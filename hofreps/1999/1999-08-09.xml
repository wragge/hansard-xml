The proposals in this bill contain the constitutional changes necessary to establish Australia as a republic. The long title of this bill will be the question put to Australian voters at a referendum later this year and 
 presently scheduled for Saturday, 6 November. The second bill considered by the committee, the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999, would become an ordinary act of parliament. This bill sets out provisions for the operation of a committee to consider public nominations for an Australian President. Together the two bills give effect to decisions taken at the 1998 Constitutional Convention held at Old Parliament House, Canberra.</para><para>The committee considered that it had three responsibilities with respect to its inquiry: firstly, to determine that the bills to the largest practical extent accurately reflected the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention; secondly, that if the bills were enacted and the referendum successful that the republican model introduced would work as intended; and, thirdly, to give the Australian people the opportunity to comment on this historic and important legislation.</para><para>The committee concluded that the legislation does accurately reflect the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. I compliment the Attorney-General and the referendum task force for producing legislation that should work in the manner intended. While there were many dissenting views both on the form of the republican model and various detailed and separate technical and legal issues, the bills represent a competent response to the chosen model. The committee agreed that these two important bills should proceed, and today's report contains 14 recommendations that the committee believes will improve the operation of the proposed laws.</para><para>In order to give the community the opportunity to comment on the legislation, public hearings were held in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Townsville. The committee inquiry was well supported by expert and non-expert witnesses alike. We were pleased that a wide range of Australians came forward to meet and talk with us. The committee agrees this inquiry was, as one witness in regional Australia observed, an example of democracy in action.</para><para>The first of our 14 recommendations addresses the long title of the bill to amend the Constitution. This was, and is, a highly charged political issue, as the words themselves will form the question to be asked at the referendum, and some believe they will have an influence on the outcome of the vote. The committee agreed that the long title of the bill should describe in concise and simple terms the essential purpose and outcome of the proposed amendments to the Constitution. The long title proposed by the committee is:</para><para>A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.</para><para>The committee believes that this proposed long title represents a substantial improvement on that of the bill currently before the parliament. While none of the committee members thinks it is perfect, for an all-party committee this proposal represents a collegiate decision reached in the spirit of consensus and compromise. In the circumstances the committee concluded that its long title was more than reasonable.</para><para>Mr Acting Speaker, I say to you there was not one dissenting voice when the final form of words of proposed recommendation No. 1 was put to the committee. Even after written dissents were taken into account, only one member of this committee has formally dissented from the agreed long title. Other recommendations of our report address variously the appointment of the President, the powers of the President, the removal of the President and other issues related to the bill.</para><para>The other recommendation on which I will briefly comment is recommendation 3, which would effectively provide that a Prime Minister who nominated for President a person other than a candidate selected by the nominations committee would be required to table a statement in writing justifying such action. The committee received a great deal of input regarding the nomination process because many people felt strongly that it was the nomination process itself which gave legitimacy to allowing the parliament to be the ultimate approver of a Prime Minister's choice of the person to be President. Accord 
 ingly, the committee felt that the nominations committee process should be given absolute legitimacy so that, while not denying the Prime Minister the opportunity to select a person not so nominated, if he and the Leader of the Opposition were unable to otherwise agree, any such decision should effectively be reported to the nation in writing.</para><para>The committee travelled across Australia taking evidence for this inquiry and on 9 July took evidence in Broome. That day was a noteworthy anniversary in Australia's constitutional history. The 9th of July this year was the 99th anniversary of a certain enactment of the British parliament—63 and 64 Victoria, chapter 12—which contains the Australian Constitution. I reflected on that British enactment at the beginning of the committee's meeting in Broome. I thought how appropriate it was that on this anniversary the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum was reviewing the bills that could lead the way for Australia to become a republic.</para><para>In the first half of the 1990s when the republic debate was beginning to achieve some national profile, I considered the issues and declared my personal position. I said that by birth, heritage and inheritance I was a republican. But I believed that our monarchical form of constitutional democracy had served Australia well and I was unconvinced that any change to this successful democratic system could be justified on grounds other than improvement to democracy itself. I also rejected the views of those who stated that a change of Australia's head of state to give effect to a republic was inevitable.</para><para>In 1996 when the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, and his wife Hillary visited Australia, the Prime Minister hosted a state luncheon in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. At the beginning of that auspicious occasion, the Prime Minister rose and proposed a toast to the President of the United States of America. We toasted and resumed our seats. Then the President of the United States rose and proposed a toast to the Queen. We toasted, but in a room of over 600 people you could literally hear the proverbial pin drop. Since that time I have listened carefully to the debate about our head of state 
 and constitutional reform. I attended day 1 of the Constitutional Convention and followed its activities avidly.</para><para> At the beginning of this inquiry I said that I was, and would remain, neutral on the question until I tabled the committee's report. I have read the written submissions and  listened carefully to the Australians who appeared before the committee to give evidence and I have considered carefully the legislation itself and its likely effect on our particular form of constitutional democracy. I hold strongly to the view that our unique model incorporating pieces of Westminster and the United States and Switzerland examples is probably the most successful of any constitutional democratic system in all of the world.</para><para>Notwithstanding that the monarchy has given us stability and non-partisan convention, I believe that any form of monarchy has for the 21st century finally outlived its usefulness. The idea that in 2000 or 2001 inherited privilege and power has any place in a democratic institution is at total variance with my belief in people based politics and equality of opportunity. I believe the model proposed by these bills is a good model and will allow us to move from a constitution based on the Crown to one based on the people in a smooth seamless transition. I applaud the Constitutional Convention for its sensible compromise outcomes. I support these bills. I will vote yes at the referendum and I will serve any public role which might assist any of the groups supporting the yes campaign.</para><para>I want to record my thanks to the committee secretariat—Claressa Surtees, Rose Verspaandonk, Hilary Manson, Anna Gadzinski and Robert Horne—for an outstanding job in a very tight time schedule under often very difficult circumstances. I would also like to thank the ever-reliable staff of our parliamentary reporting staff. To my colleagues on the committee and particularly the deputy chairman, the member for Barton, who is at the table, I say: it was a long winter of no holidays and hard work and I thank you for your cooperation, your sensibilities and for a positive outcome. I say to the executive that the 14 recommendations of this report repre 
 sent a largely unanimous outcome. I ask the executive to take serious consideration of what my committee and I believe are sensible recommendations. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>8064</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have pleasure in endorsing the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. I also thank the secretariat for their tremendous work: it really was outstanding. Opposition members are very grateful for that. In terms of the position of the chairman, I can honestly say that not one member of the committee was aware of his personal views on this issue, and that is to his credit. He approached the matter as a chairman should, with objectivity and balance, and I think that approach flowed through to the sincerity of the other members of the committee. The report is a sensible and balanced one. Overall, it gives the government's proposals, which will be put to the Australian people in November this year, a clean bill of health and, indeed, a strong endorsement.</para></talk.start><para>Regarding the most controversial issue, the long title, it is true, as the chairman of the committee said, that the desire of committee members was to have a concise and simple question. Indeed, we found that the wording proposed in the bill is misleading. It is misleading because it talks about only one aspect of the presidential nominations procedure. It says that the President will be chosen by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament. For a start, the role of the parliament is not to choose; it is only to approve two earlier steps that are a necessary precondition to that third, final check occurring.</para><para>The first step is recommendation by a nominations committee, of which more than half will be community members. A short list of nominees is put to the Prime Minister. For the first time in the selection of our head of state there will be community input in the nomination process. For the first time, any member of the community will be able to nominate someone for the position of head of state and, for the first time, there will be community involvement in the vetting of those nominations. That is a significant advance on the current situation where, 
 effectively, the Governor-General is appointed by one man, namely, the Prime Minister. That is the first precondition.</para><para>The second precondition is a joint nomination, moved by the Prime Minister but, importantly, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. This nomination procedure—if the bill is approved at the November referendum—will ensure that our head of state is not a politician but, to the contrary, is above politics, someone who is acceptable to both sides of parliament. Only after those two essential preconditions occur—the community committee nomination recommendation and the joint motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition—can the third and final step occur where the parliament has the final check on the procedure, as it were. Those elected directly and those elected by proportional representation in the Senate come together in a joint sitting, major and minor parties all reflected, and two-thirds of those representatives of the people of Australia must approve the choice. Again, that will ensure that the person put before the parliament is above politics, is an Australian that we will all be proud of, is an Australian that will unify the nation and is someone who represents Australia on the international stage with stature and is effectively one of our own.</para><para>That is the important three-step procedure in the nomination process. We actually found that to refer to only one of those steps occurring was misleading because it enabled people to erroneously and misleadingly say that the outcome of this procedure would be a politician's President. It will be anything else. It will be of the community and it will be a part of the community, as the President must be under the system that is proposed.</para><para>For that reason, we said that there were two options. One option was to avoid the misleading indication in the current question and to include the whole procedure that I have outlined. It was agreed that if we did that the question would be far too long and perhaps an impediment to people considering the issues when they vote on the question. We thought it better to have a concise and simple question. Instead of talking about the procedures, we said: what are the outcomes that we 
 are talking about? That outcome was establishing a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President. For the first time, our Australian head of state must be an Australian citizen. That is the essential outcome of the procedure that we have endorsed. It is impossible for anyone to sensibly cavil with that brief, short and concise description of what the outcome will be.</para><para>That outcome was arrived at in the spirit of consensus and compromise. At the deliberations there was not one dissenting voice and, as the chairman has pointed out, those who were not in attendance at that time have since had the opportunity to put in dissenting reports, and there has been only one dissent on that question. I know a number of people regrettably locked themselves into a corner before they had considered the report's recommendations. I would ask them to now step out of that corner, have regard to these very solid, very balanced recommendations and reassess the issue. The Australian people are entitled to have a fair and honest proposition put to them in November and we have proposed one that we think achieves that goal.</para><para>A number of other issues are canvassed in the report and other members will have the opportunity of speaking on those. One of the other more significant areas of controversy was in respect of the dismissal procedure. We have found that currently there is effectively no restriction on the Prime Minister deciding to dismiss the Governor-General. The only restriction is one of time; that is, the time it would take the Prime Minister to obtain the consent of the Queen to that process. But we note that, in this day of electronic communication, that is effectively no impediment at all; that that request for approval, and approval, could be effectively instantaneous. There is in fact under our current system no accountability for the Prime Minister dismissing the Governor-General. This bill proposes for the first time that accountability be brought into the procedure. We have recommended that the Prime Minister, as soon as practicable but certainly, as the current bill provides, within 30 days, must relate his or her decision to dismiss the President to the House of 
 Representatives, and the House of Representatives then deliberates on whether it approves or does not approve.</para><para>We note that the House is the master of its own procedures and the House could be expected to afford procedural fairness to the President who was dismissed. We also note that the political reality is that, if the Prime Minister's action in dismissing the Governor-General was disapproved of, it would effectively end the career of the Prime Minister, either by way of a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister as an individual or, if the House chose, as master of its own destiny, to move a motion of no confidence in the government of the day. That would also be available. To suggest that there is no accountability in the proposed bill is false. In fact, there is effectively no accountability in the current system and accountability will be introduced for the first time. So the committee has given approval to that process of accountability as an appropriate check in the overall system.</para><para>We have noted that the powers of the President will be the same as the Governor-General. The best advice is to that effect. So, again, any suggestion that our system of government will be changed by this bill in November is wrong. It will preserve the Westminster system that we have all come to cherish, but it will give Australians an Australian citizen as our head of state for the first time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>8065</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In accordance with usual parliamentary practice, the terms of reference of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum were narrow and specific. As a member of that committee I saw our task as twofold: first, to consider whether the provisions of the bills effectively implemented the republic model that emerged from the Constitutional Convention and, secondly, to consider whether, if the bills were passed, they would operate effectively or, to put it another way, whether there were flaws in the drafting or in the intended operation of those bills.</para></talk.start><para>It was a narrow brief and one for which I put aside personal views. In my deliberations on the committee I sought to remain as 
 objective as possible, given the specific terms of reference. There was neither the opportunity nor the ability for committee members to push alternative models for a republic.</para><para>The issue which seems to have created most interest is that of the long title. It is apparent from reading previous questions posed in previous referenda that there is some art to drafting a short and concise question which may, in fact, cover deeply complex, constitutionally difficult or even procedurally difficult proposals. Previous referenda questions have been short, concise, not cumbersome and go to the basis of the change, not to the procedures by which the change is to be effected.</para><para>The constitutional change being sought in this instance is the change from one system to another. However one looks at it, whether we describe it as a change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic or a change from a crowned head of state to an appointed head of state, it comes down to asking: what will be the fundamental difference when Australians wake up on the morning of 7 November 1999, assuming for the moment that the referendum succeeds? The fundamental change is that the Queen and the Governor-General would be replaced by an Australian President—an Australian head of state who the convention recommended be called President. That is the basic proposal.</para><para>It is hard to please everyone, for essentially seven different elements of constitutional change were put forward by various witnesses as being necessary inclusions, in their view, in the long title. Some thought the inclusion of a nominations committee was the most significant change; others thought it was the selection by the Prime Minister of a nominee. Others thought it was the approval by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament, while others thought it was the dismissal procedure. Others believed that it would be appropriate to mention the 30-day ratification by the House. I, for one, believed that the most significant matter for consideration was the powers to be given to the head of state. Appointment and dismissal are procedural matters, the process by which the head of state enters or departs the scene. At the heart 
 of it all must be the powers that the head of state holds.</para><para>Section 4 of this report deals in some detail with the issues of the powers and the views that were expressed. We were concerned to ensure that the Constitutional Convention resolution, that the powers of the President shall be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General, was adhered to. Given the weight of the expert constitutional evidence before the committee to the effect that the President would have the same powers as those which the Governor-General has at present—and that was a majority view, not an absolute view—and given the uncertainty that already exists as to whether an exercise of the reserve powers or the content of the conventions are presently justiciable, I believe that the committee's recommendations in chapter 4 show the committee has gone as far as it is able to give effect to the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention that the powers of the President should be the same as those currently exercised by the Governor-General.</para><para>Having dealt with the question of non-reserve and reserve powers and the conventions as best as we were able, I was able to support a proposed long title that the Queen and the Governor-General be replaced by a President, as inherent in that is the issue of the powers of the President. I commend the report to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>8066</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The tabling today of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum is a vital step in a long but cautious process of recognising our maturity and independence as a nation. It is part of making sure that our institutions of government actually match our strong sense of identity and our capacity as a nation to stand on our own two feet.</para></talk.start><para>It is on the record that I am a committed republican. I, like many Australians, particularly those of my generation, have always had a strong sense of pride in being Australian and in the unique freedom and strength and security that our country gives us. There was a jolt for me, however, when I became a solicitor in Victoria and again when I was 
 elected to this place, because I was twice required to swear allegiance to the Queen—a queen who, despite her personal good works, holds an office which arouses in me no sense of shared identity. I cannot automatically respect a title that she has not earned but simply inherited, and I cannot respect her wealth of immense proportions or the religiously exclusive nature of her office. Such ideas are in fundamental opposition to the Australian values of equality, openness and opportunity.</para><para>But the committee's work and recommendations were not about whether committee members were republicans, monarchists or otherwise. Our job, as other speakers have indicated, was to assess the working capacity of the bills. The committee has been able to conclude that the bills will ensure that our democratic system of great stability will continue, but with an Australian head of state who can be a symbol of our shared aspirations as a nation. A fair question must include this fundamental change. It is a change of personnel, if you like, not a change of the system itself.</para><para>On the issues of the appointment and dismissal of the President and the powers of the President, one must, to measure the proposal fairly, compare it to the total lack of process and accountability currently involved in appointing a Governor-General. The Prime Minister currently has total power to do this. The Queen does not play any role and has no independent discretion in supporting the Prime Minister's recommendations. People are largely unaware of this because the power to dismiss a Governor-General by the Prime Minister has not been exercised. The political reality and other checks within our system ensure that this is the case.  </para><para>In my view, the great strength of the proposal examined by the committee is that it is a very conservative proposal—and for a good reason. It maintains our system of government—one of the most stable and vibrant democracies in the world. All the scaremongering in the campaign to come will not detract from the fact that the experts told the committee that the powers of the President will be the same as those of the Queen and 
 the Governor-General. The bills go to great lengths to give some added protection to the position of the President and to add accountability in the process of a Prime Minister appointing a new President. Even on the question of dismissal, the checks and balances in our system come from the Westminster system of responsible government, combined with our bicameral system where the Senate is usually not controlled by the government of the day. These valuable protections remain unchanged and will ensure the stability of our democracy.</para><para>As the member for Barton has briefly touched upon, the open and participatory nomination process is a great advance on the current system of nomination. However, I would like to briefly address recommendation No. 2 of the committee, which is an important recommendation which would improve that public nomination process. Specific reference could be made to the diversity of our Australian community so that, when the Prime Minister appoints community members to a nomination committee, we make sure that those on the selection committee truly do represent the diversity of our nation. I draw attention to that important recommendation.</para><para>However, a fair question cannot refer to the nominations process unless it includes all that process. To refer to only a part, as the bills currently do and as the Prime Minister is reported as supporting, distorts that process. All or nothing might be sensible but including all the detail was regarded as far too cumbersome, confusing and difficult and therefore was decided against by the committee.</para><para>I commend the report to the House and to the Prime Minister. He might not like the recommendations, but they are fair and thorough and they give Australians a chance to make an informed choice about our future on 6 November. This is a choice about our identity and our independence. I will be urging people to vote yes. Australians do not need to be wedded for life to this particular model of the republic, but they do need to be able to respect themselves in the morning. I hope that, on the morning of 7 November, we will be able to respect ourselves and be proud to call ourselves a truly independent nation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>8068</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to endorse the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum which was presented by the chairman of the committee, the member for La Trobe. I commend him on his skill and great objectivity in chairing the committee. I also commend the secretariat of the committee who had a difficult task and did an outstanding job in a very short space of time. I commend them.</para></talk.start><para>The report represents almost the unanimous agreement of those involved in the committee. It is a reflection of the views reported to the committee at the public hearing on the analysis of the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  and the  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 . It is clear that the key questions to be resolved were, firstly, the powers of an Australian President and whether they would be equal to those of the Governor-General; secondly, the composition of the committee selected to choose the President; thirdly, the relative powers of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister in the event of one wishing to dismiss the other; fourthly, reporting to parliament on the grounds for dismissal of the President; fifthly, the subsequent impact if the Parliament does not approve the sacking; and, finally, the text of the question to be put to the Australian people in the referendum on 6 November 1999.</para><para>On the issue of the long title of the bill to be put at the referendum, I strongly support the recommendation of the committee. Surely the key question to be asked is whether the Australian nation believes that it is time to replace the Queen as head of state and her representative, the Governor-General, with an Australian head of state. It is important that the Australian public recognise what is taking place in terms of the transfer of powers of the head of state. To add that the President should be chosen by two-thirds of the parliament is superfluous, as the `bipartisan appointment of the President' model was the one chosen by the Constitutional Convention when it met in early February last year.</para><para>Obviously, there is much debate over whether the President should be popularly elected or elected by a two-thirds majority of 
 parliament. The decision has been made by the Constitutional Convention as to the preferred model. The convention decided that the direct election option would open the new republic to the situation where, in the event of a conflict between the head of state and the head of government, it would not be clear whose power would prevail.</para><para>It seems appropriate to put a simple question to the public in November asking them to decide between retaining the monarchy as the head of state or moving to a republican system of government. It is apparent from the input of the constitutional lawyers who appeared as expert witnesses before the committee that there was a division of opinion amongst them as to the legal impact of the proposed legislation. However, it would appear that in general the powers of the President would be the same as those of the Governor-General. Firstly, the checks on the choice of the President by the Prime Minister will be far greater than currently apply to the choice of Governor-General. Secondly, the recommendation for President will come from a diversely comprised committee and the Prime Minister will be required to report to the House if he decides not to accept the recommendation of the committee. Currently, the Prime Minister, with the endorsement of the cabinet, decides who to recommend to the Queen for instalment as Governor-General.</para><para>Thirdly, in the event of dismissal of the President by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister must explain within 30 days the reason for the dismissal. Currently, the Prime Minister can effectively dismiss the Governor-General without any formal mechanism to justify the action. With these main areas sorted out and, indeed, near unanimous support for all recommendations, the committee has achieved its primary objectives.</para><para>It has long been on the public record that I support this country moving towards a republican system of government. I think this country is extraordinarily fortunate to have been colonised by Britain and to have retained its main religion, language, legal system and cultural heritage. It is clear that these continue to serve the Commonwealth well. I do not see that the choice between the 
 monarchy and an Australian republic is what Henry Lawson referred to as people having to decide between `the old dead tree and the young tree green'. However, he was spot on when he said that it is a choice between `the land that belongs to the Lord and Queen and the land that belongs to you'.</para><para>As a trade commissioner in Germany, I found that people constantly asked why we had a Queen in the UK who lived 12,000 kilometres away. The importance of becoming a republic was crystallised for me during the Olympic bid—and I was also interested to hear the chairman's reasons. As part of a lobbying team, we often found ourselves in one corner of a restaurant lobbying for Sydney while, in the other corner, the daughter of the Australian head of state, Princess Anne, lobbied IOC officials for Manchester.

The Prime Minister authorised the formation of the committee, and it has taken detailed submissions both in writing and at public hearings. The purpose of the committee being formed and receiving those submissions was to listen to the opinion of the Australian people and, once hearing the evidence, to make recommendations to the parliament in the hope that the Prime Minister would in turn listen to the opinion of the Australian people and attempt to present them with an honest, unbiased referendum question on 6 November. I believe that was foremost in the minds of practically all the members of the committee. We worked hard to see whether we could come up with a question that 
 would be unbiased and which would be put to the Australian people on 6 November.</para></talk.start><para>The current long title of the legislation is both misleading and inaccurate. It was supported by all constitutional monarchists who addressed the committee at its public hearings, and it was rejected by all people who supported the republic. If you have a situation where one group supports it 100 per cent and another group rejects it, then it is obviously not a fair question—it is biased. The fact that the long title currently says `chosen by a two-thirds majority of parliament' is misleading and not a true and accurate portrayal of the appointment process. The process, as other speakers have mentioned, is that a short list be prepared by the Presidential Nominations Committee and from that the Prime Minister would choose a person to be nominated. That person would be nominated by the Prime Minister and that nomination would be seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. That is how the person would be chosen. It would then be put to the parliament and a two-thirds majority of the parliament would be needed to ratify that choice. The choice is not made by the two-thirds majority of the parliament; the choice is, in effect, made by the Prime Minister after a long period of public consultation. The proposed long title selected by the joint select committee is accurate: it does not seek to mislead people and it does not seek to give a biased view.</para><para>Other issues canvassed quite extensively and considered in detail by the committee were the appointment and dismissal process and the reserve powers of the President. The committee concluded that the proposed legislation broadly mirrored the current position, although there would be greater accountability in the appointment and dismissal process.</para><para>One issue I would like to spend a little time addressing is recommendation 14. It is quite an important issue that was brought to the attention of the committee. This recommendation identified the need to have a relevant community education campaign. Written education is not appropriate for all people. Indigenous Australians find it difficult, and are unable in a number of cases, to read 
 written information sent to them. They need to have that information disseminated to them in a meaningful way. I would like to suggest that perhaps Aboriginal medical services, land councils, ATSIC or special groups of the Australian Electoral Commission could be involved in the dissemination of that information by going out to those communities to give them that information.</para><para>The information must be in a format that is relevant to young people. It must be something that they can identify with and there must be an acknowledgment of the fact that there are a number of people in our community who have poor literacy skills. I urge the Prime Minister to accept the recommendations of the committee and to ensure that the Australian people are presented with an honest question on 6 November and that that question is the long title recommended by the committee:</para><para>A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>8070</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Without appearing to be an idealist, this report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum shows this parliament at its best. Despite an unfair schedule set by those who are perhaps half-hearted about public and parliamentary consideration of this issue, I believe we, together with the dedicated analytical staff, produced a refinement of the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. As the member for Gellibrand outlined, the 14 recommendations of this committee are quite conservative. I endorse them and I will return to them and some of the minority reports at a later time.</para></talk.start><para>As our chair, the member for La Trobe, and the member for Barton have elaborated, the committee's report on both the question to be put to the voters and the details of the operation of the minimalist republic reflects the weight of testimony given to the committee by members of the public and experts alike. The denigration of the chair and his coalition colleagues by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business says more about him than the report. All members 
 of this committee were impressed by the chair's neutrality and indeed inscrutability on the republic during the committee's hearings.</para><para>For the Australian public, only one recommendation of this committee is crucial. Do we focus, as the weight of testimony suggested, on the outcome of this referendum or do we focus on all the important but secondary mechanics? On this issue, and particularly the Prime Minister's attitude to this issue, the republic will stand or fall. It is clear that, ever since the issue was raised years ago by his archnemesis the former Prime Minister Paul Keating, the current Prime Minister wants two things from this process. First, he wants the Australian public to think he is even-handed in his approach to this issue—hence the importance of keeping his word to the Australian people on the Constitutional Convention, due consideration by our select committee and a vote where both sides have a chance to campaign evenly and where people are allowed to make a choice. Second, he wants the Queen to remain as our head of state.</para><para>The Prime Minister insists that these two ends are not mutually exclusive and that he will accept the verdict of the Australian people with equanimity whether they agree with him or not. Yet, at the first real point of conflict between John Howard `the fair broker of the republic referendum' and John Howard `no closet could hold him Queen's man', it is not difficult to see which is the real John Howard. Of course, the Prime Minister is entitled to be a constitutional monarchist. Members of this committee, however, would ask him to allow the essence of the change proposed for a republic to be considered.</para><para>The wording of this referendum question is crucial. As the government's pollsters are undoubtedly telling them, many Australians will look at the ballot paper on the day of the referendum and decide there and then how to vote. The government and this Prime Minister want the last thoughts in the minds of the people to be, `This is giving more power to politicians,' for this is exactly the effect of the wording preferred by the government. The wording they would prefer focuses on one aspect of the process of the new system—as many people here who have spoken on the 
 report have outlined—and that is the formal appointment by parliament of the new head of state.</para><para>The Joint Select Committee on the Republican Referendum on which I served suggested a formulation which focused on the essence of the change. We do not do this just because we consider ourselves better wordsmiths than the Prime Minister—the man who can meet, and has met, Les Murray at the drafting table on equal terms. We do not uncritically parrot an Australian Republican Movement formulation either, nor do we include every variation lobbied for: the nomination process, the power of the Prime Minister to dismiss and the seconding by the Leader of the Opposition in the long title. We look at the substance of the two variations. That is really the difference between the two long titles. The committee's proposed wording deals with the outcome, whereas the government's preferred wording deals with one aspect of the new process—the final aspect—for appointment of a President by a two-thirds majority of parliament. Coincidentally, if you can believe that, the aspect of the process highlighted by the government's proposal is one of the least popular aspects of the new model.</para><para>This is not a time for games. The members of the committee with whom I served put the interests of the nation above their own political imperatives. We worked together—Liberal, Labor, Democrat, National, republican and monarchist alike. We proposed a form of words to put the question to the Australian people which fairly and in a balanced way reflects the nature of the issue at hand. As the chair, the member for La Trobe, said, only one person dissented from the essence of the long title of this report.

But the fact that such issues may not appear in the headlines does not make them unimportant, because such issues often go to the very heart of what makes life convenient and bearable for average members of the community as they go about their daily lives and their daily business. It is in this context that I refer to the declining standards 
 of Telstra's 013 directory assistance services on which many Australians depend.</para><para>I initiated this private member's motion because I believe that something needs to be done about the corporate arrogance of Telstra in its management of its 013 directory assistance service. I initiated this motion because something needs to be done about the impact which this depleted service is having on ordinary citizens and on ordinary business people trying to earn a dollar. Once upon a time—perhaps in a golden age, in a quieter, more gentle time—you would dial  013 and you would actually obtain the information that you wanted from a polite operator within a reasonable period of time. If you did not have all the information that you needed, then a discussion would ensue between you and the operator until you got to the heart of the question: which street, which suburb, `It could be spelt this way' or `It could be spelt that way', and then you would finally get the number.</para><para>However, that kinder, gentler age appears to have passed because, since the Gordon Geckos took over Telstra management, we have in fact a much more rugged and rigorous pursuit of the bottom line. What you find now when you dial 013 directory assistance services is any of the following. First, you could be very lucky to get through in the first place, because the first of the, shall we say, anti-Pavlovian responses which Telstra management have engineered in their 013 directory assistance service is to effectively prevent you from getting through at all. I have noticed of late that that has improved, but for the first six months of this year and much of last year it was actually very hard to get through.</para><para>Second, when you actually get through these days, if you do not provide the operator with all the accurate information that is necessary to get the telephone number which you are searching for in the first place, you are then placed automatically onto the automatic response system of prerecorded messages which tell you, with all the emotion and warmth of Orwell's <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</inline>, `We are very sorry but the information you have provided is inadequate,' and you are 
 then cut off and left somewhere in the electronic abyss.</para><para>But what has really annoyed people the length and breadth of this country is the third device employed by Telstra management, and that is the proliferation of this plethora of audio advertisements which now pollute 013 directory assistance services as we use them today. When you dial 013 today, it is virtually impossible simply to obtain the information. Before you get it, you are confronted with any one of a number of ads, of which the common theme tends to be, `Why are you using 013? You could be using 12456 and, for just 75c plus call costs, we will put you through straightaway.'</para><para>In fact, if your blood pressure is already under some challenge, the worst thing you can do when dialling 013 is to be confronted by that ad which says, in a very soft voice, `Are you in a hurry?' Pause. `Well, if you would like to get through really quickly, what you should be doing is using 12456 and pay 75c plus call cost.' Pause. Then you hear the revving of an engine in the background. The voice continues, `And we will put you through straightaway.' If your blood pressure was sitting at 120 over 80, it has at that stage risen to 150 over 80 and a consultation with a physician needs probably to ensue.</para><para>These are just some of the ads which now pollute the service. It raises the very basic question as to why Telstra's management are doing this. Under the performance standards determined by the Australian Communications Authority, Telstra are required to provide a free directory assistance service to the consumers of Australia. The bottom line is that Telstra hate it. Telstra management hate having to provide that service free of charge. So what do they do instead? They reduce the staff employed in this service so that it becomes a much less efficient service. If you speak to Telstra staff, you often find that those staffing the directory assistance services are under enormous pressure because many of their number, hundreds of their number, have been removed from Telstra's employ.</para><para>The second strategy which Telstra management have employed is to introduce the ads to which I have just referred. The object is 
 plain: to discourage people from continuing to use the service—fewer staff, less efficient service, plus this temptation of the waving of the attraction of a 12456 75c plus call cost ad in order to get you off the 013 hook and put you onto the 75c charge service, which goes to contribute to Telstra's bottom line.</para><para>That of itself raises a further interesting point. When we speak of Telstra, we are not speaking of one of our more impoverished public corporations. If we read the 1997-98 annual report of Telstra, we find that in that year alone Telstra were able to provide a $1.8 billion dividend. I would suggest that this company are not in dire straits. I would suggest that their financial capacity to still provide a reasonable 013 directory assistance service free of charge to the community exists. They are not financially challenged. What they are doing is sailing very close to the wind. They are required by law to provide this service free of charge, yet they are trying, using every trick in the book, to wriggle out from under.</para><para>What is the impact which all this has on the community and the economy? Many of us are, shall we say, a captive market. If you are using a mobile telephone, there is no possibility at all of using the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline>. Try using the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline> while you are driving across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I would suggest if you do that you are likely to get into considerable difficulty with the constabulary. When you are seeking to obtain a telephone number from out of your city or interstate, again you are entirely dependent on 013 directory assistance services.</para><para>Going to the economic cost and not just the inconvenience, according to the Australian Communications Authority there were 443 million directory assistance calls in 1998-99. According to my watch, the time of each of the audio ads on Telstra's new 013 service is about 11 seconds, which means that each year we are now subjected to 4,873,000,000 seconds of unsolicited ads from Telstra. That is 81 million minutes or 1,350,000 hours. What is that actually costing the economy? If you were to average out that, for example, babysitters are remunerated at about $10 an hour and corporate lawyers and accountants 
 about $300 an hour, let us hit an average and just say it is $25 an hour in terms of cost to the economy. What we are looking at in one year alone is a loss to the economy of $33,750,000. Again I would suggest that a company which has got $1.8 billion in its back pocket in the last dividend which it delivered to its shareholders is not exactly stretched.</para><para>Beyond all of these arguments, it also comes down to this basic point. What Telstra are doing is irritating the hell out of consumers right across this country, both business consumers and private individuals. The number of telephone calls I have had to my office from people right across this country since first raising this issue in the Main Committee in late June has been quite surprising. This is really getting to people in a very fundamental way. Telstra said they would like to come and talk to me about it. They made an appointment for their national corporate affairs manager to come and visit me in Brisbane. Unfortunately, he cancelled. I have not heard back from him since. I gather that I have been put onto call waiting.</para><para>The community are angry about this. They want action, and that is why we have this private member's motion before us today. It is not for entertainment purposes; it is for a substantial end, and that is to attract bipartisan support—I look forward to those opposite contributing to this debate—which will enable us to put a common resolve to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts so that he can in turn provide an instruction to the Australian Communications Authority to fundamentally vary the performance standard which currently governs Telstra's 013 directory assistance services so that change can be delivered. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr ACTING SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83E</name.id><name role="metadata">RIPOLL</name><name role="display">Mr Ripoll</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>8073</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to this motion today, I recognise the contribution of my colleague the member for Griffith to this debate, but I do not agree with everything he said in every aspect of this motion. I do not agree that the government 
 should direct the ACA to amend the performance standard in relation to the 013 service, certainly not at this stage. I think there is a need for some balance in this debate. The authority does not in fact have a standard in place for the service and, while the government intends to continue to urge Telstra to improve the level of the service that is offered, it does not consider the level of service as unacceptable. On the evidence that I have seen, neither do I.</para></talk.start><para>The nature of the service has changed with the introduction of voice recorded announcements, advertisements and the like, but there is no ground in the service itself for government intervention. The government already urges Telstra and other telecommunications companies to offer directory assistance, and I think my colleague may have confused the provision of the basic 013 service with the irritants within it. I agree with him about the irritants, but I think you have got to look objectively at what the performance standard of Telstra has been.</para><para>In a recent survey by Telstra itself, it was found that 80 per cent of customers rated the 013 service as good and 90 per cent of customers expressed satisfaction with Telstra's operator assisted services on the whole over the past 18 months, so you could hardly say that the basic service was at fault. I think there are more fundamental issues here. My colleague also said that in law—and it was interesting to hear him say this because I do not think he might have researched this as thoroughly as he normally researches things—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>83T</name.id><name role="metadata">RUDD</name><name role="display">Mr Rudd</name></talker><para>—My heart wasn't in it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>—I suspect his heart was not in it because if he had scraped below the surface he may have found that his colleagues in the 1993-96 parliament did not mandate that calls should be free.

Because of the signifi 
 cance of this service to the community, possible directory assistance charges are subject to notification and disallowance under this act. This means that Telstra would be required to formally notify the minister of any proposed changes to directory assistance and what those charges might be. The minister has the power to disallow the proposed charges. The minister may also, after receiving a report, put it to the independent regulator, the ACCC. If the minister forms the opinion that charges are not in the public interest, he may reject them. The legislation—and this is the Labor Party's legislation—does not allow a proposal to be rejected without the ACCC first reporting on it, so it is not a clear-cut case of these things being stopped in law. But I think there is a much stronger case for ensuring that the 013 service be improved and, of course, that it not be charged for.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The current cost to Telstra and how it manages the service are more important aspects than just concentrating on the irritants, which my colleague has spoken about. As recently as 19 November, Telstra's Frank Blount said that cross-subsidies for funding the 000 emergency service and providing directory assistance free of charge cost the company and its shareholders $240 million a year. I think this is justified because, if you have a look at what the various services that Telstra provides bring in to Telstra, it is of the order of a billion dollars. So I do not think there is any case whatsoever for charging for these services. Obviously, the advertising on the 013 service goes some way to ameliorating this, but I think that a charge would be excessive and I agree with many of the aspects of what my colleague the member for Griffith said.</para><para>The utilisation of the service is very interesting, with 440 million users a year or 20 calls on the 013 service for each Australian. That is a fair number. But, when you take that against the billions of calls that are provided by the public—paid calls—the number of 013 services as a percentage of Telstra's overall performance is only four per cent. The ACA, in measuring Telstra's performance, found that over the last two years 57 to 73 per cent of the calls were answered within 10 seconds. 
 That part is not an irritant but it is an irritant when, as my colleague said, you get on an 013 line and you get a plethora of advertisements. However, they have said in their examination of the performance standards of Telstra that most of these calls have now been reduced to under 10 seconds in answering.</para><para>Sometimes I wonder whether in this whole thing Telstra may not have been its own worst enemy. I think too that commercial considerations have taken precedence over service in another very interesting area and that is the phone books. We are getting more and more phone books, especially in provincial areas. I suppose you cannot alter this much in the capital cities because the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide phone books are precisely that and they have beside them the <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline>. But what I find very irritating in the country—and I use my own phone book, which is 3½ centimetres thick, as an example—is that only 1.1 centimetres of that is the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline>. The Gatton phone book is 1½ centimetres thick and only half a centimetre is taken up by the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline>. The Dalby phone book is similarly a thin volume. But you can bet there are plenty of businesses in Toowoomba with advertisements in both <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline>—in both the Dalby book and the Toowoomba book.</para><para>I think that, for example, the division of the Darling Downs book into two sections like that is more to generate <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline> revenue than to make the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline> readily available to people in the region who might conceivably use those numbers. A lot of people in Warwick and Toowoomba would have business to transact in places like Dalby. They are all Darling Downs centres with similar crops and similar economic backgrounds; firms would service the Darling Downs. To divide that into two phone books would be part of the problem why people rely on an 013 service. While some would argue that it would be convenient to have the <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline> in one regional phone book, it would be preferable to have larger regions with individual <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline> and more people having access to the phone book than to have them incorporated in one copy. In this way we could reduce to a large extent un 
 necessary utilisation of the 013 service. So, broadly speaking, I agree with many aspects of my colleague's proposal but an element of balance should be taken into account when we are talking about this rather sensitive issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>8075</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is no coincidence that the decline of the Telstra 013 directory assistance service can be traced back to the introduction of the Telstra 12456 Call Connect service. The Call Connect service is similar to directory assistance. Both services assist people who do not have the number they need. Directory assistance gives you the number required, and a few things you do not require, whereas Call Connect puts the customer directly through to the number without delay.</para></talk.start><para>But this is not the important distinction between these two services. The important distinction is cost and service level. Directory assistance is a community service provided to customers by Telstra at no charge. Call Connect, however, is a value added service that Telstra charges for at a rate of 75c plus call costs. Directory assistance competes directly with the new Call Connect service and, given that Call Connect makes money for Telstra and that directory assistance costs Telstra money, it is not unreasonable to question whether Telstra would prefer that a greater number of their customers use the profit making Call Connect service.</para><para>Whilst the convenience of Call Connect will inevitably be measured against the more traditional services, directory assistance must not be degraded simply to provide Call Connect customers with a greater comparative advantage. But, unfortunately, services have been degraded, so much so that the most cynical of us might suspect that Telstra has nobbled 013 directory assistance. We may assume that Telstra, which quite naturally and quite openly supports the greater use of Call Connect, is driving people away from directory assistance to the use of the more expensive alternative.</para><para>Telstra is driving people away from directory assistance by reducing the overall service provided. By shifting resources away from directory assistance, response times to calls 
 have increased, service levels have decreased and the whole process is further delayed with intrusive advertising. Most offensive is the advertising of the 12456 service on the 013 line. Is this what we are to expect of other Telstra services in the future, particularly with the government's view that it should be completely privatised? The 013 directory assistance service is not a marketing opportunity for Telstra and should not be used as such. It is a community service and should be kept as that.</para><para>We can all do without the jingles and, if the evidence is now that more people are using the 12456 service, it is probably because they are tired of listening to advertisements that tell them how silly they are for using such a slow service on 013 when they could go to the much quicker new 12456 service. Will Telstra now be advertising on the 000 emergency number? I certainly hope not. But maybe they see it as just another marketing opportunity and a captive audience. The increase in response times for directory assistance indicates that staffing levels are not matching demand levels. The important fact here is not that directory assistance callers wait longer for an operator than Call Connect customers—although that certainly is the case—but that directory assistance customers wait longer for an operator than they did in the past, before the introduction of 12456.</para><para>The provision of an alternative service is no excuse for declining resource levels in the 013 service and is no excuse for declining service levels right across Telstra. The emphasis on getting each call over with quickly means that callers are now put through to a recorded voice when the operator cannot locate the number from the information provided. No longer is there any attempt to seek alternative information and to get the person through; you either call back or you dial 12456 as suggested in the earlier message. Yet those who pay the premium rates for Call Connect services are receiving the patient human assistance that we all once received on the 013 line.</para><para>The adverts, which are not featured on the Call Connect service, make the entire call last substantially longer than historically provided 
 by the other service. Delays through advertising and increased response times, along with decreasing service levels and human contact, increase the frustration customers feel with the old service and, henceforth, they probably should go to 12456, although I do not advocate it. Doesn't this make customers who use Call Connect see that they are getting a much better, faster and more efficient service? The creation of user-pays services such as Call Connect should not be funded or enhanced by cost cutting of other Telstra services. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>8076</page.no><name role="metadata">Barresi, Phil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRESI</name><name.id>ZJ6</name.id><electorate>Deakin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion. The member for Griffith stated in his address that in the golden old days he could be connected to the operator who was a real live human being. Of course, in the golden old days you also had an operator to connect you to your neighbour's telephone next door. The humble telephone has been with us since Federation, but today we do not need an operator to connect us or a rotary dial to finger the number or even a cord to plug into the wall. The PMG has gone, Telecom has gone and Telstra no longer has a monopoly in this country. Instead, we have greater access to phones, greater choice about telephone products and services and, not least, better connections and cheaper rates for local and long-distance calls. We still have telephone books and now we have Internet access to the <inline font-style="italic">White Pages</inline>  and <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline>  for most cities around the world. We still have 013, and it is still free.</para></talk.start><para>The use of the 12456 number is a consumer choice; it is up to the callers as to whether or not they use it. Like many who use this service, I am sometimes annoyed by Telstra's direct connect and other promotions that are often heard down the line, but maybe we should all take a powder over this issue. What have we come to that we cannot wait 10 seconds for the information we seek? A call to any other business seeking information would result in our being placed on hold for that time, and sometimes for a lot longer. If you question that, try calling Comcar to get a reservation. All businesses have dispensed with dead air time for calls on hold, so we 
 hear the radio and often commercial and even corporate promotions. Why should Telstra be any different? It provides a free directory service which fields over 440 million calls a year, and that figure is rising by around 20 million calls a year. Indeed, the vast majority of customers have expressed satisfaction. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

You might want to ask: why did that happen?

In fact, 55 of them had signed a letter to Amnesty International the week before, protesting about the conditions in the centre. Unfortunately, all of that was ignored and the rebellion resulted.

Windsor Road is the lifeline of the Hawkesbury, yet it is an absolute disgrace. Frustrated 
 commuters can spend up to 1½ hours travelling the 30 kilometres between Windsor and Parramatta. Local farmers and manufacturers lose valuable time and incur increased expense in getting their produce to the Sydney markets. In fact, many businesses refuse to establish in the Hawkesbury because of the gross inadequacy of the transport links.</para></talk.start><para>The blame for this must lie fully at the feet of the New South Wales government. It is content to increase the release of land but refuses to provide the necessary infrastructure. Four years ago, when he was opposition leader, Bob Carr promised to upgrade Windsor Road to four lanes in his first term of office, yet in those four years he has done nothing—not a thing. On behalf of the residents of the Hawkesbury, I call on Bob Carr and Carl Scully to honour their commitment to stop treating the people of Hawkesbury with contempt, to face up their responsibility and to do something about Windsor Road.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Schools: Bullying</title><page.no>8077</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>8077</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILTON</name><name.id>YK6</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to recognise the activities of both the Cranbourne West Primary School and the St Anne's Primary School in Seaford in implementing antiharassment and bullying policies.

Members of this House will know that, since the end of World War II, Third World debt has risen both exponentially and geometrically. The situation has reached a point where these countries cannot even service their interest repayments, let alone repay the principal on those loans. The 20th century will go down in the history books as one of the bloodiest and uncompromising in history. The postwar order has produced a world of haves and have-nots.

In light of the fact that many Third World countries will never be able to repay their debt, they have been reduced to a form of economic slavery. I urge the Australian government to join in this campaign and call on the creditors holding major credit liabilities against the Third World to strike off this debt from their books.

As was the case with so many of his generation, he left school at the age of 15 and began work with the South Australian Railways as a clerk at the Islington workshops. At the age of 24 he was appointed a full-time organiser for the Australian Railways Union. During World War II he served for three years, from February 1943 until his discharge in January 1946, with the Royal Australian Air Force, including postings to Darwin and Borneo. </para><para>After the war he returned to the union. He was defeated in a ballot for the South Australian state secretary's job in 1956, a loss described by him at the time as his greatest disappointment. However, the same year he was elected secretary of the South Australian Trades and Labour Council, a position he held until entering federal parliament as a senator from South Australia in 1962. He also served as a commissioner of the South Australian Board of Industry and as an executive member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions between 1956 and 1962. He was elected to the Senate in 1961. His term began in 1962, and his career lasted for 19 years until his retirement in June 1981.</para><para>In his maiden speech Reg Bishop spoke of his commitment to the old Labor principles of standing up for the workers, the problems of unemployment and the need for rail standardisation. Throughout his parliamentary career Reg Bishop took considerable interest in committee service as well as, of course, stints as a minister in the Whitlam government. He served as Minister for Repatriation for two years and as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence for two periods, but he will best be remembered as the last Postmaster-General of Australia between 1974 and 1975. It was under the ministerial stewardship of Reg Bishop that Telecom and Australia Post were first created. He also oversaw the abolition of television and radio licence fees and participated in the introduction of public broadcasting and FM radio. After leaving politics, Reg Bishop was appointed an officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia for his service to politics and government.</para><para>Can I say on a personal level that I saw a good deal of Reg Bishop during the years that we served together in this parliament. I found him on all occasions and without exception to be possessed of unfailing courtesy and decency in the dealings that I had with him. He was a man who was very true to his orthodox Labor Party beliefs. He served his country with great commitment in war. He retained a very close link with those of his colleagues in the Senate from both sides of the parliament who had served in World War II.</para><para>I well remember speaking to him briefly at the funeral of the late Senator Ken Anderson who, like Reg Bishop, was a digger returned from service in World War II. He was a man who all of us liked and respected. We may have disagreed with him on political issues, but he was possessed of unfailing basic courtesy and decency. He made a long and very praiseworthy contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to the trade union movement. I know he will be long remembered and very sadly missed by his former colleagues.</para><para>Reg lost his wife, Connie, only in 1997 after more than 60 years of marriage. He died in Adelaide on 3 July at the age of 86. On behalf of the government, I extend to his children, Romola and Phillip, and to their families the sincere sympathy and condolences of the government and the members of this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>8082</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the Prime Minister in his kind remarks about the late Reg Bishop, former senator and long-time stalwart of the Australian Labor Party.

He spent a considerable amount of his life, before he became a member of the Senate—apart from the period when he served in the RAAF in Darwin and Borneo from 1943 to 1946—as an active and senior trade unionist. He experienced bitterness in his defeat in a ballot for secretary of the railway union but immediately sought for himself an even grander recompense, if you like, by becoming Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council. He was, during that period, senior not only in the councils of the trade union movement in 
 South Australia but also in the labour movement generally at the national level.</para><para>Reg Bishop's interests were reflected immediately in the maiden speech he made when he entered the Senate in 1962. As you would expect, his maiden speech demonstrated the preoccupations that he had had over the years with the management of the economy, the life of the average Australian worker and, given his railways experience, his views about the standardisation of railway gauges. He started in parliament by honouring the contribution he had assisted in making to that point in time.</para><para>Having entered parliament, however, he broadened out his interests very considerably. During the 1960s, as well as being prominent in debates in the parliament and in the party on economic and industrial matters, he was also a most active participant in what were the dominating debates of the day—debates about foreign affairs and defence. He was a very strong participant in those debates. His contribution reflected the experience he had in World War II. He had a very deep commitment both to veterans who had served in that war and the defence of Australia. His argument in those debates, in a period of often considerable difficulty for the Australian Labor Party, lent weight and authority to the view that his political party could be trusted with government and the defence of the nation.</para><para>Those commitments were rewarded and they were reflected in the appointments he enjoyed when he was elected to the frontbench by the Labor Party after the victory of Gough Whitlam at the 1972 elections. He served as Minister for Repatriation and, for most of that period, as Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. He was a most active Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, using his position to maintain contact with his successors serving in the armed forces. He was in many ways a very human face of the government to those serving personnel when he held that office.</para><para>Probably the ministerial achievements with which Reg Bishop will be most associated in the long term came with his short appointment as the last Postmaster-General of the 
 nation and his initiatives in that portfolio. He presided over what was arguably the largest administrative reform in Australia's history when his portfolio was carved out into separate statutory authorities in the form of Telecom and Australia Post. The Postmaster-General's Department was an enormous bureaucracy, and very large bureaucracies were created in those statutory authorities. But his hands-on attitude was much reflected in an anecdote which Chris Schacht revealed in the obituary he wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>of 14 July. For those devotees of the <inline font-style="italic">Yes, Minister</inline> program it is quite a nice little anecdote. It reads:</para><para>On one occasion, the PMG's department proposed to put up public phone charges by three cents a call to 13 cents. This meant that two and one cent coins would have to be used. Reg queried what the conversion cost would be—the department officers said it would not be costly at all. He insisted on being taken to the nearest PMG workshop for a demonstration. Once there, a young technician pointed out how complex the adjustment would be. The proposal was dismissed with a curt `I thought it was a</para><para>expletive deleted—</para><para>idea—and so it is.' The Department was thereafter more wary about trying to `Yes, Minister' Reg.</para><para>Reg was a very ordinary soul but a very bright soul. He served until his retirement from the Senate in 1981 and he was able then to look back on some very strong support that he had given to two great Australian political reformers—Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan—in the context of the affairs of the South Australian branch. Reg Bishop was a very active member of the South Australian branch.</para><para>I met Reg when I was a youngster and used to come to Canberra because he was a friend of my father's, but I guess I best remember Reg in the 1980s when he ran a most constructive dining club in South Australia on a Friday afternoon. He did so for many years. If you ever wanted a decent feed of fish and some really decent Labor conversation, you could go to the dining club that Reg Bishop, among others, presided over. Mick Young always made absolutely certain that when you visited Adelaide you had the opportunity to avail yourself of the wisdom of various old 
 retired colleagues from the South Australian branch, and much wisdom there was to be had. Though those particular affairs stopped their regularity in recent times, he was always a cheerful and informative companion to spend some time with.</para><para>As the Prime Minister said, our condolences go to his son Phillip, his daughter Romola and the rest of the Bishop family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>8083</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the condolence motion for Reg Bishop. Reg was a friend of mine, he was a very good friend of my father's and of course he was a great servant of the labour movement. His credentials as a union official and representative of Australian working people stand as second to none and he devoted his life to the public service of those people. Descriptions of him have been made, but I think the humble one was by Joan Rydon in her book, <inline font-style="italic">A biographical register of the Commonwealth Parliament</inline> , where she referred to him simply as a railwayman and a union official. Reg of course was much more than that, because underneath it he was the servant of the labour movement that elected him to so many important positions, not only within the Australian Railways Union and his ability to represent through the South Australian Trades and Labor Council but also as a member of the ACTU executive from 1956 to 1962.</para></talk.start><para>Reg entered the parliament and for the period 1962 to 1981 served it and the South Australian electorate with distinction for that 19 years. His capacity in terms of representation was recognised in that he served in both Whitlam governments, first of all as Minister for Repatriation, where his service in the RAAF during World War II in both Darwin and Borneo gave him great understanding of the needs of the people whom he represented in his ministerial capacity. As Australia's last Postmaster-General he presided over significant changes, which the Leader of the Opposition has referred to. I think it is significant that Gough Whitlam referred to those achievements, in terms of Australia Post and 
 Telecom, as the largest administrative reform in Australia's history.</para><para>I want to place on record my appreciation of the service Reg gave to the country and to the labour movement. His contribution was essential to the underpinning of both the Whitlam and the Dunstan governments. He will be remembered as a tremendous servant of the movement but as a great family man as well. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending our condolences to his children, Romola and Phillip, to his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren and to the rest of the Bishop family.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I understand that it is the wish of all honourable members of the House to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places, and I invite them to do so.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members having stood in their places—</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I thank the House.</para></talk.start><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>) adjourned.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mackay, Hon.

He was educated at the Adelaide Technical High School and after completing school became a cadet engineer with the Adelaide Electric Supply Co. He served in World War II in the Royal Australian Navy and was discharged on demobilisation with the rank of acting lieutenant. After the war, he graduated in arts from the University of Adelaide and in divinity at the University of Melbourne before heading to Britain, where he enrolled at the University of Edin 
 burgh and gained his doctorate. He then returned to Australia and began a long career with the Presbyterian church. From 1954 until 1956 he was the General Secretary Australia for the World Council of Churches. In 1957 he became the first Australian born minister at Sydney's Scots Church. He was the foundation Master of Basser College at the University of New South Wales and assistant minister of the Scots Church, Melbourne, in 1979. He was also one of the first prominent churchmen in Australia to pursue an active career on television. He monitored the <inline font-style="italic">Burning Question</inline>  program on Channel 7 from 1957 until 1961 before moving to the ABC for the current affairs program <inline font-style="italic">Open Hearing</inline> .</para><para>I knew Malcolm and Ruth Mackay and their family extremely well. I remember very clearly his election to the federal parliament in 1963. I was then the campaign director for Tom Hughes in the neighbouring seat of Parkes, and Malcolm Mackay was elected to the seat of Evans in the last election when Sir Robert Menzies led the coalition. Malcolm Mackay and Tom Hughes, coincidentally, served in parliament from 1963 until 1972, when Malcolm was defeated by Allan Mulder, who was then the candidate of the Australian Labor Party. I was Malcolm's campaign director in the election of 1969 when he was successful in hanging on, albeit with a significantly reduced majority. But of course in seats like the then Evans, a majority is a majority, and one is enough. It was one of those seats that swung from one side of politics to another until it was finally abolished in the redistribution of 1977.</para><para>I spent many hours at the Mackay household in Haberfield. They were a lovely family, a very close family. He was a person of very considerable intellectual attainments. He had deep and active business interests. He remained very committed to his Presbyterian principles. He was an active member of parliamentary committees. He was a very active Minister for the Navy in the McMahon government between 1971 and 1972.</para><para>In his maiden speech he evinced a very strong concern for the young people of Australia. In that speech he spoke extensively of the need for educational resources. He 
 praised young Australians as having a zest for living and an inquiring mind. As Minister for the Navy, Malcolm Mackay was caught up in the debate at that time regarding Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War.</para><para>One of his achievements was becoming founding president of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia, and he remained an executive member of the association until his death. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1986 in recognition of his contribution to Australian life in religion, education and politics.</para><para>I think members of the House would be aware that the late Dr Mackay met his death tragically with his wife in a motor accident outside the nursing home where both of them were living in Melbourne. The partnership of over 40 years between Ruth and Malcolm ended tragically. It was not the first time that a tragic motor accident had touched that family. In 1981 their eldest child, their daughter Elspeth, was struck by a car on Melbourne's St Kilda Road. She suffered serious brain damage and died some 10 days after the accident. I remember the trauma that both Ruth and Malcolm went through at that time when I had a number of conversations on the telephone with both of them. That accident removed a delightful young woman and was a source of ongoing sadness to both of them, but the strength of their own relationship and the strength of the relationship they had with their two other children, Andrew and Margy, sustained them in the years that followed.</para><para>On behalf of the government I extend the sympathy of the government and of the House to Andrew and Margaret and to their families. I was overseas at the time of the state funeral but the then Deputy Prime Minister and member for Farrer represented me and the government at the funeral. I want to record my appreciation of Malcolm's contribution to the Liberal Party, and the appreciation of the people of the former division of Evans and of the people of Australia of his many and very distinguished careers during his long and very active life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>8085</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to join 
 the Prime Minister in expressing our condolences to the Mackay family and placing on record our appreciation of the service to the nation of Malcolm Mackay. He was born in Adelaide in 1919. He died last month in Melbourne, in the tragic circumstances described by the Prime Minister, at the age of 79, with his wife Ruth. He was educated at Adelaide Technical High School and then at Adelaide and Melbourne universities before taking a doctorate in Edinburgh. That began an extensive and interesting life for him in the areas of academia, religion, broadcasting, business, politics and various forms of social organisation.</para></talk.start><para>I think it could be legitimately said of him that he was very much a figure of the late 1950s and 1960s whom you would describe in those times as a controversialist—a person who put forward with great clarity his arguments for the conservative side of politics. He applied to that some considerable element of his intellectual rigour that was a product of his training and, of course, his own intelligence. His commitments in the areas of defence came, to some degree at least, from his experiences, as so many of that generation had, in the Australian Navy in New Guinea from 1941 to 1944. He was, after a period of time as a member of parliament and service on various parliamentary committees, appointed Minister for the Navy. The navy ministry was positively the worst job to have in the Liberal governments of the 1960s. His tenure of that portfolio, as it was with most of his predecessors of course, was marked by a degree of controversy. He was able to argue his case forcefully because of the factors in his background that I alluded to.</para><para>Malcolm Mackay's political career came to an end with the election of Gough Whitlam's government. He spent a considerable amount of time after that overseas. He remarked to friends at the time that he was deeply disappointed with the political outcome in 1972 and he did not return to Australia, I understand, on any consistent basis until about 1981. His post-parliamentary career included founding the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia and being the 
 chairman of Longreach Oil and several other resource companies.</para><para>From the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, I think Labor parliamentarians got to know him a great deal better after his political career than before. He was identified during the time of his political career as a substantially partisan figure whom it was not necessarily easy to have a chat with, but after his time in parliament and his return to become a member of the association he was a most convivial figure and gained the affection of a large number of his former parliamentary colleagues on all sides of the parliament. My father tells me he got to know him very well in that period and wants his condolences extended to the Mackay family, as indeed we all do from the opposition.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I understand that it is the wish of all honourable members of the House to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places, and I invite them to do so.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members having stood in their places—</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I thank the House.</para></talk.start><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>) adjourned.</para></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Newman, Hon.

I have also had the 
 immense privilege of serving with Jocelyn, his widow and partner in a very close and loving marriage over a long period of time, during her very distinguished ministerial career to date.</para><para>Kevin Newman was born in October 1933 in Sydney. He was educated at Scots College where he excelled, gaining entry to the Royal Military College Duntroon in 1952. He was spoken of very affectionately by the National President of the RSL, Major General Peter Phillips, who was a cadet with the late Kevin Newman at the Royal Military College. At the state funeral held for Kevin—which so many members of the House attended—Major General Phillips recalled how seriously Kevin, he and other members of that class took the commission given to them on their graduation day by the then Governor-General of Australia, Field Marshal Sir William Slim.</para><para>Kevin Newman had a very distinguished military career. He served in Malaya in 1956 and 1957. He was promoted to operations officer of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment serving in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. He later served as an exchange instructor with the British Army's School of Infantry, then as commanding officer of the 5th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and commander of the 6th Military District Tasmania.</para><para>In the early to mid-seventies, Kevin Newman decided to embark upon a political career. As I said in my tribute at his funeral, I first met Kevin Newman on the streets of Launceston. Many of us who occupied the opposition benches in Canberra in the months following the 1974 election that saw the return of the Whitlam government participated in the now famous Bass by-election of 1975—and I hope that, in the spirit of these things, my references to the Bass by-election and the importance and magnitude of that politically at the time will not be taken by any of my colleagues opposite as in any way intruding a political note into a condolence motion. I think it is important that the contribution to and the role of a deceased member in the psyche and collective memory of that person's own party be part of the tribute that 
 is paid to that member on occasions such as this.</para><para>That particular by-election, like a number of other by-elections in Australia since World War II, cast a very long shadow. Kevin secured a swing of 17½ per cent, which I believe is the largest primary swing ever to displace a member of a government party in a by-election. I think one or two swings in a general election may have exceeded that, but I think it is probably the greatest swing in a by-election. It was a very important victory and, at that time, Kevin became the only Liberal representative from the state of Tasmania in the federal parliament—Tasmania having returned five Labor members at the 1974 election.</para><para>Kevin Newman represented the seat of Bass for nine years and retired undefeated before the election of 1984. He had a fairly rapid promotion. Within 100 days of making his maiden speech he was appointed as a minister in the Fraser government—although I do know of people who have been appointed ministers in governments more rapidly and I can see one or two over there who remember the experience. Kevin Newman held a number of ministries in the Fraser government. He was an extremely energetic and effective minister. He was Minister for National Development during the time of intense debate regarding policies relating to the pricing of crude oil when import parity pricing was a very significant political debate in this country.</para><para>Kevin retained his keen interest in defence matters and was Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. During his time as Minister for Administrative Services he was very heavily involved in the establishment of the National Crime Authority which, over the years, has become a very effective agency for fighting organised crime in this country. As the minister responsible for the environment, he was involved in the establishment of the Australian Heritage Commission and the banning of sandmining on Fraser Island.</para><para>Also, in relation to his responsibilities for federal affairs when assisting Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, he had particular responsibilities in relation to giving more effect to 
 federal arrangements. After he left parliament, Kevin retained a great deal of interest in public affairs. He was chairman of the governing council of Old Parliament House. He was a member of the Stockman's Hall of Fame board, Chairman of the Australian Council of National Trusts and President of the National Trust of Tasmania from 1988 to 1991.</para><para>Any of us who observed them would have been instantly struck by the close and loving relationship of Kevin and Jocelyn Newman. It was a marriage that endured for more than 40 years. Their children and the character of their own lives were a remarkable testament to the closeness of their parents' marriage and relationship and to the character of their upbringing. It is worth recalling, as I did on another occasion, some words from Kevin in the book <inline font-style="italic">Partners</inline>, in which he said:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">. . . over recent years we have each had to look a doctor in the eye while we were told that we were not immortal. That can be pretty hard to come to terms with but it can also be enormously positive. The heightened appreciation of life, love, family and friends you subsequently experience. We think fortune has smiled on us. When we married it was for love but we all know that choosing a mate for life can be a pig in a poke. For us a long marriage that worked. We have been blessed with great children and grandchildren. We have both had important and influential careers but best of all we are still best mates.</inline></para><para>I do not think there are any amongst us who would want to say much more than that of a lifelong relationship.</para><para>Kevin died on 17 July 1999 at the age of 64 after a long battle with the affliction lupus, which gave him great discomfort and claimed his life while Jocelyn was overseas. Sadly, she was not able to get home in time to see him before he passed away. On behalf of the government and all her colleagues, I particularly extend my love and my condolences to Jocelyn, who is a great friend, colleague and servant of the government and a person whose relationship with her late husband was an example to all of us. I send our love to her, to their children, Campbell and Kate, and I record the sincere sympathy of all Kevin's former friends and colleagues and of all of their many admirers on both sides of the House. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>8088</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join the Prime Minister in those remarks on the life of Kevin Newman. At the outset, I join him in extending, on behalf of the opposition, our condolences to Senator Jocelyn Newman and members of the Newman family. I extend those condolences too to the frontbenchers and backbenchers of the government, who will feel this loss deeply because it has occurred to one of their members during the time they are in service with her. The Prime Minister's statement about the affectionate regard in which the Newman family held each other was something which we, on this side of the House, could observe in their many public appearances over the long years of their public life and role. It was something that was readily observable outside the immediate circle of their friends and political associates.</para></talk.start><para>Kevin Newman was born in Sydney in 1933 and he died in Canberra last month. He was 65. I take this opportunity to acknowledge a debt in this condolence to an affectionate and informative obituary from the former Deputy Prime Minister and current modest middlebencher who revealed things about Kevin's life, particularly in his military career, about which none of us were aware—including the extraordinary irony of him having battled, if you like, a bit of conservatism in the military bureaucracy at the time by inviting Gough Whitlam down to address his officers and men when he was attached to a unit serving in Sydney.</para><para>He graduated from the Royal Military College at Duntroon and, as Major General Peter Phillips indicated, that provided the occasion of his first entry into parliament. According to Major-General Phillips, history will show that Kevin entered parliament in 1975, but his classmates will recall a more ignominious entry in 1955 when, having been kidnapped by three Duntroon mates, he was dumped in Kings Hall on a midwinter night dressed in inelegant Army issue pyjamas and wrapped in a sleeping bag. No doubt he took that in extremely good part, as he did subsequently the experience of hard living that that no doubt first introduced him to—a hardiness 
 that he subsequently displayed in his tour of duty in Vietnam.</para><para>It is not going to be beholden to many of us to experience two substantial public careers—it was for Kevin Newman: firstly, a substantial military career and, secondly, a career in politics. The Prime Minister has already alluded to the fact that Kevin Newman had the sort of political career of which people can only dream—only 100 days spent on the back bench before being Minister for Repatriation from 1975 to 1976, Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development from 1976 to 1977, Minister for National Development from 1997 to 1979, Minister for Productivity and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs from 1979 to 1980, Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence from 1980 to 1982 and Minister for Administrative Services from 1980 to 1983. He maintained his strong interest in the defence forces throughout his portfolio services. He was also, as minister for the environment, widely credited with saving Fraser Island from sandmining.</para><para>He retired from politics in 1984, and it was almost as though he passed a baton over when he did so to his wife, who from that point on had a very extensive political career in which he was most obvious through his vigorous support. He was frequently seen by all of us here in Canberra on those many parliamentary occasions when we have an opportunity to reflect on affairs with our families. He was always a cheerful presence at those occasions. I end where I began by extending the opposition's most sincere condolences to Senator Jocelyn Newman and her family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>8088</page.no><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name><name.id>4K4</name.id><electorate>Gwydir</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to add my condolences and those of my party to those expressed by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the sudden death of a great Australian in Kevin Newman. As a soldier, politician and a family man, he exhibited all the characteristics that we in this country see as the marks of those who are great Australians and, in his case, a good bloke. He served his country as a soldier, and a commander of men, with distinction in Malaya and Vietnam. He has been described 
 as a soldiers' soldier—comfortable with all ranks and always with the interests of his troops at heart.</para></talk.start><para>As has been alluded to, he gained instant and enduring fame as a politician as the man who celebrated that famous Bass by-election victory in 1975. That became the beginning of another distinguished career as Minister for Repatriation, Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development, Minister for National Development, Minister for Productivity and Minister for Administrative Services. It is a long list and a list distinguished by the activity and enthusiasm which Kevin brought to each of these tasks.</para><para>Just as he did in the Army, Kevin had the capacity to surprise with his ability to think outside the square. There is no better example of this than his efforts to bring about an end to sandmining on Fraser Island in Queensland. It was a controversial decision and one that flew in the face of the wisdom of the conservative thinking on environmental issues.</para><para>Kevin's work in his career after politics had that same stamp on it. As Chairman of the Council of Old Parliament House, he worked tirelessly and with great dedication to bring the Parliament House project to fruition as a valuable national cultural institution and a fitting repository of our political history.</para><para>On behalf of the people of rural and regional Australia I express gratitude for the sterling work that Kevin did from 1985 on as a director of the Stockman's Hall of Fame to bring that project to fruition. I was in Longreach just last week and was struck once again by the place that the value town and community now has in the minds of so many Australians as the very symbol of the outback. The Hall of Fame has been integral to that recognition. It has also been pivotal in a change that has happened there in terms of the economic basis of that community and others. I was told on good authority there by local people last week that last year the value of agricultural production in the shire was some $23 million and that the value of tourism was some $48 million.

First of all, I want to thank His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady Deane for the quite magnificent way in which they expressed the feelings of all of the Australian people on our behalf at the memorial service at Interlaken in a most moving and enduring fashion. I also want to record my thanks to my colleague Senator Herron and his wife Jan, both of whom were in Geneva at the time the tragedy struck. They immediately went to Interlaken to provide comfort and help to those who had survived and also to extend first-hand on behalf of the government the expressions of gratitude we felt towards the Swiss authorities for what they had done. Both Senator and Mrs Herron attended the memorial service with the Governor-General and his wife on 
 Thursday, 5 August. It was appropriate that this morning at St Christopher's Cathedral in Manuka a memorial service was held for those who perished in this terrible tragedy.</para><para>It is always particularly wrenching, traumatic, tragic and hard to fathom when young people are suddenly removed, and when 14 of our own young go in one accident it has quite a collective impact on the nation. You are not possessed of the words to adequately convey feeling, except to say that it is one of those tragedies that stop an entire nation for a moment, cause all of us to reflect upon our vulnerability and cause all of us to reflect upon how ill fortune can strike any or some of us or many of us, no matter what our circumstances are.</para><para>There is something you associate with young Australians overseas, and that is adventure—a desire to enjoy themselves, to extend their physical capacity to the very limit, and to try things sometimes beyond the bounds of prudence and wisdom, but always with an open-hearted sense of adventure, a sense of vigour and a desire to test one's physical prowess. These young men and women certainly represented that part of our national psyche.</para><para>Of the many things that were said by those close to them, a number of people made the observation that they were doing what they wanted to do. That they should be struck down in this awful way through a freak change of weather adds of course to the terrible sadness and loss felt by their loved ones and their families and reminds us all of the vulnerability of life.</para><para>It was a terrible tragedy. One expresses love, sympathy and support to the families. The young people represented the hope of that generation of Australians. There are others who represent that hope as well, but they symbolised a spirit of adventure which is forever Australian and very much part of our character and part of our national life. We mourn their death. We send our support and condolences to their families and to their loved ones, and we remark our deep sadness at their death.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>8090</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the Prime 
 Minister's motion. We record here today the loss of 14 young Australians at Interlaken, Switzerland on Tuesday, 27 July. Many thousands of young Australian lives have been lost in Europe in the past, but this was not a time or a place of war; this was a time of peace. It is the experience of many Australian families that their young folk enjoy themselves in exactly the same way as these 14 were enjoying themselves when they were tragically struck down. It is all the more tragic for the death of young Australians disproportionately among all others. There were 21 killed in this terrible accident, 14 of them Australians. It was rendered tragic too because of the keen sense of adventure that they had. We have all become familiar now with the short biographies of those young folk. They were joyful, fit, cheerful, looking forward to an opportunity to create families, enjoying the families that they had and looking forward to an opportunity to build substantial lives—and all that opportunity has been destroyed, struck down by this terrible accident.</para></talk.start><para>I would like very briefly to read into the parliamentary record the names of the persons who suffered tragic death. They were Toby Drake, Bill Peel, James Cane, Bradley Dewar, Warwick Tout, Giuseppe Losinno, Kylie Morrow, John Flynn, Michael Fulton, Dean Leslie Andrewartha, Scott Redmond and his wife Alisa, Glyn Harries, who was a British national but from my home town of Perth, and Briana Smith. One in particular has been singled out for comment by the media, and that is John Flynn, who was a RAAF officer and who was very prominent in the recent rescue of yachtsmen during the disasters associated with the last Sydney to Hobart yacht race. He saved many but was taken himself.</para><para>Thousands of Australian families every year farewell their children to this part of Europe and elsewhere. They do so in confident anticipation that they will return and that as they go they will have a tremendous time. It is that anticipation which adds the poignancy to this appalling tragedy. The fact is that people who went there could not have expected even remotely, in their anticipation of their 
 time in Europe, the events which ultimately struck them down.</para><para>I join with the Prime Minister in expressing our appreciation to the Swiss authorities: the Swiss investigative authorities, the Swiss counselling authorities and the Swiss rescuing authorities. They acted with extraordinary alacrity and very great diligence and made life a bit easier thereby for the Australian families who have suffered an awful tragedy. I also join the Prime Minister in expressing our thanks to the Governor-General and Lady Deane and also to Senator Herron for representing us at those very touching and moving services that we saw on our television sets last week in which the families of the youngsters farewelled their loved ones. This is a terribly sad occasion for members of this parliament and for our nation, and it is important that in this great forum of the nation we record our condolences to their families here.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>8091</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Republic: Referendum Question</title><page.no>8091</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8091</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

I am sure that all members of this parliament have been touched on occasions by the selfless dedication of people who care for relatives and close friends who have profound disabilities. Of all of the constituency cases that I have dealt with, none has been quite so moving and touching and traumatic to discuss as the examples of ageing relatives caring for profoundly disabled adult children, desperately in need of some kind of respite and other assistance.</para></talk.start><para>I was therefore pleased when Senator Newman was able to announce on 4 August that the Commonwealth government would provide $150 million more for unmet need for disability services over the final two years of the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. I might say that this money is being made available at a time when, for very proper budgetary considerations, funds sought in some other areas of a lesser priority are not being made available, and that reflects the very high priority the government places on this particular issue. The money will be used to purchase vital in-home and respite care services for people with disabilities who have ageing carers. By assisting one of the most vulnerable types of family in this way, the 
 government is demonstrating its commitment to keeping families together.</para><para>The House will know that the states and territories have long had primary responsibility for providing accommodation and related support services, so I want to make it clear that our commitment in this area is conditional on the states also undertaking their share of the responsibility. I want to make it very clear that this money must not be used in any way by the states to withdraw, diminish or roll back their own commitment in this area. We do not want to see any cost shifting in relation to disability services. We want the states that will soon, under the GST arrangements, be the recipients of growing revenues from the goods and services tax to shoulder their share of the burden, to do their bit, to play their part and not hide behind the excuse of blaming the Commonwealth, which is the stock state response in so many of these areas.</para><para>This measure builds on a series of coalition initiatives to help those caring for a severely disabled or disadvantaged relative or loved one. For example, we provided $15.4 million to help ageing carers to look after adult children with disabilities in last year's Staying At Home package. During the last election campaign we committed $20 million to extend respite support for carers of young people with a disability and $80 million for respite support for carers of people with dementia. Many of these carers are older people themselves and both measures were confirmed in the last budget.</para><para>Despite the need to keep the budget healthily in surplus, which is one of the great economic achievements of this government, may I say that we have, through our 3¼ years in government, retained an unwavering commitment to the social security safety net. We have also found resources to help those in the community who genuinely need help. Ageing parents looking after disabled adult children represent one of the greatest areas of need, of government compassion and of human understanding in our society and I am proud to lead a government that is going to play its part in meeting that need. I thank the member for 
 Dunkley and other colleagues for their unceasing interest in this very important issue.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Defence: Administration</title><page.no>8092</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8092</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Defence.

That is good news for Australians because it is good news on job opportunities for all Australians. The recently released Morgan and Banks job index said, `Record-breaking job market predicted for Australia.' In June, while the House was up, the labour force figures showed an increase in employment in that month of 62,400 jobs, taking the unemployment rate to 7.2 per cent, the lowest in a decade coming off the Labor Party's record of 11.2 per cent—some four per cent greater.

And there he was, down there at the backbench seminar where all of the ideas were being raised and dumped, and nobody remembered to tell the Leader of the Opposition. This is no excuse for a policy.

Improving the literacy and numeracy levels of young Australians is probably the single most important thing you could do to assist educationally disadvantaged young people in this country.

Tasmania conducted its assessments last month; Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia are conducting their assessments this month; Western Australia and the Northern Territory will conduct their assessments later this month; and the Australian Capital Territory will conclude its assessments in September.</para><para>For the first time, schoolchildren in Australia are being assessed as to whether or not they have the literacy levels they need to continue successfully with their education.

Indeed, the president of the Western Australian teachers 
 union, Mr Brian Lindberg, has called on parents to withdraw their children from the tests. This is an outrage, and it is up to the Labor Party to tell its followers—the unions who support it and the union officials who are so well represented in its ranks—that parents in Australia will not put up with this constant obstruction which undermines the standards of education of their children.

All Australians who are interested in participating in the float have been invited to pre-register by next Monday, 16 August. By pre-registering, prospective investors can be guaranteed the right to purchase 400 shares in Telstra. They may wish to purchase more than 400 shares or they may wish to purchase fewer than 400 shares but, by pre-registering, they can guarantee themselves at least this amount. They do not have to make any financial commitment by virtue of pre-registration. Further, existing Telstra shareholders are not required to pre-register.</para></talk.start><para>One of the objectives of the Telstra 2 share offer is to further increase the number of Australians owning shares. To achieve that goal, the government is most interested in ensuring that the Telstra 2 share offer is accessible to as many Australians as possible. Already, more than 40 per cent of our adult population invest in the stock market, and the Telstra 2 offer has the potential to increase that figure. We have taken a number of steps to ensure that the Telstra 2 share offer is available to all Australians who want to purchase shares. Firstly, some 9.6 million letters have been written to all those who are currently Telstra fixed line customers, to those who pre-registered for the first Telstra offer and did not purchase shares, and to all of the brokers' clients.</para><para>In addition, anyone who wishes to pre-register can do so by using the freecall number 1800 181818, or they may pre-register on the T2 Internet site that is available to anyone who wants to obtain it. In addition to that, we intend with T2 to appoint a regional broker. That will ensure that there is further access for people living outside our capital cities. It is not just about people in the capital cities getting access to the shares, but about all who want them getting access.</para><para>Australians without a good command of the English language will also be catered for. The information will be available in a number of languages, including Chinese, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and Arabic. Other languages will be available through a translation and information service, again on a free call. The vision impaired will be able to get access to the information. Braille versions of the pre-registration letter have been sent to many Australians, and large print versions of the acknowledgment letter will be sent to those who seek that alternative format. What this demonstrates of course is that the government is keen to ensure that all those who seek to acquire shares in the Telstra 2 offer are given that opportunity in an affordable and accessible way. I encourage all to look at those opportunities and make their decisions.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force: Low Income Families</title><page.no>8096</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8096</page.no><name role="metadata">Martin, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN</name><name.id>8I4</name.id><electorate>Cunningham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Defence.

The government recently announced the third round of Work for the Dole projects, involving some 20,000 places and assistance of some $32 million to community organisations around Australia. I am pleased to note that there were six projects in the electorate of Moreton. Work for the Dole is one of the signature policies and one of the significant successes of the Howard government, but it has been introduced and implemented in the teeth of blanket condemnation from the Australian Labor Party. The 
 Leader of the Opposition has described Work for the Dole as `hopeless', as `mickey mouse' and as a `disgracefully shoddy piece of public policy'. The member for Batman has described Work for the Dole as evil. It was not just bad, Mr Speaker; he said it was evil.

There is a very simple test of the Labor Party's sincerity on all of this. Will the ALP tell their union mates to stop sabotaging Work for the Dole projects? In particular, will the Leader of the Opposition tell the members of the Miscellaneous Workers Union—his own union—to lift their veto on Work for the Dole projects in child-care centres?

That has been well noted by the government and I think well noted by the rest of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The answer to the honourable member's question is that the Supreme Military Court of Yugoslavia confirmed the convictions of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace on 22 July, but 
 it did apply some reduction in the sentences. A formal decision has had to be served on the men, and that has had to await the translation of the decision into English. I can inform the House that that formal decision was served on Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace on Saturday, 7 August. Their lawyers are expected to lodge clemency petitions with President Milosevic today, 9 August.</para><para>The Australian government has been very active and continues to be very active at this stage in trying to get President Milosevic to grant clemency to those two innocent Australians. On 3 August, I wrote to the foreign minister of Yugoslavia, Mr Jovanovic, asking him to support the clemency petitions. The government has sought further support from key figures around the international community. A little over a week ago the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, again wrote a letter to the Yugoslav government urging President Milosevic to grant clemency. Contact has been made with a large number of governments urging them to follow up with appeals for clemency, and they are doing that.</para><para>To give some examples, the Greek government has been particularly helpful, and I thank my counterpart there, George Papandreou. Nelson Mandela has agreed to telephone President Milosevic again, once more seeking clemency. Figures in the United Nations system such as Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Mrs Ogata, the High Commissioner for Refugees, are doing what they can to try to encourage President Milosevic to grant clemency.</para><para>Everybody knows this is an extremely difficult task. President Milosevic, for his own domestic political reasons, has so far not released Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. We watch the domestic political environment in Yugoslavia particularly closely, bearing in mind the fact that these two innocent Australians are still incarcerated in that country. We will do everything within our power to encourage President Milosevic to grant clemency. Of course, at the end of the day we cannot force him to, but we have the weight of the international community behind us. I think 
 what somebody said to me the other day is a fair comment, that the international coalition we have put together to get Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace out of prison is probably the most widespread international coalition Australia has ever put together for any issue.

The Australian government and the government of the United States have worked very closely on this issue. To the best of my recollection—and I am pretty sure my recollection here is right—at no stage has it been official US government policy to push for a peacekeeping force in East Timor. Indeed, there has been extensive inter-agency consultation between officials within the United States administration on this issue. Every single person in the United States administra 
 tion may have had a slightly different view at any particular time but, at the end of the day, the Australian government has to operate, when dealing with the United States, on the basis of official United States policy. At no stage, to the best of my recollection, has official United States policy been to advocate a peacekeeping force and Australia to stand in the way.</para></talk.start><para>If I can take a moment longer, the question is based on a discussion that Dr Calvert had with Mr Roth I think in Washington some time in February when Mr Roth was not professing to speak on behalf of United States policy but expressed a personal view—which I can assure honourable members was never the view of the United States administration. Dr Calvert made it perfectly clear at that time that to rush into proposing a peacekeeping force would obviously be resisted by the Indonesian government. This is the point here. Only a child would continue to argue that we should have a peacekeeping force in East Timor at this time when the Indonesian government do not want it. You cannot do it if they do not want it, and they have made it clear all along that they do not want it.</para><para>So way back in February when Dr Calvert was explaining this to Mr Roth, there is no doubt that Mr Roth and the American administration were grateful for the assistance that Dr Calvert provided, for the insight that Australia was able to provide on the issue, and for our continuing with a very successful leadership role that we have played on the East Timor issue—a role, let me hasten to remind the House, that the Labor Party for 13 years refused to play.

It is probably relevant to point out at the beginning that the great advantage in further liberalising access to our airports lies in the area of tourism. It has been a rapidly growing industry and it means a lot to many areas of Australia. A huge number of Australian jobs depend upon it. All the experts tell us that, with the right approaches, we can rapidly increase tourism as an economic activity and as a provider of jobs in this country, including in rural and regional Australia where I believe that we have a backyard, as we often see it—the outback—which is a ready-made product and only needs more effective access arrangements to be made in the future to see it expand.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that competition brings down costs and enables more options to be developed for incoming tourists. That is something the government has sought to respect in its consideration and action in relation to the Productivity Commission inquiry into our air access arrangements. I think that the recent announcement by the government, which essentially opens access to Australian airports in an extremely liberal way, with the exception of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, is a good thing. Freight has now been completely liberalised. This opens up all sorts of opportunities, particularly for international airports and for those airports that can handle international traffic in rural and regional areas to really go for broke. In the case of the four airports that I mentioned, it is important that we do not completely liberalise but that we use access to them as leverage to be able to gain leverage into other markets for our own airlines. The first cab off the rank was Dubai, which has now accessed considerably more liberal arrangements in time for the Olympic Games. It would be remiss of me if I did not finally point out that we have done this without destroying the cabotage arrangements out of respect for the needs of rural and regional communities and their need for air services.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor: Peacekeeping</title><page.no>8100</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8100</page.no><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRERETON</name><name.id>5T4</name.id><electorate>Kingsford-Smith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is again to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and relates to his department's further denial on 2 August of any substantive difference on East Timor in all official discussions, including those involving our own defence department, with all levels of the US administration over the past five months.

 peace enforcement exercise in East Timor, but I will say more: there was a headline in a newspaper saying something to the effect—I do not have the headline with me—that Australia would not back the marines in going into East Timor. I never heard of a plan of the Americans to send the marines into East Timor.</para><para>Anybody who understands United States policy making processes knows that to send in any kind of peacekeeping force, let alone a so-called peace enforcement force, would involve congressional consultation, and would involve a very substantial policy decision by the United States administration, following a decision by the United Nations itself that it wanted to send in some sort of peace enforcement force. The United Nations has not made that decision and the United States has not made a decision to support a peace enforcement exercise. If there were to be a security force in East Timor in phase 3—and honourable members will, I think, by now be aware of what phase 3 is about in the East Timor process—we would obviously ourselves be happy to participate in that, if so invited. Obviously we would be and obviously we would very much welcome United States participation but, frankly, whether the United States would participate or not in that exercise I really at this stage do not know.

Indigenous Australians have also seen their culture substantially destroyed, children forcibly removed from parents through at least three, if not four, generations of indigenous Australians and so-called communities artificially created in areas distant from traditional areas, services and regional foci of economic activity.</para><para>Why then should we have an indigenous employment initiative? When I had the privilege of meeting with the Minister for Employment, Education, Workplace Relations and Small Business in Melbourne with approximately 50 chief executives of some of Australia's largest companies, the CEO of Anglicare said to the assembled meeting in a light-hearted manner: `At some point all of you might need our services, that is, nursing home care, in particular.' I made the point to the meeting in response to his comment that, were it to be a meeting of indigenous Australians, only one in three would live long enough to even be likely to be in need of aged care services, let alone be receiving them.</para><para>The reason why there needs to be an indigenous employment initiative, as I reminded that meeting and as I remind this House today, is that indigenous Australians born today still have less than a one in three chance of living to the age of 65. If Mrs Hanson and her acolytes are listening to this, I challenge them to go to these places where Aboriginal people live and ask themselves if they would like to change places with them. Aboriginal people today enjoy, if you could describe it as that, life expectancies 15 to 20 years less than will be enjoyed by non-indigenous Australians. That is the same as countries like Haiti, Ghana, India and Papua New Guinea, countries to which we send substantial amounts of aid.</para><para>We live in a country where we define ourselves through our work. If you do not have a job in Australia you feel that you are of less value to your family and to society than someone who does. Yet indigenous 
 Australians live in an environment in many cases that I would describe as existential despair. Added to that are the problems associated with not having a job. What this country needs, and desperately so, is a deficit reduction strategy on Aboriginal death, intolerance and prejudice. Whatever else we achieve as a nation, if we make no progress in these areas we will have achieved nothing.</para><para>In 1996 indigenous Australians had an unemployment rate of 23 per cent. If you remove from those figures the Community Development Employment Program and the Work for the Dole program, which 34,000 indigenous Australians work under, the unemployment rate would be closer to 40 per cent. Twenty-eight per cent of indigenous employment is directly in the public sector, compared with 18 per cent for the rest of the work force. One-quarter of those Aboriginal people who work work as labourers and unskilled workers compared with 10 per cent of the rest of the population.</para><para>Labour market growth is concentrated in the private sector, and it is here where jobs for indigenous people need to be created. I went to one far northern New South Wales town with a population of approximately 12,000 people and not one indigenous Australian was employed in a business in the private sector. Any of those indigenous people who were employed in this town were employed in some kind of government or government related agency. That is an indictment of all of us, not just the business people of this community.</para><para>The government and, in particular, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, are to be congratulated for the first substantial instalment in addressing this untenable situation. The minister—along with the Minister for Employment Services, the member for Herbert, some of my colleagues and I—quietly visited remote and regional indigenous communities. We also met with some of Australia's largest employer organisations. I saw the minister listening, looking and asking, as well as feeling the tension in some of the things put to us. He then developed a policy package 
 with his department and indigenous representatives. </para><para>The policy has three main elements and represents $115 million as a first instalment on a comprehensive employment strategy for indigenous people. It has three essential strands. The first is an Indigenous Employment Program which involves a new program to replace the Indigenous Training Program, otherwise known as TAP. It effectively doubles indigenous specific program funding from $25 million to $50 million.</para><para>The second strand of the employment initiative is an indigenous small business fund. I am reminded of the recent remarks by Mr Noel Pearson—a prominent and, in my view, a highly respected indigenous leader—who described the parasitic effect of welfare on indigenous Australians. This speech is probably not the place to say it, but I would say that in the end it is welfare that is killing indigenous people.</para><para>This initiative involves a fund to improve access to business preparation and support. Some $6 million is set aside from the Regional Assistance Program and the Office of Small Business over three years and also another $5 million is to be contributed to ATSIC. In other words, it is trying to assist indigenous people by giving them access to things that many of us take for granted such as the opportunity to establish and develop a small business if you are so inclined.</para><para>The third part of the strategy is enhancements to the Job Network. These new measures are specific to indigenous job seekers. Job Network for indigenous people will involve smaller catchments. It will also establish indigenous employment specialists—people who specifically find jobs for indigenous people—and will require more providers to include indigenous servicing strategies. The program also includes wage assistance of up to $4,000 for an employer for 26 weeks of full-time employment and eligibility cards are now being issued to indigenous people.</para><para>It also includes a bonus of $2,000 for each CDEP participant who is placed in a full-time job. Chief executives of a substantial number of organisations have now committed themselves in writing to specific indigenous 
 employment. The CEO of one of Australia's leading banks, whom I spoke to recently about a completely unrelated matter, said, `It was interesting that when I was meeting with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations he actually asked me how many indigenous people I employ.' In other words, the government and the minister are trying to stimulate the corporate conscience of Australia to see what they are prepared to do to specifically address the indigenous employment situation.</para><para>We also have structured training and a voluntary service to the Indigenous Communities Foundation which shows teachers, engineers or professional persons of any sort who want to volunteer where to go, how to get there and how to most appropriately volunteer. It is a program which actually provides a means by which the beneficence of people can be applied. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HV5</name.id><name role="metadata">WAKELIN</name><name role="display">Mr Wakelin</name></talker><para>—I second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>8108</page.no><name role="metadata">Zahra, Christian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ZAHRA</name><name.id>84H</name.id><electorate>McMillan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In addressing the private member's motion moved by the honourable member for Bradfield, I think it is important to place in context the opposition's response to the indigenous employment initiative. To do that, I will draw on the remarks of the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Banks. On 25 May, the member for Banks, Daryl Melham, said of the Indigenous Employment Program:</para></talk.start><para>Can I just say at the outset that Labor welcomes the initiative announced by Peter Reith today. Those initiatives are an acknowledgment that we have had three wasted years from this government on indigenous employment. It is recognition by Peter Reith himself. In his speech today he had this to say. He said that there have been some good things that we can build on. Most of the good things were Labor initiatives.</para><para>Today's announcement has two initiatives by the government which we welcome—the CDEP initiative and also the voluntary service to Indigenous Communities Foundation. Everything else is a rebadging of Labor programs that we introduced when we were in office. Peter Reith said that he has learned a bit recently, and I think he has. That is why we welcome all of these initiatives today 
 and we welcome a return to a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal unemployment and a bipartisan approach to trying to obtain real full-time employment for indigenous Australians. I think that what we have seen today is a wet Peter Reith and a Peter Reith who has gone out there listening to the community and to indigenous communities.</para><para>The good thing about today as well is that Aboriginal people were at the table and they have all been involved in this. It is a partnership. That is where the government has failed up until now. That is where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs deserves condemnation and so does the Prime Minister. Their missionary approach to indigenous affairs for the last three years, their attempt to mainstream everything and to cut and burn and slash ATSIC has been a failure. Minister Reith today basically belled the cat. That is why Labor applauds all the initiatives that he has announced today—all of the initiatives.</para><para>I stress that we have no criticism of anything that Peter Reith announced today because most of it is a rebadging of what we did. But bear this in mind: it is an admission by Peter Reith that we have had three wasted years under this government.</para><para>That is what the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Daryl Melham, had to say about the indigenous employment initiative. For my own part, as a new member of this parliament I particularly applaud the role that the member for Bradfield has played in this important issue. I think he has played an important role behind the scenes, quietly listening and supporting the government in the introduction of this employment initiative which we believe so strongly in.</para><para>Most people in Australia do not understand the significance or the depth of the problem facing Aboriginal Australians with regard to employment. In 1991, indigenous people in work only constituted 37 per cent of all indigenous people in Australia. In 1996, this had increased to only 41 per cent. Indigenous unemployment in Australia is 23 per cent and constitutes a giant 41 per cent of all Aboriginal people if you exclude CDEP participants. This is against a general rate of unemployment of 7.4 per cent in Australia.</para><para>The problem is enormous and we should not understate or try to diminish how significant the problem we face is. This is why we need a bipartisan, non-political approach to this significant issue. That is why I praise the efforts of the government in this particular 
 regard. As I mentioned, I also applaud the efforts of the member for Bradfield to be bipartisan in his personal approach to dealing with this issue.</para><para>We owe it to Aboriginal people in our community in Australia to make sure that we put politics to one side and focus on the issue of getting Aboriginal people into work. As everyone would understand, it is only by reducing the gap between the living standards of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people that we can truly achieve reconciliation in this country.</para><para>As significant a problem as Aboriginal unemployment is, it is not insurmountable. We in this parliament need to understand that a little better. In my own electorate, I have had the good fortune of being involved with the Aboriginal people—the Gunai or Kurnai people—in the Gippsland region. For about 18 months I served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Health and Housing Cooperative, so I have had a good deal of experience in relation to these issues. It is important to try to place in local context the scale of Aboriginal unemployment. In the Latrobe Valley, if we were able to put some 20 or 30 Aboriginal people into work, nearly every Aboriginal family in the Aboriginal community in the district would benefit. The benefit of those people being in work would be felt by nearly every family in that community. This is significant. If you look at the thousands of people who are in work in the Latrobe Valley or the district, you realise how small a step this would be for us to achieve a significant step in reconciliation with Aboriginal people.</para><para>We must ensure that every opportunity to lower Aboriginal unemployment is taken up. This is a profoundly important issue that Australia as a nation needs to face up to. The gap between the living standards of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians is enormous. We need to recognise that, in the past, when there has been a great deal of wealth in the Australian community, Aboriginal people have not benefited from that wealth. Looking at my own electorate again, I reflect on the days when the Latrobe Valley was a very wealthy region, that is, when we had a lot of 
 jobs in the Latrobe Valley. But the Aboriginal community in the Latrobe Valley was still impoverished. There was still a very high and significant level of unemployment in the Aboriginal community in the Latrobe Valley. When mainstream Australia and the Latrobe Valley were rich, the Aboriginal community was poor. Now that we in the Latrobe Valley have suffered from a high unemployment rate of 17 per cent for some years, the Aboriginal community is still poor. As a fundamental principle for the development of our region, we need to recognise and accept that, when we improve, when we do get jobs created in the Latrobe Valley, we make sure that we bring the Aboriginal community with us to make sure they benefit from the fruits of employment.</para><para>Most people recognise that true empowerment comes primarily from employment and from being a part of the mainstream of Australian society. For too long Aboriginal people have been placed at the margins—to one side—of mainstream Australia. It is only by placing Aboriginal people at the centre of our society that we will see significant gains made in reducing the gap in living standards which exists between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.</para><para>For my own part, this is something which I am enormously committed to. In the months to come I intend to initiate an Aboriginal employment conference in my electorate to try to alert some of the larger employers in my electorate to some of the opportunities which exist in assistance from government and other training units—such as the good work of the Koorie units at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE and the Gippsland campus of Monash University, and the Aboriginal cooperative in Morwell—which can support Aboriginal employees in their various workplaces. Long before this initiative was announced, this was something that we intended to proceed with. Now that this initiative has been announced it is probably even more appropriate that we proceed to bring in the big business sector—and, for that matter, small and medium employers—and set a challenge for them in terms of targets which can be achieved and which will make a 
 significant dent in Aboriginal unemployment in our region.</para><para>Looking at it on a localised scale, if we brought 40 employers together in Gippsland and set them the target of, over the next six or 12 months, creating jobs for or employing only 40 or 50 people, this would significantly impact on Aboriginal unemployment in our region. This is something which would profoundly change the make-up of Aboriginal employment in the Latrobe Valley. This is what my constituents want to see. They do not want to see Aboriginal people in despair or suffering from poverty and disempowerment. They want to see Aboriginal people given the opportunity to play a constructive role in our community and to be participants in our society.</para><para>The indigenous employment initiative which the government has announced is the type of initiative which the Labor Party in office would be proud to call its own. It is something which we on this side of the House are profoundly supportive of. This is an issue which must be dealt with in a bipartisan manner. It is important to reflect on this: if the government deals with this issue in a bipartisan manner and puts forward programs which support Aboriginal people, then it can look forward to a great deal of support from me and from every member on this side of the House. That has been shown by the maturity and the support that has been provided by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, Daryl Melham, which I applaud. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>8110</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to support this motion moved by the member for Bradfield, Dr Nelson, today. I congratulate the member on his commitment to the issues of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I can well recall the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, shortly after the 1996 election talking about the issues of Aboriginal health in Australia and referring to it as a generational problem. By that he meant that the problems had become so entrenched for so long that we are facing a very long haul to turn the state of health or the quality of physical and mental life of indigenous Australians around. I 
 believe that is the case with unemployment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities throughout Australia take many forms. They can be in regional centres, remote centres and in isolated communities right out in the middle of Australia that most Australians could only ever imagine. The statistics have been well documented: the 1996 census indicates an unemployment rate for indigenous Australians of 23 per cent. Once you take the Community Development Employment Program into account, you have an unemployment rate of 40 per cent plus.</para><para>At this point I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, in terms of his Aboriginal employment program. I have had personal experience working with the minister in my own electorate at Port Augusta where there is a significant Aboriginal unemployment issue. He spent a full day working with the community listening, watching—as was indicated earlier—and showing his fully-fledged commitment to this blight on our national economic and social scene. So Peter Reith's commitment and the government's backing of $115 million to specifically address the Aboriginal employment problem are a very welcome contribution.</para><para>As stated earlier, it is effectively a three-pronged policy: the employment policy, the small business fund and a more focused Job Network. The employment policy itself has seven elements: wage assistance for employers; a placement incentive for community development employment projects; a package involving major private sector companies wishing to recruit; projects providing structured training and employment opportunities for Aboriginal people in the private sector and with Aboriginal community organisations; a voluntary service; a national indigenous cadet program; and a public awareness project aimed specifically at Aboriginal communities, employers and the broader Australian community. The small business fund will be jointly funded by ATSIC to assist new in 
 digenous businesses and to help further develop existing businesses.</para><para>I share an experience that the member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, mentioned regarding the visit of the minister, Mr Reith, to Palm Island recently. Palm Island apparently has so much potential and yet so many entrenched problems. The opportunities for employment on Palm Island are extremely limited. Answers to the community's problem have to come from within the community. The Palm Island Council recognises this. Along with the member for Herbert, I welcome Mr Reith's commitment in this area.</para><para>In terms of a model for the future, the Shalom Christian College is where the students come from very disadvantaged backgrounds and are taught the fundamentals of reading and writing. Every building at the college has been constructed by the young people of the community. It is now at a stage where the construction crews are tendering for contacts out in the private sector. So there is a community that is just starting out and showing great promise as to what can be achieved. That is a basis on which the parliament, beginning with this motion today, can further develop the proposition. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>8111</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name><name.id>83D</name.id><electorate>Lowe</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand today to wholeheartedly support the sentiments put before the House today in the motion moved by the member for Bradfield, Dr Brendan Nelson. Having examined the government's indigenous employment policy that was released recently, it was pleasing to find that some of its initiatives echo previous Australian Labor Party policy.</para></talk.start><para>It is heartening to learn that when the government was looking for unemployment solutions and employment strategies it did not just not take the attitude that it knew what was best. Indigenous Australians were involved at the highest levels in advising the government as to what would work and what would not work.</para><para>The 1996 figures show that the rate of unemployment for indigenous Australians was 23 per cent compared with nine per cent for all Australians. According to the Chairman of ATSIC, Gatjil Djerrkura, it would take around 
 7,000 new jobs each year for Aboriginal Australians to reach employment equity. And when you have 70 per cent of indigenous employees in the public sector, it is important to ensure private sector jobs are created for indigenous employees.</para><para>Wage subsidies were originally introduced under Labor's Working Nation program and have been resurrected as part of our indigenous employment policy. I congratulate the government for taking wage subsidies on board as an employment incentive that really works. I believe that the provision of these wage subsidies will certainly improve the employment prospects of indigenous Australians.</para><para>I now move to the Indigenous Small Business Fund, which I support because it not only assists indigenous Australians in setting up businesses but also encourages these small business owners to employ other indigenous people. It will also support skills development and business prospects by providing services such as mentoring, networking and market development.</para><para>I particularly commend the government's interest in negotiating links with private companies through the chief executive officers for Indigenous Employment Project. I believe that this project, which aims to create viable, commercially based employment opportunities, has the capacity to be extremely successful. Further, the major companies who are prepared to become involved in the project will be assisted by flexible funding. It is heartening to see that a number of companies are prepared to employ Aboriginal people, who are our nation's most disadvantaged group.</para><para>The issue of structured training is important, particularly when it is considered that around a quarter of indigenous employees are employed in unskilled labour. We need to ensure that our Aboriginal community has access to skills training so that indigenous Australians can improve their employment prospects. The Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders program is focused on achieving this, particularly in organising indigenous apprenticeships and traineeships.</para><para>In my electorate of Lowe there are only about 450 indigenous Australians. However, I am committed to ensuring that my constituents have access to these programs.</para><para>Indigenous Australians have a high susceptibility to disease and a shockingly low life expectancy. Giving indigenous Australians access to wage subsidies and labour market programs, as well as other employment initiatives, is one way to address some of the problems faced by the indigenous community, such as poor health and lack of employment opportunities.</para><para>In concluding, I would like to take the opportunity to mention national reconciliation, an issue very dear to my heart. It is a fact that more than one million Australians signed the sorry books. We as a nation must be prepared to apologise for the injustices indigenous people have suffered at the hands of earlier generations. I would like to recognise a sorry time in Australia's history and apologise unreservedly for the shameful way Aboriginal people have been treated since white settlement. It is long overdue for the government to do likewise.</para><para>As the member for McMillan has just said in this House a few moments ago, the ALP would be very proud to call this policy its own.

 world's most populous country. It also marks the year of the 50th anniversary of the Communist takeover of power in China in 1949. I might remind members that 1999 is also something of a historical trifecta. It is now 50 years since the publication of the world's most persuasive diagnosis of the totalitarian experience, George Orwell's <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four</inline>. Half a century ago, Orwell penned what is easily the most perceptive analysis of the mind-set of that modern species of political animal for whom the individual has no rights, society no heart and power no limits.</para><para>With the possible exception of the People's Republic of North Korea, no country in the world today, especially since the demise of the Soviet empire, so completely mimics the detailed characteristics of the Orwellian nightmare state of Oceania than the People's Republic of China. In case the Chinese hierarchy assumes these are but the views of this humble backbencher, let them note that only last week <inline font-style="italic">Nineteen Eighty-Four </inline>was judged by a leading opinion poll and leading academics in Australia to be the most influential book of the 20th century. While one recognises and welcomes the transition of China's economy from a suffocating command economy to its present rather ramshackle and uneven market economy, with its amazing growth rates and growing opportunity, the fact remains that the colossus of Asia is ruled by an unelected cabal of generally incompetent, overwhelmingly corrupt and deeply heartless men for whom, it would appear at least, no imitation of Stalinist behaviour is too embarrassing.</para><para>In recent months, particularly in the weeks leading up to the Tiananmen anniversary on 4 June, we have witnessed the relentless intimidation by the agents of `Big Brother' of anyone known to harbour divergent political views, the blacking out of overseas media outlets and forms of transmission, including Internet portals, by Beijing's very own `Ministry of Truth' and the remorseless denigration and gaoling of leading democratic activists, and even members of the meditation movement Falun Gong, by the `thought police'. Most notable for Western interests has been the transparent organisation and 
 manipulation of a `hate week' against the West following the destruction of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which was no doubt an act of monumental incompetence by NATO but also one that even the dimmest party member must have known was a mistake and not a deliberate act of provocation.</para><para>Just as that lone figure standing in front of a tank near Tiananmen Square in 1989 has etched itself on the world's consciousness, so too one might contemplate the stunning thought that in a country of over a billion people the only widely noted protest in the precincts of the square on the 10th anniversary was that of a lone man who opened his umbrella, presumably as a symbol of protest, and was swiftly whisked away by the police.</para><para>The idea of total control of the minds and deeds of over a billion human beings is breathtaking in its ambition and is one for which the communist leadership has striven for 50 years. Tiananmen reminds us that, no matter how pervasive the reach of state control, the human spirit can still break out and individuals are still prepared to risk all for an idea and a dream. We who live in a free society, while constrained as we are by powerful realities of international politics and trade, can hardly do less than support these brave souls and denounce the brutal forces that would crush them.</para><para>At stake, of course, in this global drama of China's journey since 1949 is not just the question of freedom within China. There is also the threat that the Chinese leadership poses to the rest of the world by its struggle to maintain political control in the face of the inevitable countervailing forces towards greater pluralism and openness implicit in the widening freedoms of the market and the capacity of modern telecommunications—particularly the Internet and satellite TV—to transcend the best efforts of Big Brother and the totalitarian mind to suppress the merest hints of free thought.</para><para>Information freely disseminated is the oxygen of an open society. It is also the first step to confronting the truth  of history. The fact that official China can still not face up to the horrors which they and their predecessors have inflicted on the Chinese people during 
 the last half-century—besides the hundreds of millions of broken lives, we are now informed by serious scholars that some 50 million people have actually lost their lives—says volumes about the bankruptcy of the party and the enormity of the challenge that China's democrats face in the years ahead. Indeed, it is simply inconceivable that China can evolve into a decent place, with the civilities of normal society, unless it plugs the `memory hole' of Orwell's imagination.</para><para>No doubt there are many people in this chamber on both sides of this House who will say perhaps this is the wrong time to pass on this message, even though what I have said must be obvious to anyone who has followed the history of China without blinkers. I might draw here on the words of Professor Pierre Ryckmans, whose international reputation sits uneasily with the relative neglect that he has had in his adopted country of Australia. In his new book of essays <inline font-style="italic">The Angel and the Octopus</inline>, Ryckmans writes:</para><para>The Communist Party is in essence a secret society. In its methods and mentality it presents a striking resemblance to an underworld mob. It fears daylight, feeds on deception and conspiracy, and rules by intimidation and terror.</para><para>Ryckmans observes that China's regime is `built on a triple foundation: dialectics, the power of the party, and a secret police'. He says Marxism is `merely an optional feature'.</para><para>To those who say a foreign observer has no right to comment on the actions of such a regime—`Surely,' they argue, `this is us imposing our values on someone else.'—I say that of course we acknowledge the majesty of Chinese culture and its wonderful history. But one must reflect on the fact that in China the regime has never received the electorate's mandate. Prior to its capture of power, the party membership constituted less than 0.01 per cent of the Chinese population. There is of course nothing new in any of this for, as Ryckmans modestly observed in 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen tragedy:</para><para>Let us not kid ourselves. The facts which I have been describing during these last twenty years may have been distasteful and unpalatable—they were also public knowledge. They were all too easy to collect. . .  
</para><para>The motion before you has as its objective a modest program to respond to the human rights abuses being perpetuated in China and Tibet today, a program that Australia can easily implement without undue cost to its wider interests and one consistent with its own historical commitment to democracy.</para><para>Besides the specific assistance that Australia can offer to individual dissidents, we should feel it part of our international obligation to the very human rights covenants that China has signed to ensure that our voice in defence of human rights is never muffled at the altar of immediate trade considerations, important as these considerations are to our national interest. We should support China's membership of the World Trade Organisation precisely because we hope that this constructive engagement will enable us not just to trade with Beijing but also, through the spread of technology and enhanced political leverage, to improve human rights in China. 	Besides the proposals itemised in this motion, I would also suggest that our government provide particular assistance to proponents of free trade unionism in China. That is something that probably will not go down well with the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business but, given the history of Poland, that would probably be most valuable. We should note one of the factors immediately preceding the crackdown on protesters in 1989 was the formation of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation on 17 April 1989, the first free trade union in China since the communist takeover in 1949. In 1989 many of these brave workers—as were hundreds of thousands of other people—were imprisoned in China's own gulag, which they call the loagai.</para><para>Finally, on a similar practical plane, I would like to conclude by saying that perhaps the re-expansion of the role of Radio Australia, a public institution that has probably done more to foster democratic values in our region than any other, would be a good idea. Fidelity to, and the broadcast of, objective truth has—as Orwell so eloquently observed—no equal in the great global contest with the totalitarian mind. The cost of such an enterprise for Australia is modest but the returns to our 
 country in future years, as China frees itself from its dark journey since 1949, are incalculable.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8T4</name.id><name role="metadata">FERGUSON</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>8115</page.no><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name><name.id>CU4</name.id><electorate>Hindmarsh</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the member for Melbourne Ports has mentioned, 331 Chinese people—mainly students—were tragically killed in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989 while taking part in a pro-democracy protest. There is some discussion about those figures but they were the official figures given by the Chinese government; I believe other estimates are larger. In Australia we were appalled that people could lose their lives simply for assembling legitimately to seek change in a political system and the reduction of corruption. The Australian government, in response, allowed 30,000 Chinese people who had come to Australia as students to remain in Australia because they felt that they may be in danger if they returned home. Many of those students still stay with us and are now very valued Australian citizens. Ten years on, the events at Tiananmen Square still stay with us, reflecting our very strong belief that all people have the right to demonstrate peacefully without being afraid that they are going to be killed by government, injured or put in prison.</para></talk.start><para>We share the sadness of the member for Melbourne Ports in noting the 10th anniversary of Tiananmen Square and join him in sending our sympathy to the families of those who died and suffered on that date. We acknowledge that the measures the member opposite has called for are worth while and that the motion is put forth in good faith and with genuine concern for the people of China. However, China is a sovereign country. Australia does not like to be told what to do by other countries. We do not like to be told what to do on the environment, about the treatment of our indigenous people or indeed about any other issue.</para><para>China is an extremely proud country with a written history hundreds of centuries longer than that of Australia. Like Australia and Australians, neither the government nor the people of China respond positively to being told what to do by the people or the politi 
 cians of another country. While lecturing from afar may appease our own consciences and make us feel good, I suspect that does little to encourage real change in China and indeed may be counter-productive. All members in this House would share the desire of the member for Melbourne Ports for the People's Republic of China to improve its human rights record. However, as I have indicated before, there are preferable ways than through a direct condemnation by this parliament. The best way to effect an improvement in the human rights of the Chinese people is to build on our deepening relationship with China. We do this by engaging the Chinese government and its agencies in a constructive dialogue.</para><para>To this end, in 1997 the Howard government established the annual bilateral human rights dialogue with China. Doing so puts human rights squarely on the agenda of our relationship with China. Alongside security, trade and culture, our dialogue with Chinese leaders includes discussions about the rights of individuals to voice their opinions without fear of imprisonment, injury or death.</para><para>Australians tend to respect traditions of other countries and will go out of their way not to offend in meetings between individuals. However, along with other Western countries, we tend to believe our human rights values are the fundamental ones and, as such, should always be the norm of other countries, despite their history and their culture. But the rights of individuals to protest are not as clearly a part of the culture of non-Western countries as they are of our own. Countries that are geographically close to Australia often put more emphasis on community agreement than individual rights to minimise both social disruption and conflict.</para><para>Acknowledging this cultural and political difference does not in any way lessen our horror at deaths and injuries that occur at peaceful protests such as Tiananmen Square. However, it does mean that we must be aware that countries do have, and do come from, different value systems. In addressing human rights issues, we are better served by working through their value systems rather than by simply imposing our own systems because `we know that they are right.' The dialogue 
 the Australian government is having with China, along with parallel dialogues pursued by other countries, is contributing to a gradual improvement, though perhaps not as fast as we would like, in human rights in China.</para><para>The second meeting of the Australia-Chinese human rights dialogue was held in August 1998. It brought together Chinese and Australian government officials and representatives from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to discuss domestic, regional and international human rights issues. Working with China, and through official protests about human rights violations, we are making practical, positive and real steps in human rights. Positive practical outcomes include a human rights technical assistance program worth close to $1 million a year. Because of the relationship Australia has built with China, there are now programs in place in China that promote women's and children's rights, that train judges and officials in the legal system and that develop expertise in the field of international human rights.</para><para>The Howard government has put in place arrangements for short-term study awards. These awards allow Chinese officials to attend courses on human rights at Australian universities. A program has been established to ensure that significant works published in Australia on human rights are translated into Chinese and that similar works from China are translated into English and are available in Australia. Through all these practical programs we engage the Chinese government at a senior level on the details of our human rights concerns. The rapport that we have been able to build with China through this dialogue has given us a little more influence in China than we could ever achieve by lecturing from afar.</para><para>As I have indicated before, this is not to say that Australia will remain silent on human rights abuses or that Australia will fail to speak up on behalf of all people who suffer unjustly at the hands of their governments. The Australian government reserves its right to make direct representation to all countries about reports of human rights abuses, including China. Change is rarely rapid, and in the case of China we do not, and cannot, expect 
 overnight change. There will be setbacks but, when they happen, Australia will not fail to protest.</para><para>Since December last year we have made repeated representations to Beijing about the detainment of hundreds of members of the China Democratic Party. We did so again on Friday, 6 August about the very severe sentence given to two of the leaders of that movement. We have also made our concerns very clear about the banning of the Falungong. These issues, along with human rights issues, will be on the agenda at this year's human rights dialogue in Beijing and Qinghai Province. From 16 to 21 August our eight-member delegation, led by the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will carry our concerns and the concerns of all Australians directly to the Chinese government. Professor Alice Tay, the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and a renowned authority on human rights law, will bring her expertise to the delegation. For the first time, a member of parliament, Mr Nugent, will be on the delegation in recognition of the strength of Australia's  parliamentary and community interest in human rights in China.</para><para>I thank the member opposite for bringing this motion before the House today. It is an important motion and, in the main, we agree with the sentiments it expresses and the points that he has made, but I would caution him that condemnation of China from a distance by other parliaments may not be the best way to achieve the positive results that all of us would wish for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>8116</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Whilst not being as enamoured with the market changes in China as the mover of the original motion—in fact, some of those market changes essentially led to the Chinese government and the people's army flogging off their work force to South Korean corporations for the lowest possible wages—I very much, in a less qualified manner than the previous speaker, support this motion. I think it is very interesting to look at the pragmatic effect of government upon people and the degree to which trade considerations colour 
 people's determination about human rights issues.</para></talk.start><para>If it is very easy in Australia to condemn the Chinese administration's human rights abuses, it is far easier to attack the human rights abuses in pariah states such as Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea than it is to perhaps tackle issues in China in a more determined fashion. I think that, despite this talk of meeting with the Chinese government—trying to work them through, et cetera—the evidence today is somewhat different.</para><para>I refer to an editorial in the Manchester <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline>, a liberal progressive newspaper, which said on the anniversary:</para><para>What is striking on this anniversary is not the by-now-familiar history of that horrible event, but the regime's continuing inability to face that history.</para><para>I will, unlike the previous member, catalogue some instances of individual human rights abuses which go to show that all the talk in the world is not having much impact on the Chinese administration. The Chinese administration claim that they cannot find Wang Weilin—the person who was shown on international television at the time standing in front of a tank—in the morgues, the cemeteries, the computer registers or the prisons of the country.</para><para>In the case of Fang Zheng, who has been in a wheelchair since a People's Liberation Army tank ran over his legs, the government, when they became aware of the reason why he was in a wheelchair, went so far as to say that he could not represent the Chinese nation in international disabled sporting events. Li Hai received a four-year prison sentence because he committed the monstrous crime of collecting data on the 800 people who were punished as a result of those events. He was charged with `hooliganism' in 1995 and in 1996 with `prying into high-level state secrets'. He received nine years for prying into state secrets about the fate of people who were punished. Yu Dongyue and others who were guilty of the horrific offence of throwing eggs at Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square received sentences of 16 to 20 years.</para><para>Whilst of course we do not want to adopt a hectoring style with China, we cannot for a moment imagine that simply bringing people 
 to Australia to listen to a few lectures on human rights is necessarily going to solve the situation. Amnesty International are also somewhat critical. In their latest country report, they said of the visits in recent years of Mary Robinson and Bill Clinton that they `highlighted the authorities' growing but limited willingness to discuss human rights, as well as continuing violations'. Their account of the year showed that the attack on human rights in China is multifaceted.</para><para>There have been a significant number of detentions of the Uighur people, Tibetans, trade union officials and poets. One poet was reportedly sentenced in November last year to seven years imprisonment for subversion. A businessman from the same area who is a friend of the poet and a rock singer who is a brother of one of the poets were also detained and accused of divulging state secrets. A labour rights activist from Hunan, Zhang Shanguang, was detained in July after trying to set up a group to help laid-off workers. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much tempering of our attitudes by an overconcern with trade considerations and with the fact that we would not want to offend such an expanding market for our products. I commend the motion very strongly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>8117</page.no><name role="metadata">Cadman, Alan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CADMAN</name><name.id>SD4</name.id><electorate>Mitchell</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the member for Reid for his forthright statements. It is typical of the member to come forward and make forthright statements in this House. It must have distressed him greatly to see the Australian Labor Party, when in office, rush to endorse and embrace China—with the trips of Whitlam, Hawke and others—in those early days and to set aside all of the problems of the past.</para></talk.start><para>I join the member for Reid in the condemnation of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I believe that Australia needs to keep putting forward our view on human rights, and to do it strongly with every regime and at every opportunity we have. But, as members have said, we have to balance practicalities against the achievable. We can hold strong views in this parliament and express them strongly, and that is our right. Governments, however, have to manage situations. It does not matter whether it is the Australian Labor Party 
 making friends quickly with China or whether it is Australian governments trading and building up a rapport and hoping, by a practical process, to achieve results, if one were to weigh one process of government against the other, one would have to say the Labor Party adopted an ad hoc approach to China. There is a planned approach from the current government. A process of strong statement and protest has been necessary in the last few days from the Australian government to highlight action on human rights in China, but the process has been of building strength and education as well. It is only through that double process, I believe, that we are going to achieve practical results.</para><para>But, here in this parliament, let us just state our concerns about the activities of the government of China and their failure to meet human rights targets. It has been a successive concern of American and Australian governments that, following the events in Tiananmen Square, little change appears to have taken place. There has been gradual change but not to the extent that anybody here would want. I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for bringing forward his timely motion to the House. The motion proposes a range of activities. Some of these activities are, I think, reasonable, but I do not know whether any mistreatment of Chinese students who elected to stay in Australia and subsequently returned to China is a matter of concern or not. I have not noted any reports that it is a matter of concern. I think they returned to their original country in a free and open way and appreciated their stay in Australia. Not all of them were official refugees. With regard to prisoners of conscience, I have for a long time, here in this parliament and outside this parliament, been a strong supporter of the people of Tibet. In considering that country, one cannot help but express concern about the Sinoisation of Tibet.</para><para>There are a number of factors which may colour one's views in this debate, but I do believe that the repeated representations to Beijing about the Chinese Democratic Party in December last year from this government have been useful and well timed, the last one being on 6 August, last Friday, about the very 
 severe sentence given to two of the party's leaders. I think that is good timing and were good actions on the part of this government.</para><para>The concerns we have expressed about the banning of union activity and processes have led to the appointment of this eight-member delegation, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Deputy Secretary, taking these and other human rights issues to Beijing, departing on 16 August. Mr Nugent is a member of that group. To have somebody from this parliament with a proven background and record in human rights and a concern for reconciliation as Peter Nugent has is a valuable process and one that ought to be endorsed by all sides.</para><para>The ad hoc approach of Labor Party governments has been replaced by a more planned and measured approach—one of rapprochement tempered with criticism and a statement of our deep concern where there has been a denial of human rights. Professor Alice Tay, President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, is going to be a part of that delegation leaving for China and will also be a valuable additional impetus to the Chinese. There is no doubt that any observer of Australian politics will recognise the message that the Australian government is giving to the Chinese government by this delegation. I understand the delegation is to leave within a few days, and I know that members of the Australian parliament will want to wish every member well.</para><para>Peter Nugent has had considerable experience in the Middle East and for some time was based in Singapore. His current knowledge of China and the affairs of Asia, his political involvement over a long period of time and his strong views on democratic representation will make him particularly relevant in that delegation. Democratic representation within the process that we have in Australia is one that is not understood in China. I know that Peter Nugent, above all others, will be compelling and strong and will not be pushed off his target when he expresses the views of this parliament. I am sure that he will read these debates. I would be surprised if he was not going to take with him for presentation to those people he meets 
 bound copies of today's speeches and the motion moved by my honourable friend.</para><para>It is all very well to stand here and throw rocks at the Chinese government, but at the end of the day we have to translate that concern into practical programs. That is what this government is doing, and I endorse the actions of the government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</name></talker><para>—Order!

During the adjournment debate on 21 June 1999 I expressed my grave concern for the future of our great national public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I also mentioned the enormous financial pressure the ABC is under at the moment, with the government's $55 million cut to its annual appropriation since 1997 and the further pressure for the ABC to sell off its Gore Hill television site to fund the cost of conversion to digital broadcasting. Moreover, I said that, if the ABC is further marginalised by this government and media ownership rules are changed through the Productivity Commission inquiry, great damage will be done to media diversity.</para></talk.start><para>Today I again stand up for the ABC and salute the great work of its without fear or favour programs, including the <inline font-style="italic">Media Watch</inline> revelations regarding money for comment or indeed opinion within the commercial radio industry.

It was and is in the public interest that these deals were and continue to be exposed and that we are all made aware of how naive many of us have been.

 issue of business ethics, in particular the role of the banking industry in this scandal. At a time when the banks' customers are being punished by reduced services, slugged by increased bank fees and charges, disadvantaged by branch closures and massive staff retrenchments, the bank executives reward themselves with huge salary packages and post record profits, to the delight of the shareholders. Meanwhile, the banking industry's $1.2 million deal with Mr Laws mocks the community. It is a flagrant violation of every ethical standard. It is, however, shamefully consistent with their prior conduct in other matters.</para><para>Let us look at their deal with the Law Society of New South Wales. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of July 1999 notes that `since 1984 the banks have paid an estimated $300 million to the society as "interest" or "gratuitous payments".' Little wonder the Australian Bankers Association is only now reviewing its policy as a lobby group and seeking new options to repair the banking industry's tattered reputation following the cancellation of the $1.2 million contract with the radio identity. I fully endorse the Australian Broadcasting Authority's announcement to broaden its inquiry to include Radio 5AD Broadcasting Pty Ltd and Radio 6PR Southern State Broadcasters Pty Ltd. I must quote part of the terms of reference of Professor David Flint's ABA hearing, for it is of critical importance to the public interest:</para><para>The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 includes, within its objects, to encourage providers of commercial broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest and to encourage providers of broadcasting services to respect community standards in the provision of program material.</para><para>That is what the ABA hearing is all about—protecting the public interest. That is not to say that the ethics violated here are defined merely in the act itself. But even the act has specifically identified the fundamental necessity for fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest.</para><para>This is the banking industry's most public crisis. However, it is not merely banks that fall into the trap. This fiasco, I suspect, is also operating in other industries and with other 
 high profile media broadcasters. The Americans call it payola; we call it pay for comment. A secret arrangement involving the Australian Bankers Association and Mr Laws is now exposed. The banks wanted to buy editorial comment in their favour. Mr Laws appeared to have wanted cash. Both entered into the agreement privately. This is a contemptible arrangement. I fully agree with my leader, the Hon. Kim Beazley, calling on corporations to come clean on their involvement with advertising or sponsorship schemes that could be unethical and urging them to disclose their interests now.</para><para>This banking dishonour is now an obvious example of a much wider scandalous practice. The banks' credit rating is zero. The major insurance houses and other corporations from the big business world have been courting and buying off the media for years. Not a day goes by without startling revelations of more deals, scandals and controversy. I fully agree with the comments of Dr Simon Longstaff, the Executive Director of the St James Ethics Centre, who is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 27 July 1999 as follows:</para><para>Walk into any organisation where a serious ethical breach has occurred and ask people to explain why things happen the way they do, and you will almost certainly encounter two dominant responses, `Well, everybody does it—don't they?' or `That's just the way we do things around here'.</para><para>Dr Longstaff sends this chilling warning:</para><para>Unthinking custom and practice is a recipe for disaster—not least because it means that people tend to operate on automatic pilot, failing to recognise or respond to the changing world around them. The antidote is to create an environment where people reflect on their conduct and act according to a well informed conscience.</para><para>The banks and the business world as a whole have lost the plot. So, too, have the media. They have fallen into the error of invincible ignorance. They do not know that they do not know. They are so blinded by error that they can no longer even see how disastrous—to use Dr Longstaff's description—their `policies' are. The banks have manipulated public interest, they have bought favours and they have disguised their commercial interests under a cloak of media independence. They 
 are liars, they are cheats, they are dishonest and they must be made accountable.</para><para>If a member of parliament has a pecuniary interest, he or she must declare it. A legal practitioner in New South Wales must abide by strict statutory and other rules or face professional misconduct proceedings. The same goes for doctors. In light of the recent revelations, public broadcasters and the corporate world should be made to fully disclose their financial deals. What a time for these revelations to occur in light of the Productivity Commission's inquiry. I will conclude by saying something about this inquiry, which is expected to bring down its findings on broadcasting legislation next month.</para><para>I refer to the Productivity Commission Act 1998 and the Treasurer's terms of reference in relation to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into broadcasting legislation. I urge every member of this House to read section 6 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, which deals with the functions of the commission. I also urge every member to read paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Treasurer's terms of reference for the inquiry into broadcasting legislation. When you read section 6 of the Productivity Commission Act 1998, clearly you have to ask why the Treasurer has chosen this body to conduct this very important inquiry. The concept of productivity just seems to get wider by the minute.</para><para>Broadcast and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports from this parliament reach a very small audience. Most people are dependent on media reports for information about what goes on in this House and about the actions and policies of the government. The media play a crucial role in fairly and accurately reporting the work of the parliament in conformance with the Broadcasting Services Act. The media are central to our democracy and to the public interest.</para><para>Let us look at the facts. We enter the new decade with two dominating media forces, Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch. The Treasurer's terms of reference sound good until we face the grim reality that there are no real competitors in the race for digital broadcasting. Realistically, who could afford the infrastructure investment necessary to set up a digital 
 grid of television, Internet and cable television to compete against the existing media forces? Who has that sort of money? It has taken the current players, with their enormous financial resources and clout, years to prepare for this phase of broadcasting.</para><para>The Productivity Commission has been issued with terms of reference by the Treasurer which have wrongly set it up as a Star Chamber to hang the public interest. In the Treasurer's press release No. 12 of 4 March 1999, he says:</para><para>This review does not signal any change to the government's media policies including those regarding cross-media ownership and Australia's digital transition.</para><para>What sophistry. The Treasurer must think we are all fools. The Treasurer's press release flies in the face of his own terms of reference to the Productivity Commission's inquiry on broadcasting legislation. The Productivity Commission is directed to do the following:</para><para>. . . determine a preferred option for regulation, if any, in light of objectives set out in the terms of reference, which includes, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> , practical courses of action to improve competition efficiency and the interests of consumers in broadcasting services.</para><para>What are we hearing about that inquiry from the submissions of the commercial interests? I will tell you. In a climate of obfuscation they want to change the rules to increase their power, their control over us, the parliament, and maintain profits—all at great cost to media diversity and, thus, to the public interest. The Productivity Commission is plainly being manipulated in a way that will guarantee a two-airline policy for the broadcasting industry, locking other potential significant players out of the market. The inquiry should be looking at what we can do to increase media diversity, not ensuring greater concentration of effective duopolistic control. In light of the failure of self-regulation, I urge this parliament to support a policy of co-regulation of the media, thus ensuring adequate protection of the public interest.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Paralympic Games</title><page.no>8123</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>8123</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When preparing for this grievance debate, 
 gathering some ideas some three months ago, my original intention was to highlight my concerns about the lack of publicity and lack of community involvement in the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. Since that time, many of my fears have been allayed by an extensive community involvement program and a great deal more publicity for the Paralympics—but there is still much that has to be done. A great deal more community involvement is needed to ensure that the Paralympics are a great success.</para></talk.start><para>Most Australians would know that the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games will start on Friday, 15 September. This is an exciting and challenging time for New South Wales and for all of Australia. The Olympic Games provides a showcase, unlike any other throughout the world, to allow the rest of the world to see what Australia can do and what Australia is all about. Some 10,200 athletes will be at the Olympic Games, with 5,000 officials and coaches. Between 198 and 200 countries will be participating in 28 different sports. An incredible number of media people will be involved in the Olympics—some 15,000—and the expected number of spectators is 5.5 million. More importantly, the Sydney Olympics will be viewed by a worldwide TV audience of 3.5 billion people.</para><para>Anyone driving past the Olympics site at the moment would see that building is now nearing completion and the final preparations are well in hand for a very successful Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. But in reality the Sydney 2000 Games are really just a preparation, a trial run, for the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. Obviously, if everything runs well and runs smoothly for the Olympics—as we know it will—we will know that everything will then run well at the Paralympic Games.</para><para>It is vital that the Paralympic Games are as successful and as well attended as the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games because it is the Paralympic Games that will leave the final impression on the world. The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games is in fact the closing ceremony of the Olympic celebrations for Sydney and for Australia. Some 4,000 athletes, 2,000 officials and coaches and 125 
 countries in 18 sports, 14 of which are full Olympic sports, will be participating in the Paralympics. Between 1,300 and 2,000 members of the media will be there. It is anticipated that there will be over one million spectators at the Paralympic Games.</para><para>The Paralympic Games are the next largest sporting event—in terms of the number of countries involved—after the Olympic Games. With the 120 countries involved, they are bigger than the Nagano Winter Olympic Games and the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. They will be bigger than the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games and the 1998 Soccer World Cup. They will even be bigger than the 1956 Olympic Games that were held in Melbourne.</para><para>The federal government has also played its part in assisting with the Paralympic Games. This assistance includes legislative protection of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games words and symbols and assistance with environmental issues, drug testing, revenue forgone through the GST exemption, security, immigration, customs, quarantine, health care—including access to Medicare—production of commemorative coins, communications, international air transport and promotion of Australia overseas.</para><para>The Australian Sports Commission has funded the Paralympic preparation program for athletes to undertake high level training. Australian Paralympians are among the best in the world, and I am sure that all Australians will remember that they came second in the world at the Atlanta Paralympics, second only to the US. In addition to that, on 28 July the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth government is contributing a guarantee—of up to $25 million—of half the expected operating deficit, providing almost $5.5 million towards the preparations of Paralympic athletes and meeting the GST liability on the Paralympic ticket sales—an estimated cost of $1.6 million. I am also personally delighted that the Prime Minister has accepted the invitation to officially open the Sydney Paralympic Games on 18 October next year. I should remember that date because it is the day after my 25th wedding anniversary. I have no excuse.</para><para>The Paralympic torch relay route was announced by the Prime Minister on 28 July at Parliament House. I urge all Australians, particularly those in New South Wales—and elsewhere throughout Australia, as I now know that the Paralympic torch is visiting not only New South Wales but also other states of Australia—to find out where the Paralympic torch is visiting to ensure that they support and encourage the Paralympians by cheering on the passage of the Paralympic torch. In my own area on the central coast, there was some concern, which I supported, that while the Paralympic torch was visiting Gosford—and in fact staying overnight at the new Grahame Park Stadium—it was not visiting the Woy Woy peninsula area of my electorate, which because of its geographical isolation often misses out on major events. I am pleased to note that the Paralympic torch will be going through the Woy Woy peninsula area and it is a fantastic opportunity for all those residents of the peninsula area to become personally involved and to become part of the Olympic story by supporting the Paralympic torch.</para><para>The challenge now is not the organisation of the Paralympic Games. The challenge for all Australians is to support and attend the Paralympic Games. I have no doubt that every seat for the Olympic Games will be sold, every seat will be filled. But I want to see every seat at the Paralympic Games filled as well, because the Paralympic athletes are truly remarkable people. The Australians who will be competing in those games have in many cases overcome what to many of us would be insurmountable obstacles to reach the pinnacle of their sporting careers. They are truly great Australians and each and every one of them deserves our full and wholehearted support, which we can show by attending these games.</para><para>There are people like Sue-Ellen Lovett, whom I have known for most of my life. She is a blind equestrian who has dedicated the last 10 years of her life to fundraising, not only for the Paralympic Games. She has recently completed another epic ride from Brisbane to Sydney. Last year she rode from Melbourne to Sydney—and called in to Canberra—through some atrocious weather 
 conditions to highlight the Paralympic Games and to raise funds for the athletes.</para><para>There are people like Louise Sauvage, world No. 1 track and road racer who recently raced into the hearts and minds of Australians during April with her third consecutive win in the Boston marathon. There are athletes who are sometimes less well known, such as Melissa Wilson, an 18-year-old person who suffered traumatic brain injury after being hit by a car. Despite those injuries she has become a world-class swimmer. Melissa was only 11 when she was knocked from her bike while crossing at an intersection, and she was in a coma for over four months. She had to learn to do everything again. Her rehabilitation is a continuous process and she recently spoke as an ambassador for the Paralympics at the Mingara Club on the central coast of New South Wales, accompanied by Lois Appleby. Melissa's story, which she related to us at Mingara on that night, basically made sure that there was not a dry eye amongst the audience. From being able to float in water five years ago, Melissa now swims 25 kilometres a week and has racked up a formidable national and international record. She also speaks on behalf of the Motor Accident Authority as one of their athlete ambassadors.</para><para>Just a small quote from Melissa sums up, I am sure, the attitude of every Paralympian in Australia. She said on that night:</para><para>I promise to swim the race of my life and I would love to look up after my race and see you all in the stands cheering me on.</para><para>That, I am sure, is the wish of every Paralympian, to be able to look up in the stands and see those stands full of cheering Australians, proud of the magnificent efforts of the Australian Paralympians.</para><para>There is no excuse whatsoever for those stands not being full. The Paralympic organising committee have organised a unique Paralympic day pass. Just one ticket is valid for up to 14 different sports on any one day. The cost of that ticket is just $15, or only $8 for a school child or a concession ticket. That $15 includes free entertainment, festivities, cultural events and exhibitions to make it a day out you will never forget. I know there are thousands of organisations and groups 
 throughout New South Wales and Australia that are always looking for days out at reasonable value. I challenge all those groups—the pensioner groups, Rotary groups, Lions Clubs, school groups, P&amp;Cs, social clubs, bridge players, sporting groups—to organise a coach to come down to the Paralympics. There are group advance purchase forms. If you purchase more than 100 tickets you will get the benefit of an extra 10 tickets for no cost.</para><para>I congratulate the Prime Minister and the federal Minister for Sport and Tourism for the government's initiative in providing specialist assistance to ensure the attendance of a large number of school children from all over Australia. That will mean that up to 40,000 school children will receive assistance to come to the Paralympics. I challenge each federal member to ensure that they publicise the Paralympics and get as many people, particularly from New South Wales, as they can to come and see what the Paralympians can do. It is a marvellous sporting event. It is something that the Paralympians deserve. They deserve our support and I am sure everyone will be there.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Funding</title><page.no>8125</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>8125</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the dying days of the last session of parliament before the break, the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999</inline>  passed through both houses. It is on that basis that today I grieve for the natural environment of Australia. Since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has slashed funding for the environment, broken promises about additional environment funding, and has now handed much of the responsibility for the environment over to the states and territories. During the 1996 election campaign, the coalition linked the sale of one-third of Telstra to the Natural Heritage Trust, but Australians were later to discover that it was not the case that the Natural Heritage Trust funding was extra funding—to a large extent it replaced ordinary environment portfolio expenditure slashed in federal budgets. The situation now exists where the Natural Heritage Trust is the only significant source of Commonwealth environment funding. But, as I have said, it is not additional as promised; 
 it is a substitute for funding that already existed as part of the Commonwealth's normal budgetary processes.</para></talk.start><para>From this first betrayal of the environment, the record of the Howard government has not improved. The Howard government has taken an irresponsible stand on greenhouse emissions which put Australia out of step with other Western countries and destroyed Australia's reputation as a world leader in environmental policy. The Howard government supports uranium mining at Kakadu National Park, one of the most pristine and sensitive areas of this nation. It does so, despite there being serious deficiencies in the assessment report on the Jabiluka mine.</para><para>As I stated from the outset, before the winter recess the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999  was passed. The new legislation refers to `matters of national environmental significance in which the Commonwealth will intervene'. All those matters that are not listed are handed over to the states and territories. The problems with this approach are many and varied. The environment requires an integrated national approach to deal with issues such as greenhouse gas emissions. I quote from an article today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which indicated, regarding greenhouse emissions:</para><para>Australia faces a "formidable challenge" to meet the cuts in greenhouse emissions agreed under the Kyoto climate change treaty, a confidential government report says.</para><para>We have to remember that this is in the context that at Kyoto Australia achieved considerable conditions that were favourable on the basis of our high usage of fossil fuels. I quote again from the article in this morning's newspaper regarding the challenge:</para><para>"However, even this will be a formidable challenge, requiring a cut of 25 per cent, or some 100 million tonnes . . .</para><para>That challenge was the significant concession at Kyoto that Australia achieved because we are allowed a target of reducing greenhouse emissions to 108 per cent above 1990 levels by no later than 2012. As this article indicates, to achieve that target we would need to cut back `some 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from expected "business- 
as-usual" growth by 2010'. That was stated in the report by the Prime Minister's Science Engineering and Innovation Council. The report goes on to say that, to put this 100 million tonnes equivalent into perspective, if we eliminated all Australian road transport, including private cars, this `would achieve a cut of only 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent'. So this is a large ask that a national government has to take seriously.</para><para>To hold environment policy hostage to a state rights agenda is a seriously misguided and dangerous notion. The legislation identifies the matters of national importance as the environmental assessment and approval processes in relation to the Commonwealth marine area; world heritage properties; certain Ramsar wetlands; threatened species and ecological communities; certain migratory species including whales, dolphins and porpoises; and environmentally significant nuclear actions and certain actions by the Commonwealth and its agencies. What it does not include is many of the issues that are agreed upon as the biggest environmental challenges facing Australia and the world today. It does not include the important issues of national significance such as climate change and greenhouse gases, ozone depletion, air quality, soil salinity, desertification, inland water pollution or quarantine issues. Indeed, it neglects to mention land degradation, land clearing and forest management. All of these issues require a holistic national approach for the future, not eight sets of separate decisions based on arbitrary lines drawn on a map last century.</para><para>As we approach the Centenary of Federation, there can be no other area of public policy that better illustrates the artificiality of the divisions of powers based on these arbitrary colonial boundaries than environmental policy. This was recognised at the COAG meeting—the 1997 `Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment'—where 30 areas, not the six or seven that are in this legislation, were identified as national matters of environmental significance. They included many of those that I have already listed. So we really need an understanding that, because matters 
 environmental do not recognise boundaries that are geopolitical like those we have between states and territories, we really need, like no other area of national policy, to have a national approach and for the Commonwealth government to accept national responsibility for those policies.</para><para>One of the intriguing things about inquiries that are ever held into matters environmental is that they show up the need for coordination between the Commonwealth and the states—for instance, the now 10-year-old report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <inline font-style="italic">The effectiveness of land degradation policies and programs.</inline> Much of the evidence that was put to that inquiry indicated—and I quote from the NFF submission:</para><para>There quite obviously has been a lack of coordination between the Commonwealth and the states. The states have been apprehensive about the Commonwealth coming in over the top.</para><para>Greening Australia also indicated that there were many specific problems with the lack of coordination.</para><para>The point is that in this piece of legislation, in the area of land degradation, land clearing and matters such as that, that responsibility, in the main unfettered, has been handed back to the states. If there is any area that we can improve upon to achieve better outcomes in greenhouse emissions, it would be in reforestation and in diminishing the rate of land clearing, much of which goes on at the behest of state administrations. What we really need to see is the Commonwealth government take responsibility for environmental policies, which are not only of international concern but also a national responsibility.</para><para>Community reaction to the Howard government's national buck-passing on all of these issues has been strong. Groups as diverse as the Australian Industry Group, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Environmental Defender's Office and the Worldwide Fund for Nature have criticised the legislation. The Executive Director of the ACF said in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 29 June:</para><para>The central element of the Government's agenda is to duck messy conflicts with the States by handing responsibility back to them. This is an invitation to the Premiers to sacrifice the environment to development.</para><para>The likely consequence of this legislation is a bidding war between the states and territories for the lowest common denominator environmental standards so as to attract investment. The Howard government is actively encouraging this behaviour.</para><para>Australians who are concerned about environmental issues should realise that the government's new found allies, the Australian Democrats, were instrumental in passing this legislation. The Democrats have paraded themselves around the country for the last 20 years claiming to be the political party of the environment, yet this massive shirking of Commonwealth responsibility for the environment came about with their tacit approval. Just as Australians will never forget the shabby sell-out by the Democrats that placed a 10 per cent tax on nearly everything they do or buy, nor will Australians forget the role the Democrats have played in assisting the Howard government to abrogate its responsibility for the environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Western Australian Rural Services</title><page.no>8127</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>8127</page.no><name role="metadata">Haase, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAASE</name><name.id>84T</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to draw the attention of the House to the deplorable service delivery that rural and remote communities are being forced to endure in the northern regions of Western Australia at the hands of Australia Post. As many in the House would be aware, my electorate of Kalgoorlie takes in 91 per cent of the state of Western Australia. For a long time these salt of the earth people have felt like second-class citizens in their own country with the shutting down of bank branches, Telstra's failure to quickly repair lines, high prices and reduced choice, and so on.</para></talk.start><para>It is my sad duty to inform the House that in so far as Australia Post is concerned I come here today armed with physical evidence of Australia Post's neglect of rural communities amid its farcical claims that it takes only two working days to deliver anywhere in Western Australia. Friday, 2 July of 
 this year marked the end of airmail services to the north-west of Western Australia, leaving Broome, Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek, Wyndham and Kununurra mail runs to be delivered by road. The loss of the mail contract presents Broome Airlines with a serious financial problem, having laid out $600,000 on an undertaking 12 months earlier that they would have the mail runs for Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek. I suspect that the economic rationalists have had a hand in this decision, with a healthy bottom line being more desirable than a healthy postal service to the bush.</para><para>On a recent tour of the northern regions of my electorate, taking in Wyndham, Kununurra, Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek, Derby, Broome, Marble Bar, Tom Price, Paraburdoo, Karratha, South Hedland and Port Hedland, I was confronted at each stage with the same tale. Australia Post is taking several days, sometimes over a week, getting deliveries into and out of town. With this anecdotal evidence, my first action was to contact Australia Post's head office in Perth to find out what their story was. I was assured by Cornel Scheibling of the general manager's office in writing on 8 July of this year that the `national second working day delivery promise for standard mail delivered between capital cities and country areas in their respective states' was being achieved. In other words, my concerns were unfounded and mail was getting to its destination within two working days. Allowing for this, you could reasonably expect mail to go from Kalgoorlie to Perth in a day, as flights are available all day and it is only a six-hour drive to Perth, and then from Perth to a rural destination in no more than two days.</para><para>Unconvinced, I instigated a test mail-out to selected people in communities across the northern regions of my electorate. I sent out some 300 letters asking recipients to note the post date on the envelope, the date they received the letter and the day they returned the letter to me in the reply paid envelope I supplied them with. I have been staggered and appalled by the results. In 97.5 per cent of the returns I have received, it took Australia Post longer than two working days to deliver the mail. In the majority of instances it took at 
 least four working days, many five and six working days, and in some cases seven working days, to deliver a simple letter.</para><para>For Derby residents in the Kimberley, of the 15 replies I have received, 13 letters took four working days to get to Derby from my Kalgoorlie electorate office, the other two taking five working days and seven working days. Camel Post would take the same time! On the return leg from Derby to my office, two letters took three working days to arrive, five letters took four working days, two letters took five working days, four letters took six working days and two letters took seven working days to get back to me. That is an average of over four working days to get to Derby and an average of nearly five working days to get back to me in Kalgoorlie. Clearly this is unacceptable.</para><para>Of the 21 responses I received from Kununurra, Wyndham, Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing, also in the Kimberley, 12 letters took four working days to get through, five took five working days, one took six working days and another took three working days, while just two letters actually made it on time after two working days. While this last statistic appears to be cause for joy, I would point out that there was a weekend in between the date sent and the date received. It appears Australia Post employees worked overtime just to make par. As for the return mail to my office, seven took four working days to get back to me, nine took five working days and four took six working days. One took seven working days. That is another shocking average of over four working days to get a letter into the Kimberley and an average of five working days to get a reply.</para><para>Broome is another example where service delivery is substandard. Of the eight replies to the test mail-out I conducted, five took four working days to get through and the other three took five working days. Coming back to me, one took five days, six took six working days and one took seven working days. The average here was over four days to get to Broome and an average of six working days to get back to me. Those facts are for the Kimberley, which is the furthest region from the mail centre in Perth. You would expect, 
 given the vast distances, that, as we move south into the Pilbara, Australia Post services would improve dramatically. However, their tardiness and the inconvenience to locals does not improve.</para><para>In South Hedland and Port Hedland and then inland to Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Wittenoom, just five letters made it through in three working days, five in four working days and three in five working days. Of the 13 responses I received on the way back, three took three working days, seven took four working days, one took five working days and two took six working days. That averages out at just over four working days to get through and over four working days to come back.</para><para>Of the 20 test-run letters I received from Karratha, Wickham and Marble Bar, 17 took three working days to arrive at their destination while the other three took four working days to make it through. On the way back to my office—hallelujah!—one made it back in two working days but two took three working days to get to me, 13 took four working days, two took five working days and another two took six working days. This dismal performance averages over three working days to get to a destination and over four working days to make it back.</para><para>The almost 100 responses I have received thus far clearly demonstrate that Australia Post is not serious about its delivery standards to the bush. In fact, what I have amassed as a result of this test mail-out amounts to a shameful neglect of people whose access to and contact with the outside world is already diminished due to the tyranny of distance. Now they must contend with the tyranny of Australia Post's couldn't-care-less service standards. Whilst it preaches the values of service delivery within two days, the reality is  borne out by the evidence I have gathered which tells the real story of a mail service which simply fails to deliver in accord with commitment.</para><para>The people I represent are not unreasonable. They are the salt of the earth in every respect of that expression. It should take no more than a day for mail to get from Kalgoorlie to Perth, then two days from Perth to a rural 
 destination. I think we in the bush can just about wear that. However, the evidence I have put together makes a mockery even of this scenario, with an average of four days—all the way through five, six and even seven days—being fairly consistent. I have presented the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, with the evidence and have requested a formal review of service delivery to these rural and remote areas. In 1949 the air service from Perth to Wyndham took just 14 hours and delivered the mail. Fifty years later, it is taking four days. That, in my opinion and the opinion of my electors, is clearly not good enough and improvements will have to be made.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Marks Royal Commission</title><page.no>8129</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>8129</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</name><name.id>5V5</name.id><electorate>Perth</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to speak about the importance of a high standard in public administration of proper record keeping by agencies of the executive and about the potentially grave injustices which can be done to public administration, public policy and to individuals if record keeping is not of the highest standard. I refer to what is known as the Marks royal commission, which was appointed by the Western Australian state government—the Court Liberal state government—in 1995. A royal commission is of course an agent of the executive and not a judicial body. But the Marks royal commission and its conduct in so far as its record keeping procedures were concerned were recently the subject of comment in the District Court of Western Australia, which is of course a judicial body.</para></talk.start><para>In the course of the District Court proceedings a few weeks ago, it became clear that the former commissioner, Mr Marks QC, and counsel assisting, Ann Vanstone QC, had authorised the destruction of documents which the defence in the particular case said was relevant to their client's fair trial. So we have the spectre of a politically appointed royal commission, an agent of the executive, destroying documents which a QC in a criminal trial in the District Court says is relevant to his or her client's fair trial. And the question has been asked publicly: what possible public 
 interest consideration could the commissioner, Mr Marks, and counsel assisting, Ms Vanstone, have had in their minds when they authorised the destruction of documents which the defence subsequently said in a District Court criminal trial were relevant to a person receiving a fair trial?</para><para>In response to that question, on 30 July in a joint statement put out by Mr Marks QC, Ms Vanstone QC and Narelle Johnson QC, the three QCs said they were making a statement `regarding what they call "mischievously erroneous" press reports about destruction of royal commission records'. They said:</para><para>There was nothing unethical, unwise or out of the ordinary about decisions made on what to keep or to destroy. It is preposterous to suggest any illegality. The statement that key documents, including statements of witnesses, were destroyed is irresponsible and utterly without foundation.</para><para>The statement goes on to say:</para><para>Most of the former members of Cabinet refused to be interviewed by Commission staff at all, but some provided statements through their legal advisers. All such documents were disclosed and later retained.</para><para>The items which were destroyed, such as notes of staff, directions to investigators by counsel and reports in response were not read or even seen by the Commissioner. No documents on which the Commissioner relied was destroyed. Nor has there ever been any secret as to the categories of documents and items kept or destroyed.</para><para>It goes on to say that the commission took advice from the Solicitor-General of Western Australia on its proposed course of conduct. I have seen the advice from the Solicitor-General of Western Australia, Mr Robert Meadows, and he makes it crystal clear, as he says in his advice to the royal commission executive officer:</para><para>As I have indicated above, strictly speaking the decision to destroy documents or other materials is one for the commission.</para><para>So it is a matter for the exercise of the commission's judgment in determining that discretion. So, far from it being a matter for the Solicitor-General, it is a matter for the commission itself. Far from the assertion made in the press release of 30 July by Commissioner Marks and Ann Vanstone QC that the statement that key documents, including statements to witnesses, were destroyed is 
 `irresponsible and utterly without foundation', it became crystal clear in the course of submissions made by counsel in that District Court matter that what had been destroyed included audio tapes of witnesses when they were first approached by the royal commission officers and draft statements made by people who ended up being witnesses in criminal court proceedings.</para><para>It is very interesting to read the note for file from the royal commission's record officer, Frances McAdam, dated 15 November 1995. On this file note headed `Disposal of records', she says:</para><para>When the Royal Commission records management system was established in June 1995 a meeting was held to advise personnel of their responsibilities with regard to record keeping.</para><para>Both the Executive Officer . . . and I assumed the records were `public records' and in all communication with Commission officers it was made clear that the records would be managed in accordance with the Public Records Office standards . . .</para><para>The note then goes on to describe a meeting held on 20 October with respect to disposal of records. It then says:</para><para>Whilst I was on leave from October 23 to November 5, Ann Vanstone gave instructions for certain records (identified by her) to be destroyed and told Michael Johnson—</para><para>the executive officer—</para><para>it was her opinion that the Royal Commission was not a public office, its records are not public records, and that the State Archives should not be involved.</para><para>When I returned from leave, Michael Johnson met with me to advise the change of direction regarding disposal. I stated clearly and strongly my disagreement with the new instructions.</para><para>She then goes on to say:</para><para>I have advised Michael Johnson that I still disagree with the instruction to destroy records, and that although I will continue to perform most duties as Records Manager, I could not condone or participate in the destruction of records with SCOPR approval—</para><para>that is, the Western Australian Standing Committee on Public Records—</para><para>a process which if not illegal (which it may well be), is certainly in my opinion, unethical and unwise.  
</para><para>So the records officer sprung Royal Commissioner Marks and counsel assisting, Vanstone. Against advice, and behind the records officer's back when she was on leave, the royal commissioner and counsel assisting authorised the destruction of documents which they subsequently misrepresented in a press release on a Sunday afternoon, and which were relevant to the first contact made with people who ended up being witnesses in a criminal court trial and which went to their recollections in 1995 about events in 1992.</para><para>So, despite their press release, what could possibly have been in the royal commissioner's mind and what could possibly have been in Ann Vanstone's mind when they authorised the destruction of these documents? What documents are we talking about here? At page 415 of the transcript in the District Court on 5 July Mr Phillip Dunn QC said:</para><para>Can I ask your Honour to turn to item 17, royal commission interviews audiotapes. I have already indicated to your Honour it was a process in the royal commission as deposed to by some of the witnesses that their interviews were tape-recorded, so, "royal commission interviews and audiotape scope notes, tapes of interviews conducted by the royal commission, disposal and action DI—destroy immediately".</para><para>So interviews which were tape recorded—audio tapes, scope notes, tapes of interviews—were destroyed immediately on the instruction of Marks and Vanstone. Mr Dunn goes on:</para><para>Item number 17, "Interviews, audiotapes, tapes of interviews conducted by royal commission officers, total records of its type 10, disposal action—immediate destruction."</para><para>Mr Dunn indicates that there are 18 and 10 items in those respective categories. I understand that of the audio tape interviews—tapes of interviews conducted by royal commission officers—10 were destroyed, and that of the notes of interviews conducted by royal commission officers, 18 were destroyed on the instruction of Marks QC and Vanstone QC. I also understand that part of those materials contained audio tapes and interview transcript notes conducted with Mr Keith Wilson, who was one of the first Crown witnesses in that particular trial.</para><para>What possible public interest consideration was in Marks's and Vanstone's minds when they authorised the destruction of documents which a QC subsequently said had prejudiced his client's right to a fair trial? As Mr Dunn QC said at page 418 of the transcript:</para><para>We are deprived of the opportunity of knowing what it is that witnesses said when they were first spoken to and when they made their statements to the Marks royal commission by the actions of the royal commission.</para><para>In November 1995, this matter in very general terms was drawn to the attention of the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court. It was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  on 28 November 1995 under the heading `Easton files "part of State heritage"'. At the conclusion of this article, in which Professor Leslie Marchant says that he is concerned that all the records of the royal commission are retained, it says:</para><para>Mr Court said he was not aware of documents being destroyed but he would have the matter investigated.</para><para>That was 28 November 1995. So what inquiries did the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, initiate in respect of these documents which had been destroyed? What inquiries, if any, did he initiate? If he did not initiate any inquiries, what was he doing misleading the public of Western Australia in November 1995 by saying something to the contrary?</para><para>What possible public interest consideration could have been in the minds of Marks QC and Vanstone QC when, against the advice of the records officer, who described the conduct as `possibly illegal, certainly unethical and certainly unwise', and behind the record keeper's back, they destroyed documents relevant to a fair trial? What was the possible public interest consideration? I suppose the charitable view is that they were worried about the storage space. The conspiratorial view may well be—and I am not a card-carrying member of the conspiracy society—that this was their effort to ensure that history was written in their way. Maybe this was some long-off, conditionally subsequent conspiracy to pervert the course of justice—to ensure that someone could not get a fair trial. Maybe this was in some conspiratorial view accessory before the fact of a conspiracy to 
 pervert the course of justice by destroying documents which a QC said was relevant to a person's defence in a criminal trial.</para><para>Premier Court should answer: what did you investigate in 1995? What did you find out? If you did not investigate, why did you say that you would to the public? As well, Commissioner Marks and Vanstone QC should be asked what was in their minds when they authorised the destruction of documents relevant to a person's fair trial? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Australia: Infrastructure</title><page.no>8132</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>8132</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Since this chamber met some five weeks ago, I have taken the opportunity both to service my electorate and to take part in the House of Representatives standing committee inquiry into infrastructure problems in regional and rural areas. Having travelled some 12,000 kilometres by car in that five weeks, I have seen a lot of my electorate and, as many members would realise, it is a large one with an area of approximately 54,000 square kilometres.</para></talk.start><para>The seat of Barker is a very rural seat with nearly 22 per cent of its work force directly employed in primary industry. If you care to drive from one corner at Port MacDonnell to the western end of Kangaroo Island by the shortest route, it would take more than 700 kilometres plus a sea crossing to get to Kangaroo Island. I had the pleasure of spending part of the last weekend there, and I had many discussions with constituents.</para><para>Kangaroo Island is Australia's second-largest island, measuring approximately 150 kilometres long by 80 kilometres wide, but it supports a permanent population of only about 4,000, which means that it does not have a large enough rate base for the local government to fund meaningful infrastructure projects. There is a thriving tourist industry on Kangaroo Island which has certainly helped the local economy, which has suffered through the 10-year-long depression in the wool industry and, more recently, the discovery of Ovine Johnes disease in many sheep flocks. </para><para>What other destination can say that it attracts 40 times its own population? Kangaroo Island attracts some 160,000 visitors a year, which is 40 times its population. Thirty per cent of those visitors are international and 25 per cent are from interstate. To put that into context, imagine 160 million visitors to Sydney each year. Tourism's effect on the island means that about a third of its population receive income directly from that industry. That is the effect on the Kangaroo Island population. The island is a tourist icon for international visitors, which has implications for our economy in that overseas money is spent in Australia for Australia's benefit. But Kangaroo Island simply cannot provide the infrastructure for that tourist industry with its small population base of 4,000 people.</para><para>Kangaroo Island has a mixture of farming, small business and pristine native vegetation with wonderful wildlife, which is so attractive to the tourists—especially international tourists. The farming has largely been dependent on sheep, with some cattle and cropping, including recent diversification into vineyards, marron farming and the like. The farming land could easily lend itself to a lot more cropping, with its reliable rainfall and fertile soils, but the high cost of freight and only one ferry operation to transport goods to the mainland do not allow for expansion of the cropping industry. It is an unsubsidised ferry operation for tourists, industry, farming and residents.</para><para>If one looks at what Tasmania receives in subsidies for the very same sections of the community, one can wonder why Australia's largest island, Tasmania, does so well but the second largest, Kangaroo Island, does not. There are probably similarities with King Island, but I am sure the member for Braddon can describe them in more detail. If Kangaroo Island could have a deep seaport that allowed the direct transport of grain without the huge freight costs to get it to the mainland, it could have a thriving cropping industry which could export all over the world, bringing in more export dollars and a better balance of trade result. But of course the population of Kangaroo Island cannot fund such a port, and the state government cannot either. Kangaroo 
 Island has other infrastructure problems too. There is a need for a serviceable road network for the residents and the 160,000 tourists a year, but, again, it is not possible due to the small population with its small rate base.</para><para>So what do we do about it? A hundred years ago or more, Australian governments had a sort of colonial socialism policy of providing infrastructure for rural areas. We opened up our land with roads and bridges, and electricity in latter years, for the benefit of all Australians. We provided a healthy rural economy for a strong economic base. Sadly, in recent years—perhaps the last 20 or so—this does not seem to have been a priority of state and federal governments. Unfortunately, elections are often won and lost in the metropolitan marginal seats, which has meant successive governments have concentrated on the cities rather than the country, to everyone's detriment. I am proud to say that the Howard government is reversing that trend with our emphasis on our new tax system, which will be of great benefit to regional and rural Australia. Transport costs will go down for country people, farmers will benefit and small business will benefit.</para><para>But we can do more. The Treasurer has told this chamber that if we could sell all of Telstra, the federal government of Australia could become debt free. We have seen how the Natural Heritage Trust is providing the greatest environmental restoration program in our history as a result of the public benefit from selling part of Telstra. If we sold all of Telstra, I believe we could have a further public benefit by instituting a $1 billion a year, or more, infrastructure program for regional and rural Australia. Just think of the jobs we could provide and the growth that we could generate in our economy. This proposed national infrastructure program for special projects, over and above what we already provide, could have a sensational long-term benefit for all Australians. Just think of the irrigation potential we could provide, the ports we could build, or the bridges and tourist facilities we could provide. I believe projects such as the Snowy River scheme and the Ord River scheme have been of great benefit to all Australians. With this sort of commitment, we 
 could really guarantee a future for all Australians.</para><para>By making a commitment of at least $1 billion a year over and above what we already spend—and doing that for at least 10 years—we could ensure that special projects now seen as impossible could become a reality. There is a huge potential for irrigation projects in the northern parts of Australia, where many of our inland river systems are not utilised and simply run out to sea. It is a waste.</para><para>We have national highways that need urgent upgrading, and  there is certainly a call for a major highway from Kalgoorlie through to Alice Springs. Railways could be built or renewed for a more efficient transport system. We could provide better telecommunications systems for our people and electricity for our more remote areas. For example, in South Australia there are still many areas that do not have any power, and there are quite a few settled areas that do not have three-phase power, which stifles business development. I know of wineries that would like to have three-phase power so that they could have better motors for their wine production, but they have got only single-phase power and that restricts them.</para><para>We could provide ports, such as the ones needed at Geraldton in Western Australia and my own Kangaroo Island, which would benefit our export industries. The opportunity is there for us to guarantee a future, if we could all realise the benefit of selling all of Telstra and earmarking some of the proceeds towards infrastructure and the rest towards debt elimination. I think this is a very worthy thing to be thinking about, and I hope it is taken seriously, because a $1 billion a year scheme on top of what we already have would provide a lot of jobs, a lot of growth and a lot of necessary infrastructure for this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Women's Action Alliance Australia Inc.</title><page.no>8133</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>8133</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this grievance debate I rise to speak about a number of concerns that the Women's Action Alliance Australia Inc. has raised with me and also other equally relevant issues. 
 These concerns relate to pay equity for women, family unit taxation, child care, superannuation, evaluation of unpaid work, maternity leave and domestic violence.</para></talk.start><para>One issue raised by the alliance was a report from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling which expressed concern about the fact that a greater part of the benefits of the child-care cash rebate goes to families in the top three income groups. These findings were published in a 1996 NATSEM publication, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Child Care Subsidies: A Distribution Analysis</inline>. More recent information about the disappearance of the one income family rings alarm bells regarding the impact on choices women will have in future about paid work participation when their children are young.</para><para>Five years ago a report from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, <inline font-style="italic">The use and choice of child care</inline>, showed that, of mothers in paid work who had preschool aged children, 42 per cent said that they would prefer to remain at home with their children. Of course they would rather stay at home, but with the enormous costs of home ownership these days it is less and less likely that women will be able to stay at home with their children. Every piece of available income is needed to pay the mortgage.</para><para>Pay equity for women remains a long way from being acceptable. There have been laws passed and much education done for the community. However, those in charge of businesses remain hard to crack when it comes to meeting all the requirements of real pay equity. We have managed to make huge inroads into this issue within the Public Service employment areas but out in private land the blokes in charge resist making the needed progress. Why do they resist? What is there to fear from pay equity? I believe there is nothing to fear. We must be more vigorous in employing people on merit and paying them accordingly.</para><para>I am advised by a fact sheet from the Women's Equity Bureau that the issue of the pay equity struggle goes way back to 1907 when the federal harvester case established a basic wage for males on the basis of their breadwinning status. In 1912, in the fruit 
 pickers case, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rejected an argument that the male and female basic wage be the same. In 1919 the basic female wage was set at 54 per cent of the male basic wage. I repeat: 54 per cent.</para><para>In 1993 the Commonwealth legislated for equal remuneration orders based on ILO Convention 100. In 1996 the New South Wales parliament updated a previous definition of equal pay to `equal remuneration for men and women doing work of equal or comparable value.' I am taken by the comment from the WEB fact sheet that says:</para><para>Despite Australia's somewhat checkered pay equity history, its centralised wage fixing system since the early 1970s has produced better outcomes for women than most countries around the world. The female/male wage differential in Australia is among the smallest of the industrialised countries.</para><para>But all of this is likely to change under the AWAs being so vigorously promoted by Minister Reith. Women workers, as a matter of historical fact, will suffer most from these agreements and the moves towards real pay equity are likely to disappear more quickly than they have so slowly appeared since 1912.</para><para>We need to be more flexible in our approach to family unit taxation. We need to be able to join incomes but make allowances for the cost of running a household, be it with child care, school excursions, school costs or medical fees. It costs a great deal these days to finance a family, and the taxation system does nothing to assist families through this high cost lifestyle. We need families. We need children. We need more population. However, we ignore these families when we look at the effect of taxation upon their lifestyle.</para><para>As a nation we need to be much more understanding about the need for proper and adequate child-care facilities. In an age when more and more women are required to work and more and more women also choose to continue their careers, we need to make full provision to allow them to make full use of their undoubted talents and abilities. Child-care facilities are way up on the high priority list to be provided to enable women to attend to their careers while at the same time giving 
 them the total security of knowing that their children are safe and well cared for while they are at work.</para><para>Superannuation is an issue that really affects women. Those who may work for a period after leaving school or university and then cease while they have their families are clearly discriminated against by the treatment of their superannuation funds. They are unable to touch their money, yet it can simply be eaten up with fees and costs. When they are ready to return to their careers they are virtually back to square one with little to show in the way of superannuation assets built up in the first stage of their careers.</para><para>This issue was brought home to me recently when a constituent wrote to me and asked me to write to the Treasurer about this issue. This female constituent did not receive her guaranteed superannuation when she left her employment 5½ years ago. She contacted the Australian Taxation Office over 4½ years ago and to this day there has been no action. On 12 March this year she again contacted the ATO and, to her horror, was told that her former employer had gone into liquidation in 1998 and that her chances of recovery were nil. This constituent asks why the store where she was employed is still trading under the same business name. Where is her money and how does she get it?</para><para>Clearly, businesses do not have to pay if they do not want to, and there is absolutely nothing that can be done to protect these female employees from this gross exploitation, other than of course their union taking appropriate action. The managing director of the company that employed my constituent has started a new business venture, and one wonders if the new employees will suffer the same fate as my constituent. This is no longer acceptable, and we must begin to attack this issue as a major priority in the next few months. My constituent properly asks: what is the point of writing and passing an act if it is not worth the paper it is written on?</para><para>Domestic violence also continues to be a major issue that confronts many women in our community. It must be stated for the record that this is not an issue that is based only among the lower paid levels of our 
 community. Violence towards women is universal, whether it be physical violence or mental violence. We should insist that the issue of family relationships be a compulsory subject at school from an early age and that it be an ongoing process of education through to university. We simply must stamp out the view held by so many men that they are entitled to inflict physical or mental anguish upon the women in their lives. This violence must stop and we should offer no sympathy or defence to those who perpetrate it.</para><para>We must never underestimate the value of the unpaid work that women perform daily or the unpaid work performed by women who are in paid employment. I am confident that there are many men who attend training sessions in their employment who find it quite acceptable that they perform little if any of the tasks at home and reckon that their female workmates are simply whingers when they complain about the housework they have to do when they go home from work. Equally, I am confident that many men are totally unaware of the serious strain that is placed upon women who are not in a career but running the household smoothly and seeing to the needs of their children and their husband. Unpaid work by women needs to be evaluated and acknowledged. How one compensates women for this work is something that can clearly exercise the brilliant minds of others, but it can no longer be ignored by any of us.</para><para>Maternity leave should no longer be an issue for working women, but it clearly is. I am sure there remain partners of law firms who either do not have women partners in the business or have clauses in the partnership contract that causes the partnership to end when a woman lawyer becomes pregnant. It used to be rife, but I would hazard a guess that it is still an ongoing problem. The issue for women taking leave because of pregnancy may well arise in a serious way if Minister Reith gets his way and removes all conditions from awards, as many awards have provided maternity leave for women. As the government continues on its merry 1940s and 1950s policy road, I will not be surprised to see maternity leave as something that Minister 
 Reith will be encouraged to attack and destroy.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.32 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Funding</title><page.no>8136</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>8136</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There has been a lot of talk in recent days about the crisis in the health industry. There have been calls for inquiries by state premiers, some of whom have actively contributed to the undermining of our health system. We have yet to see a Senate inquiry into that, but we will not have to go far back to find the origins of the problem. All roads lead to Labor's mismanagement of both state and federal health. We know what the issues are. The massive decline in private health insurance membership is the single biggest contributor to the problems being faced and that lies directly at the feet of the previous government. For every decrease of one per cent of private health insurance, the public purse suffers by $83 million. Yet the Labor Party was not interested in stopping the massive haemorrhaging from private funds. We saw a drop in membership from 62 per cent in 1983 to 31 per cent at the end of the Labor term. Meanwhile, anything we have done to address that issue has met with consistent and never ending Labor opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The last Australian health care agreement delivered a record level of funding for health to the states. At the same time, we have a well-documented trend of states closing down GP outpatient services at hospitals and doing everything they can to transfer more costs to the federal government via private GPs. Of course, this practice hurts low income earners in regional areas most because in those areas GPs are less likely to bulk-bill. We have just seen the start of this trend in Queensland. The Queensland state health minister, Wendy Edmond, said in a letter to a constituent that GP outpatient services would cease. When she visited the city she tried to tell the media that the GP service was not to be abolished. In fact, she did not even know the correspondence she had signed.</para><para>Another peculiarly Labor fetish is the love of tier upon tier of bureaucracy, which acts as 
 a sponge to soak up the funding that should make its way down to the wards but does not. The size of the present bureaucracy means that the current state health minister did not even know that there was a linen service at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. In fact, they closed down the Bundaberg Base Hospital laundry, moved it to one of these labour intensive type operations—millions of dollars—at Maryborough, only to find that it did not have enough throughput to make it mechanically efficient.</para><para>I feel very passionately that we should divest control of hospitals to independent hospital boards or health councils, not with some advisory role, but with statutory authority to ensure that the money gets to where it is needed and to give a sense of ownership back to communities which those hospitals serve. Last year, under the Commonwealth health care agreements, the Commonwealth delivered an extra 19.2 per cent to the states, which rather blunts what the opposition has been saying—that we are cutting back funding to the public sector. In fact, that is one of the most generous payments to the public sector in the last two decades.</para><para>I must thank the member for Brisbane for doing some legwork for me on this issue. I note that the member for Brisbane is a Labor member and would be horrified to hear me say that. A response to a question on notice to the health minister from the member for Brisbane clearly outlines how the Goss Labor government underspent and in fact cut back on public hospital spending at a time when the federal government was spending a lot more money on public hospitals. I would encourage members to have a good look at the tables provided in the minister's reply in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 2 June. In that you will find that for the three-year period of the second term of the Goss Labor government the consecutive years of spending were $661 million, $569 million and $656 million; in other words, the figure was falling. All three figures were actually less than the figure four years earlier which was $685 million. So it fell on three different occasions, if you used the 1991-92 benchmark.</para><para>During the corresponding period, $699 million, $786 million and $812 million were spent by the Commonwealth, an increasing amount—three levels of increase. It is clearly obvious that there has been a massive fraud perpetrated on the public of Queensland. If you look at the figures further down, you will find that when the Borbidge government came to power there were massive jumps in both state and federal funding. In fact, the federal funding in the first full year of the Borbidge government was $929 million and the state government matched that with the same figure—$929 million; the following year it was $1,095 billion by the federal government and $1,041 billion by the state. That is a massive increase from where it was just five or six years earlier. So there was a miraculous turnaround in the fortunes of the public hospital sector in 1995-96 when spending by the state was $10 million more than the still rising federal contribution.</para><para>I have been criticised by members of the Beattie government for wading into the public health debate. But as long as the federal government allocates more than a billion dollars a year, as it did in 1998-99, for the state government to spend on public hospitals in Queensland, I have a right to suggest more effective ways in which that money might be spent. I also reserve the right to be outraged when that money is not spent where it should be—on patients. A classic example of this was the $1.1 million Clayton's rescue package which was supposed to go to the Bundaberg Base Hospital. The hospital was left $1.1 million short. Wendy Edmond, the state health minister, announced a rescue package of $1 million—very generous—but she failed to tell us that $200,000 of that had been redirected from the mental health budget in Bundaberg. She sidelined the remaining $800,000 to an elective surgery budget and demanded that $700,000 be returned because it had not been spent. So $800,000 was notionally given and $700,000 was returned, leaving a net $100,000. These are the smoke and mirror tricks at which the state Labor government in Queensland has become adept. I will continue, regardless of the attitude of the state member for Bundaberg, to look into these matters.</para><para>I was a member of the Bundaberg Base Hospital board for 15 years. During that time, in the days of the Bjelke-Petersen and Ahern governments, I saw some real progress. But in the 6½ years after Labor came into power we saw everything grind to a halt. At the time that we left the board, which was in the first year of the Labor government, we had planned a four-storey ward block which was to contain a CSSD unit, operating theatres, a million dollar laundry and wards. In 6½ years nothing happened. At the time we left office, that project was ready to go. Every time a health minister came to town, there was a sense of outrage. What the Labor Party would do then was promise an increasing amount. At the start the amount was to be $18.1 million and then it was increased to $25 million. But it was only when Mike Horan became the state health minister of the Borbidge government that the building was started.</para><para>On behalf of the people of Bundaberg I say that I have every right to speak on health matters. Whether it pleases the member for Bundaberg or any other state Labor member, as long as we are putting half the funding into the Queensland hospitals, I intend to continue to speak.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT TO BILLS</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>8137</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages received from the Governor-General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills:</para><para> Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000

The pity is by how much it falls short of the democratic ideals with which our Constitution was first framed at the end of last century. If this Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill passes, and no doubt it will, we are setting the groundwork for a referendum that offers the vast majority of people no choice at all. It is based on a model that does not represent public opinion, nor does it represent any expression of majority will. Polls consistently show that 70 per cent of the electorate want a directly elected President. They want a model that makes that possible. This model does not make that possible. Rather than strengthen the separation of powers, this model destroys the separation of powers. It neuters the role of the President and leaves the dominant party of the day in total control of the political processes, while major party support in the electorate continues to erode.</para></talk.start><para>There is just no-one or nothing to check on executive government in this model. While painted as minimalist, the model is in fact radical. It does change the current system dramatically by embodying the right of instant dismissal of the President by the Prime Minister of the day. The Prime Minister need pay no attention at all to the President under this political establishment model. If Gough Whitlam could have dismissed Governor-General John Kerr he would have. This model will ensure the PM of the day will be able to take such a course of action. The Prime Minister becomes not only de facto but also essentially the head of state. The President should have the power to call for a general election at a time of constitutional crisis or when a government lacks support.</para><para>It is interesting to note the publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">Discovering democracy</inline> distributed 
 recently by the government. How ironic that we are debating this undemocratic model as the government, no doubt with Labor endorsement, peddles information about our wonderful democratic model. On page 45 there are details about how important American founders regarded the separate election of the President. It says:</para><para>The American founders believed all governments tended to threaten liberty.</para><para>It goes on to say how the American constitutional drafters believed that `power must be dispersed. No one group or individual could then capture all the centres of power and each power centre would keep the others in check'. The American founding fathers were right when fearing that the placing of the executive and legislature together would threaten democracy.	 According to our founding fathers, by placing the executive in parliament the ministers were responsible to parliament and if ever they threatened citizens' rights, the parliament, elected by the people, would control them. Unfortunately, the founding fathers did not count on the discipline, the arrogance and the undemocratic nature of the political party process, with its adversarial two-sided debate and its one-sided executive dominance, reinforced by the winner-take-all, illegitimate, mandate argument. It is interesting that Manning Clark described our very first constitutional convention thus:</para><para>It was for the most part the big men of the established political and economic order, the men of property or their trusted allies who moulded the Federal Constitution Bill.</para><para>Not much has changed. That 1890s process can well describe the setting up of this most recent Constitutional Convention, with one addition: half the delegates to the 1998 Convention were appointed, to all intents and purposes, by the government. We did correct the absence of youth, Aborigines and women, but the appointed delegates succeeded in swinging the Convention towards the conservative model favoured by the Prime Minister and away from the people's choice. Let us not forget just 73 delegates, less than half the 1998 Convention, voted yes to the so-called bipartisan appointment model. Bipartisan says it all. The <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline>  defines bipartisan as `of or involving two (esp. political) 
 parties'. We had 73 yes votes, 57 no votes and 22 abstentions. Despite the model not gaining support of an absolute majority, or 77 of the delegates, the question was declared carried as more people had voted yes than no—more people from a Convention deliberately designed to achieve an outcome contrary to public will.</para><para>That will represents the greatest challenge yet to the power of the parties and the power of the executive. The Labor Party, bruised by history as it is, knowing that it might get back into power one day, has supported that model, knowing that it isolates the President from any role in the political process. The High Court recently ruled that we are independent. But to enshrine that independence we must have a republic model that is truly democratic and representative. Should this referendum be lost—and I hope that is the case—then the will of 70 per cent of people will cry out to be properly represented by a proper model. This cleverly camouflaged republic model will, I hope, fool no-one. Those nervous nellies who say, `You must vote for this imperfect model. It is the only chance we have,' are falling into this major party-establishment trap. There is absolutely no imperative to reach republic status by the year 2001 save for the symbolism of doing it for the start of the new millennium.</para><para>A former eminent member of this place, Sir James Killen, who does not support any republican model, says that this proposed legislation means the President `would be very much a tool in the hands of the Prime Minister of the day'. ARM Chairman Malcolm Turnbull said in the same debate in which Sir James spoke that this model was a `minor and substantial' change. In saying that, he inadvertently gave the game away. The substantial changes are being camouflaged by the minimalist rhetoric. True democrats are not fooled.</para><para>The public participation in this republic model is illusory. While it allows any Australian to nominate someone for President, it is a Clayton's nomination process, something which exists in name only. The committee of 32 which nominates the eventual candidate is appointed by the Prime Minister of the day. 
 The report of that committee, containing the short list of nominees, need not be tabled in parliament and thus would not be open to public scrutiny.</para><para>Former conservative Attorney-General Bob Ellicott believes that the consultative committee process will throw up compromise candidates. Tellingly, he says that if they represent the people's choice it will be by accident, because the committee, with a large component of government nominees and politicians, is unlikely to be representative of ordinary Australians. Mr Ellicott is spot-on when he derides the Republican Movement members who say, `Support this model and change it later.' He quite rightly points out that `this is a reckless and irresponsible approach to basic constitutional reform'. He says that `the likelihood of it being changed, if adopted, is quite remote as anybody who has any experience or in-depth knowledge of constitutional amendments in this country should know'. But if we introduce the kinds of amendments we know the people want—that is, direct election of a President—then people will be far more likely to support it, knowing that it is about lessening rather than strengthening executive power.</para><para>Those who argue how unlikely is the passage of referenda in this country should look closely at the reasons why. I would suggest it is all about the well-founded suspicion and fear of government and executive dominance. The direct election presidential model would in fact appease those suspicions and fears.</para><para>This bill will almost certainly be passed. On 6 November, a referendum will be held posing a question that will be rejected if public opinion polling accurately reflects the mood of the Australian people. Those people know that this model is not about shifting the portrait of Sir William Deane from one place on the wall to another and simply rebadging the brass plaque. They know it is about reducing that portrait by more than half and that the title `President' will always be embraced by inverted commas. It would be a republic in name only. If the Prime Minister's motion for appointment of a President were not approved, the Prime Minister of the day 
 could leave the position vacant. The Prime Minister could keep a compliant President in office and ensure compliance by offers of continuation in office.</para><para>No grounds are specified for removal of a President by the Prime Minister. There is no provision for the grounds for dismissal to be made public. There is no provision for both houses to be recalled should a dismissal occur. There are no provisions to cover any lack of support from the House of Representatives for the dismissal of a President. Any acting presidents could be dismissed by serial dismissal notices. The Prime Minister would be sole judge of any incapacity on the part of a President. The royal prerogative would be fixed in the Constitution and monarchical powers would in effect transfer to the Prime Minister, the people nowhere to be seen.</para><para> Under the  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  to be introduced in parallel to this bill, the Prime Minister would have exclusive control over nominations to the Nominations Committee, apart from party or state nominees who would effectively be controlled by the majority parties in the state lower houses. The Prime Minister would in fact have the numbers on the committee, even without his or her own party supporters, by appointing the non-politician members who would make up half the membership and by appointing the convenor who would have a casting vote. Only lower houses of state parliaments would nominate state members, thus ensuring state governments controlled nominations and excluded minority parties and independents represented largely in upper houses but in both houses.</para><para>The Prime Minister would have virtually complete control over the terms and conditions of appointment to the Nominations Committee. Under clauses 13 and 15 the Prime Minister could manipulate vacancies and dispose of unfavourable members of the committee. Under part 5 the nomination process would be entirely secret, with the public—remember them?—having absolutely no way of judging whether the best nominee has been chosen by the Prime Minister.</para><para> This  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999  should be opposed 
 because it sets up a referendum that is inherently undemocratic in not posing the question people want. Ian Ireland and Joanna Longley of the research services of this parliament have quite clearly stated in their paper how the dismissal process alone in this bill is `the only model which does not provide a ground or grounds for dismissal or require that reasons be given. Moreover, there is no other precedent among republic dismissal models for prime ministerial removal of the President'. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, quite firmly believes that this model, the offspring of a non-democratic process, would increase the unhealthy concentration of power in the Prime Minister. He says that the `provision of constitutional safeguards is quintessentially republican. A country without safeguards is no republic'.</para><para> In a republic the power of the monarchy must be substituted by the power of the people. The head of state must be the representative of the people, not the representative of one or either side. As most of those in this debate keep saying, there are not two sides, there are many sides now representing the increasing plurality of the Australian electorate.</para><para>The real debate we should be having is one leading to a plebiscite or referendum—and I would prefer the plebiscite option—of whether or not people wish to break our links with the monarchy. We should have had such a plebiscite before any convention. Only after such an indication from the people can we have a proper debate—without the current divisiveness, the obfuscation and the complete hiding of the true germ and kernel of what people want—on constitutional reform, not this attempt to graft an unwanted and far inferior substitution for the Governor-General onto a rickety Constitution in need of wholesale reform.</para><para> The Leader of the Opposition in his contribution urged direct election advocates to not oppose this model. He spoke of the reluctance of the parties to put this matter on the agenda again if this referendum fails. What if the people out there want it on the agenda? And they will. It will not go away. He spoke of national humiliation if this referendum is lost. 
 He spoke of how infinitely harder it would be to bring about constitutional change should the people say no. In all of this, there was very little, if any, mention of the express will of the people for a directly elected President. If we do have in our parliamentary ranks direct election advocates on both sides of the House, then it will take but a properly constituted convention to design a model approved by the people—one that codifies the power of the President and one that codifies the proper powers of any Prime Minister.</para><para> Under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, only those members who oppose the legislation setting up such a referendum can contribute to the official no case against the question distributed by the Australian Electoral Commission. I call on the member for Flinders, who has been so vocal on the direct election model, to join me in voting against this bill so that his arguments can be included in the official no case. I also call on those direct election supporters hidden in the ranks of both government and opposition to throw off their party shackles and begin the process towards a true republic by voting against this flawed and inherently deceitful referendum bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>8142</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILLIAMS</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—in reply—The government has put before the parliament two bills: the <inline ref="r841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999</inline>  and the <inline ref="r839">Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999</inline> . They give expression to the Constitutional Convention's model for an Australian republic. In drafting the bills, the government's aim has been to present the people of Australia with a safe, workable proposal for a republic that continues our tradition of stable parliamentary democracy. This proposal would not dramatically change the way our system of national government operates. The object of the bills is to give Australia an Australian President who can fit effectively into our current arrangements in place of the Queen and her representative in Australia, the Governor-General.</para></talk.start><para>I thank members in the debate so far who have considered the government's referendum proposal on its merits and contributed accord 
 ingly. We should remember that the tone of the debate in the Commonwealth parliament will affect the tone—perhaps even set the tone—of the ensuing debate in the broader community. A constructive debate is essential if we want to produce the best possible legislation and the best possible proposal to put to the Australian people at the referendum.</para><para>The proposal set out in the republic bill must be one that can be supported by those who support change, but it must also be one that those who do not support change—both within the government and elsewhere—can support as a reasonable proposal to put to the Australian people at a referendum. The statement by the Leader of the Opposition that his party will cooperate with the government in producing the best possible bill is very welcome, as are the acknowledgments by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton that the republic bill is a faithful reflection of the outcome of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. It is an indication of the constructive approach that has been adopted that members such as those for Bradfield, Calwell, Chifley, Kooyong and the Northern Territory, who represent a diverse range of views on the question of a republic, can all support the passage of the republic bill and its presentation to the people at a referendum.</para><para>The bills have been the subject of close scrutiny by the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum. The government welcomes the committee's report. On behalf of the government, I congratulate the chairman, deputy chairman and other members of the committee for completing a challenging inquiry in such a short time. At the outset, the chairman identified three broad objectives. The first was to determine whether the bills reflected the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. The second was to determine whether, if a republic were approved at the referendum, the proposals set out in the bills would be effective and safe. The third objective was to give the Australian people the opportunity to have a say on the bills. With this third objective clearly in mind, the committee engaged in an extended series 
 of public hearings to collect evidence on the bills.</para><para>The committee did not limit itself to the capital cities. As the chairman indicated in the final hearing in Canberra at the end of July, the committee well and truly covered Australia. It took evidence in Canberra, Adelaide, Brisbane, Broome, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, Sydney and Townsville. Between the government's own extensive consultation through the exposure draft process and the officials committee of the Council of Australian Governments and the joint select committee's wide consultation, the government and the parliament have ensured that the referendum legislation has been subject to rigorous scrutiny at many different levels across Australia.</para><para>The government welcomes the findings of the majority of the joint select committee. The majority found that generally the bills faithfully reflect the resolutions of the Constitutional Convention. The government has also noted the brief dissenting reports which addressed particular elements of the majority report or aspects of the convention model. The fact is that the bills have together attracted strong support from a range of eminent commentators as a fair and effective legislative expression of the convention model.</para><para>However, the majority of the committee has recommended that consideration be given to some modifications. The committee's recommendation on the long title has been noted and the Prime Minister has announced that the government will move to replace the current long title with one which represents clearly and simply the essential purpose and outcome of the referendum proposal. The government believes that it has taken account of the committee's recommendation. Accordingly, I will be moving a motion to amend the long title in the consideration in detail stage of the bill. The government will consider the committee's other recommendations and any related proposals for amendment of the bills and will provide its response to these recommendations shortly. Any further amendments that are proposed by the government will be moved in the Senate.</para><para>The  Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999  is not a bill for a constitutional amendment but a bill for an ordinary Commonwealth act. As has been discussed, it provides in more detail for the establishment and role of the nominations committee and, in doing so, it fleshes out the very broad outline provided by the Constitutional Convention for the process of community consultation and evaluation of nominations. This bill does not have to be approved at the referendum and the government does not propose that this bill be passed before the outcome of the referendum is known. Accordingly, the government proposes that the bill not go forward to a third reading or to the Senate at this stage. Of course, this would not prevent the government, in the light of the joint select committee's report, giving undertakings to amend the nominations committee bill in the event that the republic bill is approved at the referendum. The government would propose that the nominations committee bill, with any amendments, go forward to a third reading and then to the Senate only if the republic bill is approved.</para><para>This referendum will be unusual in that government members will not necessarily support the referendum proposal once it has been passed by the parliament. It is a matter of public record that government members will be allowed a conscience vote in the referendum. Some members are likely to vote for change and others against it. This means that government members must be given an opportunity to participate in the formulation of the official or parliamentary no case as well as the official yes case.</para><para>Under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, only those members who vote for the republic bill as it goes through the parliament can participate in the formulation of the official 2,000-word yes case. Only those who vote against the bill can participate in the formulation of the official 2,000-word no case. In order that government members may participate in the no case, the government will be making arrangements to ensure that some of its members vote against the republic bill at the relevant time. These arrangements are simply part of the 
 government's broader plan to ensure that government members may participate in the debate as their conscience dictates and to ensure that both sides of the debate are put to the people when they vote on the referendum proposal in November.</para><para>The government has not wavered in its commitment to put the convention model for a republic to the people. The republic bill sets out a model which, unlike others such as the direct election model, is not designed to fundamentally alter the balance of our constitutional arrangements. It is, as I have said, intended to present the people of Australia with a safe and workable proposal for a republic that continues our tradition of stable parliamentary democracy. Government members will be allowed a conscience vote in the referendum. As I have indicated, some members are likely to vote for change and others against it, but the government is united in its commitment to let the Australian people decide whether Australia is to be a republic.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration in Detail</title><page.no>8144</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>8144</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Title, page 1 (lines 1-5), omit the title, substitute</para><para>"A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President".</para><para>That is an amendment to the long title of the <inline ref="r841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999</inline>  and would be the question which would, were it to be successful through all stages, be placed before the Australian people.

The answer to this was given quite nicely by one of the government members on the joint committee when he said, `The question here, phrased in this way, relates to the outcome of the successful vote as opposed to a process.' I thought that was a very nice way to put it. If you are going to incorporate process, which is essentially what the government's proposition does, then an honest presentation of that would present a total process. The government's proposition as announced by the Prime Minister today is `an act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority,' et cetera.</para><para>A couple of points need to be made about this immediately. In the first case, it does not have the qualification on the President of an Australian President. That is a very important qualification. The Queen of Australia is manifestly not an Australian. The Governor-General need not be an Australian.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">SLIPPER</name><name role="display">Mr Slipper</name></talker><para>—But he always is.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>—No, he is not. Indeed, for much of our history the Governor-General has not been an Australian. But the point of such a change would be `an Australian President' and the Australian President would have to be an Australian. It is a relevant definitional change if you want, as the Prime Minister says, this to be an accurate reflection of the process that is taking place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second point is that, if you are going to talk about the two-thirds majority and incorporate that in the question, it ought to be 
 preceded by the fact that there is public consultation on nomination followed by agreement between the government and the opposition on the presentation of a name and then approval of that proposition by two-thirds of the members of the Commonwealth parliament. Of course, the question that properly reflected that would amount to at least the paragraph of an essay. But if your defence of the government's proposition is that you need to be clear on process and not simply on outcome, then being clear on process requires integrity and honesty in presentation—and this does not have integrity and honesty in presentation. Therefore, let us go to outcomes.</para><para>It is no good for the Prime Minister to try to sneak this one through; he will subsequently live with the consequences of that if he is successful in getting its defeat. It will be a hollow victory because the Australian people now are determined that they will have an Australian head of state. They may not yet agree on process, but what has been offered in this particular bill is a safe outcome, a safe process, to achieve what is the fundamental change—the establishment of an Australian republic with an Australian head of state. With this proposition, every Australian kid can aspire to be our head of state. It will not be determined by the operations of a hereditary principle in another country; it will be determined by a decision by the Australian people. This recommendation will greatly assist that process. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>8145</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is important for me to speak in this discussion in detail of the <inline ref="r841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999</inline>  because, under the convention that applies, ministers may not speak in the second reading debate on bills that are introduced by another minister.

When the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was sacked by the Governor-General, the Queen was powerless to do anything about it. That is a set of facts, and that indeed makes the Governor-General the de facto head of state in this country. Her Majesty the Queen is a very good mechanism by which we appoint an apolitical head of state and, indeed, we have a head of state who does not have a mandate for anything in particular.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point at issue here is whether we want to swap our apolitical head of state and a system that serves us well where no individual or group of individuals can usurp power, where no Prime Minister can go outside the Constitution—as the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, attempted to do—and where no Prime Minister can indeed usurp power that is not constitutionally given. This is a very important issue for us to debate.</para><para>The proposal at issue is one that would give an elected President. The word in the referendum to go to the people is the word `appointed', but the appointment is the result of the election by two-thirds of the members of parliament—which presumes of course that there must always be a strong two-party preferred system, because otherwise you could not guarantee the numbers. That will not go down terribly well with the minority parties and those who aspire to representation. Nonetheless, the basis of the proposal is an elected President. Just as President Clinton is elected by a college of votes, not by the American people, the college that would be formed here is the college of the parliament, which would elect that presidential person. Nobody is going to be put up by any individual, someone from the general public at large or by someone more influential, unless they stand for something—anything but something. Once some 
 body says, `Choose me because I stand for this,' you start to have a mandate, you have a person chosen because of what they stand for, and they are seeking office because they say they are a good person. When that endorsement is given, you then have a competition between the President, as that person would be, and the Prime Minister.</para><para>You are all well aware that in our current Constitution there is no mention of a Prime Minister, and yet under the proposals we would have a President who would in fact be a person who would bring about a total change in the way our system operates.

While the Minister for Aged Care was speaking I had cause to put my hand into my pocket and pull out a coin—and, lo and behold, on that coin is the image of Queen Elizabeth; it is not the image of Sir William Deane. All Australians know that that representation is, for all intents and purposes, as the Constitution says in section 2, our head of 
 state. The dilemma that we as Australians have is that two-thirds of Australians regard the monarchy as now being irrelevant to modern Australian life—to such a point that we will not be having either the Queen or the Governor-General opening the Australian Olympics. The ambiguity has caused us international embarrassment. According to the Prime Minister's edict, we are having the Prime Minister opening our Olympic Games—a partisan politician, a politician indeed supported by less than 50 per cent of the voters. So instead of having a unifying figure representing us to the rest of the world we will have a partisan political figure because of this ambiguity, this refusal to acknowledge the issue that needs clarifying in this referendum.</para></talk.start><para>But we are proposing this change to the question because the current title is poor, indeed misleading. The amendment that the government will be proposing leaves that misleading indication. It is misleading because it is asking Australians to back a one-legged horse. It is asking them to back a horse on which the only thing visible is the final step in the outcome—that is, the affirmation, as the bill reads, by a two-thirds majority of the parliament, of a necessary prior procedure. That necessary prior procedure is threefold—to make the other legs of the horse.</para><para>Firstly, the President must be, for the first time, as specified in the Constitution, an Australian citizen—hence there would have to be an Australian President. Any child born after 6 November could aspire to become the Australian head of state. That is the first leg. The second leg is, for the very first time, the involvement of the community in the selection of the head of state. At the current time there is absolutely no involvement. One person, the Prime Minister, determines who is our Governor-General. For the very first time Australians will be able to nominate the person they want to be head of state. Indeed, the community will have a say in who is proposed, what short list of notable Australians is going to be a proposed to the Prime Minister from whom he will select in practice the presidential nominee. That person, far from being a politician, will have to be above 
 politics. Why? Because the nomination has to be seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. Clearly, the Leader of the Opposition is not going to second the nomination of a party political figure, so Australians are going to get a President who is above politics, a person who is acceptable to all sides of politics, who can act as a unifying force. That is the second step.</para><para>It is only after those steps are taken—the Australian citizen, the community involvement in the nomination process and the dual nomination by the Prime Minister—that those preconditions lead to the fourth and final step, and that is the affirmation by two-thirds of the parliament. It is not two-thirds of the House of Representatives but two-thirds of the parliament, being members elected directly by their constituents, as we are in the House, and senators elected by proportional representation with the minor parties being represented. You could not have a more democratic body representing the Australian people. It acts as a final check, if you like, but not as the selector. It acts as a final check on a person who comes through that procedure. That is a great improvement on what we have today. It is an improvement that is going to involve all Australians in the process. It is going to enable all Australians to identify who they regard as Australia's most notable and indeed best citizens. The person will have to be above politics and will have to have the approval of two-thirds of the elected representatives before they are selected as President. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>8147</page.no><name role="metadata">Abbott, Tony MP</name><name role="display">Mr ABBOTT</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id><electorate>Warringah</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Employment Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise briefly to congratulate the Prime Minister, the cabinet and the government on the proposed wording of the question to go to the people on 6 November. In light of the comments earlier of the Leader of the Opposition, without betraying the confidence of the party room, I should point out that Bob Charles, the chairman of that bipartisan committee, said very clearly that, in the light of the discussion, he supported the position that the government had taken, and there was no coalition member of that committee who dissented from that in the party room.</para></talk.start><para>As anyone who has followed this debate knows, I support the existing Australian Constitution, including the Crown, not because I think it is perfect but because I think it is better than all the alternatives. It is my strong view that a system which has stood the test of time, which has served Australia well through all the challenges of the century, is worthy of respect. Certainly it deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt. Republicans have placed this issue on the national agenda and therefore this debate is the debate we had to have, and 6 November is the vote we have to have to resolve this issue, if not for all time then certainly for our time.</para><para>I will be voting no on 6 November, but obviously this is going to be a vote unlike almost any other. Many people will be voting no for many different reasons: some because they support the existing system, including the Crown; some because they see no alternative which is preferable to the existing system; and some, such as the member for Calare, because they see a better alternative to that which is on offer on 6 November. Some people will be voting yes for very different reasons: some because they support the alternative on offer; some because they would support any alternative to the existing system; and some because they fear an even worse alternative. But it is absolutely vital that this issue be put to the people, and that is why both republicans and anti-republicans will be voting in favour of this bill—not because they necessarily support it but because they support the bill going to the people. I guess the final paradox of this debate is that it is necessary for some people to prepare the no case, and that means voting against the bill even though they support the bill being put to the people. I intend to vote no on the third reading for that reason.</para><para>Finally, I say that this is a special moment in the life of the parliament. We are either preparing for historic change or else preparing for a moment when Australia triumphantly reaffirms the system which has helped to make us, in my opinion, the freest, the fairest and the most prosperous country on earth.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>8148</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition because it mirrors the 
 unanimous recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum in deliberation, on which I was pleased to serve as a member. It seems to me to be a little sad that the government cannot embrace the whole concept of having a republic. No-one doubts the Prime Minister's position about being a monarchist, but in looking at the fact that we are going into a new century, a new millennium, 100 years of Federation, and we will still be lock-step with something which has outlived its usefulness, it is a pity that he could not have said, `Look, I am a monarchist, but I ask people to understand that I now support a referendum and I now support a republic as we go into the new millennium.' I find that a little disappointing. Others might not find it disappointing.</para></talk.start><para>The committee had deliberated on adding some further words that do not appear in its recommendation—that the President would have the same powers as the Governor-General. The difficulty with that was that in evidence monarchists believed that, because a Prime Minister can no longer appoint a chauffeur as a Governor-General—that is, that there is a nomination process where citizens can recommend people to be considered for President, the committee considers a short list and from that short list both the Prime Minister and presumably the Leader of the Opposition will agree to bring forward one name—the nomination process really does change the power. Learned witnesses before the committee said no, that was not the case. But, as I say, monarchists argued that that change in the procedure, plus the change to the dismissal procedure, had an impact on the powers of the President and so you could say `similar' but not `the same', and in the end we dropped that out.</para><para>I mention this because I think there is a natural tension in the long title between wanting to put in as much as you can to give an idea of what is happening and keeping it simple so that the vast majority of Australians would understand the process. For example, is the two-thirds appointment part of the nomination process the key element or is it the fact that every Australian in the future, if this were to be accepted, would have the right 
 to nominate who might be considered to be a President of Australia? As I say, there would be a whole process to that.</para><para>At the moment there is absolutely no process—this was confirmed by Malcolm Fraser. There is no process; a Prime Minister does not even have to take it to cabinet for approval. It is not even an under the line cabinet decision; it is just an announcement by the Prime Minister. As I say, I do not think any Prime Minister of any persuasion would appoint his chauffeur but there is absolutely nothing at the moment to stop a Prime Minister appointing his chauffeur to be Governor-General. We are changing that. We are actually putting some safeguards into it. We are actually putting some democracy into the process, yet people object to it. I find that very sad.</para><para>I want to reiterate that, as for the committee deliberations, I have respect for all the members of the committee who participated in the inquiry, particularly those who turned up to consider the chairman's draft report. It is a fact that every person there, whether they were Labor or Liberal or National, all agreed unanimously that this was the best long title to take to the Australian people. If the committee system is to mean anything, it behoves the government to explain why they think a bipartisan committee process should be overturned.</para><para>I think the long title is simple. It focuses on the key elements of the change. People will appreciate its simplicity and its relative brevity and it does not wish to disguise in any way the changes that would be made. In fact, I say again: why have the two-thirds appointment process in there and not the reference to the nominations committee or the dismissal procedures? And then you would get something that is probably about 80 words long.

Edmund Burke, the father of conservative thought, supported the concept of organic change where defence of the status quo was no longer feasible. As Conor Cruise O'Brien has stated in his 1992 biography of Burke and in his 1997 National Review lecture with regard to an American republic, initially, from 1765 to 1775, Burke opposed American independence through such measures as the repeal of the Stamp Act. But from 1778 on he supported an American republic. That is the Burkean tradition—organic change when the status quo is no longer viable. Similarly, with independence for Ireland, O'Brien believes that Burke would have supported the recognition of the independence of Ireland, but he opposed a French republic.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Australian historian John Hirst first outlined the argument in <inline font-style="italic">Quadrant</inline> in 1991 that there are good conservative reasons for supporting a minimal republic. Put simply, Hirst argued that the Queen no longer occupied the central role in civic life that she played 40 years ago or even 20 years ago. To argue about whether the Governor-General or the Queen is Australia's head of state resembles theological arguments about how many angels you can fit on the head of a pin. If the Queen is not Australia's head of state, why is she on the $5 note?</para><para>When the Australian colonies were granted self-government in the 19th century, it was argued that it was not necessary to replicate exactly the Westminster model as the Australians could be relied on, as British citizens, to adopt a similar form of government. The same argument, without those politically incorrect overtones, still applies today. There are any number of plausible arguments that we can run against any model of government but what we should bear in mind is that Australia has a democratic tradition almost 150 years old and that it is the behaviour and 
 the respect for rules and conventions which underpin our stable democratic tradition. In other words, it is not so much the structure as the behaviour of the participants which underpins our stable tradition.</para><para>The Constitution in 1901 and the Constitution in practice today are vastly different but most of the change has been evolutionary. Most of the change has occurred without referenda. It has occurred through legislative change, changes in the conventions and changes in the common law. Australia has evolved from the position of a dominion, through things like the Balfour Declaration in 1926, the Statute of Westminster in 1931—adopted in Australia in 1942—and the Australia Acts of 1975 and 1986, to a point where we are now, to all intents and purposes, a federal republic. We do have a republican form of government—Brian Galligan has called it `a federal republic'. But we are a crowned republic. It is almost like Barataria in Gilbert and Sullivan's <inline font-style="italic">Gondoliers </inline>in that we are a `monarchy tempered with republican equality'.</para><para>So the argument for 6 November is essentially about repatriating the appointment process. There are arguments saying the Governor-General is Australia's head of state—and he does wield those powers. But the true de jure head of state is the Queen of Australia and this is about repatriating the appointment of the person who wields those powers.</para><para>On 2 March 1996 the coalition government was elected and within a week the ministry was sworn in. The Prime Minister is not mentioned in the Constitution. How we handle transfers of government is not codified in the Constitution. Yet it all occurred without the parliament meeting. It occurred because of the respect for convention and the respect for democratic tradition. By contrast, tonight in Russia Boris Yeltsin dismissed his fourth Prime Minister. It would be misleading to suggest that Australia, by moving to a republic, will adopt this sort of behaviour. Rather than being defined by the written Constitution, our stability is circumscribed by the conventions and our respect for them. They will continue under a republic. I support the 
 government's position. I will support a yes vote on 6 November.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>8150</page.no><name role="metadata">Roxon, Nicola, MP</name><name role="display">Ms ROXON</name><name.id>83K</name.id><electorate>Gellibrand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a very funny world that we are in up here, isn't it!

Although the Queen is the Queen of Britain, there is some concept that she can be the Queen of Australia and, when she is the Queen of Australia, she is a different person from when she is the Queen of Britain. I love this. We had a fantastic witness in Melbourne who was an old cricketer, English born, who had become an Australian citizen and played for Australia against England. He said, `Look, it just doesn't make sense to me that the Queen of Britain can be the Queen of Australia. It is like saying that the English cricket captain can be the Australian cricket captain when they are playing in Australia. It just doesn't make sense that they can bat for both teams.' I thought that that was very persuasive.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is very unfair to say that we cannot refer to this change as one that converts us to a republic with an Australian President because, if we say that, we have to say that we have an Australian Governor-General and we have the Queen in right of Australia.

It is the right of those on the other side to not agree with me but I wish that they were prepared to argue this on the facts rather than the scaremongering that has been going on.</para><para>I also would like to ask the Prime Minister, when he is determined to have the process of the nomination and final approval by the two-thirds majority of the parliament, what he thinks is the most important step in becoming elected as a Prime Minister of this country. What would he describe as the most important step? Is it when the party room supports him? Probably in his seat it might be when his pre-selectors support him. Is it when he is elected by the people in his electorate? Or is it when he gets sworn in by the Governor-General? Unless we are going to use the comparable process for this President, we should not put part of the nomination process in and leave the other part out. It is quite misleading. I think that the Prime Minister really needs to look at his own position. What is important? When the community elects him? When there is a public nomination process? When he gets sworn in?

Firstly, there is the appointment mechanism, and then there is the dismissal mechanism for the President. There is the question of the powers of the President, and there is the question as to whether those powers are justiciable or not. We also have to consider the question of the conventions of constitutional monarchy and whether or not they will survive in a republic. We have to look at whether, with the Keating-Turnbull republican model, which is the only republican model on offer, we will have the checks and balances in Australia which we have had since 1901, and which, through its unique genius, denies too much power to any individual.</para><para>I oppose the proposal being put by the Leader of the Opposition. I very strongly support the mechanism that the Prime Minister has put in place, and I also intend to back the amendment which will be moved by the Attorney-General that will indicate quite clearly the substance of the question which will be before the Australian people on 6 November. The republic, which the people of Australia will have the opportunity to vote for or against, will be a republic where the President is appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament.</para><para>Every opinion poll which has been published in Australia shows that if Australia is to become a republic then the people want to have a say.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>0V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Slipper, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SLIPPER</name></talker><para>—And yet the chardonnay socialists opposite—the Bollinger Bolsheviks opposite—want to exclude the people of Australia from having any say in who should be Australia's President. The onus is on those who advocate change to make sure that change is better than the system which we now have.

 Australia's Westminster system while bringing about change as we move into the next century.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to stress that I am someone who did stand on the sidelines for some time. I looked at the proposals of the Keating republican advisory committee. I waited to be convinced. I was interested in what was on offer, and I have to say that those people who advocate the change which the Labor Party wants are asking us to simply chart a course into the unknown. They are asking us to accept a republic where the President's powers are not defined, where the President's powers are non-justiciable, and where the President's powers at the end of the day will be what he chooses them to be, and we cannot restrain him in any way, shape or form. We are asked to give the President virtually unfettered power to appoint a Prime Minister from outside the parliament. Such a Prime Minister, of course, would in due course have to find a seat in the parliament, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility that, if he or she could not, the President could then indeed appoint someone else from outside the parliament to be Prime Minister.</para><para>The reason I highlight just a few of these problems is to indicate that the model on offer is fatally flawed. Whether you think Australia should or should not become a republic, the model which the people of Australia have to vote for or against on 6 November is substantially inferior to the system of government which we have—a system of government which has made Australia one of the greatest democracies in the world. I am proud of Australia. I think we ought to reject the Keating-Turnbull model. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>8152</page.no><name role="metadata">Danby, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DANBY</name><name.id>WF6</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the Australian public, the key recommendation of this report is in its long title.

We will allow all clubs such as the Royal Canberra Golf Club and the Royal Sandringham Yacht Club to keep their royal prefixes if they so desire. Every scare tactic of the constitutional monarchists opposite was dealt with. In particular, we dealt with the scare tactic of the dismissal of the President and the unfettered powers that the previous speaker suggested that he would have. This is absolute nonsense, and it is best outlined in the testimony of your former conservative Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. If you had the time to read the testimony of Mr Fraser, you would see that he said very simply that the power of the President as outlined in the report of the committee is exactly what the situation is at the moment. It would simply be a matter of a few short hours. The Queen, of course, 
 would take the current Prime Minister's advice to remove the President.

I do not know why those opposite are so anxious to see that this is not mentioned in the proposed referendum. They know, as outlined in newspapers today, that the wording proposed by the committee—by Mr Charles, who so ably chaired the committee and, as I said in my remarks this morning, was inscrutable and neutral, during the committee's proceedings—would receive 57 per cent support. When you start putting the mechanics into the long title, you start to confuse people. Of course no-one is being dishonest, and of course we are suggesting that the President would be elected by a two-thirds majority of parliament. This is outlined in the bills. But when you start putting in mechanics, you know that people will start voting against it, because they do not understand it. This will be the first occasion when many people look at the bill, and in my view the inclusion of the long title by the government is a deliberate attempt to sink the bill. The republic stands or falls on the wording of this long title that goes before the Australian public, and I believe that the original wording put up by the committee was based on testimony from Australians all over this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>8153</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One thing I am sure we can all agree on here tonight is that on 7 November—the day after this referendum—Australia will not be somehow confronted with a civil war.

I believe that is very much the reason why we have had one of the most successful democracies in the world.

Will we remain with the status quo? How is that person to be elected?

That is not the detail which many of them are going to ever get around regardless of whether it is in this question or not.</para><para>I believe that the amendment moved in this House tonight and on which we will vote is a right and proper question to put before the people.

He is not prepared to let the Australian people 
 vote on a neutral, unbiased question. He is saying that we are having the vote that we have to have and we are going to decide on an issue for our time. There is the warning for the Australian people: the question of whether Australia will become a republic will be decided now once and for all; otherwise, it will not come up again during the time of the Minister for Employment Services.</para><para>The member for Boothby said that it is a fair question, that he supports Australia becoming a republic and that he will vote yes.

If it is the kind of government the Australian people want, at least let them have a say. At least present them with an honest question. Do not try to distort the issue. That is what this is about—distorting the issue, not trusting the Australian people. He talked about the checks and balances currently in place. He tried to run a scare campaign, insinuating that, if Australia becomes a republic, if this legislation passes through the parliament and if the referendum question is passed, all of a sudden the checks and balances which are in place in Australia will disappear. He is also trying to say that the President will have the power to appoint a Prime Minister. With the system of government we have, we all know how the Prime Minister is appointed, and it will not change if Australia becomes a republic.

It is about how we see ourselves and about how others see us. It is not about marginalia. It is not a second or third order issue, as many of those opposite tend to describe it. It goes to the core of who we are as a people and whether we wish independently to shape our political future. When in 100 years time our successors look back on the debates contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  of this evening, I think there will be a degree of puzzlement about the contributions to this debate by the government and by the Prime Minister. They will be puzzled as to why this government and this Prime Minister place, and have placed, every conceivable obstacle in the path of this nation achieving its final act of independence. They will be puzzled as to why this government and this Prime Minister lacked courage and clarity of vision to embrace our future, instead preferring to cling to a past that has already passed us by.</para></talk.start><para>To the `imperial nostalgiacs' who sit opposite, I say that once the monarchy made sense. When we had a thing which was indivisible under the monarchy called the British Empire, which had about it a logic which was a common imperial defence, a common market, a common monarchy actually made logical sense in terms of our practical, political arrangements. Those days have passed. For the information of those opposite, the changes in that direction were not initiated by us. They were initiated in Westminster.</para><para>If you look at the history of Australian defence policy, you will see that the winds have changed. British defence policy east of Suez was initiated by Macmillan—by nobody in this country—in the early 1960s. When we turn to the common market, an initiative of the British government in 1970 under Edward Heath—Macmillan and Heath were both conservative Prime Ministers, I would remind the Minister for Aged Care, sitting opposite—decisions were taken by the British govern 
 ment at the time about where its interests lay—and they did not lie in the perpetuation of this entity called the British Empire, which had served, to some extent, the practical realities of the 19th century, and they did not for the second half of the 20th century. Those realities have passed us by, yet we still have the overhang of the constitutional arrangements which underpinned it.</para><para>The logic of the republic is unassailable in two essential respects. The first is that our head of state should be one of us. It is part, as the member for Boothby said before, of the evolution of our constitutional arrangements. There was a time when it was regarded as near-heresy for governors and governors-general of this country to be nominated and appointed from Canberra or from the state capitals as opposed to directly from London. It was regarded as heresy when Scullin appointed Isaacs as an Australian-born Governor-General of this country. It was equally regarded as heresy when we had, for the first time, the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. It was regarded by some as an unfortunate set of developments when we had the culmination of our independent constitutional arrangements underpinned in the Australia Act 1986. The establishment of an Australian head of state is simply the next step in this process—this process of political evolution. Each step along the way has been opposed by political conservatives in this country as somehow being the harbinger of the skies falling in, the heavens collapsing and the world in the future never being like it was in the past.</para><para>The second unassailable piece of logic which underpins the republic is simply this: for us and our friends in the region the continuation of the British monarch as the Australian head of state is at minimum perplexing and at maximum totally confusing for our regional friends and partners. Many of us in this chamber have worked for this country abroad in various capacities. In my experience, and in the experience of members from the other side who have spoken in this debate today, it is completely incomprehensible to our neighbours that we have as an Australian head of state a British monarch. You cannot 
 clothe that in any other language other than a reality which it underpins.</para><para>The conclusion on this topic is simply this: the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition is essential if we are to have a clear choice when this matter goes to the Australian people for final decision on 6 November. The Australian people will have before them a challenge which will not be put back to them for many years to come. It behoves all those opposite to support it in a clear and forthright manner. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>8157</page.no><name role="metadata">Charles, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CHARLES</name><name.id>OT4</name.id><electorate>LaTrobe</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It had been my intention to give a very measured response to this debate on the <inline ref="r841">Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999</inline>  tonight, but I have to say that the member for Griffith has rather riled me.

It was agreed that, first, we would have a constitutional convention to decide whether or not a question could be raised that could be put to the people at referendum to change the Constitution. Very detailed proposals were insisted on by members of the backbench, members of the outer shadow ministry, as well as the shadow cabinet, on how the Constitutional Convention itself would be structured and on whether or not an outcome would be put to the people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In all honour and integrity, our Prime Minister, in the lead-up to the 1996 election, took to the people the proposition, amongst others, that he would put to the people an issue for referendum to change the Constitution if a constitutional convention, which he would call, came up with such a proposition. 
 The Constitutional Convention was convened and, in 1998, it came up with an outcome which the Prime Minister accepted as being an outcome which would go to the people in referendum. In no way has Prime Minister John Howard ever not kept faith with the Australian people on this issue.</para><para>I chaired the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum and this has been the subject of a great deal of debate tonight. It was a great honour to chair that committee. Notwithstanding the fact that we made a recommendation to the House of Representatives today, the cabinet still has a role to play in the parliamentary process, as does the House—and this side of the House happens to have the numbers. I am quite happy about the change to the wording of the long title of the bill which will become the question on the referendum paper put to the people of Australia, theoretically, on 6 November 1999. I am pleased because the Prime Minister, the cabinet and, in fact, the government rooms have seen fit to accept the committee's recommendation that a reference be made to changing the Constitution by replacing the Queen and the Governor-General with a President.</para><para>I am also pleased that the former question which contained a reference to `chosen' with respect to the parliament of Australia has been changed as well. I accept that `Australian President' more euphemistically described what may happen, but it was a bit emotive and I have no objection to the removal of that term. I accept the decision by the cabinet, the government and all those on this side of the House. I think it is a sensible compromise. The committee should be pleased that we had such an outstanding outcome. It is highly unusual for a committee in this place, particularly on such a highly politically charged issue, to have a Prime Minister and a cabinet agreeing that the committee had a point. I do not claim victory, because there is none. I simply claim that I am pleased with the outcome today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>8158</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the member for Flinders, I support the direct election of an Australian President, but unlike the member for Flinders I will be

It certainly gets closest to the true republican philosophy of entrusting direct sovereignty to the people of a nation. It certainly matches my own philosophy supporting the devolution of power. I see the true socialist principle of our time to be the dispersal of economic and political power at every opportunity. The direct election model also has the advantage of countering public cynicism and distrust of these parliamentary processes, and for that reason it would be the most likely model to succeed at a referendum question. Finally, I believe that a direct election republic can be codified; the powers of a President can be codified. I subscribe to the longstanding Whitlamite principle that a head of state should follow the advice of his or her Prime Minister; that codification is good enough for clearing up the powers of a directly elected President.</para></talk.start><para>But, despite those things, I will be voting yes on 6 November, and voting yes for very good reasons.

The main issue, the central issue, indeed the overriding issue, on 6 November is to establish an Australian head of state, a head of state who is one of us.</para><para>I think it needs to be recognised that our Constitution is in a permanent state of evolution. Direct election republicans can vote yes in November knowing that further down the track they will have the chance to advance their argument for further evolution in our Constitution. If I can survive in this place, I would like to see the day where I could be party to such a process, to have a republic established in November, and then for those direct election republicans to take the constructive role of advocating a better method of election thereafter. I would urge that approach on the member for Flinders. True 
 republicans do not spoil when they have the chance to move from an English head of state to an Australian head of state—someone who is one of us. That principle is so important. No true republican would turn it down at any opportunity. They would argue the constant state of evolution and put their case for a different method of election further down the track. I would urge any republican who supports, as I do, the direct election model to vote yes in November. It is the best way to move towards our preferred choice, to establish the Australian head of state as the first principle, and to move to the details as a secondary matter. The principle is so important.</para><para>It always saddens me to see Liberal Party members opposite—the party that was founded on the principles of opportunity, a party that often talks about the possibilities of the next generation—turn down the opportunity to give young Australians a chance at everything in this nation. In this era of unlimited possibility, technological change and educational advance, if you are a young person in this country you can do anything. You can pretty well do anything in this world of possibility except, in this country, one thing: you will never, ever be our head of state. To deny that possibility to young Australians is a shameful thing as we move into the next millennium. Why should young Australians have that possibility denied to them? Why should that position be reserved not for an Australian but for a British citizen—not for a British citizen even elected by their own people but someone reserved by hereditary privilege under the House of Windsor? For the so-called small `l' liberals to do that is a shameful thing.</para><para>Every young Australian should have the opportunity to be what they want to be in life, to follow their ambition. If that takes them to one of the highest offices in the land—the head of state in this country—then they should not be denied that possibility. They should not be denied that opportunity. That is the passion that burns in the hearts of true republicans. I say to not only the member for Flinders but people like Ted Mack and Phil Cleary, former members of this place: if that 
 passion truly burned in their hearts and they believed in the constant evolution of our Constitution, they too would be voting yes on 6 November and then advancing their best arguments thereafter to move to the direct election model. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:

The government has always sought to have a long title of the republic bill which accurately and fairly reflects the referendum proposal. The long title is particularly important because the words form the basis of the referendum question. In the bill as it is presently before the House, the long title is:</para><para>A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with a President chosen by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.</para><para>The proposed long title is:</para><para>A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with the Queen and Governor-General 
 being replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the Commonwealth Parliament.</para><para>The wording of the long title has been the subject of significant debate, not only tonight but on a number of occasions. In the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum which was tabled today, the committee recommended a change to the long title. I will come back to that as I want to comment on what the committee recommended.</para><para>The government does not agree with the committee's recommendation on this point. In the light of this recommendation, the government proposes two significant changes to the long title of the republic bill as introduced. The government is confident that the amended long title is a fair compromise. The proposed changes are, first, after the statement that the purpose of the bill is `to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic', the amendment inserts the words `with the Queen and the Governor-General being replaced by a President'. The committee suggested that these words would present, clearly and simply, the essential purpose and outcome of the proposed legislation.</para><para>The government accepts that the proposed words are appropriate. However, the government still believes that it is important for the long title to give an indication of the particular republic model to be put to the vote. The long title will therefore continue to refer to the method by which the President is to be appointed. The current wording refers to `a President chosen by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament'. These words were the subject of consideration by the committee. In particular, witnesses before the committee questioned the use of the word `chosen'. The government has noted these concerns. The second amendment is, therefore, to replace the word `chosen' with the word `appointed', which better reflects the parliament's role in the process. The government believes that the long title as amended will accurately and fairly reflect the contents of the proposal and will appropriately form the basis of the referendum question.</para><para>While it is commendable that the committee was able to agree—if not unanimously, at least by a substantial majority—on a new long title, the committee's recommendation is defective. It is very important that the question that is put to the people is regarded by both sides—the yes supporters and the no supporters—as putting the issue fairly before the people and not weighting it in either direction. In this respect, the no supporters can be critical of the committee's proposal because in one place it uses the word `Australian' in respect of the President but fails to use that adjective in relation to the Governor-General.</para><para>Secondly, supporters of both sides could potentially criticise it for not putting the issue of the preferred model fairly before the people. It is as consistent with the direct election model as it is with the parliamentary election model. On that basis, it is not supported. The government supports the amendment that has been circulated in my name.

I know he does not support it. I am confused as to why he would bother to try to demonstrate his support for it with the words he has just used. I am confounded by the propositions which he has put in saying that the supporters of the no case would be confused and the supporters of the yes case would be confused. Frankly, the bottom line is very simple: there is no acknowledgment by the government, by the Prime Minister, by his cabinet, by his ministry or by his party that an Australian should be the head of state. That is a very simple question.</para></talk.start><para>This question as it stands is going to confuse and confound. The merits of the argument were put to this House earlier this evening by the member for Griffith and the member for Werriwa as to why the term `Australian as a head of state' should be put in this long title. The electorate I represent has gone through a process whereby there was a referendum on a question to do with becoming a state. The question was confusing and 
 the population voted accordingly—just as the Prime Minister hopes that the question that will be put to the people on the referendum will confuse them and they will vote accordingly.</para><para>When the Attorney-General says that the question should not favour one side or the other, I agree. But the most generous interpretation I can give to the question which would be framed if we were to support the amendment put by the government is that it supports the no case. The confusion it will cause by its wording will inevitably lead people to vote against the proposal as it is being put. The simple question that the Australian people want asked is whether they should have an Australian as head of state. The motion just voted on and voted down by the government was the question the Australian people want.</para><para>I know from my own experience in my own electorate that people who do not have the understanding of the Attorney-General or his colleagues about the Australian Constitution will be confused when they see the words as they are being proposed by the government and they will ask the question, `What is this about?' I can say what I think it is about: it is about the primacy of the Prime Minister; it is not about asking a reasonable question of the Australian community. This is a Prime Minister who said last week that he did not think there should be a change to the question. Then this morning he says, `Yes, we will have a change.' The question has been changed in the way it has been put by the Attorney-General, only to reflect the Prime Minister's view, as it was with the debate on the preamble.</para><para>I again refer to my own electorate. Thirty per cent of my electorate are Aboriginal people. Quite a large proportion of them have English as a second language, just as many migrants in the Australian community have English as a second language.

It is open for the Governor-General to be anyone. The Governor-General can be a United Kingdom citizen. The Governor-General has historically been a non-Australian. The Australian community demands that the head of state be an Australian. The simple proposition that you should be putting to the Australian people is that question.

This is an occasion when the vote of each individual in my own electorate will be of equal importance to my own, and I shall vote yes on 6 November.</para></talk.start><para>Those who support the current arrangements are correct to say that the constitutional monarchy has served us well. Australia has one of the longest continuous democratic federations in the world and has remained socially and politically intact throughout two world wars, the Depression and countless natural disasters. To this fact, it is too easy to give the very Australian response, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' but this is a recipe for mediocrity—it drains passion, innovation and the pursuit of excellence from society and sends younger members of the community very damaging messages. Sir William Deane is an Australian and is very respected, but he represents the Queen.</para><para>A laconic approach to constitutional change is at odds with the determination we have shown as a nation in academia, on the sporting field and in defending our values. We are a small nation with a very short history yet we have influenced world affairs to a degree well out of proportion to our size. This has not come about by taking a laid back and reserved approach to changing times and attitudes. Any institution, including our system of constitutional monarchy, must remain relevant to the everyday lives of the communities it seeks to serve. It is clear that an Australian head of state is necessary if we are to be taken seriously internationally. Was there a greater example of this than when the President of the United States toasted the good health of the Queen when he dined in the Great Hall of the Australian Parliament? He should have toasted an Australian as the representative and head of a strong and independent nation confident of its identity, purpose and mission.</para><para>In the past, Australian icons have centred on bronzed lifesavers, stoic drovers and lovable larrikins. While these are still important, today's Australia is far more diverse and rich. Our cultural and political institutions should reflect this. An Australian republic has a capacity to embrace the new Australia and lead our community into the millennium in a manner that the old constitutional monarchy cannot. Our chosen system of government does send a powerful message to the international community about how we, as a community, define ourselves and what our aspirations are for the future. To move to becoming a republic is a statement of self-confidence and shows a willingness to evolve.</para><para>There has been significant debate about the method of electing a future Australian President. The republican model as recommended by the Constitutional Convention and the Australian Republican Movement is careful and will avoid the single greatest potential pitfall which lies in the move to a republic—namely, the politicisation of the position of President. We do not want a President chosen by the popular press, a talk show host or even Shane Warne, whom I admire. We need someone with bipartisan support, who has 
 merit and the confidence of this Australian parliament. The office of Presidency should never be compromised with the tarnish of popularism or the appeal of celebrity status. The President should not be a politician. Small states like South Australia would never have a representative if there were a popular election. There are those in my electorate—members of the RSL and others whom I respect—who will have a different view from me. But I did ring my father tonight, who is also a returned serviceman and 86 years old. I asked, `How will you vote on the republic?' He said, `I will vote yes.' I said, `Why?' and he said, `We have moved on. We have moved on from the monarchy and we are now independent.'</para><para>In closing I commend the Prime Minister for fulfilling the promise he made to hold a referendum, and I reject arguments put by the opposition that do not respect the effort that has come from the government in seeing this question go forward. I look forward to 6 November. As I said, I will be voting yes, and I am confident that the yes argument will be successful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>8162</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The referendum question that has been crafted by the Prime Minister is a deliberate and cynical attempt to provide the no case with the only possible available, even vaguely credible argument that will enable it to derail the referendum campaign, and that is to attack the appointment method that is provided for in the model that is being put to the people. Of course, we have already seen the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business coming out and saying that he is such a strong republican, he is so strongly in favour of the republic and people's involvement in it, that he is actually going to vote for the monarchy. Of course he is a direct electionist, and that is the excuse he is using as to why he will be voting to retain the monarchy—that the President will not be directly elected and that therefore that is an inadequate model.</para></talk.start><para>I too am a supporter of direct election—I have been publicly since 1994—and I sincerely hope that at some future time we will have a directly elected President. But I am not 
 going to allow my disappointment at the outcome of the convention process and the decision making processes of government with respect to the method of election to determine how I will vote on the much bigger question of how Australia should determine its head of state—whether we should have an Australian head of state or retain the British monarchy. It is long overdue in this debate that, in spite of the manoeuvring of people like Mr Reith and in spite of the attempt by the Prime Minister to obfuscate, we brought the focus back on to the central question: are we going to continue with the British monarchy as our head of state or have an Australian head of state? Are we going to continue to have the monarch of another country as our head of state and be in a position where not one Australian can aspire to hold that seriously important position in our system of government?</para><para>The no campaign in this referendum is going to be a very interesting and peculiar bunch. In my home state of Victoria you have that great Irish republican, Phil Cleary, campaigning to retain the British monarchy in Australia and you have the ultimate cynical politician, the minister for workplace relations, campaigning for the no case because it will advantage his prospective hopes in the Liberal Party against the Treasurer. And of course you have the Prime Minister just hoping fondly that it will all go away and that he can escape responsibility for the prospect of Australia making a decision at the turn of the millennium to retain the British monarchy as our head of state. You have the three leading Liberals in Australia with three different positions—the government in complete confusion on it. You have monarchists such as the Minister for Employment Services, there at the front bench, saying, `It ain't broke, so why fix it?' On that logic Australia would still have OBEs, we would still have appeals to the Privy Council, we would still have us all as British citizens rather than Australian citizens, and we would have our defence and foreign affairs policies being run by the British government. He is correct. The British monarchy in Australia is not broke; it is just simply no longer appropriate. It may 
 have been appropriate in the past but it is no longer appropriate now.</para><para>I would very strongly urge the direct electionists to consider the bigger question that we face here. Yes, there is a serious question about the method of election, but compare the model that is being put forward with the status quo. The model that is being put forward involves the elected representatives of the Australian people in the Australian parliament electing a President. That surely is a major step forward from the status quo where the person who holds the position is determined by birth, is not Australian and her representative is appointed purely by the Prime Minister.</para><para>You can put forward arguments about what may happen if this referendum is defeated. Peter Reith can argue that if this referendum is defeated we will then have a referendum at some point down the track where a direct election model will be put forward. That is a possibility. But it is equally possible that if this referendum is successful there may be a future government of either political persuasion that puts forward an amendment to that system to introduce a directly elected President. It is pointless to speculate on all of these possibilities. We have to confront the merits of this issue here and now.</para><para>To those who say we have had insufficient debate I would suggest that this was first put on the public agenda at the 19991 Labor Party National Conference and in the 1993 election campaign by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. We have had over six years of public debate. The time is nigh for Australia to make that fundamental choice: are we to have as our head of state the British monarchy or an Australian President? That is the single question we have to address, and no amount of obfuscation, no amount of trickery by the Prime Minister with respect to the question that is going to be on the ballot paper should divert Australians—be they supporters of direct election for a President—from that core question: are we going to have a head of state where the position is open to all Australians or are we going to continue with the British monarchy? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>8164</page.no><name role="metadata">Hockey, Joe, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOCKEY</name><name.id>DK6</name.id><electorate>North Sydney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Financial Services and Regulation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not intend to trivialise the debate by seeking to apply political semantics to the question that is before the House.

Most importantly, I believe passionately in the people of Australia.</para><para>When one enters this House, one does so carrying a very significant weight on their shoulders, the weight of representation. In many of our cases there are over 140,000 people in our electorate. I have consulted widely with the people in my electorate about this issue. I understand the differences in opinion. I understand how passionate returned servicemen are about the fact that they fought for Australia and they felt they were fighting for God, Queen and country, and for some God, King and country. I understand their sense of history. But my job as a legislator and as a representative of the people in my electorate is to look forward; it is to care not only about the people who live today but about Australians who will be living in 2050 and 2100 and the years beyond that.</para><para>What is important to those people is the symbol of nationhood, and the symbol of nationhood is about the inherent and intrinsic beliefs of each and every Australian, that is, that each and every Australian should have the opportunity to be our head of state, that 
 any Australian, notwithstanding that they are Jewish, Catholic, Protestant or Moslem, should be entitled to be our head of state; that any Australian, notwithstanding whether they are born or resident in Coober Pedy or Cremorne, should be entitled to be our head of state. That is the nation that so many Australians have fought for and that is the nation that so many representatives in this parliament stand in here day in day out seeking to defend.</para><para>From my perspective, there is no question about which way I will vote when it comes to the referendum. I am not interested in entertaining some spurious arguments about direct election, because the direct election proponents are arguing for a change to the democratic system. They are not arguing for a change in the head of state; they are arguing for a change in the system. There are some aspects in a true liberal democracy that we should preserve. We should preserve those things that work well, but we should always seek to improve on the things that seek to make us a better nation. And this makes us a better nation, because it makes us a better people. It gives young Australians the opportunity to aspire to lead their nation.

I would like to restate on the floor of this House my support for an Australian head of state. It is a position which I and many in the Labor Party have held passionately for a long time. I am pleased that the national debate has been brought to this particular position. At least we are considering a proposition that an Australian should be Australia's head of state. In doing so, I acknowledge the important contribution to our 
 historical development, to our political and legal system and, indeed, to our cultural heritage of the legacy from Great Britain. But there is a moment in history when an idea must be fulfilled. There is a point at which nations shape their destiny in a new way, and we are at this particular point now.</para><para>I think it is a very sad day for the Liberal Party and it is a sad day for the Australian people when the Prime Minister of this country cannot come into this House with an amendment or a bill that shows real leadership but seeks to tinker with the question to deliberately deceive, to deliberately confuse and to achieve a political objective other than the one which the Australian people now aspire to, and that is to have an Australian as Australia's head of state. I cannot comprehend a Prime Minister who could come into this parliament in all sincerity and delete from the title of this bill the word `Australian' and then put in half the story or a third of the story. It is an extraordinary situation.</para><para>I have to say to members opposite that many of you have come up in this debate and you have stood on the floor of this House and declared your position on the Australian republic and your support for it and your support for an Australian head of state. I came into the parliament in 1993 with Christopher Pyne from the great Adelaide seat of Sturt, and I know that this particular point of view was one that he held for a long period of time. But there was a point when the member for Sturt was pilloried in the Liberal Party and in the National Party for holding these views We had to lead the coalition by the nose. Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating put on the political agenda the really tough question. This was a tough one. This was a question that Australians were going to bleed over in a political sense, and the coalition squibbed it. You squibbed it as political parties, both of you, and now you come into the House beating your breast about whether we should have this in the amendment or that in the amendment.</para><para>It is a very simple proposition that the Prime Minister has to accept. Now is the time for an Australian to head Australia. It is time for an Australian to be Australia's head of 
 state. It is time for my children and my children's children to have the opportunity to lead their country. There is no compromise on this and there is no equivocation about it. But there is one thing that stands in this debate, and that is the failure of the Prime Minister to show some real leadership for once. We are not asking for much as Australians except to have an Australian as our head of state.</para><para>Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>8165</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Bronwyn, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP</name><name.id>SE4</name.id><electorate>Mackellar</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aged Care</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just heard a number of speeches in which people have claimed to be passionate and have claimed some passion. I too am passionate. The thing that brought me into this parliament and indeed caused me to wish to be a politician, someone who is elected, is that I was passionate about the freedoms of the people of Australia. I think the mark of nationhood is how free we as a people are, how free we are from intimidation, how free we are from having our rights taken away from us and how free we are from people being able to usurp power. During the process in my teenage years when I decided I wanted to be a politician, studying history taught me many lessons. One of those lessons was that if Germany had had the constitution it has today, instead of the Weimar Republic constitution, Hitler could never have become Chancellor. In other words, the very structure of your constitution matters.</para></talk.start><para>The rhetoric that we have heard today about an Australian head of state, that somehow the Prime Minister's wording was not presenting the case as it really is, is totally false, as is the allegation that the committee that sat in judgment upon the long title was somehow unanimous. It was not. The member for Page put in a dissenting report, the member for Wannon put in a dissenting report and Senator Abetz put in a dissenting report. That is not my version of `unanimous'. The long and the short of it is that people like me will vote no at the coming referendum, people like me who believe that the most important and paramount question to be asked is: are the rights of the people adequately protected by the constitution we have and how will any 
 change to that constitution make things better for the people of Australia? Nobody to this time has answered that question. Nobody has said how this change to the Constitution will make it better for the people of Australia. That is the one question that is vital to me.</para><para>When Sir William Deane, the Governor-General, presided at the tragic funeral in Switzerland of the young Australians who were dreadfully killed, I was proud of him as my head of state. I was proud of Sir William's words and of his action in taking wattle from the garden of Government House and spreading it on the waters that had taken away the lives of those 14 young Australians, and he looked pretty damned Australian to me when I took a look. Passion is something that many of us have and those people who say that republicans are the only people who are passionate had better think again. This is a debate which will engender passion because people do honestly believe in things, and the thing that will always be the determinant for me is not some esoteric wonderment of whether or not you use the term `President' but whether or not you put at risk the rights of the people which are now protected under our Constitution.</para><para>It is our Constitution which is tried and true, our Constitution which has been subject to being trialled through the courts, our Constitution which has been able to grow with needed change and I have no doubt it will continue to do so. We got our Constitution because we had two imperatives driving it: we needed an Australian defence force and we needed to get rid of tariff barriers which were growing up between the states, hence section 92. We had real reasons to change it. We have been debating a republic since 1850, not since Paul Keating put it on the agenda. It has been a long debate and again and again when it comes up I will put my money on the good, sensible Australian people who know when there is some other agenda pushing what is alleged to be a simple question.</para><para>Immediately when I saw the poem in the paper this morning, the first thing that occurred to me was this: they removed the fact from the question that the people were not going to elect this President but that the 
 parliament was going to appoint the President, and so suddenly they thought it was acceptable. The question as moved by the Attorney-General adequately reflects what has to be decided. But the real questions at issue are these. Does it do anything to adequately protect the rights of the people of Australia? Does it improve the situation? Does it mean that Australians will have a better lot in life? If you think the answer to that is no, then vote with me. Alternatively, vote no if you feel that when in doubt—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I call the honourable member for Page.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>8166</page.no><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAUSLEY</name><name.id>4K6</name.id><electorate>Page</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker.

The debate has focused on the long title, which I find to be a pedantic argument, one which quite frankly ignores the real issues in this particular debate. I came to this question with an open mind and I challenge some of those opposite who have spoken tonight to say that they did so, because I do not think they did. They came with a pre-conceived position which was totally in favour of a republic.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I happened to take the position that I do not believe that we need change at the present time but I am also honest enough to believe that we will evolve and that we need to look very carefully at the way we change in the future. I took the opportunity to listen very carefully to evidence given to the committee about the proposals, particularly those in the bill, and I want to remind this House that if this referendum question is carried the bill 
 itself will become the Constitution of Australia.</para><para>That is the most important point. You can talk about all these emotive issues about whether we are Australian or whether there is an Australian head of state, but the most important point is that the bill that is proposed, if the referendum is carried, will become the Constitution of Australia. That is the point that I took issue with, and that is the point that I put in a dissenting report.</para><para>I asked Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney whether he could give me one example of where our present Constitution had failed us. He said, `No, except that we haven't got an Australian head of state.' It is his opinion that we have not got an Australian head of state. It seemed to me that the position was being pushed from the particular perspectives of members of the Labor Party and members of the republican cause in Australia. All the evidence we heard was in that vogue. I did not get any evidence that showed to me that there would be a simple change—that the powers of the President would be exactly the same as the powers of the Governor-General. Much is being made of what Malcolm Fraser said in Melbourne, but again it has never been tested.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Danby interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Causley, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAUSLEY</name></talker><para>—The member for Melbourne Ports attended only a couple of hearings. He comes in here tonight and puts on a great performance. I attended the hearings, as did the member for Shortland. I think that the member for Melbourne Ports should at least listen to what I have to say. There is no precedent for what might happen should a Prime Minister go to the Queen to ask for the removal of a Governor-General, so we can only speculate what might happen. The fact is that you cannot say honestly that the position would be exactly the same, because at least the Prime Minister would have to approach the palace and it would take at least a day or two days or whatever to get a decision. I happen to take the view that the palace would do everything in its power to see that the Australian people have a vote on what should be the future of their country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I find it quite untenable that the powers in this bill give the Prime Minister the right to dismiss the President without any reason, effective immediately. In fact, as the previous speaker has said, it is very close to the situation that we had in the Weimar Republic. I am not prepared to accept that. I have an open mind and I am prepared; I do not want an American republic. You need to at least reduce the powers not just of the President but of the Prime Minister as well so that in any constitutional crisis the question must always come back to the people. For those reasons, I am not prepared to support the proposition before the House. I believe that it is a dangerous proposition. In fact, most witnesses who came before the committee did not agree with the bill, but they said that they were prepared to accept this bill and amend it in the future. I think that, given the history of referenda in Australia, that is a very dangerous position to take. I am not prepared to take that position. If I amend the Constitution of Australia, I want to know that it is right. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>8167</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbons, Steve, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GIBBONS</name><name.id>83X</name.id><electorate>Bendigo</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to reject the amendment by the government and, in doing so, I would like to speak for a few minutes about change.

I must say that I have had a strong view that, right from the word go, the Prime Minister has never wanted this question to succeed. In my view, the Constitutional Convention was put together particularly to ensure that the question of Australia becoming a republic fell over.</para></talk.start><para>We see that in the Prime Minister's attitude, in his demeanour and in the things that he says. He at least admits that he is a monarchist. I think the truth in that admission is reflected in this amendment that has been put by the government and was further reflected when the amendment put by Kim Beazley was defeated. The simple question is this: do we want an Australian as our head of state? That is the question and that is the principle, and that is what should be put to the people of Australia. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the Prime Minister and those members of the government could argue for any other position to be put or for any other question to be put.</para><para>I must say that, having gone through the Constitutional Convention and having listened intently to the arguments, I came away with a sense of respect and appreciation for those people who are the dinkum monarchists—those people who simply say, `I want the Queen to continue to be our head of state.' I do not agree with them, but I respect their position because they are forthright in that position and they are honest. But I must say that I have no respect whatsoever for those who have become the spoilers in this argument—those who say, `I am a republican but I won't be voting yes.' How can you possibly be a republican? How can you possibly have a principled position which says, `I want an Australian as a head of state, but I am going to vote no; I am going to vote for the outdated position that Australia has'? At the Constitutional Convention, I think for the first time in modern history, a group of Australians came together and put forward a different point of view.</para><para>Our conventions are not what is always written, and I think the strength of our conventions is in the spirit of what has kept Australia strong over the years. That comes back to the principle, and the strength of that principle is: do we want an Australian as our head of state? The answer has to be yes, and I cannot understand why the question is not being asked in those terms. If we want to give the spoilers—those grandstanders—a further chance to destroy this question, then the amendment that has been moved by the government will give those spoilers that great chance. So I am really disappointed.</para><para>I listened quite intently to the Minister for Aged Care, and I have no doubt that she is one of those genuine people who have a love of the monarchy and who do not want Australia's position to change. But I just ask her to think back to the time of Gallipoli, for instance. It is one thing to have passion, but passion without judgment and without trust is what those British commanders had when they committed Australian troops ashore at Gallipoli. It is the passion that they had when they sat offshore on ships and gave the orders for Australians to be sacrificed for King and Empire. It is time for passion, but it is also 
 time for judgment. This is a decision for this generation to make, and if we do not make it we will have to explain ourselves to those young kids I speak to—16- and 17-year-olds who say, `We wish we had a vote, because if we had a vote we would be voting yes.' I will be voting yes, and I will be encouraging all Australians to vote yes.

Like many here, I would have preferred a different question. As I said, I am avowed republican, and I would like the question to be a bit more on my side. But then monarchists would like it to be a bit more on their side. What we have in the end is a compromise, and my disappointment is with the members of the opposition because they have chosen to make this debate into a partisan debate. Remember it was this government that brought about the Constitutional Convention. It is this government, not the Labor Party, that is bringing forth this referendum. Yet people in this House tonight have used this debate not just to talk about a republic or the status quo; you have used it in a party political way. Can I warn you that the consequences of this are a jeopardy to achieving the republic that I want and that I believe you want because you are creating a perception that the opposition is for the republic and the government is not. And that is not the case.</para></talk.start><para>You are doing your best to say to Liberals out there: `We are going to polarise you so that if you want to vote for the republic you are going to feel like disloyal Liberals.' If you do that, you will lose your republic. So just think, when you use this debate for party political purposes, what you are doing for your goal—which is also in this case my goal—of achieving an Australian republic. Think very carefully about it, because when we go to the people we do not want them to be taken up with concerns of, `How should I, as a good Liberal, vote?' or `How should I, 
 as a good Labor Party member, vote?' but `How should I, who have the interests of Australia and the future of Australia's children at heart, vote?' Don't let party politics get into this. Let people make their own decisions.</para><para>In echoing what some people have already said, I also say that, given a choice, I am well on the record for being in favour of a direct election. But that is a procedure for choosing the Australian head of state. It is only a secondary question. The main question Australians have to deal with on 6 November is whether they want an Australian head of state or whether they want to continue with a head of state who is not really a citizen of Australia, who does not live in Australia, whose children do not live in Australia and whose primary loyalty is to another country. That is the main question that we must put to the people of Australia on 6 November, and I approach the people on the other side to address this question and not mix it up with questions of party politics, because there are very many people on this side of the House who are strongly in favour of an Australian republic and who do not want to be distracted by the petty politics of a Labor Party which cannot rise above party political issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>8169</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It becomes obvious under even the slightest scrutiny that, unfortunately, some of the members opposite seem to have missed the plot completely when it comes to understanding just what this referendum is all about. This referendum is about Australia coming of age. It is about completing a process which began almost 100 years ago when we chose to become Australians. One hundred years ago, we decided that we were not just colonists from a far off country, we were also Australians. We formed our own government and we paved the way to the point we now reach. But what are we doing? Are we moving forward into the next century, as did our predecessors, with a vision for the nation or are we going to go backwards? The answer is obvious: we must move forward. Australia is its own country and must finally be recognised as such by having an Australian as its head of state.</para></talk.start><para>I am disgusted that the Prime Minister has chosen to continually try to blur the debate by making the question as complicated as possible in order, I believe, to have the question defeated. The preamble debate and the complicating of the current question is, I believe, a smokescreen designed to suit the agenda of the no brigade. I have heard many arguments on the republic issue over many years. They have included such drivel as `You might have to change the flag'—there is a classic—`The powers of the Governor-General will be too great' and `We will not be part of the Commonwealth and we won't be able to participate in the Commonwealth Games'. The reality is that these arguments are all contrived by monarchists to have the question defeated.</para><para>The classic remains the view that they have not heard one good reason to change the current system, and I have heard that a few times today. But the reality is that not one good reason has been put forward to not proceed—not one good reason. The main argument against having change has always been the powers of the Governor-General. For those who bothered to read the Turnbull report on these issues, they would have noted that the question was put and answered by legal experts. The answer is that the changes can be made. The question really facing Australians is whether they want an Australian as head of state.</para><para>Let us face reality. Australia has a diverse and varied population who are not just from one part of the world, as they were when the country was settled. Whilst my father's family migrated here some generations ago from Scotland as carpenters, my wife and her family came here from Italy around 35 years ago. What relevance does the Queen of England have to these other Australians? Are they less important than those people who came here from England?</para><para>As I mentioned when I first spoke in this place, I remind the House that, whilst someone who migrates to this country and achieves citizenship swears loyalty to Australia and her people, if they achieve office they must swear allegiance to the Queen of England, her heirs 
 and successors according to law. I think this is ridiculous.</para><para>Other great Australians have written many words over many years about why we should become a republic and why we should have an Australian as head of state, but for me Bruce Woodley and Dobe Newton summed this up very eloquently when they wrote the words to a song.

I cannot see us getting up on the morning of 7 November and shouting out, `Australians all let us rejoice for we are young and free and we have a President.' I do not think it is really going to be that big a note.</para></talk.start><para>The concern that I have had all the way along—and it has been referred to already tonight—is that the Labor Party has colonised this debate from the start. We have this glib position being adopted by members opposite. Continually tonight we have had the Labor Party talking about the position being adopted by the Prime Minister. It is just unfair. I think it is a cynical exercise. It began that way under Paul Keating and it has continued. It has sustained the ALP in moments of deep depression ever since.</para><para>I am not concerned about the impact of constitutional change leading to civil war or about the likely behaviour of any particular President. Those things are not really in my mind. The things that really should be in the minds of those in the parliament are the big issues—jobs and things like tax, drugs and crime. Those sorts of things are the number one issues. Anyone who remembers the 1998 election would recall that the republic was not an election issue. No-one here was appointed 
 to stuff about with the Constitution. That is a fact. It was not an election issue.</para><para>What we need to look at, if we were going to be looking at the Constitution, would be the substantive issues, things like the distribution of power between the Commonwealth and the states, the role of local government, even the boundaries of states. The Labor Party has not looked at those issues. I think the last person in the Labor Party who did that was Bob Hawke and, the moment he did it, he was hurried out the back door and replaced; he got sacked as a result. I have an electorate—and I should know about this—where we have the phenomenon of One Nation. When people have all the concerns about issues like crime and drugs, it is not good to be hearing from people like Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating about what is in it for us. What is in it for the average bloke? Stuff all. That is the fact.</para><para>Tonight we have heard a lot from the politically correct police. If you have had to deal with One Nation, you know that they are the ones who really get those people going. We have heard about who is a true republican and who is not a true republican. I think that is really quite irrelevant. Some of the people who were making those statements were not selected by anyone to represent republicans. Over and over again tonight we have seen demonstrated the narrow group that the Labor Party in this parliament represents. We do not have any monarchists over there. We have a straight out group which has an adopted position ordained by their former leader.</para><para>Australians have various views. That seems to have escaped the opposition. I am sure some of you have constituents who are monarchists who share the concerns about the maintenance of a system that has served Australia well. On this side of the House we have people from all sides of the debate. I am very proud that we have such a comprehensive, representative position. Clearly, I represent and I support the great system that has made Australia what it is today. We can sing `Australians all let us rejoice', for we are young and free and we are in a very good position to be able to go on and do so. But the concern I have is that over and over again 
 we are having a political exercise being diverted away from the true interests of this debate.</para><para>The debate we should be having is about the future of our country. It is not about the colonising of republicanism by the Australian Labor Party. Members opposite should really get their focus back on the game, if they are true republicans. The rest of us—people like me who are monarchists and people who might be direct presidential electionists—deserve to be able to put our position clearly and in a straightforward way, without this political brow beating that we have seen again and again from the Australian Labor Party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>8171</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McCLELLAND</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the problems with the government's question is that, in telling only part of the story, it is misleading.

I daresay that most of the speakers on the other side, and I suppose it would be most of the speakers on our side, have not read our Constitution. Very few Australians have read our Constitution. Indeed, very few law students have read our Constitution. If you read it, the black and white document does not reflect the reality. Why? Because of the tremendous powers given to both the Queen and the Governor-General under our current Constitution. For instance, most people are not aware that the Governor-General has an absolute discretion as to whether he assents to any legislation, under the black and white wording of the Constitution. Most people are not aware of the Queen's power to disallow any law within 12 months.

These powers would give that person—the Governor-General or the Queen—if exercised, greater powers than any dictator in the world. Why are they not exercised? They are not exercised—and this answers the minister's question—because of the existence of conventions that the head of state, whether it be the Queen or the Governor-General for the purpose of the argument, acts on the advice of the government of the day. It is part of our system of responsible government, but that is not reflected in the Constitution.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If there were a constitutional crisis, there is nothing in the black and white document confirming that they will act on advice.

Indeed I note, in fairness to the government, that they are considering the report of the joint select committee and are in the process of considering amendments which appropriately arise from the committee's 
 report. The Labor Party has tabled our document with a view to indicating how the proposals can be strengthened. For instance, we have recommended in the committee report that the Prime Minister have regard to considerations of diversity in appointing the Nominations Committee to propose a list of eminent Australians. We have proposed some strengthening of the accountability provisions by compelling the Prime Minister, should it be necessary to dismiss the President, to table as soon as practicable, but certainly within 30 days, his reasons for the dismissal before parliament considers the matter. So again that is another very significant area of accountability. We have recommended that the conventions relating to the source of power and the development of conventions be specifically recognised.

We reserve our right, of course, to move further amendments in the Senate and to consider those that the government has foreshadowed. In supporting the third reading, we are firmly of the opinion that what is proposed in the bill is a very significant advance for the Australian people. For the first time, it will involve the community in the selection of our head of state. For the first time, that head of state will be an Australian citizen. It will also introduce greater measures of accountability in respect of our system of parliamentary democracy and in particular our system of responsible government where the executive of the day is responsible to the parliament as elected representatives of the people. For these very significant and historical reasons, the Australian Labor Party will be supporting the third reading.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The question is that the bill be now read a third time.

This figure comprises professional fees (including those of the Australian Government Solicitor), disbursements, transcript costs and airfares. It does not include the costs of staff time for officers of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution, the Attorney-General's Department or the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>(2) I am advised that counsel appearing for the Commonwealth did not state that all costs related to the extradition proceedings against Mr Foster had been met by the requesting country. I am advised that counsel stated that the UK authorities would be responsible for costs involved `in getting [Mr Foster] back to the UK' and that they were `prepared to go to the expense of bringing [Mr Foster] back' . Counsel has confirmed that in making these statements he was referring to the costs which would be associated with the physical removal of Mr Foster to the UK. Under normal extradition practice, the country from which extradition is requested generally bears the costs associated with the extradition proceedings, other than costs associated with the escort of the person to the requesting Country. 
</para><para>(3) The offences for which Mr Foster's extradition was originally sought comprised one count of conspiracy to use false instruments, two counts of conspiracy to defraud, and three counts of using a false instrument. Each of these offences carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment on trial upon indictment. On 30 March 1999 I determined that Mr Foster should be surrendered to the UK with respect to the three counts of using a false instrument. If Mr Foster was convicted of these offences, he would be liable to a maximum sentence of ten years on each count. The actual sentence to be imposed would be a matter for the sentencing judge in the UK.</para><para>(4) I am advised that as at 24 March 1999 Mr Foster had spent nearly 21 months in custody within Australia, most of which had been at a high security prison in Brisbane. Nearly 15 months of this period had been spent while the extradition hearing and associated proceedings were being conducted. The total period for which Mr Foster has been detained is not longer than the periods referred to in part (3).</para><para>(5) As noted in the answer to part (3), Mr Foster's extradition was originally sought with respect to six charges, not 13. I am advised that the UK Government has not sought a wavier of the speciality assurance which it provided in relation to the original request.</para><para>(6) Yes. On 23 September 1998 the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) wrote to the Attorney-General's Department and advised that the proceedings against Mr Christopher Williams had been discontinued, and that it no longer intended to proceed with the conspiracy charges against Mr Foster.</para><para>(7) Yes, my attention has been drawn to answers provided by the Lord Chancellor in the UK House of Lords between 22 February and 30 March 1999 in response to questions asked by Lord Spens about the extradition of Mr Foster. I am advised that there is no contradiction between the answers provided by the Lord Chancellor and submissions made by the Commonwealth to Justice Spender in the Federal Court proceedings.</para><para>However, there are some matters raised in the answers which may be clarified. The Lord Chancellor stated on 22 February that the SFO `currently seeks the extradition of Mr Foster on sixteen charges', whereas, as noted in the answer to part (3), the UK Government originally requested Mr Foster's extradition on six charges. I am advised that the Attorney-General's Department wrote to the Serious Fraud Office on 26 February to clarify the situation. In response) the Serious Fraud Office stated that it would wish to pursue additional charges against Mr Foster, and said that if Mr Foster was surrendered, the SFO would seek a waiver of speciality. 
</para><para>On 10 March the Lord Chancellor stated that the evidence contained in the papers supporting the extradition request disclosed the commission of 16 offences, three of which were listed in the original extradition `warrant' (which formed the basis of the UK request). He stated that the Australian authorities had been informed that the UK Government will seek waiver of the speciality rule in relation to the remaining 13 charges. However, I am advised that the UK Home Office has since confirmed with the Attorney-General's Department that the UK Government has not yet made any decision as to whether a special waiver would be sought and that any such decision is a matter for the UK Government rather than the SFO.</para><para>On 10 March 1997 the Lord Chancellor stated that `the cost of conduct of extradition proceedings in Australia is borne by the authorities there in accordance with reciprocal arrangements.' The issue as to submissions made by the Commonwealth to Justice Spender on the question of responsibility for costs is dealt with in the answer to part (2).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Labour Convention on Child Labour: Australian Involvement</title><page.no>8183</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 577)</subtitle><id.no>577</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>8183</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 11 May 1999:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Has the Australian Government been involved in the development of the proposed ILO convention on child labour expected to be finalised at the ILO Conference in June 1999; if so, what are the details.</para><para>(2) On the basis of work undertaken at the 1998 ILO Conference, will the Australian Government support the proposed declaration at the 1999 ILO Conference; if not, why not.</para><para>(3) Has the Australian Government considered the common policy of the World Bank's Multilateral Guarantee Agency and the Internal Finance Corporation to include in all their contracts a prohibition on the use of forced labour and exploitative child labour; if so, does the Australian Government incorporate a similar policy in its overseas aid agreement.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>8183</page.no><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Reith</name><name.id>WI4</name.id><electorate>Flinders</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Workplace Relations and Small Business</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The Australian Government has supported the concept of a new ILO Convention and Recommendation aimed at eliminating the most exploitative forms of child labour since the proposal was initiated by the ILO in 1997. In the first discussion about the proposed new instruments at the 1998 International Labour Conference (ILC), the Australian Government supported the adoption of a 
 flexible, non-prescriptive Convention which will focus on the most extreme forms of child labour. My department also provided a response to the ILO for the second discussion at this year's ILC, and engaged in the preparatory work.</para><para>(2) At the June 1999 International Labour Conference, Australia voted in favour of the adoption of a new Convention and Recommendation on the worst forms of child labour.</para><para>(3) The Government is aware of the use of such contract provisions. The Government is not satisfied that such provisions would be effective in addressing the root causes of exploitative child labour practices, primarily poverty and lack of education. I am advised that AusAID does not include specific contract provisions prohibiting child labour or forced labour in overseas aid agreements. Careful consideration is given in the selection of projects to their effect on fundamental rights.</para><para>The World Bank's International Finance Corporation and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency operate in a quite different environment from AusAID. The multilateral agencies have contracts with private sector agencies in developing countries. Child labour provisions in contracts seem appropriate for these agencies.

On consideration of the Plan, officers from the Department of Health and Aged Care advised me that the Plan did not contain adequate detail on measurable program outputs for each region in New South Wales, as required under the Agreement. This was made clear to officers in Mrs Lo Po's Department in November 1998. A $2.7 million funding shortfall in the allocation of regional funding was identified.</para><para>(3) I subsequently wrote to Mrs Lo Po' on 11 February 1999, advising her that the Plan did not meet the requirements of the Amending HACC Agreement, and that I required further information before I would be able to approve the Plan. Mrs Lo Po' responded to my request in a facsimile dated 12 February 1999, advising me that she did not believe the New South Wales Government was required to provide further information under the Agreement, but that she was prepared to do so in 
 this instance. I wrote again to Mrs Lo Po' on 5 March 1999, reaffirming that the New South Wales Government was required to provide details on outputs and output funding under the Agreement, and requesting that she address the matter of the $2.7 million shortfall.</para><para>Mrs Lo Po' provided additional information to me in a letter dated 5 March 1999. On examination of all the information provided by the New South Wales Government, it was clear that the data contained in the Plan was inconsistent and did not adequately reflect the true cost of HACC service provision by service type in each region. Of particular concern, was the considerable variation in the cost of personal care and home help services reported in the Plan. 	 In Northern Sydney, for example, the cost of personal care was reported to be $123.80 per hour and home help $5.20. I was, therefore, not in a position to approve the Plan proposed by Mrs Lo Po'.</para><para>Accordingly, I wrote again to Mrs Lo Po' on 24 March 1999, requesting her to review this data and provide me with a more accurate and complete Plan. On 28 April 1999, Mrs Lo Po' forwarded a revised State Annual HACC Plan for New South Wales for my approval. The revised Plan provided more detailed and accountable information on program outputs.

Mr Ian Knop is the Chairman and Managing Director of Profile Ray &amp; Berndtson.</para><para>(a) The nature of the survey involved structured interviews with 20 Chief Executive Officers or other senior executives from different industry sectors selected by the department. The survey involved a series of questions to establish the experience of the companies in indigenous employment, gather their ideas of how the Government might assist them to recruit more indigenous people and to gauge their interest in participating in a project to boost employment for indigenous Australians. The consultant prepared a detailed report 
 for the department on the responses and outcomes of the survey.</para><para>(b) The cost of the consultancy was $22 000 plus $3789 for the reimbursement of airfares, accommodation and meals at Australian Public Service non-SES rates.</para><para>(c) The companies' responses to the survey were provided in confidence. However, the outcome was positive with all companies indicating an interest in employing more indigenous people and agreeing to participate in a project to generate employment opportunities for indigenous people. That outcome was reflected in a statement issued on 27 May 1999 entitled "Corporate leaders for indigenous employment", which was placed in the weekend editions of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline>  and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  on 29-30 May 1999.</para><para>(2) My department has signed Memoranda of Understanding with a number of companies.

The current agreement commenced in 1995. Following the introduction of the Job Network in May 1998, the original contract was revised for the remaining contract period to ensure that the ACCI project did not compete with Job Network members. The current contract is due to terminate in December 1999.</para><para>(a) The agreement with the ACCI provides funding for the operation of a network of nine Indigenous Employment Managers located in Townsville, Brisbane, Gosford, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin, Canberra and Launceston, plus a Canberra based National Manager and assistant. The project aims to generate employment opportunities in the private sector by working with private sector employers, including members of local chambers; provide assistance and advice to Job Network members; and encourage indigenous job seekers to apply for jobs in the private sector.</para><para>(b) The ACCI was selected during the term of the former Federal Labour Government.
