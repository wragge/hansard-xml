This insidious disease is the most common cancer in women, resulting in approximately 2,700 Australian women dying from breast cancer each year.</para><para>Ten years ago, my wife and I became actively involved in raising the awareness of breast cancer in women within the community. My wife, Gloria, through her personal public awareness, educational and fundraising activities, has been instrumental in successfully contributing towards the purchase of two mobile mammography screening units, which operate out of Wagga Wagga in southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. In 1998, one of these mobile units screened 4,173 women in rural communities in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria.</para><para>In 1994, the then federal government finally identified breast cancer as an area of priority 
 for the funding of medical research through the National Health and Medical Research Council. Funding of $16.4 million over four years was announced for the coordination of research findings and dissemination of accessible information, for both doctors and patients, on best practice, treatment and management.</para><para>Today, the total amount of funding specifically targeting breast cancer research is in the vicinity of $5 million. The break-up of Commonwealth funding is approximately $3.2 million through the NHMRC, $1 million through the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation and half a million dollars through the CRCs. This compares with funding of $12 million per annum from the Commonwealth government toward Australia's national research effort in HIV-AIDS and related diseases.</para><para>I have absolutely no problems with government funding strategies such as the HIV-AIDS strategy. I do, however, have concerns about disproportionate amounts of funding going towards other diseases, while breast cancer has a fatality rate in women five times greater than the fatality rate from HIV-AIDS.</para><para>Information I have sourced from the National Breast Cancer Centre regarding breast cancer research shows that the largest source of funding is money provided by syndicated groups. Syndicates are formed by investors or groups of investors who acquire intellectual property as a consequence of their investment in research. Research funded by syndicates is generally not peer reviewed. The $3.69 million of funding for breast cancer research identified in 1996—and it is a deplorable state of affairs when in this House we can only quote figures that were relevant in 1996—represents only two large projects, each of which represents a wide field of inquiry which includes, but is not exclusive to, the area of breast cancer.</para><para>The next largest funding source for breast cancer research in Australia in 1996 was the NHMRC, which provided $3.27 million. The NHMRC advises the Commonwealth government on the allocation of funding for medical and scientific research and is responsible for about 40 per cent of Commonwealth funding, the majority of the rest being allocated via 
 infrastructure and salary support for researchers in universities.</para><para>The third largest source of funding for breast cancer research is the state and territory cancer organisations. These organisations contributed $1.9 million directly to breast cancer research in 1996, including funds allocated to epidemiology and behavioural research units in some states. In addition, the state and territory cancer organisations  contributed a further $314,000, indirectly, through the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation. Funds from the state and territory cancer organisations, therefore, total approximately $2.21 million.</para><para>There needs to be more funding for clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. There is currently no government funding which covers infrastructure—which means that planning is very difficult and clinical trials can take many years to complete. Less than 10 per cent of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia are currently able to participate in a clinical trial that has the benefits of access to new treatments. Clinical trials have been identified as the most important avenue for advances in treatment to cure more women. Urgent strategies are needed to increase to 25 per cent within three years the number of women who can get access to and participate in a clinical trial. This is the single most important strategy that can have an early impact on reducing the appalling death rates for women in Australia with breast cancer—50 women die every week in this country.</para><para>A woman who participates in a clinical trial gets optimal care, but the benefits are available to too few women in Australia at present and this is a funding issue—particularly infrastructure funding. Australia has done more recently to fund breast cancer research. The problem is the research is fragmented all over Australia at different levels with different aims, using different techniques and in many instances various groups are not working cohesively. We need to pull these groups together, increase funding and do more to lower the morbidity and death rate resulting from this disease. We still lag behind the United States on a per capita basis.</para><para>We should build on the outstanding performance of national clinical trials through groups such as the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group to encourage more collaborative research, internationally and nationally, and, with laboratory research, to optimise evidence based research through the groups. This will benefit all women in Australia. Infrastructure funding will give the foundation and security for planning and completion of quality, evidence based research more quickly.</para><para>The government needs to revisit the issue of breast cancer research funding for clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Each year, 8,000 Australian women are waiting for us to act. There are obviously some exciting things happening in breast cancer research in the world today, including the use of laser technology to kill cancer cells. This exciting innovation of using a needle to penetrate the breast followed by a laser beam which kills cancer cells within the breast itself offers an opportunity to dispense with lumpectomies and mastectomies which cause significant physical damage, trauma and pain to women undergoing these operations.</para><para>This type of research, which is being undertaken in the United States, is heartening, as is the work of Dr Vasso Apostolopoulos, a young women who has identified a revolutionary new formula MF-P which stimulates the body's T-cells to fight the growth of cancerous tumours. Trials of MF-P, which were made possible through the multimillion dollar <inline font-style="italic">New Idea</inline> Breast Cancer Fund, have shown the most positive results so far in women suffering advanced breast cancer. It is being trialed again on patients who have recently been diagnosed. If the trials go well, a vaccine could be available within five to 10 years. Lack of money for trials needed to put this drug on the market is the prime reason for the five to 10 years delay in this formula being available.</para><para>Handing out research funding willy-nilly for short-term political gain or because vocal and indeed powerful lobby groups use their political influence is not a responsible reac 
 tion to critical national health issues which face governments from time to time.</para><para>Breast cancer research is not attracting the funds it should be. As I have said, approximately 2,700 Australian women die from breast cancer each year and 8,000 Australian women are diagnosed with breast cancer over the same period. These women need our help. While early detection of breast cancer using mammography screening assists in lowering the morbidity rate in women, breast cancer research is the key to finding a permanent cure for this insidious disease in women. While the current government has recently increased funding for breast cancer projects, we need to do more. Funding for breast cancer research is not sufficient and I call on the government to make more funds available.</para><para>I thank the House for allowing me this opportunity to talk on this very sensitive women's health issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>2663</page.no><name role="metadata">Plibersek, Tanya, MP</name><name role="display">Ms PLIBERSEK</name><name.id>83M</name.id><electorate>Sydney</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion by the member for Hume on breast cancer. Breast cancer is a major issue of concern for Australian women. Certainly, more Australian women die from breast cancer than from any other form of cancer. About 2,700 Australian women die each year from breast cancer and one in 11 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. The research response in Australia needs to be well funded, co-ordinated and relevant to the Australian context.</para></talk.start><para>To date our major response to breast cancer has been a national population-based screening program. In June 1990, the ministers responsible for health in all states and territories joined the Commonwealth in agreeing to jointly fund a national mammography screening program. In March 1990, Prime Minister Hawke announced that the Commonwealth government would implement the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer and committed $64 million in the 1991-92 budget for that program. In the 1994-95 budget, the Commonwealth committed a further $236.6 million over five years from 1994-95 to 1998-99 to continue the program.</para><para>The National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, now known as 
 Breastscreen Australia, was established in 1991 and is now recognised as one of the most comprehensive population-based screening programs in the world. The program provides free screening mammograms at two-yearly intervals mainly to women between the ages of 50 and 69 years. Breastscreen Australia operates in over 500 locations nationwide, via fixed, relocatable and mobile screening units. Screening has increased significantly since commencement of Breastscreen Australia in 1991, with over 52,000 women now being screened each month. The program's aim is to reach a participation rate of 70 per cent among their target group. At present, unfortunately only 54 per cent of women in the target group are being screened.</para><para>Mammographic screening is the most effective method of prevention currently available, but it is certainly not fully effective. Early detection while the cancer is still localised in the breast means that women have a 90 per cent chance of survival after five years, whereas if the cancer has spread, the survival rate after five years is only 18 per cent. So the importance of early detection is plain from those figures. However, screening only has a reduction of about 30 to 35 per cent in the death rate from cancer which means that unfortunately the majority of women who are screened still die from breast cancer. That shows us the importance of continuing research in other areas of treatment, certainly in the causes of breast cancer.</para><para>The member for Hume has detailed a number of the funding sources for breast cancer. Certainly, the National Health and Medical Research Centre provides a number of breast cancer projects. They also give block grants to the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, to the Walter and Elizabeth Hall Institutes and to a number of other projects which are looking at breast cancer.</para><para>They have also set up the National Breast Cancer Centre, which was provided with $16.4 million over four years to coordinate research findings and to disseminate accessible information to patients and doctors on best practice, treatment and management.</para><para>In 1996 the National Health and Medical Research Council  tallied up breast cancer 
 research for that year, and it was sadly only $12.24 million at that time, which I do not think compares favourably with the amount of money we have spent on things such as the advertising campaign for the tax package in the lead-up to the last federal election.</para><para>But more money for breast cancer research is only part of the challenge. The other challenge is coordinating that research to make sure it is effective. The important challenge is to make sure that every dollar of breast cancer research is well spent as well as increasing the actual amount that is spent. The National Breast Cancer Centre has suggested that a National Action Plan for Breast Cancer Research be developed to ensure that level of coordination. The centre said:</para><para>This would provide both government and community with confidence that their funds are being used well. A National Action Plan for Breast Cancer Research which brought together key players and developed a coordinated approach would ensure that funds available for breast cancer research are used optimally through a rigorous peer review system, reassure the community that potential duplication of effort was being avoided, and offer the opportunity for fostering research in areas where additional effort is needed.</para><para>They suggest that that plan could have input from the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation, the National Breast Cancer Centre and the various other research institutes and government departments which have a role in undertaking research in this area.</para><para>They suggest that the plan should emphasise the importance of a competitive peer review process for allocating the funding that is available, and continue support for existing research activity, because that activity is already in line with a number of priorities which have been identified as areas for further research, such as biological causes, genetic factors, development of new treatments, risk factors, evaluation of new treatments and diagnosis.</para><para>The plan should also undertake further research in areas that are perceived as important by the consumers of breast cancer research but where little research is currently undertaken—that is, psychosocial and supportive care, and alternative therapies. The breast 
 care centre suggets that, with the knowledge that government funding will continue, it is very important not to have any duplication of research. One of the roles that they suggest that either the National Health and Medical Research Council's National Breast Cancer Centre or the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation can play is in providing something like a clearing house for breast cancer research that is currently being undertaken. This would prevent duplication but also allow collaboration between researchers so that money can perhaps be used more effectively by piggybacking on existing research in other areas.</para><para>The other particular point that I wanted to make today is that Australia has a relatively small and diffuse population, so one of the challenges for us in an Australian context is to make sure that we take up challenges that may not be covered by research from other countries. One of the most pressing issues is investigation into the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women with breast cancer. We also have to have a very serious look at the experiences of women living in rural and regional areas—their access to screening and treatment, to peer support networks and to supportive doctors and other clinicians.</para><para>The other area I briefly wanted to mention is the success of the use of public figures talking about their experiences with breast cancer. Many people in the Australian community would have read of the experiences of Belinda Emett, the young actor who was only 24 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The experiences of someone in that position who is willing to share those experiences certainly provide a role model for young women so that they continue to do regular breast self-examination and seek prompt treatment and attention as soon as they have any problems. It is an interesting fact that over half of the breast cancers that are diagnosed in New South Wales are bigger than two centimetres. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2664</page.no><name role="metadata">Moylan, Judi, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs MOYLAN</name><name.id>4V5</name.id><electorate>Pearce</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague the member for Hume for bringing the matter of breast cancer once more to the attention of the House during private 
 members' business. The first time I spoke on this matter in this place was as a new member in 1993 when there was also a motion put forward by one of my male colleagues, the then member for Cowan. It is heartening indeed to see our male colleagues take such an interest in, and have such a commitment to, supporting the research for breast cancer in this country. I know that the member for Hume has had a long association with this issue with his wife, Gloria, who has been a very strong campaigner for better diagnosis of breast cancer and has continued to push for more money for research.</para></talk.start><para>In the latest edition of a publication put out by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australasian Association of Cancer Registries and the NHMRC National Breast Cancer Centre, the latest figures that they have published on this go back to 1996, when there were 9,556 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in women, and 2,623 deaths. When I spoke in 1993 on this matter, I pointed out that women are losing their lives as we go about our business in this place: every few hours, women are dying of the disease of breast cancer.</para><para>Although we have greatly improved the diagnostic procedures and the treatment for this disease, we still really have not made enough headway with money for medical research. Women have been very stoic in dealing with this disease. They have been coping, but I do not think that in this time it is sufficient for our nation's women to have to cope. And it is not just the women who have to cope: after my speech in 1993 I had a flood of calls and letters from people all over the country—from husbands of women who had it, from brothers and fathers. It affects many families in our communities.</para><para>Those families said me, `What can we do to draw the government's attention to the fact that we need more money for research to find out what is causing breast cancer and then to take steps to improve the treatment?' Those calls resulted in my going back to my office at that time and trying to sketch out a draft of a lobby campaign called `Beat breast cancer—lobby for life'. I was assisted by many of my colleagues in this place to get that lobby 
 under way, and it resulted in more than 100,000 signatures coming to this parliament, and in the then Labor government allocating some more funding. I am pleased also that our government has increased the level of funding for research, but there is still a long way to go.</para><para>In addition to that, our government has recognised the severe impact of the disease on the lives of women in rural and remote areas and, in the last election, it made a commitment to improve the support for women having to travel from rural and remote areas to the city for treatment. Women in those areas very often opt for a full and radical mastectomy—that is, the full removal of a breast—when a partial removal would be sufficient. They do that because they cannot afford either the time or the money to travel regularly to the city to have the ongoing treatment that is necessary when a woman has a partial mastectomy or a lumpectomy. So support for rural and remote area women is also extremely important.</para><para>Like my colleague, I have a concern also about the relativity of funding for various diseases. Given the high number of deaths among women with breast cancer, we do need to encourage those who are allocating funds for research to look very closely at the impact of this. This is particularly so as this country is now facing an ageing population: there will be more women who will be at risk of breast cancer, and we need to address that.</para><para>We have had a number of very good foundations that have supported this work—one in my state is the Hancock Foundation—and have given countless hours. We also have very capable medical researchers. These foundations that raise private money, and the wonderful researchers that we have throughout Australia, need to be supported. They need to be supported by a government that also has the commitment to increase the funding for research. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2665</page.no><name role="metadata">Gerick, Jane, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GERICK</name><name.id>83W</name.id><electorate>Canning</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very supportive—as I am sure all members are, on both sides—of any initiative which will maintain or improve the allocation of funds for research into the causes of breast cancer, for further improving the treatments 
 available and for ensuring that all women have access to screening. Breast cancer is an issue which many women will have to face: on average, one out of every 11 women will develop breast cancer. As there is as yet no means of preventing the disease, it is vital that all women have access to screening and that there be an ongoing education program to encourage women to take advantage of the screening program.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that all governments make a real commitment to the funding of research, trials and screening. There needs to be real cooperation between state and federal governments to solve the real health problems and not use each other as an excuse for those problems. The federal government needs to address the lack of Medicare funding, a lack which is causing the state governments to squeeze the programs they offer. They need to address the real health problems rather than offer short-term solutions, and to ensure that adequate funding is allocated for research into breast cancer. I am sure that none of us wishes to see an issue like this turned into a political football. It is an issue where we need to work together to try to solve the problem.</para><para>An example of the problems of funding occurred last year in Cannington. The state government made the decision to close the Cannington Breastscreen service, which serviced a large part of my electorate. That decision to close was made on March 28 of last year. The Cannington Breastscreen clinic was one of the most successful clinics of its type in Western Australia. Prior to its closure, 67 per cent of the women aged from 50 to 69 who lived in the region had used the service. This is very close to achieving the target rate of 69 per cent. It compares well with the rest of the state, which has an average of 59 per cent.</para><para>Having been open for nine years, and after screening nearly 64,000 women, the clinic closed in March 1998 and women were told to use the services available in the city district. This demonstrated a lack of care for the fact that the women of the region had developed a positive rapport with their own local service. Whilst the clinic has now been reopened, after much public pressure, with 
 petitions being collected, this again demonstrated that the state government was not taking the issue as seriously as it deserved.</para><para>The new service has been described as a temporary measure and the staff are still awaiting news of what the future of the service is as they still fear that they will be privatised. Not only is it vital that screening services be available to ensure that women are able to have their breast cancer detected as early as possible, but it is essential that there is a proper accreditation process for all these services to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained. It is now time for the program to be evaluated. If a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, there needs to be the assurance that not only will treatment be offered but a service will be there which gives the counselling and support needed, not only for the person suffering breast cancer but also for their family.</para><para>While trials are being carried out, it is essential that enough funding is allocated to ensure that the trial can be completed. A document I have received from Breast Cancer Network Australia says that women have entered trials in good faith only to find that the trials are suspended midstream because the funding has run out. An example is a psychological trial in Melbourne where women were asked to send in data on themselves and then asked to cover the cost. It is unreasonable that women who volunteer to participate in trials be expected to meet part of the cost. These women are now expecting that there will be no feedback or outcome of their trial. One of the suggestions of Breast Cancer Network Australia is that a register of breast cancer trials be created which will help women with breast cancer.</para><para>All governments need to make a full commitment to fund adequately the research, trials and screening of breast cancer to ensure that women who are affected by this disease receive the best treatment, support and care possible.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Military Personnel Exposed to Radiation</title><page.no>2667</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2667</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	 notes that the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia concluded that the 1983 Survey of Health of Former Atomic Test Personnel cannot be regarded as an adequate epidemiological study;</para><para>(2)	 expresses concern that there has been no further official study into the health and mortality of Australian personnel who participated in British nuclear tests and subsequent clean-up operations;</para><para>(3)	 acknowledges that the USA accepts as radiogenic a range of cancers and other conditions experienced by military personnel who were exposed to ionising radiation;</para><para>(4)	 notes that studies of British nuclear veterans have been conducted by the UK National Radiological Protection Board in 1988 and 1993 and, more recently, through Dundee University for the British Nuclear Tests Veterans Association;</para><para>(5)	 calls on the Minister for Defence to commission as a matter of urgency a rigorous health and mortality study of Australian atomic ex-service personnel and their children and grandchildren; and</para><para>(6)	 supports the involvement of independent researchers and representatives of the ex-service community in the design and conduct of such a study.</para><para>In one sense, the opposition should perhaps be thankful that we have finally reached this stage. This particular issue has elicited a significant number of press releases from the current government. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>  of 29 December 1997—not last year but the year before—Deputy Prime Minister Fischer stated that Australia would examine the pursuit of compensation if a new study linking British nuclear testing to inherited deformities and illnesses was accepted as credible.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 30 December 1997, a spokesman for Minister McLachlan said, `the federal government yesterday pledged to study a British report.' In February 1998, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, gave further reassurances to the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council and in March 1998 the same body was assured that Bronwyn Bishop would be coordinating the govern 
 ment's examination of the Dundee study. So, for over a year and a quarter, we have had promises that we might get to the stage of having some inquiry into the health situation of these people.</para><para>In the interim, the ALP national conference called for a roll of the people involved—and we are talking about approximately 15,000 people, who include defence personnel, local Aborigines and civilians who were involved in some manner in these tests many decades ago. The government has finally arrived at a point where something is happening. However, I must express some cynicism about the timing of this matter and the nature of the wording of the inquiry.</para><para>If we turn to the phrases used in this latest announcement, we see that one of the terms of reference is that a requirement would be to:</para><para>review the literature that suggests that nuclear test "veterans" and their offspring may have suffered adverse effects . . .</para><para>It also seeks a review of the methodology employed by Ms Rabbitt Roff—the person who has been at the centre of studies in the UK which were commissioned by British nuclear veterans—and it talks of evaluating the scientific merits of her studies.</para><para>However, I would concur with the statement of the National President of the RSL, Major-General Phillips, who commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 12 January:</para><para>If the Roff report is discredited, I think there is still enough about suggesting this link with cancer to justify the Australian government commissioning new scientific research.</para><para>He further stated:</para><para>We would like this causation looked at as thoroughly as possible.</para><para>The RSL is essentially saying that we should not basically collude with the British government to undermine studies in the UK and that that should not be the emphasis in how this government or any future government deals with the question of these 15,000 veterans and their families.</para><para>The reality has been that Roff's studies in the UK have traced a growth of multiple myeloma far in excess of what the last British Radiation Authority's studies show. Whilst at 
 one stage it might be argued that the prevalence of these problems was nothing out of the ordinary in the general population, her latest work shows that a decade later the prevalence is very marked and there is evidence of the need for some action on this matter.</para><para>We are talking about a situation where the British Under-Secretary of Defence has attempted to say that the minority of judges in the major European case did not comment on the duty of responsibility of both the British and Australian governments when those tests were conducted. However, that very minority decision said:</para><para>They accordingly had the duty to assume their responsibilities towards the people present in the test areas when the explosions took place. They should have taken steps to ensure that those people were able to apprise themselves of their situation and to have available all the information necessary to enable them effectively to assert their rights.</para><para>I question the timing with which—within a day or so, as I recall—the Australian government decided that after well over a year they might actually get down to a health study. Coincidentally, it had virtually the same thrust and the same wording as the UK inquiry. This is the same British government which, for many decades, has routinely issued a statement to nuclear veterans who feel that their illnesses were caused by radiation saying:</para><para>The background [radiation] dose received by civilians and members of HM Forces serving at or off Christmas Island in the years 1956 to 1964 was only about 35% of that which they would have received on average had they remained, for that period of their lives, in the UK—that is, some 100 microsieverts per calendar month less at Christmas Island than in the United Kingdom.</para><para>We have to question the long-term credibility of various British governments for the way in which they have dealt with these people. We know that it was only the royal commission in this country, conducted by the late Senator McClelland, which essentially revealed to the Australian public the degree to which the scientific establishments of the United Kingdom and Australia had misled not only the veterans directly involved but the broader Australian population—misled them as to the dangers involved and their own personal knowledge of those dangers.</para><para>That inquiry was of major benefit to this country in that it totally repudiated the studies that governments had traditionally relied upon to avoid responsibility for compensating these people. However, the royal commission had a major failing in so far as it did not—and I do not know the reason for this; it may have been the wording that they were basically forced to operate under at the time—come up with a fundamental suggestion as to how the people should be compensated.</para><para>Things have moved along. The question of pressure on this matter has increased quite considerably in the last few years. British veterans have become better organised. They now have a greater opportunity to take their case to Europe. Whilst they have failed at this stage, increasingly the British government and, thereby, indirectly the Australian government are coming under enormous pressure to rectify this matter.</para><para>We all know that in the last few months the Fijian veterans have also looked at taking action against the United Kingdom government. The New Zealand government has essentially surrendered. It has accepted coverage for its veterans involved in these tests. There is considerable evidence that the work of Rabbitt Roff in the United Kingdom was central to the decision of Winston Peters and the entire New Zealand government to basically acknowledge what had occurred. In the <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> of 6 February 1999, Sue Rabbitt Roff commented:</para><para>It is now becoming clear that a significant number have died from multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, while others still suffer from the condition. . .</para><para>Overall, my group—</para><para>that is, the group she was studying—</para><para>is younger than the full group—</para><para>that is, the general population—</para><para>so they should be expected to be healthier. Up to December 1990, the death rate in my group from all causes was only half that of the big study. Yet I found 15 deaths from multiple myeloma in the period to December 1990—six more than the NPRB found in its much larger group. By late 1998, however, veterans' families had reported another 15 deaths from multiple myeloma to the BNTVA—  
</para><para>that is, the British servicemen's group. She went on:</para><para>During the 1990s, 13 members of the BNTVA in my 10 per cent sample have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma but are still alive. I also have information on 235 of the 528 New Zealand servicemen who were involved in the British tests . . . </para><para>As I said, there is mounting pressure in this matter. Yet, on 17 October 1997, Minister Scott could comment in correspondence:</para><para>There is insufficient scientific merit to warrant the study you propose. You cite the work of Dr Sue Rabbitt Roff . . . His Department of Veterans' Affairs has advised the Minister that Dr Rabbitt Roff's views have not been broadly accepted by the medical and scientific community. . . Radiation at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was intense but of short duration.</para><para>The situation today is that the British and the Australian governments are relenting to a degree. They are accepting that justice has to be done to the people involved and their families. When I say their families, it is not just financial compensation for their families—there is also a very high likelihood that those descendants are individually affected medically with birth deformities, et cetera.</para><para>New Zealand, as I said earlier, backed down. The United States is already in advance of both the United Kingdom and Australia. The time has come when the government should extend this study to a proper analysis of Australian servicemen. We will learn very little in the long term by trying to undermine, denigrate and bring into question these studies, which have compelled other governments to act and which are seemingly of great validity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">JENKINS</name><name role="display">Mr Jenkins</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2669</page.no><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name><name.id>2K6</name.id><electorate>Longman</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with the thrust of this particular motion before the House today, but I think a few points need to be highlighted with regard to the opposition spokesman's address that we have just heard. He referred to the ALP having a conference and deciding at the conference that a roll should be put together of all of those people who were affected by nuclear testing here in Australia. If you go back to 17 September 1986, then Senator 
 Gareth Evans commented on the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia between 1952 and 1963 in relation to recommendation No. 2, which was:</para></talk.start><para>Compile a national register of nuclear veterans, Aborigines and others who may have been exposed to black mist or radiation at the tests.</para><para>In giving the government's response, he stated:</para><para>The government does not consider that it is either possible or appropriate to create a new national register of the kind envisaged in the Royal Commission recommendation 2. However, the objectives of this recommendation can still be met to a very great extent. . . </para><para>So what has changed? It was not possible to draw up a register at that time, yet the ALP at their conference now say that it is.</para><para>The shadow spokesman also went on at length about some sort of coincidence in dates and timing. He does not fill in the gaps. He referred to some press releases and comments by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister in December 1997 and February 1998. That was directly in relation to the two-part study that was put out by Professor Rabbitt Roff from Dundee University. There were two pieces of information given to the public at that time: one, put out in October 1997, was a mortality profile from a predefined sample of death certificates of veterans of the UK nuclear weapons test; and the other, put out in April 1998, was a report on a morbidity study of members of the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association and the New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans Association and their families. So there was not just one piece of research there to be commented on but two. Hence there has been ongoing comment from the government.</para><para>To go back a step, the member opposite was part of a government that was in place from 1983 to 1996. I think he would take the point that there was very little—in fact, nothing—done of any substance during that time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BV5</name.id><name role="metadata">ADAMS</name><name role="display">Mr Adams</name></talker><para>—There was a royal commission.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Brough, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BROUGH</name></talker><para>—There was nothing done to compensate anybody, otherwise you would not be standing here today with this motion 
 before the House—the opposition's response in government was inadequate—and the shadow minister would not have felt such a motion necessary. I take the point—and, as a former serviceman myself, I would like to comment on a particular gentleman in my electorate, a Mr Dick Bird, who served in the area of Monte Bello Islands—that this is a great distress to a lot of people. I would have liked to have seen the government move on it more rapidly.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Today we have seen the press release from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, headed `Health Effects of UK Nuclear Tests—Expert appointed to review Dundee University study'. Why is it necessary to do this? If we go back to 1983, the then government said that the research that had been put in place was inadequate and was not able to come up with conclusive recommendations—therefore it never moved forward in the areas we are now looking at. So we have to look at the methodologies that have been employed, et cetera, and I think that that is a reasonable thing to do. What concerns me is that it needs to be done quickly, so I am very pleased to be able to reassure those opposite that the minister has set a reporting date of 2 April. That is only a short couple of months away and we can have his comments in.</para><para>There are a couple of other very important parts to note here. The gentleman I mentioned in my electorate suffers from serious illnesses and is also concerned about the deaths of some of his grandchildren. He believes that their deaths may have been as a direct result of his exposure. The terms of reference that have been dictated by the minister go to the actual substance of these sorts of issues—dealing with the children and the offspring of the veterans who were in place.</para><para>I would like to correct the shadow minister while I think of it. He mentioned that there were 15,000 veterans. There were not 15,000 veterans, of course; there were a great number of Aborigines, a large civilian population and some service personnel. That created a problem in itself because there was more than one basis on which compensation had to be found. It went across workers compensation claims for Commonwealth employees who believed 
 that they were injured or suffered losses as a result of their participation in these British tests, the special administrative scheme which provided payment for compensation to Australian participants in the British nuclear test program who developed leukaemia and, thirdly, the act of grace scheme, which enabled claimants with common law actions issued and served on the Commonwealth in 1988 and up to 4 September 1989 to have their cases assessed on their merits outside the court system. But there has never really been any information or detail available or recognised which has gone beyond the immediate personnel involved in these incidents to the offspring and, in the case of my particular constituent, the grandchildren.</para><para>I have seen first-hand the great distress caused by the lack of acknowledgment of the stresses that these people have undergone. Therefore I very strongly and warmly welcome the steps taken today by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</para><para>I would like to go through the terms of reference because I think that they actually do outline and deal with many issues brought up by the shadow spokesman:</para><para>1.	 The Australian Government wishes to obtain expert independent advice on the studies of the morbidity of members of the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association and the New Zealand Nuclear Test Veterans Association (and their descendants) authored by Ms Sue Rabbitt-Roff.</para><para>2.	 The appointed reviewer tasked with providing this advice will be required to produce a written report which will:</para><para>a.	 review the literature that suggests that nuclear test "veterans" and their offspring may have suffered adverse effects to their health as a result of their participation in nuclear tests . . .</para><para>I know that this was an issue for the opposition spokesman referring to such things as `suggest' as perhaps `watered down'. But this is no different from any other terms of reference or any reporting of cases that you may see on the news where they refer to the `alleged'. It simply means that you cannot draw conclusions in the terms of reference—otherwise why have terms of reference in the first place?</para><para>b.	 review the methodology employed by Ms Rabbitt-Roff in the studies at Annexes 1 and  . . .</para><para>That is nothing different from what the ALP had done in government, and I think it is quite reasonable. The terms of reference continue:</para><para>c.	 evaluate the scientific merits of the studies at Annexes 1 and 2;</para><para>d.	 with regard to subparagraphs b and c comment on any perceived material implications of the findings of the studies for Australians who participated in the British nuclear tests in Australia; and</para><para>e.	 with regard to subparagraphs b and c comment on any perceived material implications of the findings of the studies for descendants of Australians who participated in the British nuclear tests in Australia.</para><para>3.	 The appointed reviewer may also comment on whether or not further research and/or analysis needs to be conducted.</para><para>In doing this study he will need to talk, no doubt, to a range of people, including veterans, Aborigines and descendants who have been directly affected by these tests. He will also need to deal with other experts in the field so that we can expect to have back here before the parliament, within a couple of short months, some detailed information on which the government can move forward.</para><para>I would sincerely hope that the research conducted by the Dundee University does prove to be conclusive. Above all else this issue does need to be brought to an end. You only have to go back to the American experience in the Nevada Desert. I was reading a book over the break about a multibillionaire—Citizen Hughes. He was living on the doorstep of the Nevada Desert when they were letting off these explosions. He was referring to the fact that the buildings in a major tourist attraction would wobble—we are talking about minutes here. He could not convince anybody at the time of the potential dangers to the civilian population. We now know, a short time later—less than half a century—just how damaging and long term the effects of radioactive materials and nuclear tests can be. Hence they have been banned in those areas. </para><para>This government has a duty to everybody who participated to ensure that they are fully compensated, that the ramifications are fully understood, and that we acknowledge the contribution that these people made unwittingly to the defence of Australia, particularly in note of the Cold War. I commend the minister for what he has done today and I hope that the conclusions that come back are conclusive and that we have this project finally resolved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2671</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The disgrace of past shameful deeds is compounded when justice is denied to the victims. British nuclear tests in Australia during the 1950s and 1960s belong to that category of deeds. In this motion, reference is made to the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia, conducted under former senator the late Jim McClelland. This is important, when last week this House paid tribute to Jim McClelland for services to the nation. Therefore, everyone should be aware of the royal commission into the tests.</para></talk.start><para>That royal commission found that Prime Minister Menzies had handed over Australian territory to the United Kingdom for the purposes of the tests without reference to his cabinet and without any scientific knowledge of the hazards that were involved. It found that there were departures from established radiation protection policy and standards during the entire test program. It found that, by reason of the detonations and the deposition of fallout across Australia, it is probable that cancers were caused which would not have otherwise occurred.</para><para>When we reflect on this issue from the 1950s and 1960s, the attitude of the era was driven by the Cold War but also displayed sheer foolhardiness. I acknowledge it is an issue that has confronted successive Australian governments of differing political persuasions and one which they have handled with varying degrees of success. Therefore, I take issue with the honourable member for Longman, who seems to suggest that this is, in some way, a partisan debate. If we as entrusted members of this place into the late 1990s reflect on this issue, governments of both political persuasions failed in this regard. At the end of the day, the primary obligation 
 should be to those who have been affected by the tests.</para><para>Recently, a British researcher from Dundee University, Sue Rabbitt Roff, has linked the nuclear tests to cancer in British veterans. Whilst it is pleasing that the government has announced that, like the UK government, it will inquire into the British research—and announced it one day after the British government, so excuse our cynicism about a linkage perhaps between the two announcements—I agree with those who feel that the inquiry does not go far enough. There needs to be a full health and mortality study of Australian personnel who participated in this tests.</para><para>Take the words of Rick Johnstone, a former RAAF mechanic, who, after 11 years in the courts, won a damages case for radiation sickness from Maralinga in 1988. Mr Johnstone said:</para><para>I'm under constant treatment for various things. I'm still under treatment for the nervous condition. I take pills for hypertension, which is probably the most critical life-threatening thing I have, but that's virtually under control with drugs.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><para>I have six-monthly visits now to a dermatologist, who removes skin cancers or potential cancers that keep popping up all over me. And all the medicos say I tend to be about ten or twelve years older than what I really am.</para><para>While I commend the honourable member for Reid for this motion, in one aspect I feel that it does not go far enough. Whilst the defence personnel were given protective clothing—no matter how defective it was—the indigenous people of the area received no such protection. Signs in English warned indigenous people of the tests—useless, as they could not read them.</para><para>Although the Commonwealth has paid $13.5 million to the traditional owners for the loss of the use of their land and conducted a clean-up of the site, I believe that some kind of inquiry into the effects of the tests on indigenous health is also warranted. The McClelland inquiry suggested that we need to look at not only the defence personnel but also the civilians and Aboriginal people who were affected by these tests. That this sorry episode in our nation's history has been 
 allowed to drag on for so long diminishes us greatly as a nation. The first test was conducted in 1952, the last in 1963. The royal commission brought down its findings in 1985, and it is now 1999.	The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 14 January 1999 stated:</para><para>This will be a better country when we are able to confront our past and account for the mistakes made.</para><para>I hope that the inquiry that is instituted might be more wide ranging than was first thought and might bring to a favourable conclusion this tragic episode of Australian history.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2672</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on this very important issue in support of my colleague the shadow minister. In doing so, I fervently hope that our government and all governments have learned from the mistakes of the past and will never allow what has happened in the past to happen again. We should not let this deteriorate into the situation that occurred with Agent Orange, where denial goes on to a point where it becomes ludicrous. We should not have to wait for other countries to take the lead when we were the host nation for these tests and our veterans were those intimately involved.</para></talk.start><para>Given the wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated about the various forms of radiation, there is even less excuse for tardiness and prevarication. There is a great body of anecdotal evidence as to what happened at Maralinga and other test sites during the 21 detonations, and there is a parallel body of anecdotal evidence concerning the ongoing and disastrous effects on the unwitting participants and their families.</para><para>I believe that this is a defining national issue. It goes to the very essence of the duty of care. To hide behind the fact that pure science has not yet been totally perfected is little short of outrageous and condemns many military and civilian personnel who worked on the atomic test sites to a retirement of anxiety, continuing disaffection and, in many instances, deteriorating health. The only protection a Gladstone man, Vince Camilleri, a 28-year-old Navy driver who was posted to Maralinga in 1957, was given before exposure to radiation was a yellow plastic raincoat—no gloves, no hats or face shields and none of 
 the modern equipment that is now taken for granted.</para><para>Even more incredibly, Vince told me that he was required to steam clean Sir William Penny's caravan after the tests. He and his fellow servicemen were never told why they were decontaminating the equipment, although the value in hindsight leads us to great suspicion. I ask: if there was no knowledge of personal danger associated with residual radiation after the blasts, why was it that the chief scientist's own caravan had to be steam cleaned on a regular basis?</para><para>Vince Camilleri himself has had some very nasty side effects, to put it mildly. I fear his family has paid an even higher price, and this is what tortures him in his continuing deteriorating health. Three of Vince Camilleri's six children have died prematurely in childhood or young adulthood. There is no history of childhood mortality or genetic problems on either his or his wife's side of the family. Imagine his state of mind. This man and thousands like him, and the families of thousands of other men who have died prematurely, deserve to know if they can rightly blame their ills on their exposure to radiation. They deserve to know if their grandchildren, and even their great grandchildren, will inherit the legacy of Maralinga, Monte Bello, Emu Field and Christmas Island.</para><para>Vince Camilleri was not even in the Army. Vince Camilleri signed up to go into the Navy. Where did Vince Camilleri end up? In Maralinga. We have all seen those dreadful images of Maralinga with young Australian troops, stripped in many cases to their shorts, washing down planes. I repeat: if Sir William Penny wanted his caravan steam cleaned on a regular basis, was there not evidence even at that time of the danger that our troops were exposed to?</para><para>So I say: let us put Vince Camilleri's mind to rest; let us put the legitimate concerns of Australian families to rest; and let us put our own nation's conscience to rest. I commend the motion of my colleague the shadow minister to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>2673</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My colleague the member for Reid has raised a private member's motion that is of huge 
 importance to those who suffered ill health during and after the British nuclear test program in Australia. Between 1952 and 1963, Britain carried out tests at three sites in Australia: Monte Bello Island, off WA, Emu and Maralinga. Maralinga was then chosen as the permanent proving ground site and was the location of all later trials in Australia. This site finally closed in 1967.</para></talk.start><para>Much of the effect of these tests on local populations were not known and were hidden until a royal commission into the site and its contamination was held in 1984. This resulted in the British being forced to admit that they had some responsibility towards cleaning the place up and looking at the damage these tests had caused the local population, both in the forces and the local Aboriginal population.</para><para>The problem has been, and it really is still there, that no real audit has been done on the number of people involved who are still alive and the state of their health generally. I understand that the British defence department is about to undertake a study of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, to see if it is linked with radiation and that our government is following their lead. But I do not believe that goes far enough. Much more needs to be done, and with an independent researcher involved.</para><para>As with Vietnam, many of the people are suspicious of governments coming up with glib reports. They want some involvement, both through their organisations and through their branches of the Returned and Services League, to give them the feeling that there will not be some sort of whitewash. There are organisations made up of personnel who were at the sites of the tests and who were exposed. Records reveal that some 15,000 people may have been involved. We need to know how many of them still survive, what sort of health problems they have, if any, and how those problems have affected their families. So there needs to be a rigorous and objective study of these people.</para><para>While trawling for information on this current situation, I was amused to turn up a debate in the House of Lords in England about this topic. It seems that there are many British people who feel the same way as we 
 do here. A debate between two lordly persons observed that US personnel, who were hundreds of miles from the epicentre of detonation, have been compensated with $US25 million in the form of pensions and that British troops, who were much nearer of course, have never been recognised. The government there was trying to avoid the incriminating evidence, much of which was reported to have been misplaced or had disappeared. Finally, they had to make do with the fact that cases had been submitted to the European Court of Human Rights for a decision. At least some useful decision might come out of that, if they get around to reaching one.</para><para>Surely we owe it to those who risked their lives to help the British test their weapons. Few probably even knew that they were risking their lives, and that makes it even worse. They were tested like laboratory animals and were not told about it. We must, and we owe it to them, find out exactly what they have suffered and give them some compensation for the difficulties that they most surely have had. Many recorded cases of ill health in service personnel have been put down to all sorts of causes, but no-one is really prepared to admit to the exposure of radiation for those at the Maralinga test site.</para><para>After all, veterans who served in Japan after the 1945 atomic blasts were entitled to full repatriation benefits, while those at the tests in Australia got nothing. It seems that changes to the repatriation scheme between 1945 and 1972 meant that defence staff serving overseas were entitled to full benefits, including free medical care, while those serving at home were not. I think that is not good enough—just to partially clean up the site and put a few resources in place. There needs to be a greater study to that effect.

The story was that many of those who went to Monte Bello never came back. When I followed this up, I learned that the local belief was that most of the people involved died of cancer and that they got the cancer at Monte Bello.</para><para>Last night I spoke to Mr Noel Wade, President of the Shoalhaven sub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association, and he read a passage from an article printed in a 1996 NSAA newsletter. The article was by a Mr Dellitt, who had been stationed on the <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline>, which was standing off the Monte Bello Islands to ensure no unauthorised shipping entered the no-go zone during or after the tests. He wrote of how, after the <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline> steamed back to Broken Bay in Western Australia, the men were detailed to clean the radioactive gunk off the ship. As it was hard work and the weather was hot, the men stripped to their shorts while scraping and scrubbing the muck off the ship's surfaces. He went on to say that at no time was he warned that there might have been a health risk in coming into contact with the material they were cleaning off the ship.</para><para>Britain conducted 12 full-scale nuclear tests—over five series—at three locations in Australia between 1952 and 1957, with the full cooperation of the Australian government. As you have heard, the sites were Maralinga, the Monte Bello Islands and Emu Field. Australian personnel, and personnel of other nationalities—military and civilian—were situated at the British nuclear test sites during the tests and after them as part of the cleanup detail. Forty-odd years after the fact, these topics and their implications are a daily part of the fabric of people's lives. That is why it is important to ensure that any study to ascertain the health implications of people's presence at or after the British nuclear tests is done thoroughly and with the correct methodology.</para><para>A recent Dundee University study may have provided some interesting new insights. This 
 work needs to be assessed to make sure that its methodology and assumptions are valid and that the new insights are because of the data rather than its improper manipulation. The member for Reid agrees that a Commonwealth department of health study, <inline font-style="italic">Health of atomic personnel, 1983</inline> was criticised by a subsequent royal commission as `not an adequate epidemiological study' with `conclusions that were unbalanced'. So there is a precedent for having the study's methodology independently checked before acting on its results.</para><para>Although it is possible to argue that Australian participants in the British nuclear weapons tests have been poorly treated by successive governments, the reality is that it is a difficult and complex task to prove a definitive link between cancer acquired later in life and exposure to radiation from the tests.</para><para>On cancers, the Dundee study states that `it is to be noted that the incident rate as self-reported is not elevated above the general expected UK rate.' Yet the member for Reid would have us rush in, raise people's hopes and possibly spend money on studying 15,000 people and their families, possibly to no good effect. I hope not.</para><para>This government has not conducted new research yet, although we have been active in monitoring relevant international studies. When a study highlights something concrete to research, I am confident that this government will undertake the quality research required. You see, we do endeavour to act on fact. The commissioning of Professor John Kaldor, an independent expert epidemiologist, to provide advice on the research undertaken at Dundee University by Professor Sue Rabbitt Roff is in line with our quest for evidence based in science.</para><para>The member for Reid asks the House to acknowledge that the United States accepts as radiogenic a range of cancers and other conditions experienced by military personnel who were exposed to ionising radiation. Yet he knows that when the United States government made the decision to pay compensation to those people, its agencies advised the Australian Labor government of the day that 
 the decision was not based on technical or scientific considerations.</para><para>The following statement from a 1986 United States report, quoted in the introduction of Sue Rabbitt Roff's 1998 report, captures the difficulty and the human dimension of the best research efforts.

This concerns the intention of the Commonwealth to dispose of a parcel of land in my electorate in very close proximity to Melbourne airport. This land really could be used for very few things because of its proximity to the airport, 
 but it is currently very suitably tenanted by a very well regarded local group, the Keilor Pony Club. This club, however, is being evicted from the parcel of land by the Commonwealth on very unsatisfactory terms.</para></talk.start><para>The way this has been handled is in the form of a letter from the firm of solicitors Blake Dawson Waldron. In very abrupt terms the club is being told they have to be off by 15 April and that if any items are not removed within that time they will be disposed of—presumably, the bulldozers will be put through. Somewhat ironically, the solicitor's letter talks about not wanting to `cause undue convenience'. Certainly, that is a gaffe which is quite true because neither the solicitors nor the Commonwealth is causing much convenience at all. On the contrary, they are using the very high-handed action of evicting, and not acting in any suitable way such as by offering to assist the club to find alternative suitable venues. Simply putting the lawyers onto them really is appalling public relations on the part of the minister, and ought to be reviewed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Brisbane: Soorley Administration</title><page.no>2676</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2676</page.no><name role="metadata">Hardgrave, Gary, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HARDGRAVE</name><name.id>CK6</name.id><electorate>Moreton</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a long and sorry list of residents in my electorate who feel betrayed by the Soorley administration in Brisbane over high density housing developments. Robertson residents have not been consulted by council over the latest high density development in Musgrave Road. Moreover, Lord Mayor Soorley has rules which deny democratic involvement of people hurt by City Hall's decisions. I met with about 60 residents yesterday. They face $15,000 in costs to fight City Hall. They have been abandoned by their local Labor councillor, Gail MacPherson. In fact, Labor did not even send a representative to the meeting; the Liberals did. Council did, however, send a blue Ford utility to drive past at the convened meeting time, probably to spy. I have seen those sorts of things before. It is certainly the style of the Soorley administration: grand PR, glib promises, a denial of basic rights to people to have a say in a town plan change and revenge against dissenters, even ordinary citizens.</para></talk.start><para>We were told that high density housing would stop urban sprawl, yet the sprawl continues and City Hall's favourite developers keep putting up high density housing. Local residents are powerless to stop this as Soorley has covertly changed planning and appeal requirements a little bit at a time over the past eight years and the only option left for Brisbane is to vote the Soorley Labor council out in March 2000. Enough damage has been done to our suburban street scapes; people should not have to suffer lower housing values, lower water pressure, congested waste water and crowded local streets. All are part and parcel of Jim Soorley's sardine city style. Brisbane belongs to all of us, not just to the lord mayor.

The government is working on a whole series of fronts to improve the economic climate so that particularly our small businesses but also our larger businesses can see their way ahead to create more jobs. There are a lot of things that we can do. Getting interest rates down has been a great help in terms of encouraging the growth of our businesses. In the workplace relations area, for example, the junior rates being able to be included in awards is, I think, a very good measure.

Has the minister, Jeff Shaw—your mate Jeff Shaw in New South Wales—acted in New South Wales to deny young people jobs? No, he hasn't. Why hasn't he?

There is no expert knowledge on the board of the EPA to properly assess the sustainable yield. Both sides have agreed that the better solution is to have people such as Professor Ian Ferguson and Dr Turner, of the ANU, with one representative of the EPA to conduct that process. The EPA representative will not be skilled in forest management—which would seem to be a fundamental requirement for such a scientifically necessary process as establishing the sustainable yield of a forest—and they will be able to overview the process to ensure that that comes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The EPA has recently had a freedom of information request put to it and it has been established that all the remarks they made on the Regional Forest Agreement in Western Australia were the opinion of the board and were not supported by any commissioned scientific studies whatsoever.

Until two weeks ago the local doctor had no visiting rights to the hospital, which meant that he was not able to have anyone in the hospital for more than four hours at a time.</para></talk.start><para>On the basis of representations from the Deputy Prime Minister and a very large petition that I received about 15 months ago from the Jerilderie community, we put to the New South Wales government did they want this funded under the multipurpose centre arrangements we had in place. We did it that way because we have previously just funded state priorities. New South Wales put back to us quite clearly that they did not want it funded as it was not one of their priorities. We went back to them in early 1998 to ask whether they wished to reconsider this. The department was told, no, they did not want to reconsider it and they did not want to fund Jerilderie.</para><para>We became so frustrated that the Deputy Prime Minister, after consulting with me, announced in August last year that we would actually fund, unilaterally, a multipurpose centre, both of us being hopeful that we would get approval for the new regional health centres as part of election policy. That happened. We hope as soon as possible to fund 30 new regional health centres—Jerilderie will be one of them—but we are pleased that, after having announced it ourselves, the New South Wales government has finally decided to come on board. I note that in that article it was mentioned that this may not happen until July 2000. I would be optimistic that we could do it before then.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Employment Services</title><page.no>2692</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2692</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Community Services.

There are a large number of extra call centres that have been provided and special measures are now being taken to ensure that there are staff rostered on in times of peak demand. For instance, over the Christmas-new year period, which is traditionally a time when Centrelink services are stretched to their limit, more than 300 extra staff were engaged. If the honourable member for Lilley was monitoring the Senate estimates process, he would have heard that Centrelink reported to the Senate that the response and recovery time from the Christmas period was the best ever this year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a very heavy demand on the call centres and, at times of peak demand, there will be delays in the answering of calls. That is inevitable; no-one has ever attempted to deny that. What will happen as a result of the government's, and Centrelink's, new service model is that there will be a reduced demand on the call centres because decisions will be made on the spot by the officer handling the file. Over 40 per cent of all the calls to the call centres at the present time are calls from people who are inquiring about the progress 
 on their file. If the decision is made on the spot, there will be no need for those calls.</para><para>In relation to the amount of time that is taken to get an appointment for Newstart interviews, I am advised today that the average is between three to four days. There were some delays longer than that over the Christmas period, naturally, because there are a number of statutory holidays, and some difficulties have occurred, particularly, in Melbourne. Those issues have now been resolved, and I would be happy to provide, if the House would grant the time, some more details on the number of days delay in each place.</para><para>Because of the improvements made by this government to the call centres, the demand has naturally increased. There is more work yet to be done. Substantial progress has been achieved. We have significantly devoted extra resources to the call centres, and their performance is improving. I am optimistic that those trends will continue into the future and that Centrelink customers will receive an even better service in the future.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Rail Track Corporation</title><page.no>2693</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2693</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

It has already made very significant progress in furthering the goals of the intergovernmental agreement of November 1997. ARTC took control of the Victorian interstate track in July 1998. It now provides for a single point of access for operators wishing to access the South Australian and Victorian interstate tracks. It is negotiating 
 with track owners in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland for exclusive rights to market and sell access to the interstate track in those jurisdictions.</para><para>The ARTC access pricing regime has resulted in prices for interstate network access in South Australia and Victoria being set at two per cent less in real terms than 1995 prices, which goes to demonstrate what good policy can achieve.</para><para>The ARTC has played a pivotal role in promoting the entry of new freight operators to the interstate freight market—competition that is working. In particular, the entry of former interstate freight carriers FreightCorp and V-Line has made a real difference.</para><para>Since taking control of the Victorian interstate track, speed restrictions—which of course impact on everything from fuel costs to reliability of the network to competitiveness to  attracting business—have been reduced. This has resulted in a reduction from 27 per cent to around 22 per cent of the track being subjected to speed restrictions, and that will improve dramatically over the next few months.</para><para>It needs to be kept in mind that we have allocated some $250 million of Commonwealth money to the upgrading of the track across Australia. We hope that we can encourage significantly greater investment from the private sector and from the states. Indeed, the first section of line to be designated for upgrading is Pura Pura, between Melbourne and Adelaide. The Labor Party had a go at rebuilding that, and the trains travelled slower after they had done the track up than they did before they began. We have now managed to start a major reinvestment program in Australian rail and I believe that the benefits will be very widespread.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: MRI Rebates</title><page.no>2694</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2694</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

We can produce virtually any food product because of our differing temperature zones, and we have an enviable international reputation for being clean and green.</para><para>In the past decade, agriculture as a percentage of GDP has grown by 18 per cent. At the same time, the food manufacturing industry has grown by 19 per cent. Clearly, each sector of our food industry, whether it be primary production, processing, packaging, export, niche gourmet products, the restaurant and catering sector or domestic retail markets, is vital to the continuing growth of our economy and, importantly, to the safety and health of consumers. There is scope to increase this level of growth of food production, but we must maintain our disease free status. It is vital that we continue to be seen as the clean, green producer for the world and domestic markets.</para><para>If we are to maintain and build our domestic and international reputation, we must first acknowledge the need to simplify the regulatory mechanisms currently in place. There is an urgent need to implement an integrated and coordinated national uniform regulatory system, responsible to one entity, that provides consistency across the range of industries associated with food production. Many reports have been undertaken in recent years into the growth of the food industry, its export potential, health and safety standards and means of regulation.</para><para>Currently, the processed food industry is the largest manufacturing industry in Australia, employing one in five of the manufacturing 
 work force with approximately 3,500 outlets across a diverse range of operations. The spectrum covers small, specialist processors such as the gourmet food producers of the Yarra Valley region in my own electorate through to large transnational corporations. Our export market is growing and is worth over $10 billion a year. It is the highest employment multiplier of any major manufacturing industry, improves Australia's balance of payments, provides an opportunity to diversify and expand Australia's export base, provides increased research and development opportunities, generates demand for new investment in plant and equipment, and reduces the migration of people from rural Australia to urban areas.</para><para>Food has indeed become a major growth industry because we have been able to capitalise on an abundance of natural resources; a worldwide reputation for quality, hygiene, safety and freedom from contaminants; comparative advantages in leading edge technology; a multicultural society whose demand for a diversity of food products has encouraged industry to meet the varied demands for export markets; and geographical proximity to the expanding food markets of the world, particularly the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>A key role exists for government in assisting the processed food industry to overcome barriers and impediments to growth, including structural and cost impediments, lack of information and market access. The government Supermarket to Asia Council provided a vision of a dynamic and export oriented agri-food industry able to win markets in Asia in competition with the world's best agri-food exporters. To achieve this vision, it is necessary to implement efficient practices of quality assurance throughout the whole production chain, from farm gate to customer, meeting both export and domestic customer requirements for quality food products.</para><para>It is imperative that Australia has stringent regulations to ensure the highest standards of disease free quality food products. Recent statistics show that the total cost of foodborne illness in Australia is estimated to be at least $4 billion a year. It is pleasing that the Commonwealth and all states are moving to 
 introduce uniform food safety standards to protect the health and safety of, and to provide essential information to, consumers. However, I believe that we need to go further and that there is an urgent need for a uniform national food regulation system.</para><para>Last year, Dr Bill Blair undertook a major review of food regulation, producing a report, <inline font-style="italic">Food: a growth industry</inline>. The review investigated all food regulatory matters focusing on regulations administered by agricultural agencies and involving the three levels of government. It examined all types of government regulation making, compliance and enforcement activities in relation to food produced for export and domestic consumption. It looked at the whole of the food industry, including primary production, processing and retail.</para><para>There is currently a wide mix of regulatory approaches in Australia that vary from agency to agency and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These approaches range from mandatory, sometimes prescriptive, sometimes in conjunction with other regulations, sometimes voluntary industry driven schemes to, in some cases, total deregulation. Even within the one agency there can be a plethora of arrangements.</para><para>The report found that the current framework for food in Australia is complex and fragmented and involves a large number of agencies and legislation spread across the three levels of government. Approximately 150 acts and associated regulations control food or agri-businesses in Australia. This excludes levy acts and local government by-laws. In addition, there are over 90 separate national food product standards. These laws and standards, which are constantly undergoing change, are developed, administered or enforced by numerous Commonwealth departments and statutory bodies, over 40 state and territory agencies and departments, as well as over 700 local governments.</para><para>The food industry as a whole relies on consumer confidence in a safe food supply to sell its products. To maintain customer confidence in the food supply, governments must take a proactive rather than a reactive role in addressing public health and safety issues, and 
 to maintain an efficient and viable agri-business sector government also must be proactive in its regulation system.</para><para>The current system is just like the tax act—every time government tinkers with it, it becomes more complex and just as unworkable. There is growing concern about the inefficiency of the regulatory system. It is too complex, too fragmented and too inconsistent. The food industry incurs costs due to duplication between regulatory agencies, overlap of legislation and functional responsibilities, inconsistency between jurisdictions and difficulty in dealing with the large number of agencies and food laws involved.</para><para>To give a couple of examples, a single dairy plant in Victoria was required to hold 13 licences, six of which related to the dairy as a food production plant; 42 inspections and audits per year were required at a total cost of $150,000. Another example is of a small to medium sized food manufacturing plant where they were required to have a full-time, on-site AQIS inspector, costing $65,544 a year; health certificates averaging $5,500 per year; quarterly AQIS audits and inspections costing $2,600 per year; meat authority registration fee of $1,750 per year; and local government fees of $700 a year.</para><para>There is an urgent need for an integrated and coordinated national food regulatory system to replace the fragmented and piecemeal system of food regulation in place at the moment. Dr Blair recommended the centralising of food regulatory policy within a single agency. He further went on to recommend that this should be supported by a rationalisation of legislation, standards, regulatory agencies, registration systems, compliance requirements and streamlining of administrative procedures to improve effectiveness, efficiency and accountability.</para><para>We need to agree that all domestic food laws in Australia should be developed nationally and enacted uniformly, and all existing laws should be reviewed with the aim of improving national uniformity. We have an enviable reputation as a clean, green producer. In order to maintain that reputation and to assist and enhance that reputation, we must 
 look towards enacting a uniform national system of regulation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VK6</name.id><name role="metadata">VALE</name><name role="display">Mrs Vale</name></talker><para>—I second the motion.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2701</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilkie, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILKIE</name><name.id>84G</name.id><electorate>Swan</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Because of its relevance to this debate, I would like to quote from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>  magazine published on 23 June last year:</para></talk.start><para>In Britain, for example, there are few more urgent political matters than rebuilding public confidence in food safety policy. After several years of food industry deregulation, during which consumers perceived industry interests were taking precedence over safety . . . The government is setting up a well-funded UK Food Standards Agency.</para><para>Let me begin by indicating to members of this House the importance of discussion on this issue. It is particularly important for a number of reasons. Firstly, the purchase and consumption of food is a matter of life and death for all Australian consumers. Secondly, it has direct ramifications for Australian industry. Thirdly, the nation's huge export markets and further export potential could be jeopardised by an incorrect application of policy. Finally, future technology development opportunities and industry progress could be ruined.</para><para>The history of the food regulatory process provides an interesting insight into the current state of the industry. One of the earliest examples in Australia was the passing of the Pure Food Act in all states between 1905 and 1910. It is notable that Australia at this time led the world in these policies.</para><para>In 1986 the Commonwealth and states national food council was formed. Some members would also be aware that since 1991 Australia and New Zealand have participated in the process together and the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council has had the role of monitoring, regulating and coordinating the food industry. I quote the member for McEwen:</para><para>The Australia New Zealand Food Authority plays a key role in our food industry by developing food standards, coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems, conducting research and assessing polices about imported food, and developing codes of practice within industry. It is the work of the authority which is largely responsible for 
 Australia having one of the highest food safety records in the world. Our reputation for safe, clean and healthy food has been built up over a long period of time and is envied by many of our trading partners.</para><para>The industries involved in food processing currently employ a significant number of Australians and generate millions of dollars in export income. To quote the member for McEwen, one of the industries will be the horticultural industry, which consists of approximately 35,000 commercial producers employing 80,000 people in production and 11,500 employees in processing. The member for McEwen goes on to make the following observation:</para><para>While important inroads have been made into the export market, the industry has not been as successful as it could be in replacing the increasing level of imported fresh and frozen produce.</para><para>She continues:</para><para>It is hard to believe that a country such as ours with the natural advantages of such a clean environment, the right climatic conditions, an available work force and access to the latest technology could import fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, but in the financial year of 1993-94 we actually imported $267 million worth of such produce.</para><para>Here I think the member for McEwen misses the point. Australia's success in the export market is dependent on all the criteria that she has mentioned. However, she fails to appreciate one vital virtue: our clients and our domestic consumers see our products being highly differentiated in that they are clean, pure and fresh. There is the key. An industry worth over $16 billion in export revenue, that turns over $42 billion in that process, will be put at jeopardy by tardy policy.</para><para>We must be very wary of oversimplifying these issues. Many of our imports, of course, are products of consumer demand in a global market. Nonetheless, with an export income of $16 billion in food and almost $1 billion in beverages, we are doing pretty well. These figures tell us something. They tell us that the global market searches for quality. They tell us that our products are internationally recognised as some of the best in the world. Australian industry can do this due to efficiency, human capital and technology. These exports are possible because our product is safe and 
 clean. The food standards currently in place and the agencies that monitor and enforce these standards ensure this.</para><para>There has been much discussion in the media of late about the future of the food industry. At the top of the agenda are the questions of the use of genetically engineered food, the labelling of this food and the battle for a super food portfolio.</para><para>One article, contained in last week's <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine, presents a favourable summary of the looming battle between industry and the health and consumer lobbies. The point of course is that food labelling and production are becoming inexorably linked with the developing technology. The important issue is that our traditional natural advantages will need to be supplemented by new technology and industry science. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> article states:</para><para>Unless Australia develops gene technology in food, its agriculture industry could become dependant on United States intellectual property.</para><para>While the standards council has decreed that all genetically produced food should be labelled accordingly, industry thinks differently. It is the role of our food regulation agencies to ensure that developing technology does not overtake quality standards. Clearly, in any case, it is of paramount importance in maintaining the integrity of the system. As such any move to water down the authority, or to remove restrictions and regulation should be viewed with caution.</para><para>The recent litany of shoddy industry practice and poor standards bears testimony for the case of tight monitoring of industry. Among those that can be recalled in the last few years are the Garibaldi meats case, the Peters ice-cream poisoning and the outbreaks of salmonella in the poultry industry. What strikes me as somewhat disturbing are the calls being made by these same industry groups for deregulation of the food regulatory environment. Of course, this was to be expected. Evidence of this change in policy has been growing following the appointment of Mr Blair to head the Food Regulation Review. Page 2 of the report says:</para><para>. . . reduce the regulatory burden on the food sector, and examine those regulations which restrict 
 competition, impose costs or confer benefits on business.</para><para>I sincerely hope that the evidence supplied by the report was constructed with the intention of adherence to the standards of health for our citizens while considering the demands of the business lobby. This is precisely the reason why any debate needs to be extensive when bills on the matter come before this House.</para><para>As previously stated there has been considerable debate over the need for labelling products. Labelling is an integral part of consumer knowledge about the industry, its practices and choice. I also note that there has been considerable linkage about labelling of genetically modified food products. This will need to be fully investigated and consumers' interests put before those of industry.</para><para>As we know, the process of the market can be structured in such a way as to push the consumer into a purchase using some marketing strategy. I recall on one occasion I was thinking of buying a health drink, only to look at the nutritional information to see that the drink was laced with sugar and contained hundreds of calories. The same goes for the nutritional content of food, the important information such as the fat and vitamin content. The consumer can make a choice, not a market driven, brainwashed purchase.</para><para>I remember a particularly unfortunate incident in the United Kingdom a few years ago. You might recall that the then minister for home affairs was trying to instil confidence in an ever-nervous beef industry. The minister conducted a photo shoot outside his residence. At this shoot he stated that British beef was exceptionally safe and that the buying public should not be concerned. At this point he fed a hamburger to his daughter. Of course, as we know, in the ensuing months people died of the disease and an industry was ruined. I hope that I do not have the experience of watching ministers of this parliament feed their children some product in an effort to bolster consumer confidence.</para><para>The conclusions that can be drawn from an objective analysis of the food regulation industry are obvious to those who have community interests as a priority. Firstly, Australia has established a trusted and valu 
 able market niche for its products. This could be jeopardised by failure to adhere to long-term standards and market expectations of fresh and untainted products. Secondly, the changes in the inspection and monitoring of our industry regulations are not supported by consumer groups, nor is any simplifying of our labelling laws. Thirdly, as a world leader in clean food laws and production we should be appreciative of our achievements and these standards should be maintained. National standards need to be embraced but not at the expense of watering down those regulations.</para><para>As I began this address with a quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, it is appropriate that I end the speech this way. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> quoted the Director of the Public Health Association by saying `The proposed deregulated food model is like pulling out the traffic lights because we have a good road safety record.'

My electorate is located in the southern Sydney region and, apart from some fruit and vegetable growing activity at Darkes Forest, is characterised by suburban residential development. Thus, the primary production, processing and manufacturing aspects of the food industry are not generally of great concern to my constituents.</para></talk.start><para>It is as consumers that my constituents have an avid interest in food and the assurances available to them regarding the safety of the food they purchase. This interest has been heightened in recent years with several serious events regarding food contamination which have captured headlines and worried constituents about the effectiveness of our food hygiene controls and regulations. Perhaps the most horrific of these was the contaminated mettwurst sold in South Australia in 1995 which tragically killed one child and hospitalised 23 people with a type of kidney disease. In 1996, peanut butter produced by a well-known manufacturer was recalled because it was found to have been contaminated by salmonella. This led to 1,200 people suing the manufacturer in a class action.</para><para>In 1997, near the mid-New South Wales Coastal town of Forster, contamination of the famous Wallis Lakes oysters nearly closed the industry. Then in Victoria, over 700 people contracted salmonella poisoning from Vietnamese pork buns. Apart from the enormous cost of food poisoning to the food industry and to governments, it is also of great concern to consumers who expect that the food they purchase will be fit for consumption and not put them in hospital or, even worse, cause death. It is natural that people look to government for the necessary regulations and industry codes to provide the necessary protection.</para><para>Food safety has become a serious business. Over the last decade there have been significant changes in the way the food industry serves our busy career oriented society. It is certainly one of the great growth industries, not only in Australia but also increasingly in the Western world. Changes in our culture, especially with the increase in the number of women who work outside the home, have seen less and less home prepared food and an increasing reliance on pre-prepared food or takeaway food outlets.</para><para>Research reveals that it is at the retail end of the industry where the risk of food contamination is greatest, and this includes restaurants, caterers and fast food outlets. We can easily understand that the more the food is handled between the process of production and its ultimate consumption the more the chance of contamination is increased. In 1997, the Prime Minister instigated the food regulation review, a major investigation into Australian food regulations, to seek the views of consumer groups, food industry associations, small business and health groups on the business, regulation and safety of food in Australia.</para><para>The Food Regulation Review released its findings in a report called <inline font-style="italic">Food: a growth industry</inline>. This report advocated reform of the food industry through legislative, procedural and structural reforms. A significant finding of the review was the lack of uniform Commonwealth-state legislation and lack of clarity and consistency in the present confusion of regulations. The review found that `there is an urgent need for governments to 
 implement an integrated and coordinated national food regulatory system to replace the fragmented and piecemeal system of food regulation in place at the moment'. The review also pointed out that the `current regulatory framework was complex and fragmented, involving some 150 acts and associated regulations as well as more than 40 government agencies and departments and 700 local councils'.</para><para>This important review called on the government to implement an integrated and coordinated national food regulatory system which would assist in the reduction of duplication and inconsistency of regulatory agencies for the food industry, and reduce the difficulties in dealing with the large number of agencies and food regulations involved.</para><para>This will be an important step for business in the food industry, as the current complexity of overlapping regulatory regimes presents a regulatory burden which adds enormous costs to food production. However, it is also important that in any change to the regulatory process, there should be no reduction in consumer protection. Public health must remain the prime focus of reforming regulation. Any suggestion of complete deregulation of the food industry in the wake of food poisoning by Garibaldi mettwurst, the Wallis Lake oysters, peanut butter and pork buns is unlikely to ever find favour with consumers.</para><para>The key recommendations of the review covered the establishment of a single Commonwealth, state and territory council of food ministers to be responsible for developing all food regulations in Australia. Such a strategic whole of government approach should cover food from paddock to plate. This government is committed to the introduction of uniform food safety standards, and it is hoped that the states and the Commonwealth will be in a position to finalise an agreement by the middle of this year. This certainly will be a significant step in ensuring food safety, and will also assist in uniform standards on labelling of food products. In the end, the protection of the health of the consumer must be of paramount concern. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2704</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Keefe, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr O'KEEFE</name><name.id>CE4</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not doubt the sincerity of the members oppos

This House has a centenary bug. It is locked in to the old certainties: a chamber dominated by the executive—that is, the Prime Minister and ministers—with members merely the flotsam 
 and jetsam of the leadership of their political parties, rolled out in divisions to provide the numbers. Too often it is little more than a rubber stamp chamber, when any real debate occurs in the secrecy of the party room or committee. That is not to deny that there have been good innovations that serve us well. The establishment both of the House of Representative committees 10 years ago and of the second chamber are significant and important.</para><para>The people of Australia will this year decide whether or not Australia should become a republic, and will decide upon the so-called minimalist model. This amongst other things means that we will not have an executive President as in the United States of America but rather it will ensure that the current features of the Westminster system will remain. But whether the republic succeeds or fails—and I hope it does succeed—the fact remains that the public at large does not hold members of this House in high esteem. The referendum will not alter the stranglehold of the executive on this House, nor will it fundamentally alter people's lack of esteem.</para><para>Abraham Lincoln said that a country and its institutions are owned by the people. As we approach the centenary of Federation it is incumbent upon all members to reflect on this institution, this people's House, to determine how we might better serve the people and how it might develop and evolve to that great purpose. These proposals are a modest but useful beginning, and I am pleased that the Selection Committee saw fit to allow them to be debated.</para><para>The Senate estimates committee has made a most important contribution to the transparency and accountability of the federal government. There is no doubt that the government of the day finds it inconvenient and a nuisance but dares not dismantle it, nor does it have the numbers to do so. However, members of the House, who oft times claim to be more in contact with their electorates than senators are, have no opportunity to bring forward the concerns of their constituents in such a systematic way. The appropriation bill debates are largely set piece affairs where hyperbole rules.</para><para>Members of the House miss out on a better and more detailed understanding of how government and the Public Service operate. That is why I have proposed joint estimates committees: not to neuter the Senate process but rather to afford members greater opportunities to further their understanding of government. If the House and Senate were to agree, then of course ministers from the House who currently do not appear before the Senate estimates committees would presumably be able to do so. If the Senate did not agree to these proposals, then we would be replicating the House estimates committees first tried and abandoned by the Fraser Government.</para><para>Citizens have always enjoyed an ancient right to present petitions, and the House of Representatives is no exception. There is a formality to the wording of a petition which, when sufficient signatures are collected, is given to a member to lodge. If the petition is in order, the Clerk reads the petition and it is consigned to the bowels of parliament. Clearly, a petition with a massive number of signatures grabs the attention, hopefully, of the responsible minister; but it is not mandatory. There has been a proposal to have a petitions committee, but it is not my purpose to comment on that here.</para><para>My proposition would allow the person who has organised the collection of the signatures on the petition, if they were able to come to Canberra, to enter the House of Representatives and, from the bar of the parliament, read out the prayer of the petition—that is, what the petition says. Now not every one will be able to travel to Canberra and, in those cases, rather than have the Clerk read out the petitions, the member who lodged the petition would do it.</para><para>I am sure that there are great democrats on both sides who take exception to the idea that ordinary citizens should be able to enter the chamber, but it has the opposite effect on me. It would open the parliament to the people in a small but very dramatic way. To those who can see only problems with the proposal, let me say that the usual way of introducing changes is to provide for them in sessional orders prior to their incorporation in standing 
 orders—in other words, they would be trialled. If it works in the way I anticipate, we can move forward and incorporate them; if not, at least we have had a go.</para><para>The Jessop Committee in the 1970s proposed that there would be a separate appropriation for the parliament, and a staffing and appropriations committee. To date, the House has adopted the former and resisted the latter, whilst the Senate has adopted both. This is hardly a revolutionary proposal. Its adoption would mean that the committee would sit separately to consider the expenditure proposals of the Department of the House of Representatives and jointly with its Senate counterparts for the other departments of the parliament.</para><para>Surely it is totally unacceptable that, of all the federal departments and instrumentalities, it is only the Department of the House of Representatives that does not receive detailed parliamentary scrutiny. One cannot but help pick up the innuendo about past Speakers and Presidents burying expenditure in the Department of the House of Representatives. I do not know whether that is fact or fiction, but that is precisely my point. The present situation represents double standards and a deplorable lack of accountability and transparency.</para><para>To my mind, of equal concern is that the Speaker is left without a formal process for members' input on competing priorities, evolving needs and bipartisan support against the Department of Finance and Administration. Some cynical constituent might argue that this relative impotence by members of the House of Representatives does not reflect well on members' ability to stand up and fight for their own electorates.</para><para>Nothing is more sacred to the executive than the way question time is run. Now, to the credit of the government, they are allowing 20 questions, 10 a side, however long that might take. Last year the average time taken to answer a question was four minutes—suggesting that many were significantly longer. Question time is now broadcast both on radio and TV, but members have been slow to react to how the public perceives question time. It may be impossible to reconcile what the public wants of question time 
 and what the government wants. But the point is that we are not even trying. I guess that, from an opposition perspective, the relevance of answers is always going to be highest on the wish list and I suspect that the odd Speaker or two would like more stringent standing orders on relevance, or the permission to enforce them.</para><para>However, putting time limits on both the asking of questions and the answering of questions imposes a discipline of sorts. This regimen was first imposed on Senate ministers in the former Labor government amid many cries of foul play, doom and gloom. I am not arguing that this move has rescued the reputation of Senate question time, but it has generally improved the answers of Senate ministers and/or limited the boredom of meandering answers. This is a small step, but perhaps we need to take a number of small steps to improve the reality and the public perception of question time.</para><para>Some might argue that if the references for inquiries by House of Representative committees, agreed to by ministers, appeared on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, it would be possible to ask questions of committee chairs. I understand that <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> suggests that the last successful question to a committee chair occurred in 1957 and, before that, in 1948. The purpose of this change is to clear up any ambiguity. After all, the committee system has been much expanded since the last question was asked, and standing orders should reflect the importance of committees in opening up the parliament to the people. It might just give an extra edge to question time for committee chairs in the anticipation that they might just get a question.</para><para>The three-minute statements by members are now part of standing orders and are provided for in the Main Committee on Thursdays, three a side. These statements were originally conceived as constituency statements that allowed members to talk about matters affecting their constituency. This proposal merely increases that number from three a side to 10, which significantly increases the opportunities of members on both sides. </para><para>At present it is possible—and, indeed, both sides have done it—that when a motion of dissent from a Speaker's ruling is moved, the mover and seconder are gagged and the debate is gagged. That is a ruthless use of numbers and, sadly, the Speaker goes undefended by argument. This change to the standing orders stems from the respect I have for the office of Speaker. Some might suggest that having the numbers is the best argument of all, but it does little to enhance the image of the office of Speaker of the House. I commend these changes for the consideration of all honourable members.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</name></talker><para>—Is the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YK6</name.id><name role="metadata">WILTON</name><name role="display">Mr Wilton</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2709</page.no><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name><name.id>9V5</name.id><electorate>Sturt</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Procedure for the 39th Parliament, I take this opportunity to congratulate my predecessors—the member for Moncrieff and the member for Aston who are in the House today—on the work that they did in resurrecting the operations and reputation of the Procedure Committee from the 13 unhappy years of the Labor government.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RH4</name.id><name role="metadata">KERR</name><name role="display">Mr Kerr</name></talker><para>—It was a golden age—they were years of joy.

In fact, a number of these proposals have, in one form or another, been debated in this House previously. Proposed standing order 143A, to allow a question to be put to a chair of a joint committee, appears 
 to be based on a false premise. Labor's political considerations with regard to this standing order date back to September 1995 when the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, was asked two questions without notice concerning the carriage of two private member's bills standing in his name on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. The ALP responded swiftly and savagely by attempting to gag legitimate debate in this chamber by suspending the operation of standing order 143, as the honourable members opposite would remember.</para><para>Labor's hypocrisy on the application of the standing order was exposed in June 1996 when the member for Watson relied on standing order 143 to ask the Leader of the Opposition a question on a private member's bill of which Mr Beazley had carriage. In the report <inline font-style="italic">The operation of standing order 143</inline> of September 1996, point 9 on page 4 of my copy provides the following:</para><para>In general terms the way the standing order has been applied over the years has been to allow questions to be asked:</para><para>1.	 of a member sponsoring an item of private members business about procedural matters in connection with the item, for example the case of a Bill when it would be introduced, whether it has been drafted, or whether the questioner can see a copy of the Bill, or</para><para>2.	 of a committee Chair concerning, for example, whether or when the committee intended to report on a matter, or</para><para>3.	 of a member who was serving as a parliamentary representative on the statutory body about matters relating to the body.</para><para>In the case of the latter two criteria, standing order 143 was used in 1948 by the then opposition leader to the chair of the Privileges Committee when he expected the committee to report on a particular matter. In 1955, a government member asked another government member about the activities of the Commonwealth-State Flood Relief Committee on which he was the Commonwealth's representative. In 1957, an opposition member asked the chair of the Public Accounts Committee whether the government had requested the committee to inquire into a particular matter.</para><para>Standing order 143 serves an important principle: that private members must be 
 responsible and accountable for the business they bring before the House. As the standing order has already been invoked on 18 occasions since Federation, I do not believe that good reasons have been advanced for amending or broadening its present operation.</para><para>The member for Chifley also proposes standing order 145A, which will attach time constraints on asking and responding to questions. This proposal alters the principles governing the role of the Speaker of the House. The role of the Speaker is to exercise discretion to facilitate constructive debate. The issues that the member for Chifley is attempting to address have been the subject of inquiry and report by several standing committees on procedure, and a source of frustration for many Speakers. However, I can see no merit in any attempt to divest the discretion of the Speaker through time constraints.</para><para>Standing orders 142 to 144 contain sufficient provisions for the Speaker in relation to the content of questions. I am also not convinced that time limits will see more debate in the House. Indeed, the Prime Minister and the frontbench have set new standards in parliamentary accountability, and this has been achieved within the current operation of standing order 145.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Kerr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9V5</name.id><name role="metadata">Pyne, Chris, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PYNE</name></talker><para>—The member for Denison cannot possibly argue with the statistics that, in the first three years of the Howard government, over 1,000 questions without notice were asked per year. Not once within the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments, of which both honourable members in the House were members, were more than 1,000 questions asked in any year, even though the Fraser government regularly achieved this benchmark in the mid to late 1970s.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the first half of 1995, Prime Minister Keating attended question time on only 19 of the 39 sitting days. It was an attitude which permeated Mr Keating's frontbench, many of whom are the same policy dinosaurs that are currently on Mr Beazley's frontbench, including the member for Denison, sadly. This was done under the infamous rostering system for ministers. It was an approach that was in keeping with the decision by the former Labor 
 government to reschedule question time to 3 o'clock. Labor's agenda was for question time to clash with the ABC television's broadcast of <inline font-style="italic">Play School</inline> so they could hide and shield the arrogant and dismissive style of Prime Minister Keating from the television viewing public. There appears little reason to support standing order 145A.</para><para>Proposed standing order 275A seeks to extend the opportunity for members to make constituency or member statements. In May 1997, the Procedure Committee received representations from the member for Longman and the member for Chifley regarding an extension of the opportunities for members to speak on unspecified matters of concern to them. In June 1997, the Procedure Committee circulated a questionnaire to all members on this issue. As a result, the government decided to provide time in the Main Committee for members to make three-minute statements.</para><para>In 1997 the Procedure Committee found that, for the previous decade, approximately 50 per cent of members used the 90-second statement time and that most of the members using the procedure had used it between one and three times per parliament. In the first half of 1998, 43 members utilised the three-minute statement. Clearly, the three-minute statement is a useful tool, but there is some uncertainty as to whether there is a demand for putting more time aside in the Main Committee for this purpose. The arguments advanced by the member for Chifley in relation to proposed standing orders 94 and 129 are less than compelling but do deserve further consideration at a later stage.</para><para>The member for Chifley also proposes the creation of an appropriations and staffing committee to oversee the operations of the parliament, even though these functions are presently executed by a number of existing committees which have multiple functions. The member's proposal appears to be based on Senate standing order 19. Superficially, a committee of this nature may have some attractions, but it appears to me that it would inevitably be an exercise in duplication and creating unnecessary red tape. Indeed, I would direct the member for Chifley to an argument 
 made in this House on 22 June 1995, when a member said:</para><para>. . . I think that there are far too many committees. We run the risk of drowning or diminishing or executing our committees by overload.</para><para>I know that the member for Chifley agrees with this statement because it is his own statement.</para><para>Proposed standing order 28B is another concept which the member for Chifley has enthusiastically embraced for some time. While I recognise the merit of such a concept, I am unconvinced that it has practical applications. Indeed, in the 1993 report of the Procedure Committee, <inline font-style="italic">Ten years on</inline>, it was conceded that there were considerable obstacles to implementing such a proposal. Although the member for Chifley's standing order 28B goes into considerable detail, I do not believe that he has established a cogent argument for the House to support his proposal.</para><para>As chairman of the Procedure Committee, I am more concerned at the practice of members raising points of order during a minister's answer. In many circumstances this practice amounts to a tactic to disrupt the delivery of the minister's answer. Also of concern is the practical operation of points of order. It is my understanding that members who seek to make a point of order should confine their comments to relevant procedural issues and not attempt to comment on or debate issues of substance, as has happened with members of the opposition every question time since the last election.</para><para>While these and the operation of standing order 304 are for the further discretion of the Speaker, I believe that the Procedure Committee are obliged to investigate mechanisms which can be introduced to assist the Speaker. Naturally, as in all things, I welcome the member for Chifley's constructive suggestions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2711</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILTON</name><name.id>YK6</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The member for Chifley proposes a comprehensive range of well considered recommendations, including changes to several standing orders which I think by and large reflect his level of respect for the place and his desire to ensure that it operates efficiently. Neither the mem 
 ber for Chifley nor I will engage in political polemic and cheap point scoring, because that does not advance the debate. Sadly the member for Sturt has yielded to that temptation, but I am sure that the member for Aston will not follow suit. I am sure that he will approach it with an open mind, devoid of polemic and point scoring. If one on this side were to engage in that sort of activity, one might say, for example, that the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and the then opposition, in 1995 I believe, vehemently opposed the initiation of the Main Committee. In fact, that has been a major success in terms of the efficient running of this place.</para></talk.start><para>I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Chifley's sentiments in terms of sections 1 and 2 of his motion, and matters relating to the appropriations, staffing and estimates pertaining to the running of the House. I might go to some length, though, to section 3 of the member's motion, wherein he recommends that standing order 94 be amended to ensure that members cannot be gagged on motions of dissent in relation to the Speaker's ruling.</para><para>Of course, debates on matters pertaining to dissent from the Speaker's ruling very much shape the form and procedure of this House in very important ways. If a member feels strongly enough to move a motion of dissent against such a ruling, then I have no doubt in my mind—and I am sure there is no doubt in the minds of most of those in this House—that the ensuing debate should be conducted in a fair, free and frank manner, without the threat of the gag or the axe hanging over the head of any member.</para><para>It is important to note that since 1901 there have only been approximately 103 motions of dissent against the Speaker's ruling, and only six of those have been agreed to. So it has been occurring over a significant time during the life of the House, a period during which free and fair debate should have prevailed. Of course, these debates are never interpreted as censures or as personal criticisms of the Speaker of the day, but largely as a focus specifically on the particular ruling at hand.</para><para>Again I agree with the sentiments of the member for Chifley with regard to petitions. 
 Much in recent years has been said about the design of Parliament House and the distances it creates, especially between those on opposing sides. There have been some largely superficial changes made to the design of the chamber which have attempted to rectify the problem. I note the installation of flags and the spurious removal of the Hansard reporters to the rear of the chamber. But this is not so much the House of Representatives as it is the house of the Australian people. The House does not need to accommodate change to bring the parties closer together as much as it does need to accommodate change to make the people part of this House. The recommendation proposed by the member for Chifley does indeed go a long way for the first time in bringing people on to the floor of their chamber to promote their particular views, ideals and goals. His move in this regard is a great start in that direction.</para><para>That time limits be placed on the asking and answering of questions is indeed an effective initiative to improve the running of the House. Placing a one-minute time limit on the asking of questions focuses the mind of the questioner to succinctly word their questions so as to avoid polemic and ensure the sought answer is obtained with a minimum number of words. If the answers were also limited to a period of four minutes, the responder would be encouraged to remain relevant and thereby diminish the possibility of what might otherwise be spurious points of order being taken on a range of issues.</para><para>The member for Chifley deserves much credit and the acclamation of this House for his initiative. These are far-reaching changes of great importance to this House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2712</page.no><name role="metadata">Nugent, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NUGENT</name><name.id>UT4</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has already been said, in the last parliament I chaired the Standing Committee on Procedure, so I have taken some interest in these matters for quite some time. In terms of the motion put by the honourable gentleman from Chifley, I acknowledge that he has had a longstanding and sincere interest in these matters, but I am disappointed that last year when the committee undertook a major review of the committee system, which was then 10 years 
 old, with a view to looking at how it might be improved, he did not take the opportunity to make a submission or put these proposals forward. I think that might have been constructive. However, we will move on and deal with the particular issues.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YK6</name.id><name role="metadata">WILTON</name><name role="display">Mr Wilton</name></talker><para>—That is just point scoring.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Nugent, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NUGENT</name></talker><para>—It is not point scoring. The fact is that there was a mechanism there where these things could have been debated and they were not debated. Shortly after the committee brought down its recommendations, these motions were put on the paper. It is not point scoring at all.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Whilst I accept that most of these proposals are obviously made in good faith, in practical terms I have some difficulty with a number of them. In having extra committees, we have a problem in the sense that we already have some 28 committees that members of this chamber are likely to serve on. One of the things that clearly came out of the review last year was that members felt that there were too many committees, that the committees were too large and that generally everybody was getting swamped. The recommendation of the report that came out of the Procedure Committee was that we should actually reduce both the size and the number of committees. I was one who was disappointed that the government chose not to reduce the number of committees, although the government did in its response to that report agree that we should reduce the size of those committees.</para><para>In terms of motion No. 5 concerning the committee on appropriations and staffing, that would be another committee and it is something that can be done by mechanisms that already exist. I am therefore not convinced that that would be an appropriate way to go. In terms of the Senate estimates, half the problem is that that becomes a political circus. I for one do not particularly want to see that extended.</para><para>I want to talk briefly about motion No. 7—the closure of a member under standing order 94—where the honourable gentleman suggests the addition of the words `or speaking to a motion of dissent'. This is when the gag is applied. Whilst I understand the intent of the motion, it seems to me that the way the 
 wording is applied could cause a problem. This could occur whoever was in government—and, let us face it, one takes a different perspective in government from when one is in opposition. I spent six years on that side of the chamber and your objectives and how you operate are totally different from the way your objectives operate on this side.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Horne interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Nugent, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NUGENT</name></talker><para>—I intend to spend a lot longer than six years on this side. It seems to me that, unless I have misunderstood it completely, this in fact would open up the opportunity during a censure to a filibuster type operation because you could never actually turn it off.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the presentation of petitions, like many members in this chamber I think that we do not deal adequately with petitions. My concern is less with the way they are presented and read out and whether it is done by the petitioner or the member and so on and so forth than it is with the fact that we do not deal with them in any substantive way. We do not respond to the petitioners. We do not take any action as a result of the petitions. If we really are to make the chamber and the parliament more responsive to the electorate, then we should be looking at ways to respond to those petitions.</para><para>I think questions to chairs of committees is a sensible idea and one that I would personally like to see advanced. When it comes to time limits on questions, my concern about the limit of time on questions is this: if you had 20 questions—as we have at the moment—and they average four minutes each, then you are talking about one hour and 40 minutes. So four minutes is probably too high a figure. But I do not think that timing is the concern; it is the content. Again, whichever side is in government, it is the content which is the problem and I would like to see that addressed in ways other than the placing of artificial time limits on questions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2713</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Jenkins)</name></talker><para>—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Please proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name></talker><para>—I know we are going over old ground that has been responded to before, but I would like to point out that, whilst it is true that I did not specifically make a submission to the Standing Committee on Procedure, a number of these motions were on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>  and the committee was well able to take cognisance of them.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The Hunter region is changing. The traditional base of employment—mining and manufacturing—is rapidly diminishing but, unfortunately, the Howard government refuses to acknowledge this or to support our region during this transformation. Australia used to be the clever country, and the Hunter certainly epitomised that, but this government has walked away from that national goal. Support would encourage and initiate positive changes for the future, but it has cut support for industry. During Mr Howard's first period as Prime Minister,  he cut $100 million from Austrade—virtually abolishing AusIndustry.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, the Howard government has a very disgraceful record of being bad for industry, bad for business and bad for jobs. In 1996, Mr Howard set down benchmarks for the government's performance on industry policy, and he has failed on every count. First, he promised to reduce the trade deficit on manufactured goods. What is the result? 
 The manufactured trade deficit went up dramatically. It reached a record of $13.3 billion in the 1997 December quarter. Secondly, he promised to improve Australia's performance on industrial research and development. The result: he cut research and development support. This has caused a collapse in business research, with many companies taking their clever ideas offshore. Thirdly, he promised to create 200,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000. What do we find? When Senator Minchin, the Prime Minister's Special Minister of State, took over the portfolio, he dumped the target alltogether—disowned it.</para><para>I can certainly relate how this shameful record is affecting the Hunter region. The announcement of the closure of iron and steel making facilities by BHP in 1997 is well documented. How it took the Prime Minister more than two months to respond is equally well documented. He preferred to go and see the cricket at Lord's than to come to Newcastle and talk to the steelworkers. His token response was to form the Hunter Advantage Fund—$10 million put aside to attract investment, to bring new industry and to create jobs in the Hunter region. That announcement was made 20 months ago. What have we seen since then? We have seen nothing except rhetoric and promises.</para><para>Unfortunately, Mr Howard, particularly, does not realise that rhetoric alone is very cold comfort for workers and their families who desperately need this funding and who desperately need the jobs.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Hockey interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name></talker><para>—In fact, one project was announced four times by your colleagues.

It is a great project—no-one disagrees that the Hunter should be the centre of our shipbuilding industry—but what happened? Immediately after the announcement of this $2 million—and their last con 
 tract was building frigate modules for the Australian Navy—what did this government do? It made an agreement with the New Zealand government. So now those modules are being built in New Zealand and brought back to Australia. That is what has happened—that is one.</para><para>This next one is the one that I said had been announced four times—$1.5 million for a heavy vehicle education and service centre, and there is still no action 20 months down the track. Thirdly—and this is a beauty—$3 million to relocate Comm Steel, the ANI stainless steel manufacturing plant, from Waratah to Kooragang Island. What do we find? We find that that particular industry has been sold. ANI no longer owns it, Smorgon now owns it, and it is highly unlikely that that upgrade will go ahead—20 months down the track.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DK6</name.id><name role="metadata">HOCKEY</name><name role="display">Mr Hockey</name></talker><para>—What have you done?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Horne, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HORNE</name></talker><para>—I will tell you what the Labor Party has done for the Hunter.

They have assisted 16 companies, offering a total assistance of $6.348 million, and they have encouraged a total investment in the Hunter region of $389 million.

Let me just relate how one of these 58 staff lost his job at Commonwealth Steel the other day. At a quarter past nine he was visited by a clerk, he was handed a letter, he was handed a cheque, and at half past nine he was unemployed. After 42 years of working there—a graduate engineer who had worked his whole working life, who had never been consulted, had never come to an agreement with the management—his job was taken away from him and, at the age of 60, he is now unemployed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a government that says, `Let's make it easier to sack people.' That is not the problem that this government has to face. That is not the problem confronting Australia today. The problem confronting Australia today is: let's find out how we can get skilled people into work. There are many examples. In the mining industry alone, for instance, the traditional system with Conzinc Rio Tinto is for a couple of security guards to come along 
 to one of their employees when the time has come to tap him on the shoulder and say, `We're reducing our work force; here's your notice.' They will escort you to the crib room; you will pick up your personal belongings and you will leave.</para><para>That is the sort of thing that is happening in the Hunter Valley on a daily basis because of the lack of initiative and foresight of a callous government, and the lack of support for trained, industrious people. All these people want out of life is the right to work, to continue in the job that they already have, and it is being denied them by this government. This government has gone off the rails. It has ignored the dreams that people out there have. The Hunter region has an enormous amount to offer Australia, and the Howard government continues not to support it, and it does so at its peril. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Unemployment: Causes</title><page.no>2716</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2716</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would also like to speak on the issue of unemployment and note that, at present, Australia has one of the strongest economies in the world. It has inflation at the lowest level since the 1960s, business confidence at extremely high levels, a five per cent growth in the economy up to September 1998 and low interest rates. In fact, MIT economist, Paul Krugman, said in the December 1998 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> :</para></talk.start><para>Australia, in case you didn't know, is the miracle economy of the world financial crisis.

We need to have a debate about the causes of unemployment because this is one of the major social and economic issues that we face.

Australia has actually grown faster than that, yet we have not been able to reduce our unemployment rate to the sorts of levels that they are seeing in the United States. So we have the opportunity to solve one of the worst crises facing Australia, but we need to have an honest debate about the causes of unemployment. The coalition has for a long time proposed labour market reform. We are seeing that sort of reform at the moment. Unemployment—there are other things you can do. Reforming the tax system—we are doing that. We are also looking at the interaction of the tax and social security systems.</para><para>One of the key questions in this debate has to be: what does the Labor Party do when faced with a conflict between the national interest and the interests of the trade union movement? The key for New Zealand and the United States is the flexibility of the labour markets in those countries. Unemployment is an issue the coalition has the policies for, whereas the Labor Party is hamstrung by the umbilical cord that connects it to the trade union movement. The job policy they presented during the last election campaign was a joke. You can have a five per cent unemployment rate, but not with the sort of policies that are espoused by the Labor Party.</para><para>Remember 1993? Remember when Paul Keating went to the Australian Institute of Company Directors and told them that it was time to have more flexibility in the labour market? Remember the member for Kingsford-Smith going along with that prescription and the way he was blocked by the union 
 movement? You can tell a lot about the culture of an organisation by its personnel. The Minister for Employment Services correctly identified last week that only two members of the ALP were other than trade union officials, political staffers or public sector employees. That is why Labor MPs are not representative of the Australian community or even of Labor voters. Those are the member for Melbourne's words, not mine.</para><para>Why is the Labor Party so concerned about this debate? The member for Paterson has just talked about jobs for 10 minutes. I do not think he even knows where jobs come from. I think he thinks that jobs come from the largesse of government giving money to industry. Of course they do not.</para><para>Under the present Labor Party, we have a `back to the future' type leadership with the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Whitlam government included Kim Beazley I, and Crean the Elder was the Treasurer. Will the next Labor government be led by Kim Beazley II and Crean the Younger as Treasurer? This is a degree of continuity that you saw more commonly in Westminster in the 18th century rather than in a meritocratic society like Australia's.</para><para>With regard to unemployment, there are differing explanations, and I rely on an article by Ross Gittins in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last November. The neoclassical explanation is that the wage rates are too high and that businesses will substitute capital for labour when wages are too high. The Keynesian explanation is that unemployment is due to deficient demand, and governments can cut taxes, increase spending and cut interest rates to boost demand. The key is whether the elasticities of demand and supply of labour are large or small.</para><para>In 1988, Bill Russell and Warren Tease published a study which measured the elasticities in Australia, based on the empirical evidence of the previous 15 years. They found that a one per cent increase in aggregate demand during one quarter led to a 0.65 per cent increase in employment over 18 months, and a one per cent fall in real labour costs led to a 0.6 per cent rise in employment 
 over 18 months. So both the neoclassical and Keynesian explanations are partly right.</para><para>More recently, Guy Debelle and James Vickery of the Reserve Bank found that slower growth in real wages of about two per cent for a year could lead to a reduction in unemployment of about one per cent. Labor's accord, during the period of their government, saw a fall in real wages and, unfortunately, as wages were determined in a centralised way, there was no increase in productivity. The key to reducing unemployment in a sustained way will be to have a labour market institution which can unlock productivity. Hence you have seen the shift away from collective centralised arbitration to enterprise bargaining.</para><para>Last year five economists wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister with an innovative proposal which seeks to hold award wages steady for four years, which would cause real average wages to be about three to four per cent lower than they would otherwise be. Just by doing that, they said, unemployment would be 1½ to two per cent lower. To answer any equity problems raised by that policy, they suggested tax credits for low income workers, similar to the wage-tax tradeoffs of the accord. They also pointed out that this operates in the micro and the macro levels, the neoclassical and the Keynesian levels.</para><para>The suggestion of the five economists is an important contribution to the debate on unemployment and also to the link between labour market flexibility and employment. We do need to have this debate. It is a debate that the coalition is well poised to have, a debate that the Labor Party will have real problems with. The central question at the moment in Australian politics has to be: what do the Labor Party do when faced with a conflict of interest between what is good for the country, what is good for unemployed people and what is good for the trade union movement. How do they honestly resolve that?</para><para>The member for Werriwa has recognised that labour market flexibility is required to create more jobs. Des Moore gave a paper to the state labour ministers last year, which highlighted the archaic nature of Australia's labour market regulation which the ALP and the ACTU are wedded to.</para><para>The Deakin compact, which characterised Australia's labour market regulation for 90 years, was devised at a time when Australia had one of the highest living standards in the world and there was no social security net. The consequence was a decline in living standards and low productivity levels. Depending on who you believe, Australia commenced the century with the highest or the fourth highest standard of living in the world, and there was a gradual decline during the century. Part of the reason for the decline was the archaic centralised arbitration.</para><para>The institutional framework for workplace relations has pursued other objectives and currently retards growth in productivity and inhibits employment. Reducing minimum wages is not the answer to solving unemployment, but we need to recognise the role the old centralised arbitration framework plays in unemployment. What labour market institutions have delivered has been a higher level of disputes, reflecting the confrontational approach inherent in the system, a higher dispersion of earnings than in some European countries and a falling minimum wage since the mid-1970s. Australia has seven to eight per cent working poor, which is the same as in the USA. That is the social justice of the Labor Party. This is a debate that we need to have. We need to look at why unemployment has dropped so fast in the United States; they are well below the NAIRU. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>South Australian Power Generation Plant</title><page.no>2718</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2718</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish the member for Boothby had mentioned the four per cent of males in the United States who are in prison and the other four per cent who are engaged in petty crime who make their living off the streets.</para></talk.start><para>Along with many of my constituents, it is with dismay and anger that I rise today to express my total frustration and disappointment with the South Australian government. Last week, the South Australian Treasurer announced the successful bid to build South Australia's new power generation plant. That plant is planned to be built in my electorate of Port Adelaide on the Le Fevre Peninsula, at a location called Pelican Point.	I have nothing against locating electricity generating 
 facilities in my electorate. The Port Adelaide electorate has historically been linked to the electricity industry. My electorate is home to the Torrens Island Station, one of South Australia's major power generation facilities.</para><para>This Friday we will also be celebrating the opening of another power generating facility, the Osborne Cogeneration Facility. This facility, built at a cost of $160 million, is capable of producing 180 megawatts of power using combined cycle technology of a gas in combination with a steam turbine. It was built at its location at Osborne specifically to allow the Penrice Soda Products plant, which abuts the power generating facility, to make use of its waste steam in the manufacturing of its products.</para><para>This plant was built in line with world's best practice to comply with the current and future environmental requirements. These requirements include emission levels of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides, noise and, importantly, water discharge. The plant is owned and operated jointly by CU Power and Boral Energy. It uses cooling tower technology so as to minimise the need to return quantities of water to the Port River at much higher temperatures and, therefore, to not affect the ecology of the Port River. That was the requirement of the state government before the application was allowed to proceed.</para><para>The Environment Protection Authority, the regulatory authority responsible to the government, had to be convinced that quantities of hot waste water would not find their way back into the Port River. This is in stark contrast to the Torrens Island Power Station, located on the other side of the Port River and built in the 1960s, which uses the direct cooling method. That means water is pumped from the Port River, used in a heat exchange process to cool the water in the steam generator and then pumped directly back into the river at a higher temperature. This plant was built before environmental standards were introduced. The detrimental effect it has had on the marine ecology of the Port River has been acknowledged by government departments and environmental agencies.</para><para>Only a fool would want to repeat this mistake, yet that is exactly what the South 
 Australian government is doing. It is set to repeat the same mistake without any regard for the consequences. On 30 September 1998, the government opened expressions of interest for a new power station, with the government setting aside land at Pelican Point for that purpose. Torrens Island was ruled out because, as the Treasurer said, it would not sufficiently disperse the warm water and would cause higher temperature increases. He also said the Pelican Point site would pump warm water into Light's Passage, which would be quickly dispersed to avoid high temperature increases damaging the marine environment.</para><para>Yet the government is going to allow some 7½ tonnes of water, or the equivalent of a backyard swimming pool every three seconds, to be put back into the Port River at eight degrees above sea temperature. The government says it will be okay because the temperature will be reduced to within two degrees of sea temperature within a range of 50 to 100 metres.</para><para>When asked whether an alternative site could be possible, the Treasurer said that, given the environmental benefits of a power station at Pelican Point, the chances are likely to be very slim. However, when National Power met with representatives of the local community over the last week, the meeting was told the company not only would look at the possibility of building at Torrens Island but also were not averse to using cooling towers to protect the environment, as they had just completed a project in the United Kingdom doing just this. It was said that there would not be any significant difference in costs compared with the direct cooling system.</para><para>The company are very much concerned that the community concerns are also those of the company. They, as they said, are in the business of building and operating power stations. As the local community would be supportive of the suggested variations and the company had no problems with this it was agreed that the community and the successful bidder would seek a meeting with the Treasurer to resolve this with all parties in agreeance. It would be a win-win situation for 
 all parties involved. But, within an hour of the request for a meeting with the South Australian Treasurer—surprise, surprise!—there was a remarkable turnaround. The company had obviously been nobbled by the South Australian state government and in no uncertain terms told it was Pelican Point or else, and that under no circumstances would anything but a direct method of cooling be allowed. They were told that this stance had to be adopted by the company as a commercial decision if they were to proceed and that there would be no further discussion with the government into this matter.</para><para>One now has to look at the motives of the South Australian government for its rationale in this sordid little affair. The government is arguing that Pelican Point is the most appropriate site for a power station, a power station to be cooled directly with sea water. If you remove the need for direct cooling, you then remove the absolute necessity to use this specific site as the power station. Then, really, it can be situated almost anywhere, with less environmental damage.</para><para>You would also remove the need to use 200,000 cubic metres of sand required to build the site up to make it suitable for a development of this nature. What the state government has been quiet on is the fact that three-quarters of this sand is to be sourced from the West Beach-Glenelg area in the honourable member for Hindmarsh's seat and probably trucked through the suburbs to Pelican Point. I wonder whether she is aware of that. Nothing about the proposal is at all environmentally sensible or economically rational. It seems that National Power is unfortunately caught in the middle of this dopey decision by the state government, and particularly the Treasurer, Mr Lucas.</para><para>While this has been going on, an application subject to public scrutiny has been lodged by a rival bidder to build a power station at the site of the former Osborne Power Station. So far, this seems to have had a fair bit of public support in contrast with the 8,000-odd people who signed a petition to Premier John Olsen against the Pelican Point proposal. They propose to use world's best practices when it comes to gas emissions and 
 noise emissions, and will have no ugly overhead high voltage power lines as power transmission cabling will go underground and under the river to the state's Electranet distribution system on Torrens Island. And, you guessed it, they are quite happy to provide cooling tower technology. So why Pelican Point? Exactly—why indeed? There is, again, speculation of the state government entertaining the idea of a ship breaking industry alongside the power station—this must horrify all members of this federal parliament on both sides—where ships will be brought into man-made canals, broken up and then smeltered on-site. The government's own environmental agencies are very concerned that a proposal of this kind would pose a very dangerous threat to the environment in South Australia.</para><para>The Australian government's Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has, we know, very privately voiced its concerns about the potential threat of disease and pests entering this country.</para><para>One should not forget that the first sighting of the European wasp in South Australia was in the early eighties in Port Adelaide. Nothing was done at the time and we are now in a situation in South Australia where the European wasp is in potential plague proportions. How did the European wasp get into South Australia? Authorities believe that it is quite clear it was by ship. There is a major concern being expressed privately that a similar release of pest or disease might have a devastating effect on primary products in South Australia. The government's record on the Port River and its surrounds has been appalling, yet they allow this situation to manifest itself.</para><para>If the South Australian government cannot get its act together, then I believe there is a case for the federal government, given the Prime Minister's commitment to the Clean Seas Program and improving Australia's river systems, to step in and use its constitutional powers to protect this area of environmental importance. My constituents in Port Adelaide deserve nothing less.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Key Competencies</title><page.no>2720</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2720</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is to the credit of the Howard government that decisive and constructive action is being taken to address the disadvantage faced by people with poor numeracy and literacy skills. The Howard government recognises that some people have been let down by their earlier education and that further investment is required to address the disadvantage these people face in later life. Individuals with poor numeracy and literacy skills face an uphill battle keeping and getting a job, undertaking further training and education or generally fulfilling their potential. We know from recent research that more than half all unemployed people have poor literacy and numeracy skills.</para></talk.start><para>The government's recent mutual obligation announcements represent a genuine commitment to assist those who do not have reading, writing and number skills equivalent to end of primary school-early secondary school standard. Looking forward, the government has secured support for national educational standards that will ensure that current and future students do not slip through the system. Minister Kemp and the Howard government have opened up improved avenues to develop vocational skills for the three-quarters of all young people who do not go on to university.</para><para>The coalition has made more university places available than at any other time in history for young people to gain academic and professional qualifications. Opportunities abound. But what will give our kids the edge they need to take advantage of these opportunities? What will give our kids a head start in the work force of the future and in the global economy? Key competencies will provide the edge. These core and transportable skills enable us to successfully bring together and apply our accumulated training, education, knowledge and life experiences to our careers and general life. In 1992, Eric Mayer and his advisory committee to federal, state and territory ministers of education, vocational education and training reported on how key competencies could be incorporated into the school curriculum. I call on the government, this parliament and the broader community to re-acquaint themselves with the 
 concepts of key competencies and to commit to giving our kids the advantage that they provide.</para><para>We have acted to ensure that our young people do not miss out on the basic preparations for work in later life; now let us work to give this and future generations the edge and the tools to carve out a bright and prosperous place for themselves into the future. Mayer, in 1992, described key competencies as `competencies essential for effective participation in the emerging patterns of work and work organisation'. They focus on the capacity to apply knowledge and skills in an integrated way in work situations. Key competencies are generic in that they apply to work generally rather than being specific to work in particular occupations or industries. This characteristic means that key competencies are not only essential for effective participation in work but are also essential for effective participation in further education and adult life more generally.</para><para>The Mayer committee went on to define these key competencies and to recommend how they could be introduced and assessed within a framework of national standards. Seven key competencies were developed for the Australian context through consultation with employers, educators, parent groups and the broader community. These competencies are: collecting, analysing and organising information; communicating ideas and information; planning and organising activities; working with others and in teams; using mathematical ideas and techniques; solving problems; and using technology. The time available today does not permit me to elaborate on these individual key competencies.</para><para>Key competencies are recognised and promoted as core skills in the United Kingdom, as workplace know-how in the United States and as essential skills in New Zealand. The OECD is also keenly interested in key competencies under the banner of `lifelong learning'. It recognises the challenges of responding to `the changing face of Western societies, and the transformation of labour requires future citizens to master different kinds of skills'. The OECD describes key competencies as `cross curricular competen 
 cies', and has conducted comparative research to produce guiding reports into their feasibility, implementation and assessment within education systems. Key competencies remain the capacities employers such as BP seek when placing employment advertisements, filling job vacancies and considering career progression. They are not just skills that prepare us for employment and support career progression; they are also skills for life and keys to lifelong learning. As such, key competencies have never been more relevant than they are at this time as we enter the new century.</para><para>Domestically, following the work of the Finn committee in 1991 and the Mayer committee in 1992, funding was provided to support the states and territories in piloting and assessing the feasibility of proposals to implement the Mayer recommendations. The key competencies pilot program funded more than 70 exploratory projects around Australia. An evaluation report was produced in December 1996 with the key lesson for the way ahead:</para><para>Key competencies can be taught and learned, assessed and reported. They are compatible with the general educational purpose, complementing rather than displacing existing curriculum, methods of teaching and approaches to assessment. They provide what thoughtful employers say they want and what workers in high performance workplaces actually display and are enjoyed by both teacher and students.</para><para>We must now get on with it. I am happy to be working with the National Industry Education Forum and its director, Anne McLeish, in taking the available research and lessons from the forum's own work to develop an innovative proposal to implement key competencies more widely in our secondary schools. We propose a nationally significant initiative to stimulate Australian senior secondary students to strive to achieve their personal best performance in all walks of life. I have raised the proposal with Minister Kemp.</para><para>By drawing from examples and experiences from the sporting sector and the link of self-evaluation as a key to sporting success, we plan to expand student understanding and the use of key competencies. High profile sporting personalities will draw attention to the 
 concepts and the resource material to be produced and help to show how key competencies have a relevance and a role well beyond the school. Competencies can be developed and demonstrated across traditional curriculum streams and in the wider experience and interests of a person. Personal interests and pursuits can demonstrate to employers and educators key competencies a young person has developed and successfully applied.</para><para>The project is important in its own right but more so when positioned alongside the other leading initiatives the Howard government has implemented in the areas of school-to-work transition and equipping our young people with the tools they need for a successful future. While the development of key competencies is not just about schooling or purely a job for the educators, our education system needs to play a leading role in informing students about the key competency approach. The self-awareness and evaluation skills this develops during school years provides the means for lifelong learning and its natural extension and application into the work force and community life.</para><para>Today I call on this House and the governments of our Federation to support the full implementation of the key competencies framework and the latest initiative of the National Industry Education Forum. With this support, we can provide skills for life for our kids, develop the personal insights which will enhance their quality of life and contribution to our nation and tool them up for satisfying and rewarding working lives. That is a legacy we can be proud to leave the current and future generations.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth Wages</title><title>House Procedures</title><page.no>2722</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2722</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Quite coincidentally to the earlier debate on the member for Chifley's motion, I want to use this opportunity to speak on the procedures of this place that are undermining not only public respect for parliament but I suspect respect among members on both sides of this House as well. Last week we saw the government introduce their pre-emptive legislation 
 on youth employment. Not only did this bill treat with contempt the procedures set in train by earlier workplace legislation for an Industrial Relations Commission inquiry but also the minister was prepared to cut debate on this important issue.</para></talk.start><para>Before I speak on the procedures of this place, I want to put on record at least some of the points I wanted to raise in the so-called debate on the youth wages bill. That bill seeks to permanently exempt junior wages under federal awards from the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. I ask: why all the urgency? The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is not required to hand down its report until June this year. Under the current Workplace Relations Act, junior wage rates remain exempted until 22 June 2000. To pre-empt that process is bad enough, but to gag debate on it at the same time and not even transfer it to the Main Committee shows a double contempt for the role of legislators in this place.</para><para>That is why I oppose this bill. Bring it on after the IRC report and I would be prepared to accept the independent advice that body offers. I have got no problem with any legislation genuinely designed to help young people find and keep jobs. But, before considering this legislation, we should have been given the opportunity to let the Industrial Relations Commission tell us whether youth wages are the panacea or whether perhaps a base rate with a competency element is the answer. We do not yet know, and I always vote on principle against a tactic which rams through laws without proper discussion and treats the industrial referee in this case, the Industrial Relations Commission, with such contempt. 	The way the government is handling this matter is similar to the way it handled the unfair dismissal exemption for small business and the waterfront dispute. While I agree wholeheartedly with the principle behind the amended unfair dismissal legislation, and indeed supported it, and the need for reform on the docks, there are ways and ways of doing things. Trying to sneakily push the unfair dismissal reform through the Senate in the form of regulations when lacking a majority is not the way to do things. 
 Colluding with big business and vested interest groups to set up false competition and then using taxpayers' money, at least initially, to fund the resulting redundancies was not the Australian way to go about achieving reform on the waterfront.</para><para>Just as the government is now showing its contempt for the Industrial Relations Commission, it shows its contempt for the parliamentary system in its handling of the unfair dismissal laws and the shonky games it is willing to play in the name of labour market reform. If we wait, as we should, for the IRC report, there is evidence from Australia and overseas suggesting that wages are not the only factor affecting the employment of young people. In America, for example, there is no junior wage except for the first 90 days of employment. After that 90 days the young worker must be paid the adult minimum wage of $US5.15 an hour. Apparently young workers are kept on after the 90 days. Youngsters apparently do have special aptitudes—wages are not the only factor in US employment of juniors. Further, in both America and Australia, while the wage costs of young people working full-time have dropped in recent times, so has their full-time employment. The fact is that wages for full-time young workers in Australia, like their American counterparts, have been falling in recent times, but still we have not seen employers preferring young people to adults.</para><para>We have to look deeper at the causes of the youth employment problem. We have to look at the type of young people who are unemployed. As Ross Gittins pointed out recently, the figure of 28 per cent, now 24 per cent, youth unemployment bandied around is misleading. Rather than one in three young people being unemployed, the reality is that it is more like one in 15. He says in his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 4 February:</para><para>The fundamental reason unemployment is somewhat higher among teenagers is the dramatic decline in employers' demand for young, unskilled, full-time labour. Over the past 15 years the number of full-time jobs held by teenagers has declined by 60 per cent. The main explanation for this is technological change. Many of the menial jobs once done by teenagers are now done by machines, 
 and employers hire older and more highly educated young people . . .</para><para>The fact is that while wages are no doubt a factor, the issues are much deeper than simply a matter of wage costs. In the end, the real answer lies in the education system. We cannot allow students to come out of school lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills. It is too late in year 7 to teach the basics. The focus has to be on primary school years, even on preprimary years. The government needs to go further to address the underlying causes of youth unemployment and unemployment generally.</para><para>For first year apprentices, rental assistance is available. In the absence of policies creating employment in depressed regional areas, what is needed is financial assistance for young people to allow them to move from depressed regional areas to those with greater opportunity. Wages can be kept low but young people still have to be able to survive. At the same time, we cannot allow students who get into university or TAFE straight out of school not to attend university simply because their parents' income falls over some arbitrary income line. We need to set up low interest loan schemes for these families so that their children at least have the option of pursuing their dreams. These are the real issues—skilling and enabling young people so that they can access the labour market. No wage level, however low it is, will open up opportunities if basic skills are not there. These were some of the points I hoped to raise in the debate last week.</para><para>Let me briefly detail some urgent reforms that would bring a degree of real debate and decency to this House. Last budget, $340 million was allocated to run this place. This House and the other place will sit for a combined 98 days. It is costing $3 million per sitting day to run parliament. I question whether the people of Australia are getting value for money in the standard of debate which is invariably served up. I will say a lot more about the cost of government in this country at a later date. Let me concentrate here on necessary reforms to deliver meaningful debate and proper opportunity for representatives in this chamber.</para><para>Second reading speeches by ministers could easily be reduced to 20 minutes maximum, as should the opposition reply. Second reading contributions by members should be restricted to 10 minutes. How often does one hear repetitive rambling contributions from both sides? How often are they predictable repetitions of party platform with little passion and much pap?</para><para>Another suggested reform from several coalition members is the scrapping of the speaking list. This would ensure attendance in the parliament by those interested in the debate, with members standing to receive the Speaker's call. This should ensure proper reflection on opposing points of view and a closer resemblance to true debate. And finally, reform of the farce we call `Questions Without Notice'. Question time for the government is a time for ministerial statements and back slapping. For opposition backbenchers, it is a time of frustration as frontbenchers hog the available time. For government backbenchers, I can only sense that it is equally frustrating as people who have built up strong leadership reputations—indeed, as former ministers in other parliaments—in their various communities and so on are reduced to reading prepared questions for this minister or that. The member for Chifley placed a sensible motion on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> calling for logical reforms to question time. It was debated today, unfortunately with a host of other important motions that required far more consideration.</para><para>What government will be bold enough to reform question time so that kids in the galleries are not left with shouted vitriolic exchanges as their sole image of parliament? If we are serious about restoring public faith in the political process, we must televise all parliament, not just question time. One of the upcoming digital public broadcast channels should be devoted to a coordinated coverage of debate, committee hearings and question time in both houses. Then we might see a lift in the standard of debate, question time placed in its proper context and a far more public scrutiny of all of us in action. Unless we allow more contribution by members in debate, unless we make that debate more relevant, unless we enable the tactics of 
 government and opposition—gag and censure, and so on—to be properly scrutinised, we cannot plead that the public is unfairly critical of its politicians.</para><para>The current system—the contempt of the major parties when in government for the parliamentary process—ensures that the public's criticism, from this independent perspective, is very soundly based.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Literacy and Numeracy Skills</title><page.no>2724</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2724</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, De-Anne, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs DE-ANNE KELLY</name><name.id>FK6</name.id><electorate>Dawson</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Only last weekend, the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline>  reported that a major national survey of 3,206 employers by the leading recruitment company Morgan and Banks had revealed that 63.5 per cent of those surveyed believed that secondary schools did not prepare students adequately for the work force. The joint managing director of that company, Mr Geoff Morgan, was quoted as saying that employers had identified that one of the main areas they believed was being neglected was English.</para></talk.start><para>It is nothing short of a national disgrace and a national tragedy that our school systems are so demonstrably failing to prepare so many young people for the realities of the workplace. If the evidence was not so stark and so compelling, it would almost beggar belief that any young person could pass through 12 years of primary and secondary education without gaining a reasonable level of literacy skills.</para><para>In a report released only earlier this month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that an astounding almost 44 per cent of all Australians aged 15 to 64 in 1996 had `poor or very poor prose literacy skills' in English `and could be expected to experience some or considerable difficulties in using many of the printed materials encountered in daily life.' It would probably be true to say that those with poor literacy skills suffer equally because of poor numeracy skills. Difficulty with what has been traditionally referred to as `the three Rs' is directly reflected in unemployment rates. Again, I quote from the ABS survey:</para><para>Labour force participation rates in 1996 were higher for persons with good or very good skills in literacy. For instance, 86 per cent of those with good or very good prose skills were in the labour 
 force compared to 60 per cent of those with very poor prose skills.</para><para>A recent article co-authored by Professor Paul Miller of the Economics Department at the University of Western Australia and a visiting American academic concluded:</para><para>There is a negative relationship between unemployment rates and literacy/numeracy skill levels; that is, unemployment rates tend to rise as the level of literacy and numeracy falls.</para><para>Professor Miller and his colleague also concluded:</para><para>. . . it would appear that language and literacy skills are major determinants of occupation attainment, and the effect is larger for women than for men.</para><para>A report dated July 1997, by Mr Stephen Lamb for the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, looked at school achievement and initial education and labour market outcomes. It was based on a study of 2,128 16-year-olds interviewed for the first time in 1991 and 1992. The findings related to their experiences until the age of 19. The study found, and I quote:</para><para>Young people who experience the longest periods of unemployment in their teenage years are those who possess the weakest literacy and numerary skills and job seekers with weak numerary and literacy skills are also more likely to experience long-term unemployment.</para><para>The report went on:</para><para>One of the main effects of poor numeracy and literacy skills is longer periods of unemployment. The data suggests that job seekers with poor numeracy and literacy skills spend considerably longer periods of time unemployed. The average time unemployed of males with very low levels of reading  achievement is 24 per cent compared to 14 per cent for average achievers and 12 per cent for high achievers. The gaps are even wider across the J erect levels of numerary achievement.</para><para>Thus, the relationship between unemployment and poor literacy and numeracy skills is beyond any doubt. Since its election in 1996, the government has launched an integrated and comprehensive strategy to improve the teaching of basic skills in our schools, and that is to be applauded. However, for those who have already passed through the school system and who have emerged with poor levels of comprehension that strategy sadly 
 has come too late. There was a risk that large numbers of young people who lack these fundamental skills could have been the lost generation, condemned to long-term unemployment with only a dim hope of gaining relatively poorly paid and unskilled work intermittently.</para><para>The government, however, has recognised this appalling state of affairs which we inherited from our ALP predecessors. And the Prime Minister, in his federation address on 28 January this year, spelt out the government's policy and commitment. I quote from that speech:</para><para>I commit my government to requiring young people who fail basic literacy and numeracy tests to undertake appropriate remedial courses if they are to continue to receive their full dole. Previously, young people on the dole were able to satisfy their obligation by taking up one of a number of options. But I believe, and most Australians would agree, that reading and writing properly are the most fundamental prerequisites for getting a job.</para><para>I could not agree more. Certainly, this announcement has been widely welcomed as a clear, positive recognition that this coalition government will not abandon young people who—often through no fault of their own—find getting a good job near to impossible.</para><para>The details of the scheme—outlined by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs—gives flesh and blood to the Prime Minister's announcement. Access to literacy and numeracy assessment and training is being extended to all unemployed people who have poor skills and who are on youth allowance or Newstart allowance, and to sole parents participating in the Jobs, Education and Training Strategy—otherwise known as JET. Under mutual obligation, the government contracted 69 education and community organisations across the country for three years to provide basic literacy and numeracy training. Eligible job seekers will receive up to 400 hours of training over a period of up to 40 weeks. Access to the Career Counselling Program is also being extended to all job seekers on youth allowance and Newstart allowance and to all young people aged 15 to 20 years who are referred by Centrelink.</para><para>It should be understood that the level of skills set as the benchmark is level 3 on the 
 national reporting framework, which is defined as the standard that could be broadly expected of a student who has completed the end of primary school or early high school.</para><para>This is not some sort of heavy-handed, big brother attempt to abolish the dole for those unemployed who have failed to achieve advanced postgraduate degrees but rather an enlightened and genuinely caring initiative.</para><para>I referred earlier to the study by Professor Paul Miller and his colleague. That study also revealed that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of those who spoke English as their first language rated their reading, writing and mathematical skills as either excellent or good.</para><para>In the face of all of the evidence, this finding is both sad and illuminating. There is an understandable reluctance among people to admit to a weakness in basic skills, to the point obviously of self-delusion. Nobody wants to admit that they have trouble dealing with the everyday demands of life. Can you imagine the difficulties for these people, such as notes from school which are unable to be read by the child's parent? How do they use ATMs to take cash out or read instructions on a medicine bottle? How do they catch a bus or even read the bus timetable? How do they read bills or even pay them? How do they budget for household goods, read the telephone book or read instructions for infant formulas? Everyday things that all of us take for granted are obviously beyond the means of many of these folk.</para><para>This is an admission by the government that every Australian matters; no Australian is on the scrap heap. Every Australian matters and every Australian will have the opportunity to pick up the necessary literacy and numeracy skills not only to obtain a job but also to enjoy life to the full in what really is an age of the information superhighway. In the age of the superhighway we cannot abandon Australians who cannot even read the signposts at the end of the street. I am very pleased to be a part of a government that recognises that every Australian matters.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Army Reserve</title><page.no>2726</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2726</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the press releases over the Christmas period emanated from the minister opposite. He greeted Australia with the headline: `Christmas Recruitment Opportunities with Reserves'. His activity was not for no reason, because what has occurred is that a combination of the changes in the process of reserves' induction and the interface with workplace relations changes by this government has led to very serious problems in recruitment targets for the reserves. It is interesting that in its 1996 defence election policy the incoming coalition government then promised to `accelerate moves to introduce legislation protecting the civilian employment of reserves called out for war as well as in situations short of war.' So the rhetoric of 1996 was that they were going to protect people who gave up their time to serve in Australia's reserves. The reality has indeed been in stark contrast. As I say, it is having a very real impact.</para></talk.start><para>Under Minister Reith's Workplace Relations Act, leave for service in the reserves was removed as an allowable matter for industrial awards last July. The practical outcome of that is that unions and employees, essentially, will find it increasingly difficult to defend those conditions. It is interesting to note that the former Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Mrs Bishop, actually confirmed these problems, and that was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 11 February 1998. In correspondence to the then acting federal president of the Armed Forces Federation she volunteered:</para><para>I am well aware of the threat to reserve training as a possible outcome of the Workplace Relations Act, and my office is monitoring the issue closely. The ADF position and concerns are being well represented by the Office of the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Reserves) who is actively pursuing the issue. I am optimistic of a favourable long term outcome.</para><para>I guess the question is how long term she was talking about. Certainly, the figures are not too good for the coalition, not too good for the Armed Forces, and not too good for those people who believe that the reserves fulfil a valuable role in this country.</para><para>Typical of what is occurring is Telstra management's recent indications that the matter of leave from Telstra for people in the reserves was `under review.' The indication, as I understand it, from the people who contacted Telstra, was that there would probably be a reduction from six weeks to two weeks allowable leave. This is not too helpful, given the fact that the government has decided that Army Reserve recruits will now be required to undertake six weeks of full-time, common induction training. Quite frankly, very few employers are going to be jumping off buildings in joy about the possibility of allowing people to go for this six-week break.</para><para>This government is simultaneously attempting to diminish the powers of awards and agreements to essentially put a bit more pressure on employers to allow employees the time off when the employer is reluctant to do so. The fact of life is that changes in the work force in this country mean that, even among their fellow employees, there is a greater degree of antagonism and a greater degree of questioning by the employee as to whether they can basically carry the burden of the job with downsizing. Even if we accepted for the moment, for the sake of argument, the government's rhetoric about featherbedding in the Public Service, et cetera, the reality is that there is decreased employment throughout this economy in various workplaces. As I said, people are not too keen to see Billy Bloggs walk out for six weeks. That is why there is all the more reason to have protection for people.</para><para>It is therefore little wonder that Minister Scott grandly announced that the Army Reserve currently had 4,500 vacancies. He was of course very keen to try to put a bit of upswing to that situation. The point is that, according to him, `the quality of training received by Reserve recruits has improved and it has been made more attractive to potential recruits'—despite the fact that they are staying away in droves. He also made the point—or what he thought was the point—that, of those who do continue to join the reserves, the success rate in their passing the training course had increased from 80 per cent 
 to 94 per cent. So, as he points out, there are greatly reduced numbers of people entering the reserves.</para><para>Those still determined enough are going to be a very different group of people from the normal intake of reserves. The fact that they are persevering, that they are getting encouragement from their employers, when the government is basically deleting this requirement from awards and agreements, means that you are likely to get a better percentage getting through the course. That is a reality.</para><para>To hang your hat on the quality of training for those who do get it, and the fact that the success rate is greater, is not much comfort for those people who look at the overall situation. So the Minister's reassurance of 17 January last was perhaps not as important as his pre-Christmas greeting that the Christmas period is a great time to join up, because of the very low uptake of late.</para><para>The situation is that media reports late last year revealed that in every state the Army was massively behind with its recruitment target for the reserves. Indeed, in four states it apparently reached less than a third of the target. It might be very comforting that the few that are getting through are quite capable and have good outcomes, and that the training per se is better for those who get through this induction period, but one has to question whether that really is the aim of the game.</para><para>More recently, on 12 January 1999, the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> reported that only 71 people had been recruited into the reserves locally since last June. That represented less than 55 per cent of the local target. The same publication ran a further article on 18 January headed `Army Reserve recruits down' in which a reserves official—remaining anonymous—was quoted as saying:</para><para>We need the government to change the recruitment policy before the reserve falls over.</para><para>So the press releases of the minister really do not give a full picture of how serious the situation is becoming. The problem in that city is compounded by the local member who, unfortunately, has the mistaken impression that these provisions protecting people's rights to take time off for the reserves never existed—this is despite the fact that the former 
 Minister for Defence, Industry Science and Personnel said that her department was monitoring the problem, and despite the fact that she had indicated that there was a concern about recruitment levels because of the changes instigated by Minister Reith in our workplace situation. The local member up there says that there were never any such provisions in awards. Therefore, one has to question what exactly the then minister was monitoring.</para><para>These cuts to part-time service are on top of the coalition's deliberate cuts in full-time positions under the Defence reform program, and the impact on numbers that has been occasioned by contracting out. It is no surprise that the morale overall in the Defence Force is now at such a low ebb.</para><para>In another article by Dennis Quick it talks about the appointment of Brigadier Ian Flawith as the leader of Townsville's 11th Brigade Army Reserve. That article quotes the Brigadier as saying:</para><para>However, while our numbers are somewhat down on other years, it is yet early days. I'll be working through every available process to ensure that any long term problems are highlighted and overcome.</para><para>So he at least, unlike the local member, indicated that maybe there was a little problem around the place with regard to this matter and that maybe the numbers had reached alarming degrees. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Strahan, James Jasper: Death</title><title>Australia Day Awards</title><page.no>2728</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2728</page.no><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RONALDSON</name><name.id>XT4</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have two matters to raise this afternoon. Firstly, I seek to grieve in the true sense of the word—and that is a matter that brings me great sorrow. I also wish to speak about a matter which brings me great joy. It is appropriate to turn first to the matter that gives me great sorrow—and one which, indeed, gives great sorrow to a great many Australians. It regards young James Dean Sette—or, as his adopting parents hoped he would be called, James Jasper Strahan. James was a 15-month-old boy from Daylesford in my electorate. I think Australians have been watching with their hearts in their mouths in the last week to see whether or not James was alive. As we 
 are aware, unfortunately the body of baby James was found in Moama last Friday.</para></talk.start><para>I want to pay tribute to young James today and, on behalf of this parliament, to pass on our condolences to Fiona Strahan and Jack Gilding. They are two young Australians who live in my electorate and they were going to be James's new parents some time this week. Words cannot describe the horror that they went through last week when their 15-month-old soon-to-be son went missing. I do not want to comment on the circumstances surrounding his disappearance, for obvious reasons, and nor is it appropriate to do so today.</para><para>I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members when I say to Jack and Fiona that they are very much in our thoughts. In Daylesford on Saturday night 400 people celebrated the life of baby James. I am sure a lot of members of this House have heard of Daylesford, but they might not have heard of a place called Korweinguboora, which is where Jack and Fiona live. Members probably think of Daylesford as a town that is, quite rightly, known throughout Australia as a tourist destination that is second to none.</para><para>However, members might not be aware that Daylesford is a close-knit country community. Some 400 people held a vigil on Saturday night to mourn baby James Strahan and to tell Fiona and Jack that they had someone there who cared about them, who cared that they had gone through sheer hell that week, and to mourn with them for the loss of a young boy who had been part of the family—not officially, but unofficially—for quite some time, and whom they regarded as their own. From speaking to people in Daylesford, I know that Fiona and Jack were looking forward to a very happy life.</para><para>I would like to read from the death notice in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>, as I think it is appropriate that it be read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. It says:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">STRAHAN</inline> .—James Jasper, Nov. 7, 1997—Feb. 7, 1999</para><para>May your heart always be joyful,</para><para>May your song always be sung.</para><para>You will stay forever young. 
</para><para>Deeply loved adopted son of Fiona and Jack, loving grandson of Helen and Ron Strahan and Ruth Gilding, adored nephew of Alison, Larry, Lee, Linda, Paul, Michelle, Tony and Rei, special cousin of Tara, Jasper, Asher, Callan, and Matilda, Godchild of Patricia and Ian. Loved child of the Korweinguboora and Daylesford communities.</para><para>So beautiful, so delightful, so special. You lived life to the full and expected those around you to do the same. You have changed us all. You were too young. We were so lucky.</para><para>What extraordinary pain for two special people to go through: first, that week when they did not have their baby with them, and now that loss. With some pride, I say to the House today that I know that the communities of Korweinguboora and Daylesford will look after this young couple. I have no doubt that Fiona and Jack will be helped through what they are going through at the moment by a community that cares. One thing that makes us in this House as one is the great pride we share in that special Australian spirit where, when there is adversity, we all work together.</para><para>I think it is a great shame that the members of the Australian community do not necessarily see this House as being part of that as well—a place where we can collectively mourn today the loss of this child and where we can collectively grieve for two young Australians who have lost someone special. Seeing 400 people gather at short notice in Daylesford on Saturday night to look after two other Australians is something that we should be proud of.</para><para>That approach of many Australians is, as I said before, one that is very much part and parcel of this Australian parliament. I know that my views are shared by both the members of the opposition and the members of the government, who have seen these young people go through absolute hell in the last week and who will see this young couple go through extraordinarily difficult times in that grieving process.</para><para>In the time that is left to me I want to talk about something else that I think is proudly Australian, and that is the mighty band of people who on Australia Day are rewarded both nationally and locally. In my own electorate on Australia Day, Dr Norm Castle received the Order of Australia Medal, Mr 
 Jack Sewell was made a Member of the Order of Australia and Mr Bruce Fowkes was given the Public Service Medal. Right throughout the municipalities in my electorate, there were citizens who were thanked by their communities for doing something special.</para><para>I think the greatest difficulty for any community is to go out and pick a person and say that their contribution has been better than someone else's. It is an extraordinarily difficult situation for any mayor or shire president who really has to drive that process. But the city of Ballarat chose a wonderful lady, Mrs Gail Elsey, as citizen of the year. This is a mother who lost a child through cancer. Gail has been putting in 28 hours a day to make sure that others hopefully will not go through what she and her family did. A young man, Jacob Hewitt, was the young citizen of the year. He is a very special young man.</para><para>I am running out of time so I will go through the others quickly. In the Pyrenees shire, Mrs Pat Briody was the citizen of the year and Miss Carol Dean was the young citizen. In the Golden Plains shire, Mr Ken Maybery was citizen of the year and Mr Scott Lyner was the young citizen. In the Moorabool shire, Mr Len Murfett was citizen of the year and Miss Tina Macumber was the young citizen of the year. In the Hepburn shire, Sergeant Gary Chandler was citizen of the year. In the Northern Grampians shire, Ms Sophie Dunn was citizen of the year.</para><para>These people who received awards in my electorate are great Australians. They will not be on the front pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline>, but they are very special people.

One of those is for $10 million for payment to the Northern Territory for continuation of the Northern Territory Health Indigenous Infrastructure Program to improve living conditions and health standards for indigenous people. The second is a figure of $19 million which, as you will recall, was and remains the cause of a lot of political discussion around this country and in this parliament. It is $19 million for a community education and information program on reform to the Australian tax system.</para></talk.start><para>Let me first address the issue of Aboriginal health. I want to put my remarks in the context of what are seen as being important matters in relation to the overall position in terms of average Aboriginal health. What I would firstly like to do is to give some information about basic indices, which give us a very firm idea of how disadvantaged Aboriginal people are in terms of health generally.</para><para>The statistics are pretty well known to most of us, although I fear that the fact that they are well known does not mean that we necessarily react positively to providing appropriate ways to ameliorate those poor health standards. Of course, the figures will vary across Australia depending on circumstances and location. It is that issue of location that will become very important later in this debate for me as I talk about the impact of the second item—that is, the $19 million for the community education program in relation to a GST and what the GST means for people who live in the bush.</para><para>Life expectancy for Aboriginal people is 20 years less than for non-Aboriginal Australians. Life expectancy of Aboriginal people is considerably worse than for other comparable indigenous populations, such as the native peoples of the United States and Canada, and 
 the Maoris of Aotearoa. Aboriginal boys born today have only a 45 per cent chance of living to the age of 65. Aboriginal girls have a 54 per cent chance of living to the age of 65. Age standardised death rates for Aboriginal males are 2.8 times those for non-Aboriginal males. Age standardised death rates for Aboriginal females are 3.3 times those for non-Aboriginal females.</para><para>Aboriginal people suffer from certain health conditions at a much higher rate than non-Aboriginal people. For example, Aboriginal people have diabetes at a rate 12 to 17 times the non-Aboriginal population. The figure for renal disease is 17.4 times that for the non-Aboriginal population.</para><para>Just as an example, of the 64 clients of the Alice Springs renal dialysis unit, 63 at the time these figures were collected—the end of last year—were Aboriginal people. That is a very clear indication of the poor state of Aboriginal health. Health care funding is a very important element of the way in which we address these issues, but it must be funding built within a framework of a comprehensive health policy designed to ameliorate these poor health outcomes.</para><para>Despite the greater burden of death and illness that Aboriginal people bear, and contradicting popular misconception, huge amounts of money are not being thrown at the problem. In 1995-96, 2.19 per cent of all Australian recurrent health expenditure was on indigenous Australians—that is only eight per cent higher per capita than for other Australians, despite the vastly greater burden of illness. Unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of this money is spent on expensive end-stage hospital or similar care. Across Australia 55 per cent of health expenditure on Aboriginal people is for hospital care. This amounts to about $1,218 per indigenous person per year spent on hospital care. This is twice the expenditure on non-Aboriginal people in hospitals, which is only $604 per year.</para><para>On the other hand, for every $1 that non-Aboriginal Australians access through Medicare, Aboriginal Australians receive 27c. For every $1 that non-Aboriginal Australians get from the pharmaceutical benefits fund, the 
 PBS scheme, Aboriginal Australians get 22c. So you can see that there is a huge disparity in the way we apply these services to indigenous Australians.</para><para>The Commonwealth health department through its Aboriginal health section funds Aboriginal primary health care services, which goes some way toward compensating for the lack of Aboriginal access to MBS and PBS funds. However, the level of primary health care expenditure for Aboriginal people is still approximately $100 per person per year less than the national average of $600 per year. That says to me that we have been fed a lot of misconceptions about the way in which health care dollars are spent in this country and about the way in which governments, despite the rhetoric, have been addressing the problems. And I say that not only about this government but also about the previous Labor government and governments before it. Frankly, we have not been doing a good enough job. Despite the scare campaigns and denigrating insults which are made of indigenous Australians generally around issues related to health—that it is their responsibility—it is very clear when you look at the figures that we as a nation have not accepted our share of that responsibility in ensuring that we provide appropriate resources so that they can address the appalling state of Aboriginal health.</para><para>We need to understand in that context the vast need for dollars to be spent on indigenous health in this country. That is demonstrated clearly by the morbidity and mortality statistics which I have already referred to.</para><para>Measured against need, expenditure on Aboriginal health is clearly and totally inadequate. The clearest way to address this inequity is to ensure Aboriginal access to the large mainstream funding sources of MBS and PBS. That is a challenge to this government—to come up with a way in which they can properly resource Aboriginal communities, and indeed the Northern Territory government in this instance, through the MBS and PBS schemes. Unless we do, we are denying indigenous Australians a fair shake. We are denying them the possibility that some of the appalling health data that I have already 
 referred to can be improved. That means there is a responsibility on all of us.</para><para>As I say, I am sorry about the poor outcomes under the previous Labor government—they should have been far better. But because they should have been better under the previous Labor government is no excuse for not doing anything now. My concern is that I do not believe this government is sincere enough or fair dinkum enough about these issues to make a difference. But there is a challenge, and I hope to see them meet that challenge. I certainly know that there are proposals in hand to deal with the MBS and PBS issues and I know that those ideas will come to the federal government. I know that there is widespread support from the community based health services in the Northern Territory which are working in concert with the Northern Territory health department about a proposal which will deal with these issues.</para><para>When we are talking about what is required for good health, we need to understand that there is a matrix of things that we need to address. The first, which is not new to me but I think is new to a lot of the bureaucrats and politicians who make judgments about important issues relating to Aboriginal health, is that we need to have an approach to Aboriginal health which is holistic and which addresses a range of needs—the first of which is identity. It is important that you know who you are, what your relationship with others is, what your relationship with the land is and what your culture is. That is fundamental. Yet we have had debates in this country over recent years in relation to native title—and they will emerge again over issues to do with the Northern Territory Land Rights Act—where those very things have been questioned. I had cause last week to discuss in this place the understanding that we non-indigenous Australians have of indigenous Australians. We need to contemplate these things in far more detail.</para><para>The second is access to health services—primary health care, hospitals and specialist services. The third is economic activity—being active in the process of living, looking after your country, having a job, caring for 
 your family and the community. I note that the minister is at the table. At some point I would like to have a discussion with him about the failure of his programs to deal with those particular issues in relation to Aboriginal communities in remote Australia. I can give him the detail; I can give him chapter and verse. While I am on the subject of remote communities, I will deal very quickly with another matter and come back to this discussion in a moment.</para><para>We discovered from the Senate estimates last week that the concept of mutual obligation extends only to people who live within 90 miles—it should have been 90 kilometres, I am sure—from a government office that deals with these issues. One presumes this is a Centrelink office. Under questioning in the Senate, this was said:</para><para>Under the existing mutual obligation rules, people who have to travel more than 90 miles are exempt. But you would certainly be offered the option and, as I explained a little while ago, there are two distance learning providers available in the Northern Territory. I would very much hope that the Centrelink office that was dealing with that person in question . . . </para><para>Let me say to you that that is absolute fairyland stuff. The truth of the matter is that mutual obligation to this government means, `We'll give you money, and we'll make you do things, provided we do not have to pay more to make you do them.' In other words, `If we have to provide program dollars to assist you to train to get the skills we say you need and you live outside of 90 kilometres from Alice Springs, forget it, you won't get them.'</para><para>We know already that the Job Network does not provide services to people who live in 90 per cent of the Northern Territory. Basically, it is not covered. So, if you are an Aboriginal person living in the remote areas of the Northern Territory and you are unemployed or on CDP, forget having access to government programs, you just will not have it.</para><para>This issue of mutual obligation and the importance of literacy and numeracy applies only to areas where the government believes it wants to spend money. It is clearly not prepared to spend the money where it is most 
 needed: on the people who are most disadvantaged in the labour force, the most impoverished people in this nation—those people who live in these remote communities. They have the worst literacy rates and they have the worst educational outcomes, but this government has chosen by dint of the way in which it expressed its policies, and by the way it is funding and administering them, to ignore their plight.</para><para>The Labor Party accepts—indeed, it promoted—the idea of mutual obligation, but we put in place the programs and we funded those programs. We put in place officers to travel to those communities and service those clients, and it has all been taken away by this government. So, when we are dealing with Aboriginal health in the context of their lifestyle and the ability of Aboriginal people to get a job, it has been taken away effectively by the mismanagement of this issue by the government.</para><para>Having appropriate infrastructure that suits the way people live—housing, shelter, et cetera—is important. Education appropriate to community need and culture is also important. That is an issue which I would like to come back to, but I do not have time to today. It is very much in the same vein as the way this government is dealing with the issue of employment and the issue of the labour market.</para><para>Good tucker is very important—access to bush tucker and healthy store food is especially important for kids to grow into healthy adults. Then there is the need for an active men's and women's culture. Last, but not least, political leadership and the ability to negotiate with the authorities imposed upon Aboriginal people is very important, yet we see this government basically ignoring its advisory body, ATSIC, on these issues, and that body passing a motion of no confidence in the current minister.</para><para>I want to pay particular attention to the issue of food. Clearly, one of the issues which is very important is nutrition. If we want to improve health outcomes in Aboriginal communities, we must make sure that there is adequate nutrition. But the government has now proposed a tax regime which will effec 
 tively marginalise further these people. We know already that there are Aboriginal people in Northern and Central Australia who go without food some days of the week because of the costs that are involved in purchasing those products.</para><para>Last year the Northern Territory Department of Health undertook a survey of Northern Territory remote community stores. They did some very interesting pricing analyses and the difference in the price of goods in these remote Aboriginal community stores from the price of goods in Darwin and in the other major capital cities. The surveys were carried out in April and July last year in 45 stores throughout the Northern Territory. Bear in mind this was not done by me but by professionals in the Department of Health in the Northern Territory. The total basket was adjusted to meet what was perceived to be 100 per cent of the nutrient requirements and 95 per cent of the energy requirements of this population. On average, there were seven different choices of fruit and 12 different choices of vegetables in community stores. The total basket average costs in communities was $484, which compared with a Darwin price of  $329. So we had a difference between Darwin and these communities of 47 per cent. So, if you live in a remote Aboriginal community, you are being asked to pay 47 per cent more for fruit and vegetables than if you live in Darwin.</para><para>But that is not the end of it. I have more—like the Demtel salesman, like these people when they are trying to flog us a GST, telling us what benefits are going to accrue out of this momentous tax they say will be great for the nation. It will not be great for these people. The difference between the costs of buying those same commodities in these Aboriginal controlled community stores—the 45 of them around the Northern Territory—and the costs of the same products in Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra is 61 per cent. The total family basket would cost 61 per cent more than the average across all capital cities.</para><para>The fruit and vegie component, which for the purposes of this debate on health is a very important component, would increase massively under a GST. In the Katherine district, 
 it would be 92 per cent more than the average across the capital cities, and in east Arnhem it would be 106 per cent more. The hypothetical family of six would spend up to $614 per fortnight on a food basket in eastern Arnhem Land. The same basket across the average of capital cities would be $310.</para><para>I heard the Treasurer this afternoon talking about the benefits of a GST and cuts in income tax. Let me say to the Treasurer, and anyone on the other side of the House who knows anything about the income distribution in this country and regional differences in income distribution, that most of the people I am referring to do not pay tax because their incomes are not high enough. They will get no benefits from tax cuts, but of course they will get an increase of four per cent in their entitlements if they are on a benefit. You do not have to be Einstein, or even a simple mathematician like me, to work out that four per cent is going to make absolutely no difference to these people who are already penalised, because the price of the food—these fresh fruit and vegies which they already pay $614 for—will go up by 10 per cent. You do not have to be too smart to work it out.</para><para>This government has yet to come to terms with its obligations. This government has spent $19 million trying to tell Australia the benefits of this GST. This government has yet to acknowledge that the people who will be most disadvantaged by this program, despite people like you and me, will be those who live in these remote communities and are among the most impoverished in Australia's community.</para><para>Yet there is not one inkling of any idea by this government as to how to address these issues. Every day we have more and more evidence coming from the Senate committee hearings on the GST, demonstrating time and time again that we are being led down the garden path and told blatant untruths by the government. And we are expected to say to them, `Whoopee! Let's take a tax cut,' and tell these poor people who live in my electorate that they can expect great things out of a GST. You and I both know, and they know—despite the fact that I think this government 
 believes these people are stupid—that you are wrong. These people know that you are misleading them. These people know that the GST is a health tax. These people know that a GST on the fruit and vegetables they buy will impact detrimentally on their health. There are already people in my electorate who go without food because of the costs they have to incur. That will only be exacerbated by this cruel and iniquitous tax.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2734</page.no><name role="metadata">Nugent, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NUGENT</name><name.id>UT4</name.id><electorate>Aston</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I make my comments on <inline ref="r704">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99</inline> , and <inline ref="r705">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99</inline>  and <inline ref="r706">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99</inline> , which we are debating cognately, I would like to pick up on a couple of points that the previous speaker, the member for the Northern Territory made. He will know that the general situation of the indigenous people of this country is something in which I have personally taken a strong interest for some years.</para></talk.start><para>I think I can say that I have taken a genuine interest. There have been times when my interest has made me somewhat unpopular on my own side of politics; therefore, I understand some of the points he is trying to make. But I have to say that I think he does his cause a disservice by doing himself what he has accused this side of the house of doing—and that is, not always dealing in the truth of the situation. He used the words `blatant untruths'. I think there was some of that in what he had to say.</para><para>There are two or three points I would like to make about what the previous speaker said. We all understand that Aboriginal health is a problem, and the honourable gentleman who spoke before me acknowledged that his previous government had not solved all those problems in the same way that I acknowledge that this government has not solved all those problems. There are ongoing problems: Aboriginal health, Aboriginal unemployment, Aboriginal education—there is a whole raft of areas that are of concern to most members in this chamber. They have been long-term problems. It seems to me that the inescapable fact of the matter is that governments of whatever persuasions have not yet been able to effectively deal with these issues.</para><para>There are certainly differences between the two sides of politics as to how you might go about it. I would suggest that, particularly in the health area, the current Minister for Health and Aged Care, who himself over a long period of time has demonstrated a particular interest in indigenous health, is trying to make a significant improvement and has come up with a number of very worthwhile initiatives.</para><para>I think the previous speaker is mistaken to try to blame the problem of the cost of food or anything else in remote territories on the GST. There is a problem of cost in remote parts of Australia that, frankly, are there whatever government is in power and whatever the particular tax structures may be. In terms of dealing with the problem of costs in remote parts of Australia, I agree with his own words that you need to take a `holistic approach'. I do not think you can just say, `It's going to be this particular thing or that particular thing.' There is a whole raft of costs. Therefore, when he talks about adding 10 per cent to the cost of food for remote communities, that actually is not a true statement, and I think the honourable gentleman understands that.</para><para>I am not minimising the problems of the cost of food or anything else to remote community people. Remote community people are less able to deal with the cost of anything because they do not have the education or the jobs, the unemployment rates are high and income is a problem, and so on. But the reality is that food will not go up by 10 per cent, as the honourable gentleman knows, because embedded in those costs is a whole raft of other existing taxes which will be sucked out of the system.</para><para>One of the most important changes to the proposed tax system, of which the GST is but a part, is in fact a very significant reduction in fuel costs. The honourable gentleman knows full well that that is part of the problem of servicing remote parts of Australia—the sheer cost of getting items there. The fact that transport costs are going to come down dramatically will mean that there will not be an increase of 10 per cent, and it is a blatant untruth to make those sorts of allegations.</para><para>I want to turn to other matters. We are talking about appropriation bills, and I have heard a number of other speakers talk not only in detail about these bills, but also of the context in which we discuss appropriations generally. We have heard a great deal about how the world is changing. I think it is important that we in this place, and the Australian community generally, acknowledge the fact that the world is changing and that we can longer do things as we have done them before.</para><para>The world is changing in all sorts of ways, one of the most dramatic being the impact of technology. I think the impact of technology has made dramatic inroads into all of our lives for quite a long time. I do not think we as a community realise how technology is changing the way in which the economy is structured, the way we do business and the way we operate as a country. It is not just a question of having a better bit of technology on the television—a bigger picture, better resolution, more computer games and those sorts of things. Technology is actually changing the structure of the way that the world operates, and it is going to go on into the future.</para><para>If you have technology operating around the world and the speed of communications is increasing, it means that the average citizen can access that technology around the world and that borders are effectively coming down. You cannot stop technology crossing borders and, in the same way, in an environmental context, you cannot change pollution when it reaches the Murray River between Victoria and New South Wales. The environment is an ongoing thing and so is technology. The ability of governments to govern and control their particular piece of earth is proving to be much more difficult. We can no longer live with the regimes we had in the past where governments would say, `We are going to effectively put up economic borders and control almost totally what we do within those borders.'</para><para>Governments have to be mindful of what is going on in the rest of the world. Governments cannot act in isolation; when they try to do so, they find that they have a great 
 problem. One of the most classic examples of that recently was when the government of Malaysia tried to freeze its currency. It linked it to the American dollar, froze the currency and stopped people importing and exporting the currency in Malaysia. The result was that Malaysia, which relies very heavily on foreign investment, found that nobody was interested in investing there anymore. Because they were not allowed to take their currency out when they made some profits, they looked elsewhere in the world to do their business. The Malaysian government has found that it cannot control the economy within its boundaries as it wanted to, and it has recently had to change that particular approach.</para><para>All this changing technology and the economic frontiers that we now deal in mean that there is much more freedom for the individual; it is not just something that the government controls. Businesses, people and governments are having to look at a whole new environment in the way the economy is run. We are subject to international influences and we are reliant on our neighbours and our trading partners—things which have to be taken into account when the government tries to set its economic and legislative plans.</para><para>I was very interested to read an article in last Friday's <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline> by Phil Ruthven from IBIS. He talks about perspectives for a new century—reading that I would commend to all members of this House. It is the first in what is going to be a series of articles about the way the economy around the world is structured and how it affects Australia. Phil Ruthven looks at how our economy has been structured over the last 100 years or so, where it is going in the future, what the new industries are and which industries are dying. He looks at the GDP per capita at 1995-96 prices.</para><para>Back in the late 1700s and early 1800s—which he defines as the `hunting' period in Australia's history—the per capita GDP was very low. It started to inch up during the `agrarian' period, which lasted until about 1900, and it inched up a bit more during the `industrial' period—particularly towards the end of the industrial period in the 1950s and 1960s. It has improved since about 1965 and 
 is rising very steeply in the `infotronics' period, as Phil Ruthven describes it. The projections are that this is going to continue into the future.</para><para>He makes some other points which I think are very important for us to recognise when planning how we are going to run the country. For example, our primary industries—agriculture and mining—important though they are, and they will continue to be, are turning out to be a much smaller proportion of our total wealth as a nation. Our whole manufacturing area—the whole area of making things, retailing and dealing in things—is in fact only about 27 per cent of our economy today. Historically, of course, we took the view that the primary and secondary production sectors of mining, agriculture, manufacturing and so on were the core of any successful economy, and service industries had to feed off that. The reality today is that the primary and secondary sector is about 27 per cent. The other 72 per cent, in its own right, is generated out of the services sector—finance, insurance and things like that.</para><para>We are changing the whole shape and profile of the way we run our economy and do business, and the government needs to be responsive to those changing circumstances. We will get to a situation where many households and businesses will no longer be doing things for themselves, they will be outsourcing—whether it is cleaning the house, shopping by telephone or outsourcing IT, transportation, legal work or getting consultants. The figures coming out of this research by IBIS show that outsourcing some 10 per cent more of do-it-yourself work at home would restore full employment in this country. As we improve our lifestyles and become more affluent, we do not want to do the chores at home. If we started to outsource just 10 per cent of what we currently do at home—I am moving house shortly and am contemplating painting my new house; maybe I ought to outsource that and employ a painter—it would eliminate the unemployment problem.</para><para>It is interesting to look at industries share of GDP. For example, agriculture, which used to have a huge share, now has a minute share, 
 and so on. But perhaps the most telling thing, in planning for government action, is to look at the five-year growth forecasts and the industries that are going to do well. At the top of the heap by far is the communications sector, followed by personal and other services. Third on the list is finance and insurance, fourth is property and business, and fifth is accommodation, cafes and restaurants. Health and community are next—and only then you get down to mining as a growth area in the economy.</para><para>If we understand the way our economy and the world economy are going, what the growth areas are and those sorts of things, we will create an environment in which there will be jobs and a sense of wellbeing in Australia. I think it is very important that we all remember the broader picture before we get down to arguing some of the nitty-gritty of the legislation.</para><para>The government, over the last three years, has followed a program of trying to get the budget into balance which it has achieved. It introduced some tax cuts to try to give some incentives to people—the family tax package—when it first got elected. It has obviously tried to stop some of the abuses in the social security area and introduced the concept of mutual obligation. We have seen the lowest interest rates for something like 30 years.</para><para>It is interesting that, when you can do these things by proper tight fiscal management, at ground level the impact is quite startling. We have just had from all the major retailers over the Christmas period, for example, reports of sensational, record high sales in the retail sector. Why is this when we have not had huge wage increases in the last two or three years? My electorate, for example, has one of the highest proportions of mortgage payers in the country and interest rates have come down dramatically. When I was elected in 1990 interest rates were running at 17 per cent. They are now down to five per cent or six per cent and I saw a special the other day at 4.95 per cent. The fact that interest rates have come down dramatically has meant that you are putting money in the pockets of people and they are going out and spending it. That 
 is generating economic activity and that means that we start to grow and we start to generate more jobs. From a growth point of view, we are running at the highest level of growth in the OECD.</para><para>In spite of all the economic problems going on around us, this country's economy is actually sailing along quite well. That does not mean to say all is perfect, that does not mean to say it cannot be better, that does not mean to say there are not other things that we need to do; but we are in fact going along pretty well.	It is interesting, for example, that the National Australia Bank business survey confirms our strong economic growth. They released their business survey on 9 February, just last week, and it showed that business conditions improved for the sixth consecutive month.</para><para>Business confidence remains at an extremely high level. Business confidence has now returned to the high levels prior to the Asian financial crisis. The Chief Economist of the NAB claimed the `survey suggested the strengthening trend in economic activity evident in recent months was maintained in early 1999'. He also suggested the domestic economy `had enough momentum to continue expanding strongly for at least six months'. It seems to me that those are good signs for our economy and that we are actually moving in the right direction.</para><para>We are obviously very pleased with those results, but we have more to do. That is why we are trying to make sure that we continue on that road of introducing legislation and policies that will continue to stimulate the opportunity for people to get jobs. The tax package is part of that exercise. Clearly it is not just a GST, although that is what the opposition would like to have people believe. There is in fact much more to it than just the GST. It is about trying to get a more equitable system; it is about trying to get some relief for exporters; it is about trying to provide further tax relief and, therefore, the spending power for most people in the work force; and it is about the need to create extra jobs. I think it is important that we do not lose sight of those objectives and what it is we are trying to achieve.</para><para>Jobs growth is predicted to continue. Morgan and Banks brought out a survey late last week which says that more than one-third of employers indicated they would be putting on more staff in the next three months. This is the highest level of confidence in the economy since the survey commenced in April 1995. I might add that it is also the largest survey in Australia of projected jobs growth.</para><para>I think we are actually seeing, on a consistent basis, a good economic record from this government. I hope that those on the other side help support the government's restructuring of the tax package. I have been particularly disappointed at some of the statements by ACOSS, whose own survey showed that, on the worst case scenario, with the introduction of the new tax package there would be an increase in the cost of living of 3.3 per cent. As the government has said, this is for aged pensioners, single working age people on benefits and so on. They said their survey showed that those on benefits—the worst scenario from their own research papers—showed a worst case scenario of three point something per cent. The government has said it will provide a four per cent increase in those benefits. Clearly that means that those people will not be disadvantaged.</para><para>It seems to me that it is dishonest of people like those in ACOSS and other advocates to go running around trying to suggest that that is not the case. The government is concerned to make sure that people are properly looked after. It has provided the figures and even the figures of those who oppose us politically show that what we have said is the truth. Therefore, I urge the House not only to support this particular legislation but, on an ongoing basis, to implement the government's tax policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2737</page.no><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name><name.id>HH4</name.id><electorate>Scullin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Usually it does not fuss me who the minister on duty at the table is during a debate, but tonight I am very pleased to see the Minister for Employment Services at the table. I will read from an article by Bill Birnbauer in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  of 29 April 1994, quoting a third person as saying:</para></talk.start><para>When some of them (the participants) started, they were simply unemployable.

 are self-starters and are willing to work. I would employ all of them if I had the money.</para><para>I am sure that that is a quote that the minister would like to be able to use for the government's Work for the Dole Scheme. But, in fact, this was a quote about a Keating government Jobskills-LEAP program being conducted in the Ballina region in April 1994.</para><para>I should share with the House how I came upon that article. On Saturday in a feature in the <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Extra</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was an article by Bettina Arndt. What attracted me was that it was an article entitled `The brave new world of welfare'. It was to be an article about mutual obligation and matters surrounding that. But, when I turned to page 4 of <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Extra</inline>, I saw the photo accompanying the article. Under the photo it said: `Hay-ho: young people walk across a paddock with tools, a hay bale and flowers as part of a rural work-for-the-dole project'. I recognised that photo as a photo that I had, as it turns out, seen in the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline>back in April 1994. On that occasion, the title under the photo said: `Jobskill participants'—and it names the participants—`leave to plant rainforest and eucalyptus trees along the Upper Coopers Creek, in Northern New South Wales'. It was in the article accompanying that photo that the landowner, as a third party to the Jobskills LEAP project, made that comment about what effect the project had had on the participants.</para><para>Whilst I have some problem with the way in which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> have used the photo, that is not really the important aspect or the reason I raise this today. In fact, I am indebted to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for this, because it led me back to Birnbauer's original article. I remember this vividly because, on the day that Birnbauer and the photographer John Woudstra—I note that in Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> he was not acknowledged as the photographer—were visiting this scheme the House of Representatives environment committee, as part of its inquiry into the greening of jobs, was visiting the same scheme. The then chair was John Langmore. So that other honourable members can have a look at these photos and make their own judgment about their veracity, I seek leave to table the photos. I have spoken to the minister and I think I have kept to the undertaking I 
 gave him about the use of the photos, if not the article.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name></talker><para>—To return to comparison of schemes that were in place under the Labor government with the scheme that the minister at the table administers—the Work for the Dole Scheme—I have to make comment that it was not only the work experience that young unemployed people gain out of the Work for the Dole Scheme that Labor government programs produced but a whole host of other things.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In fact, when we look at this particular project that the House of Representatives committee visited back in April 1994, the training—as well as the work experience—that the participants in the program entered into ranged from courses such as surveying, welding, rainforest regeneration, farm forestry, plantation management, nursery practice and computer skills to forest dynamics and, importantly, very transferable skills—occupational health and safety, and first aid. This is the point that the opposition is trying to make when it criticises the notion that is put forward by the government about their Work for the Dole Scheme: it lacks a number of positive elements. But with a little bit of effort this government could improve the scheme.</para><para>I noted over the weekend that Minister Abbott is contemplating a change to the name of the Work for the Dole program. That is a simple step, but it is only one small step, which goes to the nature of the program. It is very much perceived that this program has a punitive nature; that it is all about punishing the victims. Any step to get over that hurdle will, of course, be positive. But I hope that the minister will go further—that he will look at the nature of the program. I hope that if we are to go down this track of mutual obligation, as defined by this government, it is not merely about somebody having to do something in return for the cash payment, in return for the unemployment benefit—or for any other benefit.</para><para>I hope that we can return to a notion first termed by the previous Labor government: reciprocal obligation. It was a two-way 
 process that saw the government not only guaranteeing income support to the unemployed person but also guaranteeing other aspects. That is what has been forgotten in this debate. That is what makes it very difficult when we have the easy comments on the opposition's position. In fact, we are in disagreement because the two definitions being used by each side of this House are vastly different. In May 1994 in the Working Nation statement Prime Minister Keating set out a description for reciprocal obligation. It reads:</para><para>. . . puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for 18 months or more. Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits.</para><para>Those are the mere words; the practice not only was about trying to give the unemployed person—and many of these programs targeted long-term unemployed people—the type of self-esteem and hope that work experience itself could give, but also was about giving them skills through training programs; skills that would be transferable through several employment options. It was an important aspect to skill up the people so that they could find their own way back into full-time labour. That is an aspect that perhaps the government is overlooking.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name></talker><para>—Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I outlined to the House my interest in a photograph that was in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  on Saturday, which purported to be a photo of a Work for the Dole scheme, and the fact that I was able to establish that the photo had been used back in April 1994 in support of a project that was being funded under LEAP. It is not that I wish to have a go at the <inline font-style="italic">Age </inline> tonight. I can understand why they would wish to use the photo again: it is of great artistic merit. I note again that the photographer, John Woudstra, was not acknowledged.</para></talk.start></continue><para>My point in raising this in debate was that it made me research the previous article in April 1994. It reminded me that within the 
 article there was a good description of the success of projects that had been funded under the Landcare and Environment Action Program and Jobskills. These were used as the genesis for much of what was put in the Working Nation statement of May 1994. It also gave me the opportunity to discuss the differences between this government's notion of mutual obligation and the Keating government's notion of reciprocal obligation. To illustrate that, the programs that this government has in place are lacking in important aspects which could help to improve the lot of the unemployed well past just the work experience.</para><para>I was interested in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> last Saturday which, unfortunately, deceptively used the photo, because it described the way in which the notion of mutual obligation is developing in a number of other countries. There was a discussion of the way in which it is developing in the United States. There was a discussion of some of the measures that are being contemplated in New Zealand and by the Blair government in the United Kingdom. What we see in those countries is the development of the concept of mutual obligation to look at other benefits which are payable by government.</para><para>I am greatly concerned and disturbed by some of the suggestions that have been put. For instance, in America there is the notion that people that are born into families that have been on welfare should be ineligible for further welfare payments. That strikes me as a very strange notion. I cannot see why the dependent children of such families should be cut out of being able to access proper welfare benefits.</para><para>One of my concerns is that this government tends to look only at the cash payment aspect of the equation. The government is not willing to do what the Labor government did under reciprocal obligation—that is, to look at a whole host of other things that government can do for the beneficiary and ask that the beneficiary do something in return. It is not willing to adopt a very definite two-way process within the notion of reciprocal obligation. </para><para>As has been discussed in this place over the last week, the Prime Minister has expanded his notion of mutual obligation and the young unemployed by indicating that he believes that those on benefits who lack literacy and numeracy skills and do not avail themselves of literacy and numeracy programs should lose that benefit. Regrettably, yet again, this has been done by emphasising the punitive nature of what the Prime Minister is suggesting without perhaps stressing what could be positive about that notion.</para><para>There have to be two things that are positive about such a notion. Nobody disputes the fact that, if an unemployed person is lacking in literacy and numeracy skills, their chances of employment are increased by improving those skills. I think everybody would agree with that notion. But if we are to stipulate that as something that unemployed people have to do to remain on benefit, let us ensure that they have adequate access to the programs.</para><para>Simply put, this government's record in that regard can be placed under great question. For instance, in his weekly column in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on Friday, 5 February, the honourable member for Werriwa indicated that, each year, the federal government provides just $21 million in literacy programs for the unemployed. Mr Latham has done the sums on this and they show that there is about $29.74 for each of Australia's 706,000 unemployed people. Looking at youth unemployment, we see that the amount is something like $280 per person. As Mark says, it is not even enough for two days training. If we are fair dinkum, as the government seem to suggest that they are, why not ensure that the access is there so that young people are able to receive this benefit?</para><para>When we look at the way the Job Network operates and discuss it with some of the Job Network providers, they say—and perhaps it is because of the profit motive involved—that they are not willing to pay for the literacy programs when, they suggest, there are other literacy programs available. One has to ask: are they available, and why does the Job Network provider not take some responsibility for their client by ensuring that they get 
 access to those programs? As an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 5 February by Richard McGregor states:</para><para>Nor does it—</para><para>the government—</para><para>think that training should be part of the equation, as its expanding work-for-the-dole program shows.</para><para>I think this is the real problem—that is, the government will not take responsibility through the different programs that it makes available for that training as well as the on-the-job experience. I reject this developing notion that in fact mutual obligation is just about the punitive nature. It concerns me that that is the way it is couched. There is some electoral appeal to that. It is the easy option in gathering and garnering support from the electorate, because they see, in simple terms, that this is the way it should happen without perhaps taking a deeper look at the way in which the programs could develop.</para><para>Having said this about mutual and reciprocal obligation, and in fact having quoted from the honourable member for Werriwa, in conclusion I would like to use the few minutes left to me to discuss the ongoing debate on this side of the House on policy development. I am not concerned that that is going on. I am not really concerned that a number of leading members of the caucus have decided to put their thoughts into writing and have written books. Perhaps I would wish that they did it more in a pamphlet style or something that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">MARTIN</name><name role="display">Mr Martin</name></talker><para>—When's yours coming?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Jenkins, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr JENKINS</name></talker><para>—I don't think you will be seeing anything in writing from me. The point is that people like the shadow minister, people like myself, as a member of the caucus, are quite happy to enter into debate and to be able to put views and concepts in the run-up to the development of a policy that the parliamentary party would take to an election. The Australian Labor Party is a fairly robust organisation. It is an umbrella organisation. Its membership has a wide range of views. Its history enables it to be able to accommodate those views. Its history enables it to give venues and fora in which those views can be debated.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some of my colleagues have concern that in part this is being conducted in the public arena. I say to those people that perhaps we need to take that on board. We have to realise that people in the wider community have views that they can put to us and that the debate will be healthy. Whether or not I agree with some of the things that have been proposed—for instance, I think the honourable member for Werriwa goes way too far with a lot of what he is proposing and I have some disagreement with him—raising issues is important. If there are a multitude of options in the way, we should tackle solving those issues, and that is the way it should be done.</para><para>On our side of the House, we do not have really great concern that that is ongoing. That is something which went on while we were in government and continues while we are in opposition. The government decries elements of the backgrounds of the membership of the caucus. At the end of the day, the diversity of our backgrounds is one of our great strengths. We know what it is to be a dynamic political organisation. We have connections with a wide range of organisations within the community. An important aspect to that is the organised Labor movement. That enables us to come together and have debates which will lead to solutions that are in the best interests of the nation, and that is very important. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2741</page.no><name role="metadata">Entsch, Warren, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ENTSCH</name><name.id>7K6</name.id><electorate>Leichhardt</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to speak on <inline ref="r704">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99</inline> , <inline ref="r705">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1998-99</inline>  and <inline ref="r706">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99</inline> . Given the limited opportunities I have presently to speak in the House, this gives me an opportunity to raise a number of issues affecting my electorate of Leichhardt at the moment. The first issue I would like to raise has been happening now for some time and relates to air services in the Torres Strait. In recent times, there has been an almost total withdrawal of services from the area on a decision which was made on 7 January 1999 when CASA decided to issue show-cause notices to the airline operators in the Torres Strait area. This show-cause 
 notice was based on the fact that they were selling single seats on their charters rather than chartering the full aircraft.</para></talk.start><para>The problem is that in 1988 there was an amendment made to the regulation which gave the Secretary of CASA the discretion of allowing these operations to continue. He had the discretionary right to allow them to fly. I am somewhat puzzled as to why it has taken 10 years for CASA to get around to enforcing this operation. It is causing major problems in the area. What it means in effect is that for people up there on very limited incomes who are travelling from one island to another, where it would normally cost them $60 or $100 to buy a seat it is now costing them $1,200 or more. That relates to something like one-seventh of their annual income, so it makes it very difficult for them to afford.</para><para>Unfortunately about the time that this decision was made there was a tragic accident on Coconut Island with the loss of three lives: the pilot Cheryl Hicks, Ethyl Larry and Belma David. My sincere condolences go to the family of those three people. That accident is being investigated at the moment and there is still no determination as to its cause. Unfortunately there has been a lot of confusion, and people are starting to cloud both the issues, particularly up in the Torres Strait. It is very hard to distinguish what is the problem.</para><para>We have had a situation where, when the kids were wanting to travel back to school, the parents would not allow them to travel in any of the aircraft up there, because they were afraid that the aircraft were going to fall out of the sky. As a consequence, 168 kids throughout outer islands of the Torres Strait missed the first few days of school, because the only alternative was a dinghy in very rough conditions. Given the fact that it is the storm season, it puts the kids at a tremendous amount of risk.</para><para>Fortunately, John Abednego, the Chairman of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, and I were able to speak with the defence ministers, and we arranged a flight of the 35 Squadron, who sent two Caribous up there. Because of the very close relationship between the defence services—particularly with the great work that 51 Battalion has done— 
 the kids had no hesitation in stepping into a military aircraft. As a consequence, the problem was solved and all the kids were brought in.</para><para>Unfortunately it is a one-off. The situation certainly impacted very much on the small operators up there that make a living out of providing a service. It is something that desperately needs to be resolved very quickly. I know that there are difficulties associated with it—issues relating to safety. The reality is that it is absolutely impossible to meet the PRT requirements to allow public transport carrying in that area.</para><para>I have had meetings with the hierarchy of CASA on this and explained my position to them. I have also expressed concern at the fact that it took 10 years for them to make a decision to ground these airlines. And they would have known very much that this was going to happen, but at no stage did they think of any contingency plans. One would have thought that the responsible thing to do would have been to suggest that they were going to make some changes but have some alternatives that they were looking at to fix the problem. </para><para>So at the moment we have islands such as Duan, Saibai and Boigu that have gone from an almost daily mail service to being lucky to get one mail service a week, because they are relying on barges now to get the mail out to these places. We have unaffordable airline tickets, and as a consequence more and more people are going on dinghies on journeys of up to 120 kilometres. So it is becoming very difficult for these people to travel, and still there is no decision being made.</para><para>As I say, I have spoken to CASA on this and have asked them to do something very quickly, because it is going to affect a lot of people. You cannot send medical supplies or fresh fruit and vegetables for the store on Thursday Island, unless you charter an entire aircraft. So it is impacting right across the broad spectrum. From 7 January to now we are looking at about a month and a half. I think that it has gone on long enough and that CASA needs to sort themselves out and to do something that will restore the services to these regions.</para><para>While I am on that, there were another couple of decisions—one last week when, in their wisdom, the local CASA people decided that people in some of the remote places are not allowed to carry animals on aircraft without a sealed container cargo compartment. Unfortunately, most of these small communities do not have the services of vets, and the only way they are going to get any assistance for a sick or injured animal is by carrying them by air or on unsealed roads which are impassable in many cases at this time of the year. They do have the proper pet containers, but they have decided that these people cannot carry animals. In fact, one constituent, Mrs Boyle from Cooktown, took her animal to Cairns. A couple of days later when she wanted to return she was told she was not allowed to take it back. I raised this with the CASA authorities, and they eventually paid to road freight that dog back to Cooktown. That is not a good alternative.</para><para>Again I spoke with the CASA people on this, and I was given a very firm undertaking that the local CASA people in my region were misinterpreting the regulations. I was given a commitment that they would immediately write a directive to these people and ask them to reinstate the service of carrying these animals. Unfortunately, one of those that gave me that commitment decided—I think on the next day—to go on leave, and to this day we have not been able to re-establish those services. I think that they have to start to look at their responsibilities with respect to the public up there as far as these sorts of things are concerned. I think they are ridiculous decisions.</para><para>Today I have been advised that Cape York is also feeling the effects of it. I have a number of letters here from small cattle station owners who, as we are well aware, have suffered badly in recent years—first of all from the impact native title issues has had on their industry and also from very poor cattle prices. Some of these people are not prepared to lie down and cop it in the neck. They have actually gone out and started small tourist operations—operations like the Strathburn Station and the Eclectus Wilderness Retreat at Iron Range are good examples. 
 These people have gone out and continued to have a go. Now they are told that they cannot get any passengers, because their passengers had been brought in on the mail plane for years and years. Now they cannot get any clients into their operation and they are very fearful that this is going to be the straw that is going to break the camel's back and shut them down.</para><para>Again, this is something which really needs to be dealt with. There is no question about safety. Safety is absolutely imperative, particularly the airworthiness of aircraft. But, at the end of the day, we have to realise that airstrips out in the middle of Cape York or Mabuiag Island or Darnley Island or Murray Island or up at Saibai are not the same as Kingsford Smith. As such, we need to make concessions or special allowances for aircraft operating in those areas, whether that be by accepting that there are some limitations with regard to the standard of strips that are available or that there are restrictions with regard to the carrying of certain passengers in Papua New Guinea.</para><para>In the Torres Strait, for example, the operators are not allowed to carry Papua New Guinea nationals, because of quarantine and immigration issues. That automatically means that they cannot get the standard RPT; and so there need to be concessions made. I am raising this tonight because I think that we have been very patient. It has been six weeks now, and it is really time that CASA realised the impact that this is having on people in Cape York and in the Torres Strait. CASA needs to sit down and sort this out and get these services operating again.</para><para>Quite frankly, they cannot continue to do it the way it is now. In Cape York at the moment, they have had record rain and people are stuck. I have in mind the situation of a woman in Cooktown who recently had a child. She is in hospital and is trying to get back to her remote property. She cannot afford a full charter flight and she has been stranded in Cooktown, away from her young family, for a couple of weeks now. She cannot drive out because the road is impassable: they do not have any roads at this time of year, because they are totally flooded out. 
 You can see the problems and the trauma that it is causing in the area.</para><para>I call on CASA to acknowledge the difficulties that are being caused there. We are not asking them to compromise on safety but we are asking them to accept the impacts that this is having on people's everyday lives and to acknowledge that there are remote areas that are very different. For goodness sake, do something to get these people moving again before we see another tragedy where somebody tries to head out but is unable to do so and something happens, whether it be in a dinghy or on an impassable road. At the end of the day, that is very likely to happen; so I would encourage CASA very strongly to deal with this as soon as possible.</para><para>I have another issue that I would like to raise. I would like to make the House aware of a fellow in my electorate who is a special human being. His name is Geoff Guest, and his partner is Norma. Geoff has a property in the area called Petford. He is one of those very special people who have been providing special help for kids that none of the other organisations or authorities are able to help. These are kids  with violent upbringings, who come from very troubled homes and Geoff has a very special way with them.</para><para>Geoff himself had had a very troubled youth: he was an orphan and was adopted out, and he had a very unhappy childhood. As he grew up, he had the dream of having a cattle property. He bought a small block, of only a couple of a hundred square kilometres, called Emu Creek, out of Petford. Twenty-odd years ago, suddenly he started to find kids turning up at his door, kids who were having all sorts of problems; and so Petford Youth Camp was established. Norma came in about 15 years ago, when her son arrived there. Norma was an Aboriginal woman from Yarrabah, and she became Geoff's partner.</para><para>Over all those years they have had over 2,000 kids go through. The way that Geoff does it is this: he has a belief in giving the kids a challenge to achieve, and he does it with horses. He brings brumbies in and usually gives the kids three each as they come in. Basically, they have the responsibility of breaking these horses in, and the achievement 
 of doing that does a hell of a lot for them. Then they go on to rodeos and a whole range of other things. On top of that, for the first time, many of these kids have a sense of belonging. Anybody who has actually been into Norma's kitchen will see the warmth and the love that is there from these two people. Unfortunately, Geoff is getting on in age—he is now 72—and Norma is not in good health.</para><para>Geoff has provided a service, as I say, for all those years. Unfortunately, what has happened is that these things cost money, and Geoff and Norma have put every cent they have ever owned into it. Obviously the authorities thought it was a pretty good idea too, because they started sending kids there, and that was probably the mistake. When the authorities did that, of course, they decided that they would contribute; but there are always strings attached. With that contribution, they then decided they wanted control—and I am talking about the Queensland family services department.</para><para>As a consequence, we had a situation where we had had the place being run by Geoff and Norma, with over 2,000 kids going through, but last year, when it was taken over by Family Services, they had an administrator, a youth worker, two cooks, an accountant and, of course, Geoff. Norma was there as an adviser, but was not paid. So they had six full-time paid employees. Then they started to criticise what Geoff was doing—and we should point out that the reason they came in there in the first place was that what Geoff was doing was the only thing that was working with these kids.</para><para>He is a bit tough with them. There was a comment which Norma made that I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline> recently. She was commenting after Family Services had taken over. They are actually trying to kick them off now: it is crazy. She said that it needed to go back to the old days: plenty of talking and listening, and love and affection. She said,`You don't bribe them. Maybe I was a little too strict with them, but were they scared of me? Yes, they were. I would just tell them what was wrong and right. I taught them to cook, and some of them even came back to work 
 with us years later. Some are vets and some are engineers now.'</para><para>Unfortunately, the family services department and the board that have tried to take control there are, through political correctness, trying to destroy Geoff and Norma. It is all about social engineering. They do not agree with the way in which Geoff is doing it. He is one of those square pegs in a round hole. Because he does not fit into the bureaucratic requirements, they suddenly want to throw him out—discard him. They need to realise that Petford is nothing without Geoff Guest and Norma—and, of course, they are nothing without Petford. I think those people should hang their heads in shame. I will read a letter that came to Petford recently from a fellow by the name of Fletcher. He wrote:</para><para>Hi, its Fletcher here. I've heard you're having problems. I don't know what to say but to tell you that in everything I have ever been you have done the right and good thing. You are a strong man and I have more respect for you than any living man.</para><para>He signs off the letter with the words, `I love you, old man, all my love Fletch.' That is one of many letters that he gets from these kids. I call on the family services department to leave Geoff to do what he does well. Let them continue to operate that. For once, for goodness sake, let commonsense prevail and give them the opportunity to take back Petford to the way it should be. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>2744</page.no><name role="metadata">Latham, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LATHAM</name><name.id>K26</name.id><electorate>Werriwa</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to address the additional Department of Defence appropriations in the <inline ref="r704">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99</inline>  and cognate bills, and in particular how they might be influenced by developments in East Timor and Australia's relations with Indonesia. East Timor has re-emerged strongly in recent times on the public agenda. I must confess I am always surprised that, given the massive changes and challenges in Indonesia at the current time, with the huge need for economic, political and social reform, so much of the foreign policy focus in this country narrows down to the province of East Timor.</para></talk.start><para>Nonetheless, journalists and politicians alike express a lot of interest in this area. There has been a lot of speculation about transactions, 
 conversations and policy exchanges between the Australian and Indonesian governments for the last 30 years. I believe, because of this speculation, the time has come for the Howard government to release all the documents relating to those exchanges. It is time to set the record straight and to give the Australian people a proper account of the historical record.</para><para>I am talking not just about the cabinet records that are ordinarily released with the expiry of 30 years; I think it is time to release as many of the internal departmental records as possible. It is my belief that if the Minister for Foreign Affairs acted in this way it would demonstrate two things. The first is the ongoing neglect of the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments in arranging a proper process of decolonisation by the Portuguese out of East Timor.</para><para>In my lifetime, there have been two great difficulties in Australian foreign policy. Both have been the product of faulty decolonisation processes. Both reflect the legacy of inadequate coalition governments. The first of those is the Australian tragedy in Vietnam, with the misjudgment of successive coalition governments in the 1960s in terms of facilitating and assisting proper decolonisation with the departure of the French. The second difficulty relates to the inaction and inertia by successive coalition governments in smoothing the departure of the Portuguese from East Timor.</para><para>If we release all the records going back to the 1950s, it will prove that point. That is my belief. It is not too hard for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to release the records going back to the fifties and sixties. It will show the inaction of the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments in trying to anticipate and smooth the way for successful decolonisation processes by the Portuguese out of East Timor.</para><para>The second thing I believe those documents would demonstrate is that Gough Whitlam's public account of his involvement in this matter would be verified. I have absolutely no doubt, from my association with the former member for Werriwa, that his public statements about his own record as Prime Minister 
 and foreign minister in relation to East Timor would be verified by the release of all the relevant documents. Let us clear the air. Let us set the historical record straight. Let us release all the relevant documents.</para><para>Mr Whitlam has taken a lot of abuse over a 25-year period relating to the record of the Whitlam government on East Timor. He has taken abuse from both sides of parliament. He has taken abuse in the press. And he has taken a lot of ridicule from different parts of the Australian political community. I think the member for Kingsford-Smith got very close to the truth when he gave an address in Brisbane on 4 February. He said:</para><para>Critics have claimed that Whitlam gave Suharto a "green light" to take over East Timor by force of arms. I don't think the record supports this judgment—and that conclusion is reinforced by Whitlam's subsequent exchanges with Suharto. Whitlam wrote to Suharto following the first invasion alarm over East Timor in February 1975. He emphasised to Suharto that no Australian Government could allow it to be thought, whether beforehand or afterwards, that it supported Indonesian military action against East Timor, and he warned that such action would have a serious impact on the bilateral relationship.</para><para>In this speech, the member for Kingsford-Smith assured his audience that he had seen the relevant documents, and I believe him on that. From his viewing of the relevant documents, he drew the conclusion that Whitlam at no stage gave Suharto a green light to take over East Timor by force of arms. Let us release the documents. Let us confirm what the member for Kingsford-Smith has already placed on the public record: at no stage did Mr Whitlam condone the military takeover of East Timor.</para><para>In terms of Gough's own account of these things, half in jest, he once likened his own reputation in history to that of Churchill. He quoted Churchill in saying that he was confident that history would record a favourable judgment of his time in government, largely because he planned to write the history himself—and write it he did, just as Churchill wrote about his own time in government and various accounts of World War II. True to his word, Gough Whitlam put down his own account of these events in East Timor. I believe that, especially given some of the 
 abuse that has been dished out over the years in this parliament, it is appropriate to read into the parliamentary record a good part of Gough Whitlam's account. I know the book well: <inline font-style="italic">The Whitlam Government 1972-1975</inline>.</para><para>In that book, Gough Whitlam gives his account of two meetings and sets of discussions with Suharto: the first of those at Wonosobo on 5 to 7 September 1974 and the second at Townsville on 3 to 5 April 1975. Gough writes as follows:</para><para>On the night of 25 April 1974 the Portuguese Government collapsed and a new government took office in Lisbon committed to decolonisation.</para><para>Then writing of his meeting with Suharto in September 1974:</para><para>President Suharto and I agreed that Portugal should be encouraged to maintain its authority in Timor for some time longer, probably five years, in order to give the population some experience in managing its affairs. We were to be frustrated in this by the irresponsibility of the Portuguese and the intransigence of the Timorese parties. I wrote a long letter to the President after our discussions in Wonosobo. Our discussions in Townsville turned more upon Viet Nam, where the North was overrunning the South, than on Timor, where the two principal parties, UDT and Fretilin, had formed a coalition on 22 January.</para><para>That passage in itself makes a very important point. In all of this speculation about the events in East Timor in 1975, too little recognition is given in Australia to the irresponsibility of the Portuguese. The truth is the Portuguese government up and left East Timor at the most critical stage of a civil war in that island colony of Portugal.</para><para>Portugal, in the Australian debate, gets off scot-free. There is too much focus on the actions of the Australian government at that time and not enough focus on and understanding of the irresponsibility of the Portuguese government. Gough Whitlam continues:</para><para>On 27 May 1975, distrustful of alleged left-wing influence in Fretilin, UDT announced the end of the coalition. At the end of June talks in Macau failed because Fretilin boycotted them. The relations between the parties now deteriorated rapidly. A Fretilin delegation attended the independence celebrations in Mozambique on 26 June 1975. Fretilin had always identified itself with Frelimo and now rejected the idea of elections in East Timor on the ground that Frelimo had been recognised as the government of Mozambique without 
 elections. UDT, whose principal contacts, other than with Portugal, had been with Taiwan and which was strongly anti-Marxist, had hoped for a longer association with Portugal than anyone in Portugal now desired. UDT came to prefer integration with Indonesia to rule by Fretilin.</para><para>He goes on:</para><para>In a show of force on the evening of 10 August UDT occupied the police headquarters and other administrative buildings in Dili and demanded the arrest of Fretilin leaders and the expulsion of certain Portuguese officials alleged to be communists. UDT established the `Revolutionary Anti-Communist Movement of 11 August'. On 15 August Fretilin proclaimed a general armed insurrection against all traitors to the fatherland . . . On 17 August two representatives of the Portuguese Government . . . had left Dili and during the night of 27 August the Governor transferred the Portuguese administration to the off-shore island of Atauro.</para><para>There it is in black and white: an accurate historical account of the irresponsibility of the Portuguese in leaving during the outbreak of civil war between the pro-Mozambique Fretilin forces, which were subsequently described by Doug Anthony and Malcolm Fraser as being communist, and UDT, which had closely aligned itself with political influences in Taiwan and which had preferred integration with Indonesia. This makes a very important point because often in the Australian debate one would have the impression that all that happened in East Timor was that the Portuguese left and the Indonesians marched in and landed at Dili.</para><para>Of course, you need to remember the political circumstances in East Timor itself, where there was conflict to the point of civil war between competing political parties and competing political views. Fretilin had supported independence and the UDT, a major force in East Timor, actually supported integration with Indonesia. So the Indonesian actions need to be seen in that context, as do the Australian actions both before and after the Indonesian invasion. Let me continue with Gough Whitlam's account:</para><para>Full scale civil war between the parties now broke out and Australia's efforts had to be devoted to persuading the combatants to hold discussions and lay down their arms and to providing considerable and constant means of evacuation, communication and relief. Only Portugal had official status 
 and direct responsibility in East Timor but at no stage did it take specific initiatives in the UN or make specific proposals to Australia or other regional powers.</para><para>He later says:</para><para>There was, however, a small faction in the Department of Defence which, having failed to keep Indonesia out of New Guinea, was now intent on establishing an enclave in the midst of the Indonesian archipelago in case of future conflict with Indonesia.</para><para>I mentioned earlier the Defence appropriations here. It is appropriate at this point to look at some of the press reporting of some of these events in East Timor. I notice that Brian Toohey, once employed by the then shadow minister for defence, Lance Barnard, back in the 1960s and early 1970s, had an account in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  on 9 February. He was quoting a memo from what he claimed to be a Defence official, Bill Pritchett, saying that Australia's best interests were to support independence for East Timor. In fact, Mr Pritchett was on secondment from the department of foreign affairs, so he was not a Defence official.</para><para>But there were Defence officials at that time arguing that Australia should put the case for independence in East Timor. What was their motive? Their motive was to establish a foothold for Australian forces in East Timor if we ever came into conflict with Indonesia. So let no-one think this was a magnanimous act of altruism by the Department of Defence, saying, `Oh, yes, the East Timorese people should have independence.' It was strategic thinking by the Department of Defence to say that if there was to be conflict between Australia and Indonesia we would need a foothold for our forces and operations. What better foothold could there be than to use East Timor?</para><para>Defence was seeing East Timor not as some potential bastion of democracy and freedom but as a strategic asset in their own planning against the possibility of armed conflict with Indonesia. So that puts Mr Toohey to rest. Toohey was quite an expert on defence matters pre 1973. That was the time, of course, when he appropriated documents out of the office of the departing Minister for Defence in December 1972. On the basis of 
 those documents he became quite an expert in defence matters. That was pre 1973. Post 1973, as I have just shown, some of his accounts leave a certain amount of fantasy hanging in the air and require a certain amount of explanation in this parliament. Gough Whitlam continues:</para><para>On 30 October Willesee offered an Australian venue for round-table discussions. In Rome on 1 and 2 November the Portuguese and Indonesian foreign ministers agreed on the need of a meeting between Portugal and the three Timorese parties. Again it was impossible to reach agreement. Soon after the coup in Canberra on 11 November Fraser wrote to Suharto that he hoped to establish with him the close personal relationship that he understood that I had with him. On 28 August 1975 Fraser had endorsed Anthony's criticism of Fretilin as communist and this criticism had been repeated a month later by Dudley Erwin in the House and John Carrick in the Senate. From 11 November Indonesia knew that any `anti-communist' action it took would have support from Canberra. Suharto was entitled to believe that his personal undertakings to me had elapsed.</para><para>On 28 November Fretilin, without holding elections, issued a unilateral declaration of independence and proclaimed—</para><para>proclaimed!</para><para>the Democratic Republic of East Timor . . . The next day UDT—</para><para>and the other coalition parties—</para><para>proclaimed integration with Indonesia.</para><para>On 7 December Indonesian air and naval forces landed at Dili.</para><para>Gough Whitlam goes on, but for the purposes of my contribution that is sufficient account of the historical record set down in <inline font-style="italic">The Whitlam Government</inline> .</para><para>A number of points need to be made. It has been said that there is an inconsistency in Gough Whitlam's approach from 1975, that he was inconsistent in saying to Suharto that Australia strongly favoured the process of self-determination in East Timor, but then to go on and express the view—Gough Whitlam's view—that it would be in East Timor's best interest, out of self-determination, to be part of Indonesia. It is a bit rich for those who are also second-guessing self-determination to say that Gough Whitlam is inconsistent. In fact, second-guessing the self-determination process in 
 East Timor has become an Australian national pastime. Those who support independence for East Timor have always worked on the assumption that self-determination would lead to independence, yet they are willing to criticise Gough Whitlam because he said at that time—1975—that self-determination would lead to integration with Indonesia.</para><para>I think Gough Whitlam had a valid view at that time. Nobody, even to this day, claims that East Timor could be economically sufficient. East Timor would struggle even if it were to be independent. Gough Whitlam has a huge amount of faith in the ability of people, when the facts are made available to them, to reason out a rational position. It is my belief that he would have thought that in an act of self-determination the East Timorese people would have concluded that their best economic interests lie in integration with Indonesia. That is not an uncommon thing in politics at large. The Australian territory closest to East Timor made a similar judgment recently. On 3 October the people of the Northern Territory decided, in what can be equated to an act of self-determination, that they did not want statehood—they wanted to reap the economic benefits of their current relationship with Canberra. So it is possible for people, whether in Australia or East Timor, in making an act of self-determination to decide that independence is not necessarily in their best interests. That could have been entirely possible in 1975.</para><para>You need to remember that East Timor is somewhat an accident of colonial history. If the Dutch had occupied both West and East Timor none of this would be happening now. It would be a normal part of the diverse Indonesian archipelago. Based on that history, based on the practicalities of East Timor's economic position, Gough Whitlam had the view that self-determination could possibly lead to integration with Indonesia and not necessarily to independence.</para><para>Reflecting further on Australia's best interests at that time, it was not an unusual conclusion for an Australian Prime Minister to reach. Australia had just been through the process of getting out of Vietnam. The bitterness and division of 10 years involvement in 
 Vietnam had just ended in 1975. Based on what some people were saying about Fretilin, was it ever going to be in Australia's best interests to have a Cuba on our doorstep? It would not have been in Australia's best interests to have an unstable, undemocratic regime such as Fretilin on our doorstep. In the context of our departure from Vietnam and those terrible debates about communism in the 1950s and 1960s, it is not an unusual or irrational thing for an Australian Prime Minister to think our national interest would have been served by East Timor becoming part of Indonesia.</para><para>In terms of current policy making, it is very important for Australia to keep its eye on the main game. And the main game, whether we like it or not, is not in East Timor; it is to promote political, economic and social reform in Indonesia itself. Indonesia has been through a financial crisis and a crisis in its social and political system. This is our largest and most important neighbour, a nation of the utmost significance to Australia in all respects of our national interest and future. We need to be focused entirely on the political, economic and social reform process in Indonesia and then see East Timor as a subset of those bigger issues.</para><para>But again we have nothing but inertia and neglect by the Howard government. They are just following the Menzies path of failing to promote a proper stance for economic, political and social reform in Indonesia. I have heard nothing, as this parliament has heard nothing, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Prime Minister about those reform processes in Indonesia. So Australia is falling into a very bad trap and that is to think that East Timor is more important than the reform process in Indonesia itself. In fact, East Timor needs to be treated as a subset of the broader reform process. I would not go as far as former Prime Minister Paul Keating in saying that Australia should never sacrifice its interests on the altar of East Timor, but I think we need to keep the general set of priorities and perspective in place.</para><para>For the future, I agree with shadow minister Laurie Brereton about the need for a UN presence, the removal of the Indonesian 
 military from East Timor and for a self-determination process. But let us get the historical record right. Let us not run the Indonesians out of East Timor and create the same problem as when the Portuguese left. Let us have some regard for history and get it right in the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2749</page.no><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RONALDSON</name><name.id>XT4</name.id><electorate>Ballarat</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not going to talk about East Timor tonight, but the member for Werriwa has pricked my interest in relation to this matter. I find it interesting his coming in here to defend, in effect, the comments made by the shadow minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith. To some extent, I think the matters that were raised by the honourable member for Werriwa tonight are an endeavour to extract the member for Kingsford-Smith from a mess that was of his own making.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Kingsford-Smith, on my understanding, was not a member of the Parliamentarians for East Timor group, which was active three or four years ago. The group, led by the very capable member for Reid, had deep concerns about East Timor. I might be doing the member for Kingsford-Smith a great disservice by saying that I do not remember his being an active part of that group. In some respects, I think it is sorry and sad that the group has not been as active as it once was, but I have no doubt that its involvement in those early days led to some of the changes in attitude that we are now seeing.</para><para>I thank the member for Werriwa for some of the historical matters he has raised today but, with the greatest respect, in my view that was done to extract the Labor Party from an unholy mess created by the shadow minister. I suspect there is a certain irony in the member for Werriwa being the one trying to bring the two groups together. We are acutely aware of his close relationship with former Prime Minister Whitlam, a man that I personally have a lot of respect for, but it is interesting to see the member for Werriwa coming in here tonight trying to unravel a mess created by the member for Kingsford-Smith who, in my view, out of left field—and I suspect might have been suffering a heavy dose of relevance syndrome—has tossed into the pack 
 a quite extraordinary attack on two former governments.</para><para>There is no doubt that East Timor not only is a problem for us in a political sense but is something for which I think collectively we should hang our heads in shame. I think there has been considerable neglect over 20 or 30 years, but I do not think that is addressed in the way the member for Kingsford-Smith has done it. As I say, it was right out of left field, and I am yet to see any evidence that it has achieved anything or that it is going to resolve this extraordinarily difficult problem that we have in relation to East Timor.</para><para>There is no doubt that the people of East Timor cannot stand on their own two feet in an economic sense at the moment. I think there is a very good school of thought which says they cannot stand on their two feet in a political sense at the moment either, but that surely does not mean that we do not strive to achieve what must be achieved. It is disappointing that this has now become a political football, where the member for Werriwa has to come in and try to defend past actions and bring former governments to account for their lack of action in relation to this. That was driven by the member for Kingsford-Smith, who, of his own doing, tried to make this a political football. He has achieved that by requiring the member for Werriwa to come in and defend it. Anyway, that was not the reason that I wanted to speak tonight, but I was moved by the comments of the member for Werriwa.</para><para>I want to speak tonight about what I see as a significant attack by the Australian Labor Party on the notion of mutual obligation—something that I believe is absolutely pivotal to this country's future. In my lifetime I do not think I have seen a more important initiative than the development of the concept of mutual obligation. The great irony about the concept of mutual obligation is that its greatest supporters are the people it was designed to assist. No amount of screaming from those who are opposed to this is going to alter the fact that we now have a principle in this country that is meeting the needs of both groups in the community.</para><para>I am sure there is not one member in this place, including those opposite, who have not been approached by the two groups who are pivotal to the changes we need to make. The first group is young people themselves, who are going through an appalling sense of hopelessness in relation to what lies ahead. I am sure there is not a member in this House who has not been approached by young people who have said, `I need a chance. I need some assistance. I need a sense of worth. I need something to direct my energies into.' On the other hand, we have members of the community who, in my view, have quite reasonable expectations that their giving of support to those in receipt of a benefit has the reciprocal obligation of something being given in return.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Martin interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RONALDSON</name></talker><para>—I will take the interjection from the shadow minister at the table. I will take it, and I will give him some quotes. I have no doubt that the shadow minister at the table, in the personal sense, does support mutual obligation. I think I know him well enough to say that he is the sort of person who would support it. But I will remind him of some comments made by his colleagues in relation to mutual obligation and, in this context, the Work for the Dole Scheme.	 On 11 February, 1997 the Leader of the Opposition described it as:</para></talk.start></continue><para>. . . an initiative which is in fact a disgrace . . . </para><para>And:</para><para>. . . we are going to amend it to blazes.</para><para>The member for Hotham, on <inline font-style="italic">Face to Face</inline>  on 16 March 1997, said they were opposed to the initiative:</para><para>. . . because it's demeaning to young people to say they've got to work for the dole.</para><para>On the Radio National <inline font-style="italic">Breakfast</inline>  program with Pru Goward on 10 February 1997, the then shadow employment spokesman, Martin Ferguson, said:</para><para>Are you trying to tell me that one and a half days or two days per week is going to give people the discipline to work? They go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week.</para><para>The one thing that young people in this country do not need is to be labelled as a 
 group of people who spend all day in bed or watching TV. The one thing that destroys young people is a view formulated by them that their contribution is not wanted, that there is no place for them. I would have thought that this was a great opportunity in this country for us to lock in place once and for all—no ifs, no buts—the concept of mutual obligation. It is simply not good enough for some members of the Labor Party to go behind closed doors, when they are speaking at rallies or at the local trade union branch meeting, and attack the concept of mutual obligation and then come in here and, whenever there is an attack on, say, `Oh, no! We support it.'</para><para>The simple fact is that the Labor Party does not support the concept of mutual obligation. They can say that they do, but those sorts of quotes are clear evidence of the fact that they are not prepared under any circumstances when they get back into government to maintain the principle of mutual obligation. They have no intention of maintaining the principle of mutual obligation. The interesting part is that if you look at the government's Work for the Dole program, which was attacked by a group of people—not only the Labor Party; they were joined by others—who said, `You can't force people to work for the dole; it is against their basic human rights,' that group of people have been proved very wrong.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Martin interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ronaldson, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RONALDSON</name></talker><para>—I am not talking about him; the shadow minister should listen. They should get out of the armchair and have a look at what is happening in the real world. The real world is that we are expecting a group of people now between the ages of 15 and 25 to be running this country in the next 10, 15 or 20 years. The responsibility on us is to make sure that their opportunities to participate and do that are maximised. This outrageous notion that you can sit in an armchair and sit in judgment on a program that is designed to achieve those dual matters I referred to before is somehow not in the interests of those young people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would go as far as to say that if those people sitting in those armchairs making those 
 comments, talking about this objective notion of no responsibility to work for the dole and no responsibility to give and take, are allowed to have their way, the chances of those young people running this country successfully, in my view, will be quite dramatically reduced.</para><para>There cannot be a member in this House who does not go to schools, as I do. There cannot be a member in this House who is not driven by the desire and enthusiasm of these young people to make their mark. But we have to take the lead in that. We have to tell these young people that it does not matter whether they live in Kununurra, Camperdown or Cape York, this country will provide them with the opportunity to maximise their own potential. I do not believe in the notion that we should drive children to achieve that which they cannot achieve, but I am a very strong supporter of the notion of encouraging our young people to maximise their own potential.</para><para>You cannot encourage young people to maximise their own potential if you do not instil in them at a very early age a sense of their own self-worth. If you do not instil in them the notion that they have a contribution to make, if you do not instil in them a sense that it is not a one-way street and that life is a game of give and take, when they get over the age of 15, 18 or 21 they will soon find out that life is a bit of give and take. Most of them will get married, and they will soon learn that life is a bit of give and take. They will hopefully get a job, and they will find that life is a bit of give and take. They will form close friendships, and they will learn that friendship is about give and take.</para><para>The one thing that will stop the wider community supporting these young people is if they form the view that they have not been asked to make a contribution. If you look at what is involved in the Work for the Dole program—and I have a number of examples from my own electorate about the sorts of things that are being done—which was attacked by certain members of the Labor Party, you can see that it is marrying the two essential groups that are going to make or break Australia's young people. Those two groups consist of the young people themselves and 
 the community. Ultimately, the community will decide the future for these young people. If the community believes that what we are doing as a nation is about give and take, I think the community will ensure that these young people have the opportunity they must get.</para><para>I get sick and tired of the bleeding hearts and the armchair critics who are not prepared to get off their backsides and go and see what is happening with things like the Work for the Dole scheme. It is very easy to sit back and criticise without going out and having a look. I challenge those armchair critics to have a look at not only what is happening on the ground with some of these Work for the Dole programs but also what the response of the community is to people who are participating.</para><para>I will give you a classic example of a Work for the Dole program in my electorate. A young man on the program wanted to get into the paint industry, and he went to see an employer. The employer could not see him that day but he told him to come back the next day. The employer said to this young man, `What can you offer me?' The young fellow said, `I am enthusiastic. I am on a Work for the Dole program. I am having a go.' The employer said, `You're what?' and the young man said, `I am on a Work for the Dole program.' The employer said, `Start next week'. The employer saw that young man getting in and having a go. If we do not support the principle of mutual obligation, and if we do not have programs that deliver that, then we will not have members of the community—in this case an employer—willing to assist.</para><para>In the time left to me, I also want to talk about the armchair critics who attacked the government's proposal to bring some mutual obligation into literacy and numeracy—affectionately known as `learn for the dole'. If there is one thing that will destroy a young person in Australia in 1999, it is a lack of literacy and numeracy skills. It is a sure-fire way to minimise their opportunities to participate in this country's future. I think it is a matter of utter disgrace that in 1999 there are still young people being turned out of school in this country who do not have basic literacy 
 and numeracy skills.	Learn for the dole is about providing some mutual obligation in getting up to speed on those skills, and I think it should be supported.</para><para>If we are to drive this nation into the year 2000 and beyond, it has to be on the basis that we all have responsibilities and we all have rights. For far too long, the rights have been put before the responsibilities. The sooner we start putting the responsibilities before the rights, the sooner we will start sending some messages to our young people and the community generally that we are serious about them and we are serious about their future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2752</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to use this time to talk about literacy and the `read for the dole' program. Literacy is something that I am not only very familiar with—and I have been active in promoting it both in parliament and outside; it is a very personal part of my own past.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of myths being perpetuated, especially by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In a press release dated 15 September 1997, he said:</para><para>. . . the system is failing tens of thousands of children. It is feeding the unemployment queues and denying children basic skills to participate fully in society.</para><para>He has continued, on television and in other pronouncements in parliament and in the media since that time, to build up a perception of a literacy crisis. This set the media off looking for new systems of teaching literacy and for scapegoats for the current problem. A whole host of people have been trying to make money out of teaching the illiterate to read.</para><para>I have been looking at what some of the professionals have been saying about this so-called crisis. I have my doubts that we are any worse off than we were, say, 20 years ago. From some work done by Associate Professor Brian Cambourne of the University of Wollongong, I learnt that in the past 20 years three major studies into adult literacy standards have been conducted, and they cast doubts on the claims that there is a literacy crisis. </para><para>A report by Goyen in 1974-75 found that the illiteracy rate was 1.6 per cent among the under-30s but 11.9 per cent among the over-60s. Wickert's 1987-89 study found that, on document and prose reading tasks, more people scored above the mean than below. Both studies found that there were more literacy problems with older and non-English-speaking background groups, and this was also supported in the 1997 study of adult literacy undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</para><para>Another report, Mapping Literacy Achievement, which was the official report on the 1996 National School English Literacy Survey which involved 8,300 students in years 3 and 5 in all states and in both government and non-government schools, found that indigenous students, students from poor socio-economic backgrounds and students who come from non-English speaking backgrounds experience literacy problems.</para><para>But there was a wide range of literacy achievement among Australian children. The top 10 per cent of students in each year are working about five levels ahead of the bottom 10 per cent—not exactly a crisis, more of a skew, with the skills at the bottom level being more difficult to deal with. I am inclined to agree with Andrew Macfarlane, who carried out an analysis of that study which he believed Dr Kemp wanted to use for his own agenda in describing a literacy crisis. Mr Macfarlane commented that while the figures were interesting they probably showed the increasing gap between the socio-economic groups as students got older. But the study was cautious, as it was supposed to be used for setting benchmarks.</para><para>I am not satisfied that the big cry of crisis in literacy is valid in the way that it is being portrayed by the minister. It is certainly no worse in children than it was 20 years ago, and in most cases a lot better than in many other developed countries. However, it is not the time to be complacent. I will now quote from the Australian Council of Adult Literacy. Going back to the Wicker study, she found there was a need to use a different definition of literacy from the literacy campaigns of the past. Literacy was no longer 
 seen as the achievement of a basic threshold of reading ability but as integrally linked with how adults use literacy in their everyday lives.</para><para>The OECD definition is `how adults use written information to function well'. This report goes on to describe how they develop the tests and the assessment processes and come up with a way of arranging scores grouped at five different levels. I would like to quote directly from the findings of this Australian survey:</para><para>A part of the survey was designed to assess participants perceptions of their literacy and numeracy practices. Seventy four per cent of those surveyed do not write regularly—no more than a page once a month at the most.</para><para>Twenty five per cent said they never have to write at work and sixty per cent do not read very often—perhaps once a month. Twenty eight per cent said they never have to use maths skills at work. Fourteen per cent of people stated they need help with reading information from government and business and ten per cent wanted help with filling out forms.</para><para>When we look at the actual performance of the survey tasks, all of which were considered to be reasonably familiar, and were in common use, the following extrapolations can be made about the levels of literacy skills of Australians aged fifteen to seventy four:</para><para>Level 1—2.6 million people</para><para>Level 2—3.6 million people</para><para>Level 3—4.8 million people</para><para>Levels 4/5—2.3 million people.</para><para>Based on these and other findings, we can infer that almost half the adult population in Australia can be expected to have difficulty coping with the information processing demands of everyday life. In addition, it was reported that people who are currently unemployed have much greater difficulty than those who are in the work force, and that literacy difficulties appear to increase with age (except for the 15—19 year old age group), particularly for non-English speaking migrants.</para><para>Across the whole sample, of people who did not speak English as their first language, approaching half were at the lowest level on the scale. More surprising, perhaps, is that fourteen per cent of those who first spoke English are also at that level.</para><para>They finish up by saying that despite the limitations of their study there is clearly cause for concern about adult literacy and numeracy 
 and that funding should not be cut for those struggling with reading and writing.</para><para>This report has not dealt with the compulsory side of the government's program. However, it highlights where the problem really does lie. This is backed up by the volunteer tutors—to whom I personally owe so much—who have been working with the problem for many years with little reward. I would like to put on record a letter written by some of those tutors, who are very concerned at the way things are going in adult literacy. The people concerned are Betty Anderson, Jean Lee and Peggy Wolfe, who are wonderful volunteer tutors in the Southern Tasmania region. They wrote a letter to the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> on 11 February which says:</para><para>We urge the federal and State governments to provide access to adult literacy and numeracy support for all Australians.</para><para>Referring to the recent federal speech, `The Australian Way', we applaud the Prime Minister for expanding the age range in which mutual obligation policy is to include all unemployed people. However, it does not cover all the people who have literacy problems. We feel it is not sufficient, nor should it be compulsory.</para><para>An OECD survey conducted in Australia in 1996 shows there are more people who need assistance than those targeted by the Prime Minister. Adult literacy should cater for all adults, employed or not. Why should those in society who are employed or not seeking work and come forward voluntarily be discriminated against? Many people need literacy assistance for job retention, promotion or job change. Others simply seek to improve their quality of life. The current allocation of training hours by the Tasmania State Training Authority to access equality in Tasmania is six per cent, compared with the national average of 17 per cent. Adult literacy and basic education, as one of a diverse range of providers, does not have enough training hours with current funding to meet the needs of clients.</para><para>Training in Tasmania would be on a far stronger foundation if access and equity funding were increased to 17 per cent. We feel it is essential that a comprehensive 
 Tasmanian and Australian adult literacy and numerary program be developed to meet the needs of all adults who seek assistance. Another letter actually fingers what I believe lies at the bottom of the problem. Alis Jacob of Kingston asks:</para><para>Is illiteracy the real issue or is the fact that the Government cannot adequately justify the loss of opportunities for job seekers across Australia and evident demise of Centrelink?</para><para>If this is all about jobs and trying to make people responsible for their own inadequacies, it makes it a pretty rough life when they were not able to do anything about it at the time when they were best fitted to learn.</para><para>Gaining literacy must be done at a time when the brain is most susceptible to experimentation and learning, which is when we are young—in family life, at child care and at kindergarten. When a family has no history of reading at home or having books and bedtime stories, it is unlikely that children will be suitably prepared to understand what reading is all about. Learning early and using words and language as games and as something that is stimulating is easy for them. It becomes fun and they feel they are achieving with a base of some sort to build on. School becomes an exciting place and it is possible to build on earlier experiences.</para><para>You could hardly say the same of a 24-year-old who has no reading or writing background in family life or anywhere else and who has hidden his disability by looking for employment that does not require either of those skills. Sitting in a classroom with others being forced to undertake lessons is likely to alienate them further. They will feel angry and resentful. They will at best learn whatever is necessary to get them their money and at worst be disruptive, drop out and do whatever is required to acquire a means of living. That leaves them not much more than a life of crime. Neither will be literate in the real sense of the word. It is not their fault that they did not learn as a child. There would be a host of reasons they did not learn. I doubt very much if they would understand the theories of mutual responsibility in relation to literacy—and for good reason. To them, it is really a load of cow manure.</para><para>As the reports I have quoted point out, adults and particularly older adults have all sorts of reasons for not reading. Some never went to school. Others went but left early without mastering basic literacy. Others can read and write enough to do basic daily tasks and read the newspaper headlines but would be completely at sea if asked to write a report or develop an argument on something they had read. The other problem is that the concept of work has changed. No longer can people learn on the job. Most jobs require a person to be slotted in at a certain level with all the skills present. You cannot start by making the tea and finding a mentor who can help you through, as did so many of our older achievers in this world.</para><para>The government is using its failure to provide this sort of start-up training—it was available under Working Nation, I wish to add; it was there—to penalise the unemployed, to blame them for failing to find work because of their literacy level. Therefore, they must be punished: `No dole. You have failed.' The government will succeed in putting up the crime rate and enlarging the black market, GST or no GST. There is no way out. It is a bit like Emil Zola's <inline font-style="italic">Paris</inline>—degradation and poverty being the prize, even for the most enterprising person. It is not surprising that something like 70 per cent of those who have been in gaol have literacy problems. As Gregory D. Watson so eloquently put it:</para><para>Illiteracy is tied to a cycle of poverty or low income status, undereducation, dependency, poor health and crime. For those who cannot read or write, access to education and good jobs is limited. There is a constraint on their social climb no matter how industrious. Socially the illiterate are disenfranchised. A person who is illiterate, or even functionally illiterate, may have little or no voice in the democratic process. Others decide what is best for them. They are unaware of the great events of history through the richness of literature, the drama of human life on a larger scale. They are unaware of themselves in the context of an evolving world culture they cannot understand. They are oppressed, in no mild sense. What was the privilege of a few has become the birthright of the masses.</para><para>How about we start addressing the problem at the real end of it? Flying start programs can help children before they start school and should be part of any assessment for literacy 
 assistance. We can encourage parents to read to their children, helped through adult literacy programs. Reading for a non-critical audience is great practice for those whose skills are limited. We can encourage people to want to learn, not force them with the sword of Damocles hovering over them. There should be more funding to help volunteers continue their good work. Volunteers can help on a one-to-one basis. They are the people that set up a student to go on to the next step—the one that actually gives them the formal qualification.</para><para>Parliamentarians should not use disadvantaged people as the scapegoats for their own inadequacies. They should learn more about why they are in the situation that they are and do something about it.</para><para>Madam Deputy Speaker, earlier tonight in a speech on the grievance debate you mentioned that the Work for the Dole program was a good one and that 40 weeks would be available for training. Taking the example, again, of a 24-year-old, what chance will he be given of a job by this government? Will he be guaranteed a job once he has done his compulsory reading and numeracy training? Will it be there when he finishes his class? As with our Working Nation, which was not perfect, will there be some training alongside so that he can pick up on his literacy and numeracy at the same time? It is very difficult to learn otherwise.</para><para>When we talk, as the member for Ballarat did, about mutual obligation, it is the definition of mutual obligation that we on this side have a few problems with. Mutual obligation works two ways, not one. Working without training and without a future is the same as working in any jobs which were criticised in our time.	I call on the government to set some targets for jobs. They have not done that and they do not seem to want to do so. They bring in work for the dole and read for the dole, but they provide no targets. They give the Australian people no opportunity to make a judgment about their policies.</para><para>Let us get rid of this stupid idea of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and put something into place that is going to work, to help people learn and give 
 them some dignity. If he does that he will be very surprised to learn that the cost will be a lot less than his current and future programs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Kelly)</name></talker><para>—I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his attention to my earlier address.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>2755</page.no><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name><name.id>XJ6</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Deputy Speaker, it is nice to see the member for Dawson in the chair. The appropriation bill determines how the government spends the money it raises from taxpayers. Clearly, the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party is that we only spend money that we collect. In the last year of the Keating-Beazley administration, Labor appropriated $10.3 billion that did not exist. That has caused enormous problems for this country just recently. Looking at it another way, that was over $200 million a week on special programs for noisy minorities, fraudulent social security claims, discredited employment programs or other measures. It is important to recognise that the coalition only spends money that it actually raises. This prudent management has helped us focus on spending areas that need government intervention.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight I would like to speak on a number of issues both on a national level and in the electorate of Richmond that I represent. Finally, I will spend some time talking about supermarkets, particularly the incredible domination that is occurring in the retail sector, and some of the real concerns I have for Australia and indeed for regional Australia.</para><para>Last week there was a lot of discussion by the federal opposition on the book club and perhaps some internal navel gazing. There were two major publications by the government concerning trade and e-commerce which I would like to talk about. The first was a statement on trade outcomes and objectives which outlines Australia's trade and investment performance and prospects. It is important because it looks at both the past trade and where we currently are to try to get an indication of future trading patterns, which is absolutely critical for this country. It also sets 
 out some, I believe, achievable market access objectives for the next two years.</para><para>What was extraordinary in the 1997-98 year for Australia's trade was that, even with the severe economic crisis in Asia, particularly in South-East Asia, we still had a record export level of $114 billion. That was an increase of over eight per cent over the previous year. Despite the downturn, our exporters managed to be incredibly diverse in responding to the Asian crisis by switching markets to the United States, Europe and other countries. Whilst we saw about a 20 per cent decline in exports to South-East Asia, we saw a 41 per cent increase to our second biggest trading partner, which is the United States. We saw a 25 per cent increase by Australian exporters to the European Union. Even to the troubled Russian economy there was a 121 per cent increase.</para><para>Whilst that was a good year, we do not want to rest on our laurels, because the next financial year will be a difficult trading environment for Australia. That is why it is very important that we continue to emphasise bilateral, regional and multilateral trade agreements to ensure that we have access to new markets to sell Australian produce. Whilst it might not be at the front of everyone's mind, particularly in regional Australia, at the new round of the World Trade Organisation, which will start at the end of this year—it is called the Millennium Round—it is critically important for Australia to ensure that we maintain access to these markets, because in some economies we are seeing what is called backsliding, where there is a tendency to go back to more protectionist policies as a very short-term measure so countries can protect themselves in this deteriorating trading environment.</para><para>It is important for Australia to lead the way and ensure that we do not get a revision of those protectionist policies. At the end of the day, it is all about jobs. In Australia, 20 per cent of the work force—that is, 1.7 million—is directly involved in the export industry. Just in tourism alone, that figure ranges between 250,000 and half a million. We must continue to push our exports and match import replacements.</para><para>The other thing that I thought was of extreme importance for the country was the launch of the electronic commerce—known as e-commerce—reports. Whilst there was another launch, that of a Labor book, a valedictory, by none other than Paul Keating—it is interesting to note that he endorsed the government's plans to sell Telstra—this publication concerned two studies on Internet commerce. One was called `Driving Forces on the New Silk Road' and the other was called `Creating a Clearway on the New Silk Road'. For those who might not know the silk road, that was the main link between Europe and China by Marco Polo many hundreds of years ago.</para><para>What we are saying in this report is that we strongly believe that Internet commerce will be the next micro-economic revolution for the 21st century, just as the internal combustion engine was or as the steam engine back in the 18th century gave rise to the Industrial Revolution. Of course, in the 1950s the jet engine was invented. Who would have thought 40 years ago that we would now have an international tourist market? It was unheard of.</para><para>The next revolution, whether or not we like it, will certainly be in electronic commerce. It is very important that Australia positions its export industries and job creation to be on that pathway, to be more competitive in our environment and also to provide not just goods but services. It is in the area of services that we have an advantage, particularly as we are in the same time zone as South-East Asia, whether we are providing accounting or legal services, or the transportation of goods.</para><para>The growth in e-commerce has been extraordinary. Some years ago, they were anticipating that by the year 2000 e-commerce would be in the area of $100 billion to $150 billion. That figure is now $500 billion to $1,500 billion. Over 300 million people are now using the Internet compared to two million in 1995. So the actual global value of Internet commerce by the year 2000 will overtake the size of the Australian economy. A dramatic change is happening. Even if only 20 per cent of global Internet commerce is traded between countries, this will provide enormous opportunities for international trade. It is important 
 for Australia as we are one of the few countries, along with the United States and some Scandinavian countries, which have embraced this. It is also important that regional Australia embrace it, particularly small business which has been very reluctant.</para><para>In my electorate of Richmond, there are some areas which I believe could benefit dramatically from a sensible endorsement of electronic commerce, particularly in tourism and travel—it is enormous at the moment. Manufacturing would benefit with improving inventory and distribution systems. In primary production, the Internet is becoming an important marketing tool for commodities. So many farmers lose much of their control and pricing at the farm gate when they send their product off to the wholesaler and to the market system. Internet commerce is perhaps an avenue where goods can go from the farm gate straight to the retailer and not through the myriad distributors who often take a huge chunk of the profit. We can also develop special niche markets for Australiana products.</para><para>Sadly, the greatest growth in Internet commerce is in gambling and pornography, which are not often talked about. While gambling is already part of the Australian ethos, there has been a rapid increase in gambling on the Internet. In the Northern Territory, which is the only part of mainland Australia to allow electronic gambling, Centrebet—and good luck to them—is racking up several million dollars a week in Internet commerce. While there are enormous advantages with e-commerce, there are some risks as well. As the parliament and as legislators, we have to ensure that those two areas are monitored.</para><para>Also, we have to provide adequate infrastructure for electronic commerce. Electronic commerce will overcome the tyranny of distance in a lot of regional communities where they have been disadvantaged because of their location, particularly compared with their city cousins. I believe the Internet could lead to a doubling or tripling of regional Australian firms as they are able to access across not just state boundaries, but also international boundaries. In Byron shire there 
 is a very high degree of Internet connection, computer literacy and enterprising spirit which is crucial to expansion.</para><para>We have talked about appropriations and I have talked about some of the big picture, like $11,000 million that we spend every year on defence for this county. It is also important to talk about what is happening on a microcosm level. Last Friday in Byron Bay I opened the new Byron Business Village—a new business incubator in Byron Bay. Like many other parts of regional Australia, Byron suffers from very high levels of unemployment. The Commonwealth put in half a million dollars for this business incubator. It allows 15 new enterprises to set up their own enterprise and gives them a chance to get on their feet until they can move into bigger premises. Some of those new businesses include carpet laying, woodwork, natural paints, glass sculptures, ceramics and bicycle repairs, just to name a few.</para><para>Where I come from, without question small business is the largest employer. Really it is the only salvation for many people who find it extremely difficult to get employment because we do not have the critical mass of multinationals or large organisations. I would like to record my thanks to Gary Bargh and the people at Ballina Employment and Training Centre who were the key project sponsors of the Byron Business Village, and likewise to the Byron Chamber of Commerce and to the council.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>834</name.id><name role="metadata">LAWLER</name><name role="display">Mr Lawler</name></talker><para>—That's why you weren't in Wangaratta.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>—I am sorry I could not make it to Wangaratta, but I am led to believe that it was certainly in good hands. Further south in the electorate of Richmond there is another project at Ballina Ex-Services and Community Care complex where the government provided a grant of $20,000 for the Shed Out the Back, helping the elderly particularly—in this case mainly men—to maintain their skill base as they grow older. Up north of the electorate, another very good initiative is with the Tweed war widows where funding has been provided to overcome social isolation. In this case it was funding for bus excursions—perhaps fairly pedestrian for 
 most of us, but making a huge impact on older people's lives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Another important initiative, speaking of appropriations, is a decision made by the government at the end of last year, that is, the new incentives for apprenticeships. That is where there has been a major thrust by the coalition. Under the previous government, apprenticeships were at a 30-year low. This initiative provides training and skills, not just a six-month program, but traineeships or apprenticeships for 12 months and up to four years.</para><para>We still have very high levels of unemployment on the North Coast. It is encouraging that nationally unemployment is at an eight-year low, but there is still much work to be done in the northern part of New South Wales. The apprenticeship scheme provides an extra $1,000—that is, up to about $5,000—which employers can utilise in areas of skill shortages, whether they be motor mechanics, IT or hairdressing, just to name a few. Jenny Brunker of the Tweed Chamber of Commerce has been very supportive of it, and likewise the Tweed Shire Council.</para><para>Probably the biggest appropriation issue in my electorate is one for which the funds have been appropriated for over two years. Unfortunately that funding has not been spent. Before going further on this issue I would like to place on record my deep sorrow at the deaths of Margaret Ross, John Lyons and his daughter Adelle, who tragically were killed on the Pacific Highway—the latter two on the Burringbar Range in the last few weeks. It has been a very sad time for Mullumbimby where they came from. A spate of tragedies has befallen that town, and I extend my deepest sympathy to their families.</para><para>The issue I would like to talk about is the Chinderah to Yelgun motorway. Prior to the 1996 federal election, the then opposition leader, John Howard, and the current Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer,  came to Richmond to announce that a coalition government would take the unusual step of funding half of the proposed Chinderah to Yelgun motorway—a 22-kilometre bypass of the Burringbar Range. When it is started—which is a moot point—it will be the biggest single road 
 project in Australia. The Burringbar Range has claimed 21 Australian lives in the past five years—that is not to mention all the other costs. The motorway was scheduled to be opened late this year or next year. Sadly, that will not happen. Not one bulldozer has been brought into action. And there have been countless reasons but, quite frankly, the fault does lie with the New South Wales government, which has the constitutional responsibility to make it happen through its planning powers but has not made it a priority.</para><para>It is rather rich that it would spend $20 million on grass canopies over an underpass in Sydney—I believe it is next to the New South Wales Art Gallery—rather than spend that money, as it should be, on Australia's national road and, in this case, the Pacific Highway. The degree of partisanship and political opportunism has been appalling in the lead-up to 27 March. No doubt, there will be a flurry of announcements just prior to the state election, but that will be four years until we get the road.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VU5</name.id><name role="metadata">GRIFFIN</name><name role="display">Mr Griffin</name></talker><para>—A grant for every family?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XJ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Anthony, Larry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>—With all due respect to those members in the chamber, this is a project of national importance. It is our national highway. I lived on that range, and I can tell you that it has taken a huge toll, not only on those people who have been affected but on the psychology of towns in that community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On another matter, I noticed that on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program the opposition leader, Kim Beazley, claimed that all his election platform policies would be thrown out—obviously going back to square one. That seems rather hypocritical when we on this side of the House are actually tackling major issues to try to make Australia a better place—whether it be tax reform or industrial relations—and not just running a book club.</para><para>The area I would like to talk about in the remaining time concerns a distinctly National Party policy—that is, the growing problem of supermarket domination of the retail sector, particularly in regional Australia. In October 1998 the National Party promised to establish a Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. The terms of reference have now been 
 resolved, and they are: firstly, the degree of industry concentration within the retailing sector in Australia, with particular reference to the small independent retailers; secondly, to look at what other economies, particularly in the OECD, are doing with this increasing competition—and I would say it is unfair competition; and, thirdly, what action we can take in this House—not just the government but both parties—to ensure that we have an equitable small business environment.</para><para>When you look at the United Kingdom, the major grocery retailers control 45 per cent of the market. In the greatest free enterprise bastion of the world, the United States, it is 21 per cent. In Japan it is 17 per cent. In Australia, sadly, it is 80 per cent. I must add that this case was eloquently put by a colleague of mine, the member for Parkes, in his maiden speech, when he stated:</para><para>I believe the government for too long has stood aside and watched the main supermarket chains take ever increasing slices of the retail market to the point where they now control 80 per cent of total retail sales in Australia.</para><para>This figure has doubled in the last 20 years. Some figures suggest that the big three chains have actually bought out nearly $1 billion worth of small and independent retailers in the last three years alone. As a parliament where do we start to draw the line? Is competition where the chains own 95 per cent of the retail sales?</para><para>There are other issues which hurt small business, such as  extended trading hours—which is vexing, because many consumers enjoy them. They also enjoy QA requirements, but that has an impact, particularly on farmers. The concentration  that the retailers have in determining price to those who are supplying horticultural or any type of goods to supermarkets is quite alarming. Hydroponics is certainly one industry that I have had a number of representations on.</para><para>So part of the answer, I hope, is that many of these supermarkets, instead of continuing to look at buying Australian market share, which already is at 80 per cent, will be encouraged to look offshore and to use Australia as a supplier for South-East Asia. I do hope an organisation such as the Dairy 
 Farm Group will embrace the use of Australia as a sourcing platform to that massive market across the sea.</para><para>At the end of the day, it does come down to competition. While it is important to have a number of players in the market, if there are only two players, an oligopoly situation, you can hardly call that competition. This is one area where national competition policy needs to be reviewed. Whilst there have been enormous gains in the big end of town—whether it is with electricity or gas or perhaps in telecommunications—it is in the area of small business with its local governments and particularly in regional areas where competition has not meant lower prices that gains need to be made. Indeed, competition, in some cases, has led to substantial reductions in services. In my wrap-up I think it is important to highlight the necessity for trade. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2759</page.no><name role="metadata">Hollis, Colin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLIS</name><name.id>DH4</name.id><electorate>Throsby</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="r704">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1998-99</inline> , because it enables me to highlight some of the very dubious practices that this government has been involved in. I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Richmond, especially in the opening part of his speech where he said that the government only spends money it raises. It seems to me that the honourable member for Richmond has not looked at the details of this appropriation bill, because he would find out just what sort of dubious practices this government is involved in with Australian taxpayers' money.</para></talk.start><para>The bill provides for additional, major appropriations to a number of departments but particularly to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business for an amount of just over $2 million to meet litigation costs of the waterfront dispute. The bill provides for additional appropriations for the Department of Family and Community Services of just over $147 million for the running costs of Centrelink. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides for just over $19 million to be appropriated to the Treasury for the `community education and information program' on the introduction of the GST.</para><para>This bill, in the three areas mentioned, highlights the failures of the Howard government. Finally, after all of the policy misfires and shooting from the hip by various ministers this debt is now being put before the taxpayer. The bill represents the long, ideological drive of the government. It represents the views of smallest government, an all-out attack against workers and the organisations that represent them, and the distribution of the tax burden in the wrong direction.</para><para>Some might argue that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is indeed a very lucky politician. He escaped being put before a court to answer detailed questioning about his activities prior to and during the waterfront dispute last year. The minister said endlessly throughout last year that he knew nothing about the Patrick Stevedores decision to unilaterally sack its entire waterfront work force until the last moment—well, that is what he claims, that he did not know anything about it until the very last moment. Questions were put to him and the Prime Minister in this place but their denials were consistent.</para><para>This bill, however, confirms otherwise, that the minister, his office and his department were up to their necks in the plotting and scheming with Patrick management to sack waterfront workers in a failed attempt to break the Maritime Union of Australia. Today, or tonight, this bill seeks just over $2 million to pay for litigation costs incurred by the minister's ideological stupidity. That is what they will vote for in this bill. Australians are entitled to ask: did the minister learn anything from the failed attack on the trade union movement and workers last year? Well, indeed, there is a $2 million answer to that question before us tonight. Nothing has been learnt.</para><para>In a speech to a business lunch in Perth last year, Minister Reith said:</para><para>Never forget the history of politics and never forget which side we're on.</para><para>We're on the side of making profits.</para><para>We're on the side of people owning private capital.</para><para>Just last week, the minister was frothing at the mouth about the trade union movement and yet again attempted to portray the opposi 
 tion as representing a sectional group of workers. Let me make it clear: I don't, never have and never will abandon my links and association with the trade union movement of Australia. Every so often those opposite—especially the ministers on the frontbench on the opposite side—quote how many members of this side come from a trade union background, as if in some way it were a badge of shame.</para><para>I come from a trade union background and I regard it as a matter of pride to have come from a trade union background. In my region, the Illawarra, the labour movement leads the community—it always has and always will. For those who say that we are all former union hacks, and the other terms they use, what they occasionally forget is that the ALP grew out of the trade union movement. We were a movement of the trade union. That is different from those on the other side—they are a movement of the bosses, of the capitalists, of the ruling class. We grew out of the trade union movement; a movement of the workers, not of the bosses and not of the capitalists.</para><para>On Friday of last week a new battle sprung up at Gordonstone in Queensland. Just like the waterfront debacle last year, the people owning capital are at it again using this government's industrial legislation to undermine jobs and living standards. Rio Tinto management has again taken to the workers of Gordonstone, despite various decisions by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and also the Federal Court. On Friday morning, a bus load of scabs were transported onto the site to take the jobs of miners whose only perceived sin is to wish to belong to the CFMEU. Rio Tinto, like all of the members of the government, want a weak, compliant work force so that the people owning private capital can make their profits off the back of low wages, increased hours of work and no protection or conditions of employment. I support the CFMEU and the sacked miners who, after nearly 18 months, are still fighting to get their jobs back and for their families.</para><para>Centrelink is another example of this government's narrow-mindedness. Following the 1996 budget, one of the first acts of the 
 Howard government was to attack a local suburb in my electorate. The local community at Warrawong was attacked not once but twice with the removal of essential public services. First the Warrawong Medicare office was closed and moved to Wollongong and then in the dead of night came the announcement that the area's then Department of Social Security office would also be closed. I described the decision to close both offices as monumentally stupid and I have no reason to alter that view—neither, I might add, has the local community.</para><para>After a long, frustrating battle in which the Warrawong community was led ably by the Save Our Services Committee, the Centrelink office is set to return. Unfortunately, the soon to be re-established Centrelink office will not operate on a five-day week basis, like the offices in other areas. Nonetheless, the negotiations for leased accommodation, which are still continuing, will mean that Warrawong will no longer be treated as the Illawarra's missing link. It is an offensive outrage that a local community in the very heart of my electorate has been treated so shabbily by the penny-pinching mentality of this government. But at least in their long campaign their voices have finally been heard.</para><para>In an age when people are so cynical about the possible effects of people power and the ability to influence big corporations and bureaucracy, the re-establishment of an albeit scaled down Warrawong Centrelink office is proof that ordinary people can change issues and decisions.</para><para>I now turn to the big ticket item in this legislation—the just over $19 million that the government seeks appropriation for for the Treasury to pay for the community education and information program on the introduction of a new tax system. The organisation that should be responsible for paying this huge amount is the Liberal Party of Australia. The government, in its weak, pathetic defence, seeks to suggest that Labor governments have done the same thing—that is, appropriate money to pay for election promises.</para><para>Labor governments have never been so acutely arrogant with public money. The main reason is quite simply that we would never 
 get away with it. We would have been criticised up hill and down dale for an expenditure so blatantly political in the weeks leading up to a general election and during the election campaign proper. Labor would have been attacked every minute of the day by every major radio broadcaster in the country.</para><para>Labor would have been subject to front-page headlines in every major newspaper and lead items on every television news and current affairs program, to say nothing of the screaming editorials that would have torn us apart. And imagine what Alan Jones would have spewed out every morning if it had been Labor trying this on! Yet the Howard government escapes this sort of public criticism and calls for accountability. Every radio broadcaster who fumes about the most minor mistake by bureaucracy has been singularly silent in calling on the Liberal Party of Australia to foot the $20 million for the political advertising that they used in their last election campaign.</para><para>Labor governments have had propriety on these issues because we have always known that we are subject to much higher standards of accountability. I can recall, as many of my colleagues will, that during the 1990 election the Australian Labor Party paid for the publication of budget papers because we were heading towards an election. My colleagues know the mountains of books and other publications we get hit with when the Treasurer of the day rises to his feet to announce budget measures, but the ALP paid the bill, not the Australian taxpayer—but the Australian taxpayer is now being asked to pay the bill for the electioneering of the Liberal Party.</para><para>Throughout this government's time in opposition, I heard much criticism of the arrogance of the then Prime Minister and cabinet ministers—indeed, the whole of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Anyone who witnessed the Prime Minister's interview on the Channel 10 program <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> yesterday morning would have to agree that his performance was the most arrogant and dismissive of any modern holder of that office. I cannot see the broadsheets letting former Prime Ministers Hawke or Keating get away with that performance.</para><para>Again, we in the Labor Party know that we are subject to different and higher standards by journalists and the community generally. Never has a Labor Party proposed fundamental change to Australia's policy or institutional structure without there being an opportunity for widespread debate and consideration. As observers of the Labor Party are only too well aware, by allowing substantial debate we often get ourselves into trouble, with accusations that we are divided. It is happening again now with one-line gibes by those opposite that we are all members of book clubs. The members of the Labor Party are never silent about our differences—nor should we be. We have always been a party of debate and we have always been a party of ideas.</para><para>Labor Party members fight hard because we are passionate. We care deeply about issues and policy. We have principle and purpose. Labor Party members do not flee a struggle. Contrast this approach with the conservatives who never debate things, and nobody ever dares question, doubt or dissent. They talk about the book club on this side, but we are all waiting quite anxiously for a few books to be produced on that side to show that they have got a few ideas.</para><para>The conservative grand plan always falls apart under pressure. It happened with the waterfront and it is happening again with the GST. The Senate committee assessing the GST has already punched tremendous holes in the need for this tax, showing that it will erode employment prospects and confirming that the tax system as we know it is not a basket case. This bill points to the next three years of the Howard government doing more of the same for which it has been notorious during its first term. The rhetoric by the Prime Minister on election night about a different government approach and an inclusive Australia counts for nothing. The Howard government's second term is all about nastiness, meanness, pettiness and cringing—a narrow ideological agenda that does nothing for Australia as we move into the next century.</para><para>Having spent the first three-quarters of my speech on internal issues, I now turn to an 
 international perspective on an area that I have a particular interest in—population and development. That issue is not debated nearly as much as it should be in this parliament. Almost five years ago, there was an international conference on population at Cairo. Prior to that formal meeting, there was a meeting of parliamentarians to discuss the issue.</para><para>As I said, population and development get far too little mention in this parliament. At the meeting in Cairo, parliamentarians from all over the world agreed that population issues should not be seen in isolation but rather within the larger context of sustainable development for improving the quality of life of all humankind. There, parliamentarians welcomed the approach that placed family planning within the broader framework of reproductive health care. They urged governments to make responsible efforts to resolve population issues in ways that respect human rights while responding to their own national and cultural identities, values, traditions and ethics.</para><para>In Cairo, parliamentarians recognised that development cannot be sustained unless women are guaranteed equal rights and equal status with men. They called on legislators all over the world to join them in their efforts to empower women as a matter of national priority and on governments to enforce the necessary legislation. They also supported the right of all people to have access to reproductive health services, including family planning, by the year 2015. They pledged to work to reduce the disparities in health conditions and mortality risks between and within countries. They also vowed to work to increase both domestic and international funding for population and development programs.</para><para>It was my privilege, in early February of this year, to attend a conference in the Hague, Netherlands, called Cairo Plus Five. The idea of the conference was that, as it was five years since Cairo, there should be an international forum of parliamentarians to review the progress made and the constraints encountered by individual countries in the implementation of the plan from Cairo. It was an exceptionally good meeting.</para><para>The progress in implementing the Cairo plan has been very mixed indeed. In some 
 countries, I guess where it is least needed, the program has in many respects been most successful. But, interestingly, issues were raised by the countries of the former Soviet Union, Latin American countries and various others, and there was much debate and much criticism of the negative role many religions play in this field.</para><para>The other sobering thought is that the recent financial and economic turmoil witnessed in East and South-East Asia, parts of Eastern Europe and indeed Latin America, and the associated massive job losses and increases in poverty levels, have slowed—if not in some cases reversed—some of the impressive development gains so painstakingly built up over the past three decades. It is always a great pity that, when many of the developing countries experience economic downturns, one of the first programs to suffer is the family planning program.</para><para>Another sad element has been that countries have been withdrawing funding for population programs. The USA, pushed by the far right of the USA I have no doubt, has withdrawn funding from the UNFPA. This will have a dramatic impact on that program and will subject many women to all sorts of problems in much of the developing world. Australia has never restored the funding to what it was when the Howard government came to power. In that first budget they slashed the funding to UNFPA and indeed halved the funding to the International Planned Parenthood Federation. We were told at that time that it was only a short-term budgetary program.</para><para>Australia overall has a good record in the area of population development, and I think it is a great pity that we have cut that funding. I hope the government and the various ministers will see their way clear to restoring that funding. If they are not going to do it in relation to the international bodies, surely we can increase our funding to population programs in our part of the world, where in many respects we have a responsibility.</para><para>In October of this year the world's population will pass the six billion mark. At the turn of the century it was just over one billion. The sobering aspect of this is that the last one billion was gained in the last 11 years. India's 
 population alone will reach one billion by May in the year 2000.</para><para>In many respects the rate of population growth is slowing. However, there is also a demographic shift, which is presenting the world with new challenges. We have an ageing population but we also have an unprecedented high population in the child-bearing years. We are going to have a problem in that area. At this time, more young people than ever are entering their child-bearing years; so even with success in curtailing population in so many parts of the world population will increase. You have to ask: what is the long-term sustainable level of development or carrying capacity of the world? Is it eight billion? Is it 10 billion? Is it 12 billion? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2763</page.no><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name><name.id>MP6</name.id><electorate>Cook</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure to rise tonight to speak on the appropriation bills.

If you look at it, what is actually going to happen is the reverse. We will be taking $4½ billion dollars off the export costs, making us more competitive in the international market. Having been through the process, I am certainly happy to debate that with him at any time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is no doubt that our exporters will be better off than they have been at any time in the past 20 years. I am very pleased to see 
 that this government is allocating resources that are going to provide returns not only for this generation but for generations to come. For example, the $260 million that was allocated to Austrade is being returned through the magnificent efforts in Australia's exports.</para><para>The Australian trade figures provided by the Deputy Prime Minister show that our exports total $114 billion, which is up over the year before by 8.2 per cent. That is a magnificent effort considering that we sit in South-East Asia, where every country except China is in either recession or depression. In achieving this amazing result of 8.2 per cent, I want to pay tribute to the Deputy Prime Minister, in particular his enthusiasm in leading Australia's push for exports. I was with him on one particular trip to South-East Asia and I have to say that his enthusiasm and his sense of vision have been very important in leading our drive for exports in the trade area.</para><para>If we look at the reports from Austrade to find out where they are actually spending this money in order to get the returns for this government, we find that, for example, they were in San Diego for the first time with a major trade fair. There was an increase of 60 per cent over the previous event. That reflects the tremendous interest by this government in South America in developing this market. In the years to come I am sure that we will see a continuing growth of the South American market. We already have direct air links with South America. Qantas has started direct services to South America. It is an important market to develop.</para><para>They have also been in South-East Asia at the Food and Hotel Asia—the premier food show in South-East Asia. We had direct sales of $1.3 million. Then 56 Australian companies exhibited at Siebert in 1998 in Hanover, Germany, reporting sales of $31.6 million, with $10 million sales in 1997—another significant increase.</para><para>This tends to illustrate where the government is putting its resources. It is not only about a government of reform but about putting resources in these important areas of trade promotion and trade development to get the exporters out in the marketplace, to sign 
 the contracts and to get the returns for the Australian economy. It is particularly interesting to see the way we provided, for exporters, $147 million last year, as outlined in the appropriation bill, in export market development grants. These grants assist exporters to get out there in marketplaces right throughout the world where they may not have had the resources previously to assist them to go out there and attempt to sign up orders around the world. And that pays off. That $114 billion comes from this type of effort, from trade promotion and from Austrade and of course from the Export Market Development Grants Scheme—a great assistance and a great effort.</para><para>This is all about providing the right economic environment. It is not only in the trade area but also in the tourism area. I am very pleased to see that we have our highly enthusiastic Minister for Sport and Tourism at the table. Her shadow is also sitting there and I am sure he would congratulate the minister on what she is achieving already.</para><para>This is another area in which the government has been allocating funds. In this financial year, $85 million has been allocated to tourism promotion. This amount is one of the highest in the world allocated to a tourism promotion body. In real terms, in whatever way you want to measure it, even in the halcyon days that Labor remembers of John Brown they did not have figures of this order. Never did export promotions reach a figure of $85 million even if you take it in real terms back to comparative figures. And I am very pleased to see that our member who is based on the Gold Coast and who knows the benefits of tourism promotion across the board is in the chamber.</para><para>What has it resulted in? We might spend $85 million, but the benefits are there to be seen. We have some $16 billion in export earnings from the tourism industry alone—an incredible result. We had over four million international visitors last year—a very worthy figure. In 1975 we had only half a million visitors. That increased to one million by 1985 and now we have over four million international visitors. Compare that with some other countries like South Africa. They allocate one-quarter the amount of money to 
 their tourism promotion and they have one-quarter the amount of visitors—just over one million international visitors into South Africa. They reap what they sow. We have put in four times the amount and the tourists come to this country in that similar proportion. India, with all its exotic appeal, spends a lot and gets two million international visitors. These comparisons are very worth while to show what this government has achieved. We look forward to further initiatives by this minister.</para><para>There have been significant problems with some markets in South-East Asia. It is amazing that we finished up the year so well. It is because of the diversification in markets, particularly in the USA where there has been a significant increase the market share that we have there. There was a 13.3 per cent increase last year from the United States and a 13.2 per cent increase from the UK as the emphasis has shifted away from South-East Asia and into the UK, the European market and also the US market. That is a great achievement for the investment of funds into promotions. I know that as this government invests funds in tourism we will see a great unfolding. The opposition talks a lot about it, but the results are on this side in real terms and in real results.</para><para>Let us look at the funds that are put into education across Australia, for example. Over $5 billion is allocated to this area. But we also invite foreign international students—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">FITZGIBBON</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—Are you going to tax that, too?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>MP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Baird, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BAIRD</name></talker><para>—I know the member for Hunter fantasises about that great day when he may be the minister for tourism, but I can say that it is a long way off. With the reforms being carried out by this government and this minister, I do not think you will ever see that day. But dream on and think about it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In education, the actual earnings from international students coming into this country is $3.3 billion. As a result of the investment by this government in tertiary institutions, 147,130 enrolments have come through, which is extraordinary, as a result of this encouragement. These are the returns we are getting in foreign exchange earnings.</para><para>Look at primary industry: some $50.7 billion in exports—whether it be wheat, meat or right across the board in sorghum and barley. That is an amazing figure for a country of this size, a country of 18 million people, to be producing primary products that are exported right across the world.</para><para>In minerals, there is over $34 billion in iron ore, coal, alumina, bauxite and refined products. It is an amazing performance, and it is this government which is providing the incentives through the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, the framework for industry, the development and promotion activities, the network of Austrade offices and the whole promotion exercise right across the world.</para><para>There is no doubt that few countries have the promotional resources that we have in terms of Austrade and the Australian Tourist Commission. In fact, we are the envy of the world in many areas. Canada is the only other country that has a promotional resource that could be seen as competitive as Austrade. SATOUR, the South African Tourist Organisation, sent a mission across to Australia to find out about the Australian Tourist Commission and how we do it here. We are leading the world in a whole number of models.</para><para>It is not only those things which make us competitive. It is the economic environment. We have the fastest growing economy in South-East Asia—amongst the fastest growing in the world—with a five per cent growth rate. At the end of last year, as many of my fellow members heard tonight, <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> magazine called us the economic miracle of the world in the growth rates that are being achieved. These were not the words of the Treasurer but the words of <inline font-style="italic">Fortune</inline> magazine.</para><para>We have the lowest inflation rate that this country has seen for some 30 years. We have the lowest interest rates since Menzies was the Prime Minister. We have a growth rate which is so phenomenal it is like a freight train. The member for Hunter and the other members opposite may think and reminisce about what it was like during the Keating years when these growth rates were just a dim distant memory. When we had interest rates 
 of 18 per cent, the level of confidence was entirely different.</para><para>We have achieved our internationally competitive position with our economic growth rate and the economic environment. Importantly, as I said before, the GST is going to transform the economy and make us much more able to reduce tax levels for over 80 per cent of the Australian taxpayers. This is important for many reasons, not the least of which is being able to provide a $4.5 billion reduction for our exporters.</para><para>In creating a competitive environment, it is also important that we look at our industrial relations reforms and the reforms on our wharves so that we no longer compare very unfavourably with the rest of the world. No longer do people hold up to us the turnaround rate of ships in Singapore and Rotterdam. The reforms that this government has introduced—painful though they may be—have shown us what we can do. The opposition has objected all the way along the line to the changes and reforms that were necessary, but they have produced the results. If we are going to be internationally competitive, these are the hard measures that must be taken.</para><para>If you speak to anybody, they will say there are three key factors in a globally competitive economy. Firstly, to have a strong economy, you need reform of the taxation system. Secondly, you need industrial relations reform. We are certainly long overdue for that. Issues such as unfair dismissal have been raised in this House before. These are the types of things that need to be changed in our economic environment as well. The third aspect that is important is regulatory review—the types of regulations and red tape that hold back this economy. It is very pleasing to see that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has undertaken a major review of over 100 pieces of legislation. Funds have been allocated in the appropriation bill to look at areas of legislation which can improve the regulatory environment within this country.</para><para>I am very pleased to be part of a government that sees the need to be internationally competitive right across the board. The funds that have been allocated by this government are huge by international standards. If you go 
 to somewhere like the United States and you ask them how much they allocate to export promotion, it is almost zero. How much do they allocate to tourist promotion? Zero. Individual states do, but the federal government allocates nothing. How much do they provide for export incentives? Nothing.</para><para>We are providing that investment in the future. We are showing the results in a significant increase—8½ per cent—in our exports right across the board. Exports are worth $114 billion. Our minerals industry is going well. The primary industry sector and the tourism industry, despite the downturn in South-East Asia, produced results at the end of last year which were amazing. We are changing our environment in the areas of taxation, regulation and industrial relations. It is a situation that this government can be very proud of, and we look to a future where with the reforms that this government is making we become more internationally competitive. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2766</page.no><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name><name.id>8K6</name.id><electorate>Hunter</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is my pleasure also to have a brief opportunity to speak to these appropriation bills and to follow on from the member for Cook and pick up on some of the issues he raised. The whole focus of his address was the assistance that the government's tax reform is going to give to our export industries. He talked a lot about our agricultural industries and our mineral export industries, and there is a case to be put that his new tax system might make those export industries a little more competitive. I will accept that argument just for a moment.</para></talk.start><para>However, the main point is this: we all know that commodities over time give a declining return, and these mineral and agricultural exports—while we would always support them—will struggle over time. Our real growth exports in this country are tourism and education. These are two very important sectors which have been hitherto untaxed. The real opportunities for this nation lie in tourism and education, sectors hitherto untaxed. The government of the member for Cook suddenly wants to whack a massive, regressive GST on Australia's fastest growing export markets.</para><para>I would like to hear him get up on some other evening to explain the logic behind that. 
 He talked a lot about tax reform. He talked about additional funding for tourism, but the Labor Party—the former Hawke and Keating Labor governments—were the pathfinders in those areas. Tourism did not exist on the federal government's agenda until John Brown—I was pleased to hear him mentioned by the member for Cook—came along. We support the additional funding going to tourism.

The college was already involved in solar projects and had competed in events such as the Shell Mileage Marathon and the NRMA Energy Challenge, to name a couple, and these had led to a successful campaign in the 1996 World Solar Challenge, with a first place in the university/schools category and 16th place from a field of 47 entries.</para></talk.start><para>With this experience, the project members were keen to start from scratch and build a new vehicle that was completely home grown. With the corporate support of ACTEW and many minor but important sponsors, the team set to work. Seven days a week, and then seven nights a week as well—in essence, a three-year project done in one year, with all available time spent on the project.</para><para>The college believes that this is probably the largest technology project ever undertaken by an Australian secondary school. The team participated in the 1998 World Solar Car Rally in Japan; however, a lack of testing time and a few electronic gremlins meant below their potential performance. The vehicle received the excellence in technical design award, recognising it as the best built solar 
 car of the 91 entries, and finished seventh in its class of 24.</para><para>There has been almost continual disbelief that a secondary school could develop a project of this nature. The students were not mere spectators in this project; it was in fact their project. The vehicle was developed as a school project from within the curriculum of Lake Tuggeranong College. It was not built by engineers or university students studying engineering, nor did it have any major components of its structure produced by industry. Budget shortfall is compensated by endless hours of work. It represents in excess of 7,000 hours of students' time in design, construction and testing.</para><para>The design and construction from the ground up was undertaken by students on the campus of the college. Twenty students were recruited to the project. With nowhere to base the project, the students first had to build the workshop where they would build the car. With space at a premium, an area under Lake Tuggeranong College library was identified and work started in earnest on building the workshop and, four weeks later, the design of the car commenced. Construction on the car began about Easter of 1997.</para><para>The students involved came from across the curriculum. Many had no idea how to use a hammer or cordless screwdriver, how to drill holes or paint using a roller. The solar vehicle was built entirely within that college. Their work will be recognised on the graduating year 12 certificates. Every step of the design and construction involved the students. Apart from the vehicle, the students have also been responsible for developing the energy management software that is used to oversee the operation of the vehicle when it is on the highway.</para><para>The biggest test yet for the project was when the vehicle competed in the CitiPower Sunrace 99, from Sydney to Melbourne, via Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Hay, Mildura, Swan Hill and Bendigo. They enjoyed a convincing win, with six out of seven timed stages. Entries from the University of Queensland, the University of New South Wales and, I might add, the Ford engineers based team 
 were all outclassed by these high school students' efforts.</para><para>The college is looking forward to future competitions, such as the 1999 World Solar Challenge, from Darwin to Adelaide; the 2000 and 2001 CitiPower Sunraces, and so on—and maybe even a trip to Japan again. Corporate support, of course, will be their big question. By the way, they now have a solar boat, and will compete in the 1999 Advanced Technology and Solar Boat Race. I would like to quote:</para><para>What can be imagined, can be achieved,</para><para>You must dare to dream!</para><para>There is no substitute for perseverance,</para><para>Dedication, commitment and teamwork,</para><para>Because no-one gets there alone!</para><para>That is not a bad credo on which to found this project. In the words of Stuart Clode, one of the teachers involved very heavily in this project:</para><para>The performance of the team of Lake Tuggeranong College in the 1999 CitiPower Sunrace was literally a dream come true—but one based on an incredible amount of perseverance, dedication, commitment and teamwork.</para><para>I would like to take the opportunity to put on record on behalf of the Canberra community and, I am sure, everyone in this House the heartiest of congratulations to everyone involved at Lake Tuggeranong College—the students, the staff and the board all have very much of which to be proud. I am sure we will be hearing about this unbelievable project team at Lake Tuggeranong College again in the future.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Groups, Queensland: Government Grants</title><page.no>2768</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2768</page.no><name role="metadata">May, Margaret, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MAY</name><name.id>83B</name.id><electorate>McPherson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I want to acknowledge the direct benefits to several community groups in my electorate thanks to grants provided by the Howard federal government. The Burleigh Heads RSL sub-branch this year celebrates its 60th anniversary. The sub-branch was formed as Australia was on the brink of World War II and, with the foresight of several founding members, it has a proud history. It provided a venue for social activities when Burleigh was just a village, has hosted numerous 
 community events and in recent years has retained its character as other RSL clubs have undergone huge changes and become venues for food, entertainment and pokies.</para></talk.start><para>In this 60th anniversary year, the granting of $3,555 from the Department of Veterans' Affairs Joint Venture Scheme has special significance for the sub-branch's members. As Chris Keating, the Secretary/Treasurer of the sub-branch, recently told me during the cheque presentation for the grant, the group is grateful for the support in this celebratory year. Funding will be used to install a public address system for use at the sub-branch's monthly meetings, commemorative activities and on social occasions. Mr Keating last week told me that the group has road-tested the PA system with the attendance of several hearing-impaired diggers, who are grateful they can now pick up more of what is said at meetings.</para><para>I would also like to draw attention to some comments made by Mr Keating about the impact of the Australia Remembers Program on the Burleigh Heads sub-branch. He was thrilled to tell me that, as a direct result of the national and local exposure and the recognition of those who had fought for their country, the club had doubled its membership. Today the club has 66 members—the highest number in its history. This is a tremendous result and a positive outcome from the Australia Remembers Program. In Mr Keating's words:</para><para>Some of the old diggers came out of hiding after decades so that they could rekindle that mateship, that camaraderie, that fellowship: all because of the Australia Remembers Program.</para><para>Also in my electorate, the Gold Coast sub-branch of the War Widows Guild of Australia has benefited from a $1,875 grant to provide funding for five bus excursions aimed at overcoming social isolation. I was delighted to see first-hand—when I presented the cheque recently—the excitement in members' faces. As I shook hands with these ladies, the comments made were of gratitude to the government for providing funds under the Department of Veterans' Affairs joint venture scheme. The scheme assists in the maintenance and development of social networks 
 and companionship for many who are often socially isolated.</para><para>To Jill Beauchamp, the President of the War Widows Guild, to Phil Bentley, the treasurer, and to Joan Byrne, the secretary, I would like to extend my sincere thanks for an enjoyable morning. I know the members of the guild will benefit and enjoy the opportunity for the social interaction from the forthcoming bus trips.</para><para>On 22 February, I will be presenting a $1,800 cheque to the Burleigh Heads Legacy Laurel Club. Shirley David, the president of the club, secretary Mary Pugsley, and treasurer Joan Atkinson, have extended an invitation to me to attend their monthly meeting to present the cheque, which is also a grant provided under the joint venture scheme. The grant will also provide for a series of bus excursions for Legacy widows. Legacy, of course, is well known for its support services to the widows and families of our ex-servicemen. It has always had a strong interest in their welfare, actively seeking opportunities to improve their quality of life through social activities, outings and information sessions. This project will allow the Burleigh Heads Legacy Laurel Club the opportunity to provide assistance and encouragement to the veteran community in order to maintain their health, independence and quality of life.</para><para>On behalf of the recipients of the grants extended to my electorate, I thank the Howard government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs for providing the opportunities for such groups to benefit in practical and meaningful ways.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Sydney Orbital Road System</title><page.no>2769</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>2769</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My adjournment speech relates to funding for the Western Sydney orbital road system. The people of Western Sydney are being severely penalised by this uncaring government, which refuses to provide much needed funding for the Western Sydney orbital road program and hides behind the so-called need to wait for a decision on Badgerys Creek.</para></talk.start><para>The problems relating to the orbital road system are immediate, while the issues relat 
 ing to the construction and operation of an airport at Badgerys Creek are more long term. But the effect on the environment of heavy vehicles driving through suburban streets is identical to that of large passenger aircraft flying overhead, with increased noise and pollution flowing from both of these.</para><para>There was strong pre-election opposition to Badgerys Creek from the Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly, and the member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, on the government side, and from the members for Prospect, Chifley, Fowler, Reid and Greenway on my side of the House. We have all been re-elected on an anti-airport platform, and the prospect of this project going ahead is now, in my view, very unlikely. I am sure we are not going to let the residents of Western Sydney down on this issue and allow the public to once again say, `You can't trust politicians. They have broken another promise.' I do not think that will be the case with any of us.</para><para>But the immediate problem that I am speaking about tonight is the orbital road system. There are thousands of huge trucks, transporting millions of dollars worth of products, rumbling through the suburban streets every day and night. They are causing the long-suffering residents huge noise and fume problems from their smoky exhausts. In my electorate of Greenway, we are desperately in need of the completion of this project. The people of Blacktown, Prospect, Seven Hills, Lalor Park and parts of Kings Langley are bearing an enormous burden while the minister fiddles about. Whether Badgerys Creek is built or not, these huge transports will continue to crisscross Sydney, using the outer Western Sydney streets as their corridors.</para><para>The Chairman of the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board, Mr Jim Bosnjak, who is also well known in transport circles, has recently again called on the minister to release money to allow the orbital to be progressed. Jim Bosnjak has regularly commented on the need for the orbital in the interests of business development in Western Sydney.</para><para>Prospective business commencement is being held up because investors know of the traffic snarls and delays that are occurring daily because the road system is totally unsuited to the present heavy traffic, let alone increases because of business development. If we can get increased business development in Western Sydney, we can create extra jobs. This is an urgent problem and it needs urgent action.</para><para>The minister says he needs to wait to see what is happening with Badgerys Creek. This is a fallacious argument. The government simply can no longer hide behind the airport issue—particularly when they themselves are delaying announcement of the EIS—and dodge the need for the Western Sydney orbital road system to be completed as a matter of urgency. The need is clearly economic, as the road system will ease the burdens of existing companies whose costs are quite enormous because of the traffic delays and the volume of traffic.</para><para>There are also the social needs of the residents, who at present are subjected to almost 24-hour-a-day noise and fume abuse by these huge trucks, which of course add to the dangers faced by drivers—often mothers with their children—and by schoolchildren whose schools are scattered along the present traffic corridors.</para><para>The roads being used out of necessity are simply not appropriate for the type of increased commercial activity that is occurring in Western Sydney. They were not meant to be used for heavy transport vehicles. They are suburban roads which are used by small business and ordinary mums and dads and their children. These people are being subjected to the unfortunate—but I am sure not deliberate—tyranny of huge trucks travelling behind them or alongside them, and they are indeed intimidating. Anyone who travels to this parliament regularly from Sydney will know what I mean by the tyranny and intimidation that one feels from these huge transports as they hurl up the highway. Translate that onto a Western Sydney road and you will begin to see why the local councils, the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board and the local MPs are all urging 
 the federal government to urgently take this issue on board and release funds for this much needed Western Sydney orbital road system. This is an issue that affects everybody in Western Sydney. It affects the residents of Chifley as much as it does the residents of Mitchell.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Attention Deficit Disorder</title><page.no>2770</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2770</page.no><name role="metadata">Secker, Patrick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SECKER</name><name.id>848</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak about the difficulties that people who suffer from attention deficit disorder—and their families—face on a daily basis. Attention deficit disorder, or ADD as it is more commonly called, is believed to be a development failure in the brain circuitry that underlies inhibition and self-control. This loss of self-control in turn impairs other important brain functions crucial for maintaining attention, including the ability to defer immediate rewards for later greater gain.</para></talk.start><para>Children with ADD cannot control their responses to their environment and this lack of control makes them hyperactive, inattentive and impulsive. Many studies have been done on ADD but none have conclusively proved the cause of ADD, although it is believed to be genetic. Boys are three times as likely to develop this disorder and most of the children show signs of having ADD by the time they are seven years of age. It is estimated that up to three per cent of school-age children suffer from severe ADD, and between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of these children still have symptoms as an adult.</para><para>For the parents of children with ADD there are many challenges. Ensuring that the child keeps up with school work, despite their extremely short attention spans, is hard and many adults are intolerant of an ADD child's behaviour, despite there being a medical reason for their hyperactivity or apparent uninterest in learning or communicating with other people.</para><para>Despite ADD being classified as a learning disability, there is little assistance for the parents or care givers because ADD is not classified as a disability under the federal government's Disability Services Act or, indeed, in that of my own state, the South Australian Disability Act. To be eligible for 
 disabled services under these acts the disability must be classified as `is or likely to be permanent'. Because there are conflicting medical opinions as to whether this disorder actually affects adults, ADD is not considered permanent and so ADD sufferers and their families are denied access to disability services, including home care and family support services, respite care, therapy services and counselling and support services.</para><para>Parents of children with ADD are particularly keen to gain access to support services and respite services because of how demanding ADD children are, but none are available. Only support groups that are set up by parents experiencing the same sorts of difficulties offer the moral support that is needed. However, the federal Disability Discrimination Act, as distinct from the Disability Services Act, states that it aims to eliminate, as far as possible, discrimination against persons on the grounds of disability in the area of administration of Commonwealth laws. In this act, the definition of disability includes a disorder that results in the person learning differently from a person without the disorder, or a disorder that affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment that results in disturbed behaviour and the condition can either presently exist, previously exist or may exist in the future. This definition is clearly different from those in the other two acts and, under this act, ADD would be classified as a disability but, unfortunately, this act does not administer disability services.</para><para>The current way of handling behavioural problems of ADD sufferers at school is to take action after the incident. By this time the child may have already fallen considerably behind in their school work and may have interrupted other students learning. If the child is removed from the school the parent is often forced to care for the child at home, which may cost them financially if they have to leave the work force to do this.</para><para>I would encourage this parliament and all of the state and territory governments to review their treatments of ADD sufferers. At the moment the families of children who have ADD are under greater amounts of stress and are not given the support they desperately 
 need. ADD is no longer an unknown disease; it is a learning disorder and we should recognise it as a disability so sufferers and their families can experience a greater quality of life.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Division of Shortland</title><page.no>2771</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2771</page.no><name role="metadata">Hall, Jill, MP</name><name role="display">Ms HALL</name><name.id>83N</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am most disturbed by the increase in the numbers of constituents that have been contacting my office about the problems they are having with Centrelink. The reason for this is quite obvious to my constituents, my office and the staff delivering the services. There is one thing that is common to all these complaints and that is that Centrelink is not able to deliver the services to the constituents because they do not have the staff. This government has systematically chopped, hacked and slashed Centrelink staff levels.</para></talk.start><para>I find it laughable that the minister can stand up in this House and talk about how this government has improved and expanded Centrelink services.	The truth is that it has, in fact, cut resources and staff to such a level it is nearly impossible to deliver any service whatsoever. This cut in staff is also costing the government money because Centrelink does not have the staff to resource or to investigate allegations of fraud. Recently, a constituent reported a case to me where people living in a relocatable home village on the central coast were being paid cash in hand and given a rent-free site to undertake work for the park owner. This is costing the government money. It is paying benefits to people who are not entitled to receive the benefit and it is depriving the government of taxation revenue.</para><para>Centrelink at Wyong has difficulty coping with the day-to-day delivery of financial assistance to its clients. Since this government's decision to abolish the review teams it has made it impossible to carry out investigations of Centrelink fraud. It seems that the government has made a conscious decision to slash the services and benefits available to pensioners, the disabled, the unemployed and young Australians. It has decided that, rather than ensuring that all Australians have adequate financial support, it will attack them and let the cheats and 
 frauds go unpunished. Now it is set to punish ordinary Australians even more when it introduces the GST.</para><para>I thought it would be appropriate for me to detail the concerns that constituents have brought to my office. The office telephones have run hot with people complaining that they cannot get through to Centrelink—something the minister assured us was not happening. Unfortunately, its clients have not experienced the efficiency that the minister was assuring us had taken place within Centrelink. They have only experienced lengthy delays and disconnections after waiting for long periods of time to speak to Centrelink staff.</para><para>One young man rang Centrelink to check when he would receive his Newstart. He finally managed to get through after numerous attempts and waited for nine minutes, after which time Centrelink accidentally disconnected him. This same person had waited three hours for an interview on the previous day. This is supposed to be a good service. This is supposed to be an improved service. I know this was not happening before when there was adequate staff. If this had been a one-off incident you would ignore it and assume that the young man had just been unlucky. But this is happening on a regular basis. His story is repeated many times a day.</para><para>It is not the fault of Centrelink staff. They are aware of the problems their clients are experiencing and find it extremely stressful that they are providing a second-rate service. But what can you do when you do not have enough staff? What can you do when you do not have the resources? What can you do when you do not have the programs in place that will help those people in need?</para><para>The Centrelink office in Shortland is in Charlestown. It has lost what equates to seven full-time staff. Most of those staff were part-time employees—staff who worked when there was a high workload. This equates to a 10 per cent reduction in staff and a corresponding reduction in service. The staff at Charlestown are aware that they are struggling to deliver the services, as are the people who rely on those Centrelink services: people who need the money they receive to eat, pay their 
 electricity bills and clothe their children. These people do not eat if they do not get their money. I know it is difficult for members on the other side to understand that Australians rely on these services that the government is downgrading. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Citizenship: 50th Anniversary</title><page.no>2772</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2772</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Julie, MP</name><name role="display">Ms JULIE BISHOP</name><name.id>83P</name.id><electorate>Curtin</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before more time passes in this session I wish to refer back to 26 January 1999. There was a special significance attaching to Australia Day this year for it marked the 50th year since the notion of citizenship was first articulated in the laws of this country. On Australia Day in 1949, for the first time since European settlement, people born or naturalised in Australia were deemed to be Australian citizens. Prior to that date we were all deemed to be British subjects. However, well before the tumultuous years of World War II the Australian identity had come into its own and we recognised that we all shared membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia. This need to highlight our common membership by the concept of Australian citizenship was enhanced by the first wave of postwar immigration.</para></talk.start><para>Our development as a multicultural nation over the past 50 years can be judged in one sense by a comparison of new citizens in 1949 and then in 1998. In 1949, fewer than 3,000 migrants and their families from 37 countries in Europe and the Middle East became citizens. Last year, more than 112,300 people from 140 countries around the world became Australian citizens.</para><para>I was honoured to represent the federal government as the local member at a number of citizenship ceremonies throughout the electorate of Curtin—in particular, the town of Cottesloe, the town of Mosman Park, the Shire of Peppermint Grove, the City of Stirling and the town of Vincent. Each held moving citizenship ceremonies, together with Citizen of the Year awards. Each local authority is to be congratulated on the effort and, I suggest, the cost that went towards ensuring the various ceremonies were not only memorable occasions for all present but also festive celebrations. The City of Perth, for example— 
 the boundaries of which also fall partly within the electorate of Curtin—held a citizenship ceremony in the morning and then capped it off in a spectacular fashion with the annual Skyworks display held over the Swan River. The natural amphitheatre of the river and the wider surrounds attracted an estimated 400,000 people to this Australia Day celebration.</para><para>Due recognition was paid at each ceremony to the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had made available lapel pins commemorating the occasion which were given to those taking the pledge of loyalty. The minister spoke last week during question time of the wide range of activities planned for the 50th celebrations.</para><para>As I listened to our new citizens take the pledge—loyalty to Australia and its people by sharing our democratic beliefs, by respecting our rights and liberties and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia—I was struck by the emotion displayed by a number of the new citizens, including those who had lived in Australia for many years. Each person taking the pledge had their own reasons for seeking citizenship of this country. It was clearly more than just a matter of living here. I would like to think that among their reasons was a recognition that this country aspires to the ideals to which they aspire, that it holds dear the values that they hold dear and that it cherishes the beliefs that they cherish.</para><para>There was another significance attaching to this Australia Day: it was the last Australia Day of the 1900s. So it is timely that this year we all reconfirm what it is that we want for the Australia of the future—perhaps to locate our reference points in understanding what makes up the unique Australian identity. I hope that we all take the time to remind ourselves what it is we cherish about this country and that we continually renew our celebration and appreciation of Australian citizenship with the freedoms it offers in exchange for its obligations. Whether it be the Australian sense of fair play and a fair go for all, the ethnic and cultural diversity of our people, our sense of community and neighbourhood, our egalitarian ideals, our pride in 
 our achievers, our love of sport, our concern for our environment, or whether it be our freedom and democracy—whatever it is that we cherish about this country—we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure that future Australians share in it as well.</para><para>So, during this 50th year of celebrating Australian citizenship, may we each value our citizenship, may we each contribute actively and energetically to our community, may we each be proud of our Australian values and ideals and may we each be determined actively to proclaim them.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2773</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 11.00 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>2773</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Hull</inline> to move:</para><para>That this House calls on the Government to make provision for recurrent funding for student hostels servicing the school access needs of students in remote areas of Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cadman</inline> to move:</para><para>That the House:</para><para>(1)	 notes with deep concern the high level of suicide in Australia;</para><para>(2)	 expresses its dismay that young males, drug takers and residents of rural areas are particularly prone to take their lives;</para><para>(3)	 conveys its sympathy to the families and friends who have been touched by the tragedy of suicide; and</para><para>(4)	 commits itself as individuals and as a representative group of Australians to do everything possible to reduce the high level of suicide.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Theophanous</inline> to move:</para><para>That the House:</para><para>(1)	 views with concern the continuing reductions in net immigration to Australia over the last few years, in particular the impact of these cuts on economic development, family reunion and humanitarian programs;</para><para>(2)	 notes that there are now calls for an increase in immigration from a diversity of sectors in the Australian community, such as industry, ethnic community organisations and political leaders;</para><para>(3)	 recognises the enduring importance of immigration to the development of Australia and to the maintenance of Australia's multicultural identity; and
