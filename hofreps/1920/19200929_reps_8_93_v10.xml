                            <para>- Then I shall say that the Minister considered the representations made to him by various honorable' members, who pointed out that the South Australian Government had been doing effective work under its local housing scheme. As the result of these representations, he practically withdrew the operations of the 'Commonwealth Bank in that State, so far as the building of War Service Homes was concerned, and permitted the State Government to continue its own housing scheme on behalf of the -Commonwealth. At the recent Conference, however, it was suggested by the South Australian Minister for Repatriation that the time had arrived when a new financial basis should be arranged as between the respective Governments. In consequence of what 1 might describe as t^ie indefinite understanding existing between the two Ministers, the Commonwealth Minister for Repatriation was awaiting concrete proposals from the South Australian Minister. These have not yet come to hand, and in the interval the South Australian Minister has announced that he does not propose to proceed further with the building of soldiers' homes. The entire responsibility, therefore, now rests with the Commonwealth Minister for Repatriation. This he, and the Government as a whole, accepts. We shall proceed at once to - build soldiers' homos in South Australia on the basis adopted in all the other States. </para>

                            <para>- No definite arrangement has yet been made. Originally the New South Wales Government made an offer to build what arc known as our 12,800-ton ships at something like £34 per ton. I accepted that offer, and subsequently notified the House of that decision. The New South Wales Government, however, failed to sign the necessary papers and specifications. At a considerably later date, they submitted a fresh offer to- build these vessels at a cost of £51 2s. 6d. per ton. At that time we were negotiating with the different trade organizations carrying on operations in connexion with shipbuilding, and it was _ decided by the Commonwealth Government that nothing further should be done until an agreement had been arrived at with those organizations as to the new terms stipulated by us in regard to continuity of work, piece-work, and dilution. Until that agreement has been arrived at, the negotiations with the New South Wales Government will remain in abeyance. I have made it very clear, however, to the representatives of New South Wales that before I shall be prepared to accept an offer from the State Government to build these vessels for us at anything like the price quoted by them, the whole matter must be submitted to the House for approval. </para>

                    <para>I explained on Thursday last that, to a very large extent, the amount that would be paid depended upon the financial position in which the Commonwealth found itself, and that that in turn do pended upon forward sales, one of which we hoped would shortly be made. That one of itself was of such importance, I said, that it would materially affect the situation. I hope to be able, quite shortly, to make a statement which will fix the date and the amount of the payment to be made. I shall fix the minimum amount, and the question as to how much more shall be paid will depend entirely upon what progress we make with the forward sales, and also upon what arrangements of a financial character wo can make to enable us to do what the farmers desire. The honorable member may assure his constituents, and the farmers of New South Wales generally, who have suffered very much through the drought, that we appreciate to the fullest their circumstances, and are not less anxious than they are that everything it is in our power to do should be done to help them. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member gives me a very large order in his question. However, I would like to say that, so far, I have been able to cancel £3,500,000 worth of notes within the last five or six weeks. To what extent we are able to continue that' cancellation, of course, will depend on the extent to which the money of the Commonwealth is available for the purpose. </para>

                            <para>- No. The other day I purchased £1,500,000 worth of these notes with accumulated funds from.' the Australian Notes Fund, which, after all, is the sensible way of proceeding about this business. It is all very well for people with nothing to do but to propound theories to make this or that proposal, but I am surrounded with practical difficulties, through which I am endeavouring to thread my way as best I can. While other people talk I am trying to do things. I am afraid the people of Australia, and particularly the workers, to whom the cost of living is a prime consideration, have some notion in their heads, due to the incessant dinning that has taken place, that a reduction in the cost of living will immediately follow the cancellation of our currency. Nothing can be further from the fact in my judgment, and it is mischievous propaganda to lead the people of this country to imagine so. In this regard prices are governed, not by the currency, but by the conditions prevailing throughout the world. It is the world-wide inflation that sensibly affects prices, not only here, but all over the world. </para>

                            <para>- I take this opportunity of reminding the House that questions without notice should be asked only on matters of an urgent nature, and that questions which may not be classed as urgent must not be asked without notice, but should be placed on the business-paper, particularly when they involve long and complicated answers. I remind honorable members also that interject'ons must not be made while questions are being answered; such a practice, if permitted, must inevitably involve the House in an irregular debate. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs a question based on the following newspaper report of remarks by the manager of the Fruit-growers' Co-operative Jam Factory, South Australia: - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The manager mentioned that there were certain firms in Victoria and Tasmania who had had Avar contracts and who were still receiving their war rations of sugar. This meant they were getting more sugar than they needed for home requirements, with the result that to-day they were exporting jams. He was not complaining about the exportation of jams that was necessary, but he did object to such a state of affairs, seeing that his factory could not obtain sufficient sugar to meet the demands of the home trade, and had been warned that if they used any sugar for export jams its supplies of the commodity would be stopped. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I know the position is not as stated in the newspaper extract read by the honorable member. Our object is, as far as possible, to meet the requirements of the various traders who deal in sugar, and give to each his fair quota. As I have explained to the House over and over again, owing to industrial troubles that have cropped up, and the difficulty that has been experienced in refining sugar, we are not in a position to give to everybody the full amount required. </para>

All arrangements are made for a thoroughly systematic search, including the coast of Tasmania, by means of a motor boat.

It is possible they have had to descend in forest country on the coast of Tasmania away from any means of communication. </para>

                        <para>- It will be remembered that Parliament decided that returned soldiers might start co-operative enterprises, the Government giving assistance at the rate of £1 for £1 contributed by the men, and undertaking to accept either cash or gratuity bonds in payment. Can the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation say how soldiers who desire to undertake these cooperative enterprises may obtain this assistance from the Government? </para>

                        <para>- In May last, when the question of repatriation was being revised, the Government set aside a sum of £500,000 for approved co-operative businesses. It was decided that the Government might assist approved enterprises to the extent of £150 for each soldier, and accept war bonds as contributions by the men. All proposals for such enterprises must be submitted in the ordinary way, with a full outline of the business to be undertaken, and each enterprise is subject to the approval of the Commissioner and the Minister. All proposals of the kind, if submitted, will be fully investigated. </para>

                            <para>The right referred to is apparently that arising out of an agreement, made in October, 1919, by which certain native owners agreed to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> F. D. Morgan to cut sago on their land at Lakekamu, the consideration being £37. The local Resident Magistrate approved of the agreement ( 1 ) as not giving exclusive right, and (2) as not giving any right except to sago growing on land at the date of agreement. This was the Resident Magistrate's view in approving the agreement. It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan</inline> or his successors in title are now floating this agreement into a company. They seem to re gard the agreement as giving them exclusive rights and in perpetuity. The attention of the directors and solicitors of the company is being invited to the fact that the Government of Papua are desirous that it should be clearly understood the . agreement does not give any exclusive right, and does not operate in perpetuity, but that it only refers to sago growing on the land at the date of the agreement. The directors and solicitors have been asked by the Department to see that the necessary steps are taken to see that this information is made known to applicants for shares in the company. </para>

                        - Yes, as far as the Battery was concerned, but it cannot be ascertained whether Gunner Yates 'formed one of a gun-crew in the engagements at Villers-Bretonneux, Morlancourt, or the taking of Hamel. Before commencing the big offensive, on 8th August, 1918, the 13th Field Artillery Brigade formed a dump of surplus stores and baggage at BlangyTronville, near Amiens, and it is understood Gunner Yates was one of a small guard which remained there until 25th October, 1918, or later, and, therefore, did not participate in the big offensive.

                            your inquiry of the 10th instant, No.- 38614, Gunner Yates was taken on the strength of the 13th Brigade, A.F.A., A.I.F., and posted to the 50th Battery on 23rd May, 1918, and was evacuated sick on 15th October, 1918.

                        <para>That Battery fired portion of the barrage which was required in support of a raid near Villers-Bretonneux on the 15th June, 1918. and was in action near Fouilly at the time. Similarly the battery participated in a minor operation near Morlancourt on the 29th July, 1918, and also in the Hamel operation of 4th July, 1918. I cannot say whether Gunner Yates formed part of one of the 50th Battery gun detachments or not. I have no records showing that. Possibly his B.C. may remember. </para>

                            <para>- I know he did. I intend to place the whole of the evidence on the table, so that honorable members may look into the details for themselves. While not wishing to qualify my expression of regret at having done an. injustice to a returned soldier, I contend that my executive officers in the Department were not to blame. They did all they could to obtain the information, and were justified in giving me the replies in the terms in which I received them for presentation to this House. They were justified, I say, in view of the fact that they had obtained the information from the man's commanding officer. I repeat that  Colonel Caddy  is a civilian officer. I will give consideration regarding what steps can be taken in the direction of bringing him to book. We shall want an explanation concerning why he gave information of which he was not sure. Honorable members will see from a perusal of the evidence that he furnished the particulars from memory. He expresses his regret, and says that he had not his records at hand, and that he gave the information from his recollection. The whole file is before me, and also a report of the evidence taken by the Commission. I lay the papers on the table. </para>

I interjected, and was promptly called to order by yourself, sir; but I was able to get in one name, at any rate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yates</inline> -learned of the incident, and considered it a reflection upon himself* personally, taking the view that he was one of those to whom the Prime Minister had alluded. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and some of them deserved. It is quite possible, seeing that  Colonel Caddy  said he knew Gunner Yates was stationed at the dump, that he himself was there also. I say it is quite possible. But he wanted to damn a man's military reputation. There are plenty of officers who reply to questions put to them officially in the way in which they think their " heads " want to have those questions answered. </para>

I draw the attention of honorable members to the irregular manner in which the business of the House is likely to be conducted through a practice which is growing up of statements and counter statements being made involving controversial matters. Leave was granted for the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> to make a statement, and the Minister's remarks contained matter which seemed to the Leader of the Opposition to demand a reply. A request was then made that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> be similarly given leave to make a statement, and leave was granted. The nature of the statement was such as to cause further interjections, and thus initiate an irregular debate. I ask honorable members to permit the statement to be concluded without further interjections. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, they gave him sixty days, but we are not dealing with that now. Of course, Yates got those sixty days when he was innocent. And I believe he could have got out of that term of detention if he had cared to ask to be let off; but he did not. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> to move, " That the papers be printed." Many papers have been printed, at the desire of Ministers, which are of considerably less importance than these- If the Minister were to submit that motion, as I hold he should do, honorable members who wished to say something upon the matter would have a fair and open opportunity. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yates</inline> upon the outcome of the inquiry, but it does not reflect credit on the man who gave the information contained in the answers supplied to the Minister.' Seeing that he had trusted to his memory,  Colonel Caddy  should have let the Minister know, instead of trying to damn a man's military and political reputation. Will the Minister move, " That the papers be printed " <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                                <para>- The Minister could not do so in the course of a second speech at this stage. I pointed out that the Minister had obtained leave to make a statement, and that he then announced  that he would lay the papers on the table. The Minister did not move that they be printed, nor was leave asked or given to move a motion. And be cannot now move in that direction, seeing that another honorable member has meanwhile asked for and secured leave to make a statement, and that the business of the day has been called on.  </para>

                    <para>.- This amendment, providing as it does that the Commissioner shall have power subject to the approval of Parliament, to acquire or establish brickworks, saw-mills, and cement works is a very important one. In connexion with the construction of War Service Homes an exceedingly large sum will be expended. We have been told that up to the present something like 4,000 homes have been completed, and that 27,000 applications for the construction of these homes are under consideration. The Committee must not lose sight of the fact that the whole of the money so expended will have to be repaid by the returned soldiers for whom  the homes are erected. It is, therefore, most essential that we should keep down the cost to the lowest possible extent. Every one realizes what it means to a working man to be called upon to pay 20s. or 25s. per week over an extended period. The greater the cost of these homes the more the men will have to pay "by way of monthly instalments. It should be our endeavour so' to keep down the cost that the men will have a reasonable chance to fulfil their contracts. I am afraid that many of them will" be unable to do&gt; so. As time goes on, they will probably be burdened with families in many cases, and. the maintenance of these, together with the regular payment of instalments in respect of' their homes, will put a very heavy strain upon their financial resources. It is thus quite possible that many of these homes will fall back into the hands of the Department. Although something like 4,000 homes have been erected, we are now asked to agree that the maximum amount that.- may be advanced shall be increased from £700 to £800. The Minister has told us that this increase is necessary, not because it is proposed to build larger homes, but owing to the greatly increased cost of labour and material. The cost of material, more particularly, has. enormously increased. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> when moving the second reading of the Bill, told us that during the last twelve months the prices of building material had increased to the extent of 25 per cent., and that owing to the competition between the Department and private contractors prices'  were likely to go much higher. There is a great scarcity of building material, and it is essential that we should devise some means of keeping down costs to a minimum. That is necessary in the interests of the men themselves. Obviously, we cannot hope to secure any reduction in cost if we allow the present competition between the Department and outside contractors to continue. We have been told that the Commissioner has purchased saw-mills, not only in Queensland, but in Victoria. My amendment would enable the Commissioner, subject to the approval of Parliament, to extend his operations in that direction. It is unlikely that any attempt would be made to purchase saw-mills, brickworks, or cement works unless the Government could show Parliament that the deal contemplated was a good one. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I have not a word to say. against the recent purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland. I know nothing about them. It may be that the Department has made an excellent bargain, but it is absolutely necessary that further purchases should be made. It is hardly likely that the Department will be able to supply timber from Queensland for the building of homes in New South Wales, Victoria, and some of the other States at rates that will result in any material reduction in the cost of these homes. It will be necessary, in the interest of economy to establish Government mills in suitable areas in each State. In that way we ought to be able to reduce our costs. In to-day's newspapers it is reported that, as a result of the purchase of saw-mills in Victoria, the Commissioner claims to have made a saving of 50 per cent, in the cost of timber for War Service Homes in this State. If that can be done in Victoria, it should be possible also in other States. There are splendid hardwood forests along the north coast of New South Wales, where saw-mills could be established at comparatively small cost. </para>

                        <para>- No. It may be of interest to the honorable member to learn that every day in the week vessels are carrying timber along the north coast to Sydney and other places. The timber can be brought down either by rail or water carriage. Excellent facilities exist. </para>

                <para>A railway runs within easy distance of the coast-line, and there are navigable rivers running into these hardwood forests. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline> Taylor has mills on the north coast and vessels regularly engaged in carrying timber from them to the port of Sydney. If the Government acquired or established mills there it would' be possible to obtain at reduced cost the timber necessary for building War Service Homes in New South Wales. Similar arrangements could be made in Victoria and the other States, with the result that we might be able once more to build these homes for £700, instead of £800 as now proposed. Having regard to the number of homes to be erected, it should be good business for the Department to go into the whole question with a view to reducing costs. Unless that action is taken we shall probably be asked twelve months hence to agree to the minimum being raised from £800 to £900. The repayment of such a sum by monthly instalments is more than the average young fellow can undertake. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The Minister for Repatriations <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> and his representative in this House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> have stated that, owing to the keen demand for timber and the competition between the Department and outside contractors for supplies, prices are soaring higher and higher week after week. In the interests of our returned men, we should not allow that state of affairs to continue. Our boys did their best for their country, and should receive the utmost consideration. Should we allow the present see-saw game of competition to continue between the Department and private contractors? I do not know what objection the Minister can have to my amendment, in view of the fact that the Department, without consulting Parliament, has already struck out in the direction for which it provides. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Repatriation is doubtful on that . point. He has stated that his interpretation of the Act is that he has the power, but he is not going to say that that is the correct interpretation. Assuming, however, that he has the power, was it not argued in this House last week that the Parliament never intended that the Minister or the Commissioner should expend more than' £5,000 on any enterprise without obtaining its consent? I think it would be better for the Minister himself if the amendment in the form submitted by me were agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very pertinent interjection. Whilst there might be some objection, on the score of delay, to my proposal that Parliament should first be consulted, I think that, in the interests of the country and the Government itself, it would be well to observe the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, and to refer to the Public Works Committee all departmental undertakings involving an expenditure exceeding £20,000. </para>

The price of bricks is increasing year after year. An honorable member informs me that contractors in New South Wales are now paying £4 per 1,000 for them delivered on the job, as against 30s. per 1,000, which was the price prior to the war. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that we can, but I believe that by the establishment of brick-works in suitable centres, particularly in the big metropolitan areas, we may be able to obtain them very much cheaper than we buy them today. There are acres of good brickmaking land available in the Newcastle district, where a large number of soldiers' homes is being erected, and I would take it upon myself to see that it could be acquired at a reasonable price. The clay is very suitable for brick-making. It has been tested more than once. A brickworks which would not cost more than £20,000 or £30,000 would probably supply all the demands for the erection of houses in its vicinity. Should the demand increase, it would be quite an easy matter to increase the output of the kilns. But the great advantage is that if we can, by the establishment of brick-works, cheapen the price of bricks, it will not only decrease the present cost of building homes, but also possibly prevent a future rise in the cost of building them. As honorable members know very well, it is almost impossible to purchase cement. Works everywhere have been hung up for the last couple of years because of the impossibility of securing supplies of this material. For over twelve months the streets of Newcastle have been torn up for the purpose of laying the rails for the hew electric tram system, but this work cannot be completed because of the impossibility of securing supplies of cement. It has been found necessary to suspend all operations until a sufficient number of barrels accumulate, and then the men are put on to work, but very speedily they are obliged to cease operations until fresh supplies can be accumulated. The same remarks apply to buildings all over Australia. Sufficient supplies of cement cannot be obtained to guarantee continuous or expeditious work. I have with me the minutes of th? findings of the Public Works Committee in regard to the establishment of cement works for Federal Capital and  other  Commonwealth purposes. The conclusion arrived at by the Committee was as follows : - </para>

                    <para>The Committee learned that about two-thirds of the cement used in Australia is at present imported, and in view of the enormous demand anticipated in Europe after the war, is of opinion that it is improbable that the establishment of private cement factories in Australia would cheapen the price to the Commonwealth until the total Australian production was sufficient to fully supply Australian needs. It is considered, therefore, that from the point of view of economy, as well as convenience, it is a sound proposition for the Commonwealth to proceed with the establishment of cement works to supply its needs for Federal Capital and other Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Then there is no justification for our refusing to set about manufacturing our own requirements for the purpose of expediting the work of building soldiers' homes, to say nothing of reducing the price of the article to the community generally. We . cannot proceed with this huge scheme of building homes, which will run into an expenditure of millions of pounds, while prices are continually soaring through the scarcity of material, and because of our competition with outsiders, and consequent inability to secure what little material is available. I understand there are over 20,000 applications for the building of War Service Homes, and in all probability three-fourths of these applications will be granted. It means a very big business to be undertaken within the next few years, for which we ought to make every preparation. Scarcity creates increased prices, and if we do not increase the supply of materials we shall find that in twelve months' time the prices we are called upon to pay will be very much higher than they are at present. Already they are 25 per cent, higher than they were this time twelve months ago, and possibly they will be another 25 per cent, higher in twelve months' time. These  rises in costs have a serious effect upon the soldiers themselves, because later on it may be found necessary to still further  increase the advance from £800 to £900. This is a possibility we ought to try to avoid. It should be our endeavour to get the homes built at the lowest possible cost, always keeping in view the fact that this money must eventually be repaid to the Commonwealth. A man may struggle on for twenty-five years only to find in the end that he is not able to maintain his payments.  His  wife and his children may have to deprive themselves of many comforts in order to put by money to meet the regular instalments due on the purchase of the home, but in spite of all this, they may not be able to redeem their promise to repay the money advanced by the Commonwealth Government, owing to the fact that the cost of material has been so high at the time of the building of the house that its price has been increased by £100 or £200. Of course, the question arises as to what must be done to meet such cases, but that is a matter for the future. All we should have in view now is the possibility of preventing men from being placed in such a position by endeavouring to keep down the cost of buildings. We are acquiring sawmills in Victoria and Queensland, and I hold that we should also acquire brickworks and cement works, and extensively supply our own material for the purpose of building, homes for our soldiers as cheaply as possible, so that in the future their occupants may not be hampered, as they may be, owing to the increasingly high cost of building material. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in his desire to cheapen the cost of building soldiers' homes, but the cost, as the Minister has already pointed out, is largely due to the great increase in the price of material, which again is largely due to an inadequate output. The present supply of material is not sufficient to meet the demand for building purposes. Particularly is this the case in respect to timber. In every capital city the yards of timber merchants are bare. Merchants cannot get their orders executed. Nearly every timber yard in South Australia has had orders placed in Queensland eighteen months ago, which have not been executed, and no one knows when they will be. I was in Sydney a little while ago, and made inquiries there. In spite of the fact that there are extensive areas; of timber in New South Wales, much of it suitable for building purposes, the timber merchants of Sydney are in very much the earn© position as those in Adelaide. While this scarcity continues, prices are bound to be high. </para>

                        <para>- The trouble is due to the inadequacy of supplies to meet an abnormal demand, but this abnormal demand is likely to continue for a very long time to come. The same remarks apply to bricks and cement. The increased demand is not only created by the building of War Service Homes. The works undertaken by the Murray Water Commission are assuming considerable proportions. Honorable members have no idea of the magnitude of the cement orders placed by that Commission. There are other large water conservation works demanding cement. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, silos will also make a very material difference in the demand. The question is how to reduce the cost of the material required for building soldiers' homes, and it can only be done by increasing the output. Does the honorable member for Hunter mean that his proposal to create State enterprises will overcome the difficulty ? </para>

                        <para>- It needs careful inquiry before it is undertaken. I am opposed to the extension of State enterprises, but, if they are necessary for the purpose of bringing an undue monopoly to its bearings, I will support them. That has been my policy for many years past. As to the price of bricks, it has been pointed out that there are numbers of important brickworks lying idle today. The Government should know the reason for this, and if the same remarks apply to other materials required for this enterprise, the Government should know whether a monopoly is injuriously affecting the public interest, and, if necessary, take action to check it. In my opinion, - there is no necessity for the amendment, because the Government have the power irrespective of it.  _ I  offer no apology for once more referring to the question of the construction of these homes by the South Australian Government, because it involves their cost and the amounts to be repaid by the men. The reason why South Australian representatives brought up the matter some months ago was that we saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> an advertisement calling for applications to fill positions in certain offices, involving an outlay of some £7,000 or £8,000 per year. This meant the creation of a competing Department by the Commonwealth to work side by side with the South Australian State Department that has been, for seven or eight years past, engaged in building civilian homes, and is thoroughly organized for such work. We South Australian representatives made vigorous and repeated protests. </para>

                        <para>- We did not; we got quotations from  the  State Bank of South Australia, and I challenge the honorable member to deny the facts. If he goes to the State Bank he can be shown the figures, and he can compare that cost with that of the buildings  constructed  by the Commonwealth Repatriation Department. He will see that the State work compares more than favorably in regard to the extent of the land, the spaciousness of the buildings, and in other respects. I may further point out that neither  the  Minister for  Repatriation  nor any officer of the Department has challenged those figures, and I cannot see what more information than they have can be possessed by  the  honorable member for Melbourne Ports. The creation of this new Department is characteristic evidence of the grasping  efforts  of some public official to magnify his office; and it is this that is responsible for the interference with the construction of these buildings by the State Government of South Australia. The competition sent up the cost of construction so much that the State Government have retired altogether from the business. </para>

                        <para>- South Australian representatives here moved the adjournment of the House on the question, being determined to keep the matter before the Government and honorable members. It is true that the Minister for Repatriation did hold his hand for a time, but the State Minister in charge of repatriation in South Australia could get no satisfaction, although he came over to Melbourne to two conferences on the matter. As I say, the business was hung up, and prices got so high that the State Government withdrew from the field. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government's idea, of economy is to approve the creation of Departments in this way, they will have a lot of trouble between now and the end of the session on the question of public expenditure; and it is about time they had some trouble. If the Treasurer knew the feeling in South Australia on this question, he would take a different view. The South Australian Government have no desire to set aside the work of building civilian homes, but they feel that the interests of the returned soldiers should first be considered. \ I ask honorable members to look into the matter carefully, for, if they do, they can arrive at only one conclusion. </para>

                    <para>. - While crediting the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> with an earnest desire to help in solving the great difficulties that confront the Commissioner in the acquisition of material for the erection of War Service homes, I regret to say that the Government are unable to accept his amendment. ' First, the scope of the amendment covers only one type or class of beneficiary under the Act. There is some difficulty, or some room for misunderstanding, under the Act as at present drawn. In the Act, the power of the Commissioner to build on individual applications was not clearly defined, and this clause is designed to put the matter beyond doubt. The clause provides that the Commissioner may erect, complete, or enlarge, for eligible persons, dwelling-houses " on land owned by them," or may enter into contracts for the erection, completion, or enlargement of dwelling-houses on such land. It will be seen, as I have said, that the clause is limited to that type of applicant who himself owns the land on which he desires the house to be erected, either through the Commissioner's staff or under a contract, let by the applicant and approved by the Commissioner. The clause does not cover the whole range of construction under the main Act; and the amendment of the honorable member for Hunter, if it has any effect, will be rather to limit the power under that Act. Personally, I read the proposal of the honorable member as vesting in the Commissioner power to take all the necessary steps for the acquisition of land and material, and probably to go the length of himself establishing the necessary means of obtaining them, under the direction of the Minister; but clearly, if the amendment is carried, it will not achieve what the honorable member no doubt has in his mind, namely, to give the Commissioner the power to provide the whole of the material. There seems to be a great deal of confused thought with regard to what this House has already done in respect to the housing scheme, and honorable members appear to be very much divided in mind as to what are the powers of the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister. I take it that this House charged the War Service Homes Commissioner with the great undertaking of building homes, and of acquiring, subject to the- approval of the Minister, the necessary material; and the first occasion on which the work of the Commissioner is called to account is when he enters into a contract for the purchase of mills and timber areas. As to the question of the wisdom or otherwise of entering into this contract without the approval or ratification of Parliament, I leave that aside for the moment; but I do not think any honorable member will contend that the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, has not that power already. </para>

We deliberately decided to remove what might be called the" commercial side of this great undertaking from parliamentary influence and control, and place it under a Commissioner. If the Commissioner is expected to bring every one of his operations to this House for ratification, how can we have continuity of work, when the House is not in session? I do not plead, of course, for the expenditure of huge sums without reference to Parliament, if Parliament is available; but the Commissioner is given no power to engage in a contract, particularly by the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Hunter, for the purchase of land or material without the consent of the Minister. Honorable members will not contend that the consent of the Minister means the consent of the House; and in matters of great magnitude it becomes a question of policy or discretion with the </para>

                <para class="block">Minister and Government of the day to consult Parliament. That is the position clearly established by the Act. The wisdom or otherwise of that policy is another question. Certainly Parliament decided to create a business Commission. The Government appointed a Commissioner with certain  powers, and authorized him to engage business men and experts to advise him in regard to all the ramifications of house-building. He has acquired by contract, and otherwise, the necessary material to build all the houses that have been erected to date, and no question was raised by this House until the timber purchases were made. I regret that, from time to time, loose statements, which reflect very gravely upon the Commissioner, and also the Minister, have been made. I am certain that anybody who knows the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> well will agree that there is no more painstaking Minister, and none who does more to apply  business methods to the management of his Department. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> has asked certain questions in regard to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Caldwell, and he suggested that if certain information which had reached him was correct, a very serious state of affairs existed, which warranted the appointment of a Royal Commission. Apparently the honorable member desired an inquiry into statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> to him. To use the words of the Minister for Repatriation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> desired to sell to the Commissioner a " gold brick." He offered to sell to the Commissioner the lease of certain lands in the islands under the control of the Pacific Islands Commissioner. The War Service Homes Commissioner received him in good faith, and listened to his representations, but on inquiry of the Commissioner of the Pacific Islands, he found that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> held no lease or concession of any kind that he could sell to anybody. Another statement has been made in regard to the purchase by the War Service Homes Commissioner of timber mills m the Beech Forest. According to the critics, those mills are on their last legs. In answer to a question by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> I promised to supply complete details of the purchase. The facts are that the Commissioner has purchased from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> W. Knott, of Melbourne, for £48,570, five saw-mills - three in the Beech Forest, one at Cheviot, and one at Broadford - together with 694 acres of freehold land and cutting rights over an area of not less than l',000 acres, to each mill. The effect of the purchase is to assure to the Commissioner a supply of 30,000,000 super, feet of hardwood (scantlings, &amp;c), 3,000,000 palings, and 6,000,000 lineal feet of dressed weatherboards at prices varying from 15s. 9d. to 33s. per 100 feet super, as against the present market rates of from 25s. Sd. to 54s. He is thus assured for the next three years of the material that is necessary for the cheaper building of homes for soldiers. A further condition of the contract is that, at the end of three years, the contractor who is to operate the mills will take them over at the purchase price. Personally, I do not object to any criticism so long as the Department is afforded a reasonable opportunity to meet it. But I ask honorable members to endeavour to assist the Commissioner and the Government in their efforts to get materials with which to build home3 at a reasonable price. There are three methods by whic  the material can be obtained. First of all, there is general competition in the open market, but large orders such as the Commissioner will necessarily have to place must mean, in the present limited market, soaring prices. The second alternative is that the Commissioner may, with the approval of the Minister, enter into arrangements similar to . that made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knott,</inline> and by a subsidiary contract, which will not be operated by the officials of the Department, assure to himself supplies of timber at reasonable rates. Foi the conduct of timber mills it is necessary to have skilled and experienced men. The third method is that suggested by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> namely, that the Government should enter into' State undertakings. The Government cannot see their way to embark upon a wide range of undertakings for the supply of building materials unless as a last resource. The Government and the Commissioner have not at their command that experience and skill which established works have, and for that reason they would be greatly handicapped in entering upon State-managed undertakings. Whilst I credit the honorable member for Hunter with a genuine desire to help the Commissioner to acquire material at reasonable rates, the Government are unable to accept the amendment for the reasons I have already given. </para>

                    <para>.- The latter part of. the Minister's statement in regard to the agreement made by the Commissioner for the supply of timber in Victoria indicates that the soldiers will get cheaper homes. The principle he has outlined is a, good one, and it should be extended to the supply of bricks, cement, and other materials. The Minister referred to competition in the open market, but there is no competition in regard to bricks. AH the brick -making firms are joined together in a Combine, and the Government cannot get a fair deal from them. It is, therefore, the duty of the Government to establish brickworks. That could be done at a small cost. Some honorable member has said that notwithstanding State enterprise in brick manufacture in New South Wales the price of bricks there is not cheaper than in other States. That is true to a certain extent. About £140,000 has been expended by the Government on the establishment of State brick works. The biggest consumers of bricks in New South Wales are the Railway Commissioners, and as a result of the State brickworks tendering at lower prices than those quoted by the Combine, the Railway Commissioners have saved £177,000 since the brickworks were established. Last year the brickworks showed a profit of £37,000. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. So long as the Commonwealth endures, it will require supplies of cement. In connexion with nearly every big public work cement is used. We are told that the establishment of cement works in Tasmania will help to relieve the market. No doubt it will. But even if half a dozen new cement works were started the whole output would be required. The big works that are being carried out in connexion with the Murray River scheme will absorb all the cement that can be obtained. Great quantities of cement will be required also in connexion with the building of the Federal Capital at Canberra. I do not say that the Government have not power to do what the amendment suggests, but the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> merely desires to fortify the Government by getting the Committee to assert the principle of State enterprise. The Committee of Public Works submitted to Parliament a report on the cost of establishing and equipping up-to-date cement works at Fairy Meadow, on the southern line, close to Canberra, and handy to the Murray River. A good piece of land for the purpose has been acquired, and if the Government would establish these works they would be entering upon a very profitable speculation. They would reduce the cost of building the soldiers' homes, whilst- also providing cheaper cement for other Government undertakings. I concur in the action of the Government in acquiring timber1 areas and saw-mills, and if the transaction is proved to be fair and square I shall support -it. Unless they adopt a policy of that kind the Government will be in the hands of the rings and trusts.It is their duty to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the interests of the soldiers. In regard to timber they have adopted the right policy, and I hope they will extend it to bricks and cement. </para>

                        <para>- I do not, and that is another reason why I cannot support it. If the Commissioner were to 'submit to the House any good proposition for acquiring or establishing timber mills, cement works or brickworks, the House would judge the scheme on its merits, and. probably agree to it. That would be a far saner procedure than to give the Minister and the Commissioner power to go about in a general and haphazard way. setting up these works in all the States. If cement is to be made by the Commonwealth, it would be better to produce it at the spot where the best facilities are afforded, and thence, to distribute it throughout the Commonwealth, rather than that numbers of works should be established all over the States. If the Government embark upon this class of enterprise, there will be a riot of Government established industries, and works of one character and another will be growing up all over the land. The guiding principle in regard to all this legislation is how best to benefit the returned soldier. We should consider nothing else but how to provide soldiers with the cheapest and meet suitable homes. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The amendment will not take the whole scheme any further than the law can carry it to-day. The honorable member does not say, in his amendment, that the Commissioner shall acquire, but that he " may " acquire;, and the Commissioner has that power to-day. In fact, the Commissioner has acquired, to a very considerable extent, and I am not at all satisfied that he has dona the right thing with respect to the Queensland " deal." I want to hear a lot more about it before I can say that I am convinced that the proposition is sound. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so; and I hope that, if they should go in similarly for brick- works and cement propositions, the enterprises will prove equally as successful as the honorable member believes the present one to be. I trust, however, that Parliament will first be consulted. I do not agree with what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has just said concerning the approval of the Minister. I think he is quite wrong in his argument. It was not intended, when the Act was passed, that the Minister and the War Service Homes Commissioner should be able to put their heads together and, without consulting Parliament, run the country into a purchase involving £500,000. Are honorable members to stand by, without being informed or consulted, and then to be required automatically to signify their approval, long after a " deal " has been completed and when there is no course open but to pay ? If we do not wish to remain in such an absurd position, we should amend the Act. The Government have done wrong in not coming before the House for approval. I regard the Minister as being a trustee. He should not require to be dragged to the floor of this House to give an account of his stewardship; he should be ready with his accounts, to make them public. The first honorable members heard of the Queensland " deal " was when they read' the information published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> Why should not honorable members be informed before the newspapers publish the information broadcast? Honorable members are supposed to be responsible for their votes. How can they be expected to accept responsibility in such circumstances? Had the particulars been made known to honorable members and the country from the floor of this Chamber there never would have been that vote taken recently which nearly had the effect of bringing about the demise of the Government. Had the outcome of the vote been unfavorable, nobody would have been to blame but the Government themselves. It would have been their sole responsibility if they had been compelled to go out of office. If I were to signify my approval of the amendment I would be acquiescing in the proposition that the Government should enter upon these various enterprises. My view is, however, that the Government should keep out of such things. We' have enough Government-run businesses at present, very few of which are a success. It is all  very  well for the Government to come in at a time when the country is monopoly ridden, or when abnormal circumstances have arisen, under which certain people are securing undue advantages to tie detriment of the community. I will never take exception to the Government legitimately endeavouring to protect the community, but I oppose the principle underlying the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. If the Parliament refused to ratify an agreement that had been made by the Commissioner for the purchase of any large works, would there not be considerable delay ? Surely the honorable member does not think that this Parliament is prepared to agree to any expenditure that may be undertaken by the Minister or the War Service Homes ' Commissioner. Tn many cases the Commissioner could obtain an option over a property that he desired to acquire, and give Parliament an opportunity to consider his proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Neither the Minister nor the Commissioner should enter upon enterprises involving a large expenditure without consulting Parliament. I have heard to-day, for the first time, that further saw-mills have been acquired in Victoria. The wholesale acquisition of mills and other works will lead to disaster. Where the Government make one good bargain they are likely to have ten bad ones on their hands. That sort of thing would not benefit our returned soldiers, and, in dealing with this question, my .sole desire is to consider their best interests. I do not desire the Government to enter upon "wild cat" schemes. I know too well the history of Government-conducted industries in Australia. Very few of them have been a success. Doubtless, the Commissioner could acquire certain properties- with a fair prospect of success, and, in such circumstances, the Parliament would readily approve of action being taken by him. Since he already has that power, I see no necessity for this amendment, and must, therefore, vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- By agreeing to this amendment we shall give to the Commissioner a clear indication that the Parliament desires that he shall acquire large business enterprises. At the present time the Minister and the Commissioner have power to purchase mills and works of various kinds. Our complaint concerning the recent purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland was that the Government should have entered upon such an enterprise, involving, as it does, an expenditure of £500,000, without consulting Parliament. We were quite justified in protesting against that action, and  I  hope that we shall never be slow to protest against the Government of the day usurping the powers of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise the point that the honorable member seeks to make, but I would point out that when the Government purchase a big business enterprise without consulting Parliament they take away from us the control that we should exercise over the public funds. I do not say that the Commissioner has made a bad deal in regard to the Queensland purchase. I know nothing of the properties acquired,  and I hope that the investigation in regard to them will show that the purchase was absolutely justifiable. I appreciate the difficulties with which, the Minister and the Commissioner have had to contend, and I regret that we cannot insert in this Bill a clause making it a criminal offence for any persons to combine in restraint of trade in respect of goods or material required for War Service Homes. Unfortunately, I do not think we have the power to legislate with respect to trade and commerce within a State; the power still remains with the State Parliaments. Many timber merchants are, in my opinion, combining to raise prices, and I do not think we shall be able to take effective action to bring down prices until we have power to pass legislation making it a criminal offence for any association to fix the prices of goods required by the Government. </para>

I would also remind the Committee of the working of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. Honorable members will recollect the fight I have put up from time to time, with the object of ascertaining the cost of rifles produced in that factory. I offered, on one occasion, to make a wager that they were costing over £11 each. The Committee that reported to Parliament in favour of the establishment of that Factory said that rifles could be manufactured under Australian conditions at a cost of £3 9s.1d. each. We have in the Lithgow Factory what, prior to the war, was one of the best plants in the world. During the war period costs, as we know, have gone up considerably, but the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> last week admitted that rifles produced by the Small Arms Factory were now costing £13 each.' </para>

It was said that it would be unwise to let foreign Powers know the number of rifles we were making and the cost of their manufacture. In Belgium and France girls are employed to operate the machines in the Small Arms Factories, while boys and girls are so employed in British factories; but at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory only engineers are employed, and there is one mas to each machine. Is it any wonder that the cost of production is so high? </para>

The price here, I presume, is controlled1 by a Combine. I would do everything possible to prevent this restraint of trade.

                <para>The War Service Homes Commissioner may find it absolutely necessary to erect brickworks. He has power to do so under the principal Act. If prices continue to rise, and it is found impossible to obtain bricks at a reasonable price, he may deem it essential to establish brickworks. There is nothing to stop him from doing so, and in such circumstances the House, I am sure, would commend him for taking such action. Parliament, however, should be consulted in respect of any large expenditure contemplated by the Department. We have given the Minister and the Commissioner enormous powers under the principal Act. In carrying out "the War Service Homes . scheme they will probably spend something like £30,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The omission of such a provision is a reflection on the draftsman of the Bill. Measures of this kind are usually framed on existing legislation, and I copied most of- my proposed amendment from a provision in the Railways Act of 1917. However, the Minister already has the power to do what the honorable member for Hunter desires to give the Commissioner power to do, and if it were found that Combines were being formed, rendering it very costly to obtain material for building soldiers' homes, I am sure he would set about the establishment of the necessary works. We are all of the opinion that the best should be done to provide soldiers with homes at the cheapest possible price. There is not an honorable member here who would work in the interest of any person anxious to increase the cost of these buildings. But are we to make it part of the policy of the War Service Homes Commissioner to establish undertakings of the kind suggested in the amendment ? </para>

                        <para>- The Government are pretty well alive to the fact that if action similar to that taken in the recent purchase of saw-mills in Queensland were taken in the future, honorable members who were found supporting them on the last occasion would then be found opposing them. Honorable members' realize their responsibilities, and want some control over the public purse; they could not exonerate any Government which repeated what they had condemned them for doing in the past. One strong argument against the adoption of the amendment is the fact that it would assuredly lead to the establishment of a number of Departments, increasing the public expenditure.. As the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard. Foster)</inline> has already pointed out, the establishment of a War Service Homes Branch. in South Australia, where the State Bank has already been carrying out the work of building soldiers' homes successfully, must increase the cost of building these houses at a time when we ought to be doing all we can to keep it down ; and here again, if we set up additional Departments with expensive staffs, for the purpose of running Commonwealth 'Brick Works, and Commonwealth Cement Works, and so forth, it must increase the cost of building homes for the soldiers, the very thing which we should set our minds on avoiding. </para>

The honorable member for Dampier has always been very careful to trot out what he deems to have been the failures of State enterprises; but if we were to go through the whole gamut of private and Government enterprises, I dare say we should find a greater number of failures among the former. </para>

He states - "Accumulated profits at 30th June, J HIS, were £23,(&gt;22 Ss. 9d., or 2G.94 per cent.: reserve for renewals, £27,4S9 1,5s. 6d., or 31.30 per cent., amounting in all to £51,112 4s. 3d., or 58.30 per cent., of the capital employed." </para>

                <para class="block">As pointed out by the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> these works anticipate paying off this year the balance of the capital cost. Consequently they will be able to sell their output cheaper. At any rate, they must be a good proposition for the State Government when we find that they can save another State undertaking, to wit, the Railways, as much as £170.000. State enterprises are not all a series of mistakes and blunders. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. ' Gregory)</inline> has pointed out that we are being squeezed to-day by timber, brick, and cement Combines. How are we to escape from their grip ? The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has told us that owing to the purchase of saw-mills at Beech Forest, the War Service Homes Commissioner will effect a saving of at least 10s. per 100 feet on hardwood. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite likely, as the honorable member suggests, that the purchase of these mills by the Commonwealth may result in bringing down the price of timber in the open market, and that affords another splendid argument for inserting the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter. In any case, as I have already pointed out, the mere insertion of the amendment would have a deterrent effect on the operations of Combines. / </para>

                        <para>- But the amendment would be a double-barrelled safeguard. No work could be established without the authority of Parliament, and the provision appearing in the Act would have a deterrent effect on Combines. I know that some honorable members regard a lot of the expenditure at the Flinders Naval Base as' extravagant, and there certainly has been laxity and inefficiency of control, resulting in the wasting of thousands of pounds, but there are other officers who, in the administration of affairs, have been wise,- One officer stationed at Flinders, requiring a large quantity of hardwood, approached a small saw-mill -owner in the neighbourhood and asked him to quote for the whole of the output of his mill, which about met the Department's requirements. As a result, he was able to effect a considerable saving. </para>

                <para>I was a member of a Committee which inquired into the question of the establishment of cement works at Fairy Meadow, some 25 miles from the Federal Capital site. The evidence that we took, not only from Government officials, but from private cement manufacturers and others, was fairly conclusive that if the Government were to embark on the venture they could save at least £10,000 a year. I am surprised that the Government have not taken steps to establish cement works at that place. </para>

                        <para>- Not quite so much. For a considerable number of years Danish manufacturers had a monopoly of cement production, but the British manufacturers have now come into the field, and are doing as well, if not better, than their Continental competitors. The land at Fairy Meadow has been purchased by the Commonwealth from the New South Wales Government, and it seems peculiarly adapted for this industry. On one side of a beautiful stream of water is a great hill of limestone formation, and on the other side a hill of shale. Thus we have the two main elements of cement, with water power to  drive the machinery. We know that large operations have commenced at Maria Island, and that Australian manufacturers are trying to catch up with the demand. Much work is ahead, including the construction of silos, irrigation works - including the Murray River works - pipe building, and ordinary building operations, and throughout Australia there is a greater demand for cement than ever. This is particularly noticeable in the case of reinforced cement work, and the pipes that are being turned out here, from 3-inch to 8-feet diameter, by the Hume Brothers company, are known all over the world. I think I am at liberty to say that Hume Brothers have sold their South African rights for £50,000, and that the New South Wales rights have been bought by the State Government. Under all the circumstances, we would be wise to adopt the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Hunter. To my mind, the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> and the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> tell more strongly in favour of the amendment than against it. I suppose that before we are finished with the work of repatriation we shall have to erect, roughly, 100,000 homes, which, at only £700 each, represents an expenditure of £70,000,000. Under the circumstances, we should, in every way possible, protect the returned soldier, who, after all, has to find the money. We should brush aside some of our preconceived notions regarding State enterprises, and adopt the course that will, in the end, prove the cheapest for the men who have done their duty by this country. </para>

                    <para>.- Unfortunately, I was unable to be present when the Minister made a statement in reference to a question I had asked earlier in the day. I wish to see the best done for our returned soldiers in the way of providing for them the cheapest houses the Government can build. I think, however, that the returned soldiers are not going to get the cheapest houses by the means adopted now, namely, the purchase of saw-mills and timber areas. I do not know whether honorable members are aware that the . Government, some time back, purchased five timber mills in Victoria at a cost of something like £40,000. I am afraid that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has been wrongly informed when he attempts to justify that purchase by stating that timber is now sold at from 25s. to 54s. per 100 feet super. </para>

If the Government had gone to any of the millers in the areas they have purchased, they could have got the timber at as low a price as it is costing them to-day. I was not here when the Minister made his statement, but I understood him. to say that the cost is 15s. 9d. per 100 feet super. The' Victorian saw-mills cost, I believe, £40,000. </para>

                        <para>- Although most of the mills purchased are in my own electorate, I am not sufficiently familiar with the  fact3  to justify me in criticising the transaction. I may do so later, however, for I have hoard a good deal about the matter. The Commonwealth Government could have taken up areas owned by the State Government, and put in their own mills, thus avoiding the purchase of the good-will of businesses carried out on lands already to a certain extent cut out. Some of the millers in my electorate have concluded that it is much more profitable to let their mills to parties of eight to fifteen men, and pay those men for the whole of the output; under all the circumstances, I think the Government have made a mistake, and would have done as well, or better, by going into new country. I hope that these purchases will prove all right, but I am a little doubtful. It is time enough, when all other resources have been exhausted, to enter into State enterprises of this kind. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> Industries such as that of cement and iron manufacture in existence to-day cannot supply present demands, and the Government ought to make sure of a proper supply of material in order to avoid failure in the building of these War Service Homes. There are, I believe, about 70,000 applications for homes already in, and we may look for 100,000 before the work is completed. This means the consumption of a vast amount of raw material which the Government ought to be able to provide for themselves. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is against the Government taking the control of any industry because, he says, such attempts in the past have not proved successful. I remind the honorable member, however, that he was against the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, which certainly has not proved a failure. Then, again, the Small Arms Factory is a paying proposition. </para>

                        <para>- They were a success, and produced implements at prices 30 per cent, below those quoted by private manufacturers. The implement works are still in operation, and nobody raises any objection to them. Therefore, they must be on a fairly satisfactory footing. The Commonwealth Clothing and Saddlery Factories have also proved profitable enterprises. If Government control is a success in connexion with the enterprises I have mentioned it is fair to assume that it would be equally successful in connexion with brick, cement, and iron works. Under existing conditions soldiers are not getting their homes built as cheaply as they could do if better arrangements were made for obtaining the necessary material. To-day, cement and lime are fully 30s. per ton dearer than they should be, whilst roofing iron is £40 per ton dearer than the price at which it could be profitably manufactured in Australia. Corrugated galvanized iron is quoted at about £70 per ton, whereas statistics prove that it could be manufactured in Australia at £35 per ton. That price would give a reasonable return on capital. There is no reason why the Government should not establish these enterprises. There are comparatively few cement works in Australia, and they cannot supply the demand. Large quantities of cement are being consumed by Government Departments, and private buyers cannot get supplies. The main objection to the amendment raised by honorable members opposite is that Government control will not be successful. The old tale that Government enterprise is a failure will no longer serve, because every industry which the Government have established and managed has been a success. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> said that the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was not a success. </para>

                        <para>- I do not dispute that, but the conditions under which the employees work to-day are vastly different from what they were when the factory was first established. At any rate, rifle.* are manufactured as cheaply in the Government factory at Lithgow as they could be produced elsewhere in Australia. If the Lithgow article is not cheaper tha'.i. the article produced by private enterprise it should be, because the Department refuses to pay its employees the same rate of pay as private employers pay for a similar class of work. There is plenty of scope for the Government to establish industries in almost every portion of the Commonwealth. In my own electorate there is room for new cement, lime, and iron works. In each of those industries nature would be practically a shareholder, for the whole of the material is ready to  hand. For cement works there is abundance of limestone and shale, and coal is obtainable close by. The only material that would have to be obtained from outside the State .is gypsum. New South Wales presents better opportunities for the establishment of these industries than does any other State. </para>

                        <para>- Are not the Portland Cement Works the most successful of the kind in the Commonwealth? Will the honorable member deny that there nature is a shareholder, contributing tens of millions of tons of limestone and shale on the spot, and convenient supplies of coal. At scores of other places in that State there is room for the establishment of similar enterprise. The Hoskins works at Lithgow have unlimited supplies of ironstone and coal. There is an opportunity for the Government to .establish works which would produce iron at prices cheaper than those ruling to-day, and instead of the profits going into ' the pockets of private enterprise, they would go into the coffers of the Treasury, whilst the community would get a cheaper article. If the Government seriously desire to erect homes for soldiers at a reasonable cost they must see that - the necessary material is obtained as cheaply as possible, and not continue paying private individuals whatever prices they choose to ask. Cement is quoted at about £5, 2s. 6d. per ton, although anybody who knows anything about its manufacture will admit that it could be produced at a much lower price. Lime is from £3 to £3 15s. per ton; about five years ago it was selling at 27s. to 30s. per ton. These facts are worthy of consideration. </para>

It merely provides that Parliament shall decide in regard to any large purchase which the Government mav contemplate. The clause, if amended as proposed by the honorable member for Hunter, will provide that the Commissioner may erect, complete, or enlarge, for eligible persons, dwelling houses on land owned by them, and, for that purpose, may acquire or establish, with the consent of Parliament, brickworks, saw-mills, and cement works. </para>

                        <para>- If the power already exists, why is there so much objection to stating it in the Bill? Acts of Parliament should be made clear enough for anybody to understand, and so explicit that there can be no evasion of the intention of the Legislature. I am not of opinion that the acquisition, by the Commissioner, of saw mills and timber areas will lead to any reduction in the price "of timber. The Government action in this regard is equivalent to removing an experienced farmer from the land and putting an inexperienced soldier in hie place, with the idea that, by so doing, the more rapid development of agriculture will be encouraged. I indorse the argument that the Government would have been better advised had they established mills in virgin forests, and thus supplemented the supplies at present available to the public; If the Government are going to acquire more of these mills, such acquisition must, of necessity, reduce the output to the general public. I fail to see the wisdom of purchasing mills which, in many cases, have been working for years. Any one with experience of saw-milling must know that, when a mill is established at a suitable forest site, the longer the mill remains in operation the more denuded does the neighbourhood become of  suitable  and accessible timber. Some thirty years ago I was employed by a saw-miller in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- No; we were felling giants of the forest, 8 feet in diameter. We were sent out into the bush to cut down certain timbers, which, however, remained for several years as they had crashed, and, apparently, were only an eyesore to the proprietor. The manager of the mill had instructed us to leave them as they lay, because he could not see his way clear to get the timber to the mill, and sell it at a profit. Eventually these fallen trees were milled ; and I may say here that the proprietor later became insolvent. The manager, who had been strongly averse from touching the timber at all, took the trouble to prepare detailed statements of the whole of the items of expense; and he afterwards made the matter public, since it had aroused considerable interest. I remember that the timber cost the owner more than 25s. per 100 feet to cut, and that he secured only 10s. 6d. per 100 feet for the hardwood in the rough. It was no wonder that he went insolvent. My point is that some of the mills which the Government have purchased have been working for a considerable time, and that it will cost more in future - and more and more as the years go by- to get the timber to those mills, and market it. The Government would have been more wisely advised if, instead of purchasing these going concerns, they had been persuaded to embark on the establishment of a mill of their own in a timber area hitherto untouched. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to cement. In the direction of the Government producing their own supplies, there are great possibilities. The Department should be able to erect, in the more congested areas, numbers of suitable homes for soldiers at a much cheaper rate than by building wooden homes; and there would be an additional advantage in that the upkeep of concrete houses would amount to considerably less. Some time ago, I was in conversation with a gentleman who told me that the Victorian Government had spent something like £10,000 upon the importation of cement from overseas for certain works in connexion with a freezing establishment somewhere in the neighbourhood, I understand, of Murtoa. I was authoritatively informed also that, right on the spot itself, there are millions of tons of the necessary ingredients for the manufacture of cement. That item of £10,000 would have provided capital for a splendid investment by the State erecting cement works. Instead of sending that money out of Australia for the purchase of a commodity, which came to hand only in very limited quantises, and was quickly used up, a permanent source of supply could have been established, and the effect might have been to materially cheapen the cost of soldiers' homes in the more congested areas. </para>
                <para>The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has made reference to a matter which I raised in this House, by way of a question, on Friday last. The outcome of my question is that there will be an inquiry into certain charges which have been made; but I wish to emphasize the fact that I have not made those charges. Their terms are to be found embodied in correspondence which has passed between the individual named therein and the War Service Homes Department. The Minister referred to the gentleman as being desirous of selling to the Commissioner something which he had not for sale. I call the attention of honorable members to the following letter dated 8th March, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Caldwell to the Commissioner for War Service Homes : - </para>

                        <para>- I do not hold a brief for him. I am. simply making quotations from the correspondence, in which he endeavours to prove that he has not been fairly treated by the War Service Homes Commissioner. Various statements, which I think strengthen his case, are made in the correspondence. I need not mention them here, but, having read the correspondence, I feel satisfied that if the statements contained in it are correct, this man has just ground for complaint. I am not here to say that, his statements are true or untrue, but he certainly makes very serious charges, gravely reflecting upon officials in the War Service Homes Department, and for the sake of their honour and integrity the fullest inquiry should be made. The correspondence shows that in the course of interviews be-  tween <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> and the Commissioner, and also between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> and the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> some strong expressions were used. Reference is made in such words as " liars ' 'and " swindlers." The whole of the correspondence will be tabled. I desire now to quote from a letter sent by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Caldwell</inline> to the War Service Homes Commissioner on 4th August last - </para>

                    <para>I have to acknowledge yours of 29th July, which is not a reply to mine of 24th June, wherein 1 stated a case and asked for an explanation. Whether my correspondence is couched in " reasonable language" or not is a matter of opinion. The reason for it' is not a usual one, and in view of the allegation of serious wrong-doing on the part of the War Service Homes officials, and the refusal to even acknowledge correspondence addressed on a public_ matter, is an occasion which warrants severe criticism. </para>

                        <para>- Caldwell states that on his return from the islands he had an interview with Colonel Walker, who entered into a tentative agreement with him on the understanding that matters could be finalized later on. Caldwell had spoken of Lahey's mills and timber areas in Queensland, and -Colonel Walker suggested that he should go to Queensland, and enter into negotiations, with a view to the purchase of considerable quantities of timber for the War Service Homes Commissioner. These were the first - negotiations that took place on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. Caldwell's charge is that, while he was on his way to Brisbane, with the full approval and consent of, and practically under instructions from, the- War Service Homes Commissioner, the Commissioner, behind his back, entered into negotiations with Lahey Bros., by means of telegraphic communications, for the purchase of 5,000,000 superficial feet of pine per annum for a period of five years. </para>

I  trust  that the whole of the facts will be elicited from both sides in order that justice may be done to those who apparently are at present under a. cloud. As to the amendment, I certainly feel disposed to give it my support. </para>

                    <para>. - The necessity for such an amendment as  that .proposed by me has been clearly shown during the course of the debate. Practically every honorable member is in agreement with the principle for which it provides. One or two honorable members have intimated their intention of voting against it; but an analysis of their speeches shows that they are in duty bound to support it. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has declared that the Department has already sufficient power under the principal Act to expend whatever it pleases on the purchase of timber mills, or anything else, necessary in connexion with the construction of War Service Homes.  His  only objection to the amendment seemed to be that it requires that Parliament shall be consulted before the Commissioner acquires or establishes any of these enterprises. So or any honorable members had said that the Parliament should be consulted in respect of all projects involving a large expenditure that I did not anticipate any opposition to my amendment. During the war period h, system grew up under which Ministers and others were permitted to undertake huge expenditures without consulting the Parliament. We have become familiar with the practice, and it seems now to be taken for granted that it should continue. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> and the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who adopted practically the same line of argument, concluded by stating that they would oppose the amendment. The honorable member for Wilmot said that under the principal Act the Minister had power to acquire any business enterprise necessary to the building of War Service Homes, and that, therefore, this amendment was unnecessary. A moment later he declared that if the Government continued to expend huge sums of money without first consulting Parliament, they need not look to him for any  further support. He said he would have to consider whether he would be justified in supporting a Government that would continue that practice. Notwithstanding this declaration, he objects to an amendment which expressly provides that the consent of Parliament shall be obtained to any proposal by the Department for the purchase of a business enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- I believe in the principle for which it provides. Those who favour the principle, and yet oppose this amendment, are taking up a very strange position. The honorable member for Dampier urged that to carry the amendment would be to give a direction to the Commissioner that he should purchase or set up big industrial enterprises. He admits that the principal Act gives the Commissioner power to incur large expenditures in such a direction, and that being so. he ought not to take exception to the amendment. It provides for the very principle for which he has declared. </para>

                        <para>- It has been contended throughout the afternoon that the Minister has power to acquire certain propositions, but that they ought first to be referred to Parliament. If that is so, how is it a constitutional power ? To my mind, the necessity to refer such matters to Parliament ought to be placed in the Bill, so that there can be no escape from it. However, very soon we shall have a division on my amendment, and then we shall have the spectacle of , honorable members, who have pointed out how absolutely necessary it is that no large sum of money should be spent without the consent of Parliament, voting against an amendment which places on the Minister the obligation to seek the consent of Parliament before undertaking any big business transaction, and doing so on the flimsy pretext that they do not think such a provision ought to be included in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That would prevent the Minister from doing anything in this direction except under exceptional circumstances. I would give him the option of carrying on these enterprises. I take no exception to what the Minister has done recently in the purchase of saw-mills, but I hold that no money should be expended for the purpose of acquiring undertakings, although they may be found necessary to reduce the cost of building material, unless the consent of Parliament has first  been obtained. If this provision is made in the Bill, there can be no ground for complaint against any transaction. It surprises me that some honorable members are opposing my amendment. Only the other day they were condemning the Minister for having purchased mills in "Queensland at a cost of £500,000, without the consent of Parliament, but now that they have the opportunity of compelling him. to first submit to Parliament any proposition he wants to acquire, they wriggle and advance all sorts of excuses for not supporting it. If they have any desire to be consistent they have the opportunity of displaying their consistency by supporting my proposal. There is such a scarcity of material, and there are so many competitors in the field for the quantity available; that higher prices must prevail, and, in twelve months' time, I believe the Minister will be compelled to come down to this House and ask permission to make a further advance to soldiers for the purchase of homes. </para>

                        <para>- That would be the case. There are always people who are only too anxious to cast doubt upon any transaction. My amendment would relieve the Minister of any responsibility in that regard. If he recommends  a  certain proposition to the Parliament, pointing out that a saving would bo effected by it, and if Parliament consents to it, he clears himself of all future responsibility in connexion with it.  I  think the amendment is a reasonable one. </para>

                    <para>.- Listening to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> one would think that his amendment was designed to safeguard the rights of Parliament as against individual Ministerial action, and protect the soldier against the Commissioner ; and if that were the effect of the amendment I would most gladly support it, because it is time Parliament had more control over expenditure, and it would be better for the individual soldier to always have such matters referred to this House, but the amendment does neither of these things. It merely gives a direction, to the Commissioner to acquire these different undertakings. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mean that. If a better means could be devised by which a soldier could reach this House instead of through the Minister, and the honorable member for Hunter implied, that that was what his amendment sought to achieve, I would support it, but  I  find that under the amendment the soldier would get no nearer to this House, and that the power of Parliament would not in any way be decreased. The Minister would still remain the sole arbiter. </para>

                    <para>.- Very often I find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> but, in regard to .this amendment, I .find myself in total disagreement with him. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> the honorable member has claimed that all honorable members on -this side of the House .ought to support his amendment, I think it necessary to say a word or two in regard to  my  attitude towards it. I believe in the Minister and the Commissioner having .the powers they have at present under the Act. I  believe  in the Commissioner having the power to expend money up to the sum mentioned, £5,000. I also believe that he should not have the power to expend ov-er that amount without the  approval  of the Minister. But, having intrusted the Minister and those associated with him with the expenditure of an .immense sum of money, I .am perfectly content to leave it to them ito spend it, subject always to their responsibility to Parliament. If a Minister, pursuant to the powers given him under the Act, spends money unwisely, he can be brought to book on the floor of the House. We can challenge every transaction in which he engages, and if he does something that is .clearly unbusiness-like, he can be brought to book, and the Government that indorses his action can be thrown out of office. Under the Act, .the Minister and the Commissioner already have power to acquire all the classes of enterprise which the .honorable member for Hunter thinks it may be .necessary for them to undertake in the interests of the economical building of soldiers' homes. As a matter of fact, the amendment would really restrict, and restrict unnecessarily, their power in this respect. I would leave the whole .of the responsibility as to the way in which the money is to be expended .on the .shoulders of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and it may be lost if he does not seize upon it at once. However, suppose the Minister gets an .option on the purchase of a saw-, mill. Just imagine this business proposition being introduced to the House. There would be .all sorts .of wrangling. My experience in the House is that it is exceedingly difficult to have any question discussed on its merits. Nearly every discussion in this House in which I have taken part has been vitiated by party considerations and prejudices. If we had a business proposition placed before us for our approval, the chances are that these considerations, would operate.; </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the- Minister will take some action to have the purchase of houses expedited. Sometimes, after an application is approved1, a long, time elapses before the Department completes the bargain. I have in mind the case of a soldier who applied to the Department for assistance to purchase a home 'from a private person. His application was approved, and the owner thought it fair to allow the. soldier to take possession of the home. I think the soldier- has been in occupation of the house for at least six months, and the purchase is not yet completed'.. In the meantime the seller has been receiving no rent, and he is without the purchase money. He has been placed in a difficult position. I am of opinion that when, the 'Departmen't has approved of an- application, not more than a few weeks should elapse before the transaction, is. completed. </para>

                <para>Mr.CHARLTON.- Yes; some of "it has been already sold, and the balance is available for purchase. I refer to the Newcastle Commonage Reserve. I believe it is available at a reasonable price, for the reason that it was undermined years ago, and was subsequently levelled by the late E. W. O'Sullivan. The best portion of it could be selected for soldiers' homes,- instead of erecting them on the flat. There is also land belonging to the Waratah Coal Company. 1 believe that the area which is acquired was dearer than either of these properties 1 have mentioned. If we are to provide homes for soldiers, we should do the thing properly, and not buy land simply because it is offered to the Department, and regardless of the fact that it is in an unhealthy situation. I was informed a Tew days ago that, after recent heavy rains, the area which has been purchased was partly under water. At present there is no adequate provision for the drainage of . the area. Even if it were drained it would still be subject to fog, and in winter it is one of the coldest spots in the Newcastle district. </para>

                    <para>.- During the second-reading debate I drew attention to instances of the estimated cost of a home having been exceeded owing to circumstances over which neither the Commissioner nor the applicant had any control, and the . Commissioner thereupon insisting that the applicant, before occupying the home, should pay in cash the excess cost. I now urge upon the Assistant Minister the desirability of reviewing the reply that he gave to me on Thursday last. This matter has received mature consideration by the executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, who, after hearing particulars of cases submitted by individuals in various States, carried a resolution which has 'been forwarded to the Government. I will illustrate my point with a supposititious case: The Department agrees to build a home for an applicant under the existing Act at an estimated cost of £690. Owing to circumstances which arise during the course of construction, and for which neither the applicant nor the Commissioner is responsible, the cost is increased to- £720. The increase may be due to the higher price of materials and labour; but the original estimate forms the basis of the contract between the Department and the soldier. The Department then requires the soldier to pay in cash the additional £30 before he is allowed to occupy the building. I ask the Assistant Minister to adopt, by administrative act, the principle that operates in Western Australia under the Workers Homes Act, whereby, if the estimated cost of the building is exceeded, the excess is added to the worker's obligation for the time being, and he is allowed a period of months, and in some cases years, in which to pay off such excess. He is not required to pay the amount in cash before he can enter- his -home. Many returned soldiers are not in a position, after paying their deposit to the Department and buying furniture, to find even an extra £20 in cash, and the result is that sometimes a soldier is prevented from entering a home which the Department has erected for him. He has to approach a money-lender or a friend in order to borrow the amount of cash required before he can take possession of his own house. I should like the Minister to agree to the practice in operation in Western Australia. I have received the following reply to a telegram which I sent to West-' ern Australia, asking for information on this point: - </para>

                <para class="block">I also suggest that the cover for all homes to be erected under the Act should be sufficient, and let me disabuse honorable members' minds on another point. If an applicant for a home asks for extras while the house is in course of erection, or for any alteration in the plan resulting in increased expenditure, he should pay the difference in cash. I am arguing for those cases, and there are many, in which an applicant for a home is not in any way responsible for the added expenditure, and finds that he has to put up a certain amount in cash before he can get into his home. Probably cases similar to these have given colour  to statements that we hear outside that the War Service Homes Department are ; really charging a deposit on their homes, whereas we know that they do not. How ever, in this way a deposit is virtually being secured from certain applicants, and I hope the Minister will give some definite undertaking that, in the administration of the Act, cases similar to that which I have mentioned, will Be met by allowing the increased cost to be spread over a number of months rather than by demanding hard cash from the applicant. </para>

It may happen that later materials will be available at a cheaper rate, and, consequently, an applicant would benefit by obtaining a better class of house for the increased amount. But if circumstances should tend the other way, and materials begin to rise, the Government might then give consideration to the point raised by the honorable member. In view of the fact that by this increase we have met ah cases up to the present, I ask the honorable gentleman not to press for an amendment to the clause. </para>

I am anxious that those houses which are being purchased through or erected by other bodies than the War Service Homes Department, should) come -under- the provisions of this measure.. I understand that in South Australia up- to the present, the work has. been done by the. State Bank, and that similar- work, is- being done elsewhere by the Commonwealth- Bank. Are they -working independently, and are they allowed to go to&gt; any amount;, provided that the security is good enough? </para>

                        <para>- But I am referring to the point: raised by the honorable member for Fremantle', and I must say that I am entirely disappointed with the provisions of clause 10. We had been led to believe that the Ministry recognised that, the amount provided' in the Act for the erection of soldiers' homes was inadequate, and decided to increase it by £100. Instead, of. doing that, however, this- Bill, merely applies- the- additional amount to a few cases in which* a soldier may have a special claim for consideration. I suppose, if he had a large family,, or had some special need, for a large house;, he- would: secure, the benefit of this measure in that way. But that is not what we are asking for. We are asking for- some recognition, of. the fact that it is now costing the Commissioner more to build houses- than was, anticipated when. Parliament passed) the Bill fixing the limit of advance at £700. This Bill contains' no remedy for that. </para>

                        <para>- I anticipated that in this amending Bill we . should not have all this verbiage as to the Commissioner being satisfied!,, and so on, but' a clause striking, out the* amount of £7.00 in. the original Act. and substituting an amount of £800-. That is what the soldiers thought: would- be done-. I suppose- my experience- is the same as that of other honorable' members. We all know of cases in which soldiers' dependants have  been waiting for the passage of this Bill in the belief that, by reason of its more liberal provisions, they would be able to  get . a house to suit their requirements. Instead of that, we now find that they will have to go to the Commissioner with  some special claim, and advance some reasons why they should get a little more than the amount fixed in the original Act. That is not my view of the necessities of the case at all, and I should like to move an amendment which would give to every applicant for a house the right, on account of the extra cost of building, to obtain an advance up to £800 instead of £'700. "We are unable now to provide the kind of house we had in mind when we fixed the amount at . £700, and it is clearly our duty to raise the sum 'to such a figure as will enable the Commissioner 'to provide for the soldier &gt;the house we had in view when the original Bill was passed. </para>

                    <para>. - The other day4here was brought under my notice the case of a young man who had applied to purchase a place on the Brown's River-road, just outside of Hobart.  His  application was refused on what appeared to be an extraordinary decision, namely, that the property was out* side the city boundary. If 'there is one thing we want to encourage returned soldiers to do, it is to keep outside city boundaries. I will lay the letter before the Minister to-morrow, and I am sure he will give it his attention ; but it is remarkable that a man, desiring to purchase a property against which there is no other objection, should be prevented from so doing on the ground that it. is outside a city area. I feel sure that such a decision does not represent the policy of the  Department ; and, that if it does, it is not representative of the policy of Parlia- . -ment. </para>

                <para>There has been much dissatisfaction concerning the preparation of soldiers' homes in Hobart. In that city, there has been stationed an officer connected with the Repatriation Department who has had under him, I understand, a very competent staff. These officials would prepare plans, which had to be submitted for approval, however, to the Commonwealth Bank. But the Commonwealth Bank also had a staff of draughtsmen, with the result that plans would sometimes be chopped a'botit, and there would be differences of opinion and disputes between the two staffs. If that arrangement has not been altered, I hope it will be at once. Let either one or the other body run the whole concern; but I hope -the Minister will put an end to the conflict between the two staffs. </para>

                <para>Another case which has come under my notice has to do with a returned soldier who happened to be a carpenter, and a decidedly smart young builder. He prepared plans of a home which ha was desirous of erecting for himself, and which he could have constructed for less than the amount indicated by the Department in respect of its plans. The returned man's plans were a decided improvement on the standardized sets, but, because his vas not a standard plan, he was not given permission to build the house for himself,  liven  although he was prepared to carry on under the supervision of the Commis- sioner's staff. He became so disgusted  that  eventually he borrowed money from friends and put up a house for himself. Incidents such as these reveal pinpricks . and the placing of unwarranted disabilities in the way of furnishing returned soldiers with homes. Where a returned man happens to be a builder or carpenter, surely it is better to let him do the work rather than that others should be put on to the job while he continues to draw his sustenance allowance. What is the use of that to him while he stands idly by, perhaps, watching the work of men who are not as competent as himself? The hard-and-fast standardization of plans may have its advantages, but in individual cases, such as I have mentioned, the Commissioner should be free to exercise his discretion. </para>

                    <para>.- The case for returned men has been quite properly put by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell).</inline> It is possible that a man may, in all honesty, exceed the estimate by a small amount, and may find it impossible to furnish the difference in cash. There is no reason why the Department should not extend the payments over a longer period in order to cover the extra amount involved. Or, better still, the Department might arrange for increased payment of interest over the period now provided for to permit the extra money to be included in the general account. The statement of the Minister in Connexion with the increase of the advance does not quite meet every case. Honorable members regarded the increase from £700 to £800, not in the light of its being conceded to exceptional cases, but of its being generally applied by way of meeting the added cost of building to-day. It takes at least £800 now to build as good a home as could have been reared for £700 when the principal measure was before Parliament. Returned men believe that the proposed increase of advance was intended to provide the same degree of comfort in the building of homes to-day as could have been secured when the ori- final amount of £700 was decided upon, It is now desired, also, that in cases where the total of £800 may, by any mischance, have been exceeded by some small amount, the excess should be added to capital cost and provision made for payment of interest on the whole until the debt is cleared off. I would suggest to the Minister the wisdom of deleting the words - if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the circumstances of any case justify the excess, so that the proposed new section would read - </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to bring a case before the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> and, if possible, to obtain an assurance from him that the returned soldier who is concerned in it will not be penalized. In August last this soldier submitted to the War Service Homes Department a property which he desired to purchase, and which was valued at £700. He paid the Department a guinea to obtain a valuation of it. After he had sent in" his application he received a reply stating that his offer had been accepted conditionally upon the payment by him of £35, as the property had been valued at only £665. He was told that, if he . paid the Department £35, the balance of £665 would be advanced to him. Upon the strength of that communication be at once concluded the purchase of the property, and handed over the £35 to' the vendor. Subsequently he received from a new  Deputy  Commissioner in Queensland a letter stating that his application had been turned down, and that the advance could not be made upon the ground that he was not in a position to undertake the purchase. This man in a letter to me points out that he is in permanent employment, and is in receipt of a wage of £4 per week. I brought the matter before the War Service Homes Commissioner and asked him to wire the authorities in Queensland in regard to it, because the soldier in question has only till the 1st of next month to finalize his purchase, and, in default, he will be obliged to forfeit his £35. He further assures me that there are two persons who are willing to give £700 for the property.' There must be something radically wrong  in the Department when one  Deputy  Commissioner affirms in writing that the application of this man has been granted, whilst another says that it has been refused; even after the arrangement for the purchase of the property had been concluded. </para>

                    <para>.- I fail to see how the additional cost referred to in this clause is incurred. I presume that, if a soldier has a home built for him under the War Service Homes Act, a contract is made with the builder, and if the cost of the house exceeds £700 the onus of completing it is upon the contractor. </para>

                        <para>- If the Commonwealth builds homes for our soldiers, surely it does not undertake to build them without first fixing a price for their erection. In that case the War Service Homes Commissioner becomes a contractor. Let us assume that the departmental estimate for one of these homes is £720. The soldier for whom the home is being erected knows the cost of it, and, if the departmental estimate- be exceeded, it is manifestly unfair to ask. him to  pay the increased cost. If. the: Government aite.- going to. build these homes- for our soldiers they must occupy a precisely similar position to that, -which is occupied by the. outside contractor. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The Act is- verv explicit upon the matter. It shows that a contra-ct is made with the- individual soldier. Where, therefore, is there: any warrant for the Department making the soldier pay any increased expenditure that may be incurred ? If the- Department sustains a loss the country must bear it, and not the individual' soldier.. I ask the Assistant Minister whether this "matter is mot worth 'looking into very closely indeed? If the Department is. making a loss upon many of these homes either there must be something wrong with its own estimates or abnormal . conditions must be operating. But certainly the soldier ought not to be penalized upon that account. </para>

                    <para>. - The scheme of the principal Act, as I understand it, is that the Department will take the responsibility of building a house for a returned soldier at actual cost price. The soldier is to be free from the payment of architect's fees, and is not to be liable for the payment of a builder's percentage on the cost of the material. The agent for the building of the house is provided by the Government, and the sole charge against the soldier is the actual cost of labour and material. The Act provides that a sum not exceeding £700 shall be spent in the erection of a war service home. The Commissioner accordingly enters into an arrangement with a returned soldier to erect a house for him aft  actual cost price. That cost may be a little more or a little less than £700. The soldier has the benefit of an expert estimate as to what the cost will be, but, having regard to the way in which prices of material fluctuate, it is quite impossible at the present . time to pre-pare an estimate with absolute accuracy. In these  circumstances the Government, desiring to be perfectly fair to our returned soldiers, say, " You will not be charged any moire than the actual cost plrice." That being the scheme of the Act, I would urge honorable members not to add to it. It would be manifestly unjust to bind the Commissioner to the estimate given. It would be unjust, also, to the returned soldiers. If any such condition were imposed, the Commissioner would take care to over-estimate, rather than under-estimate, the cost, and the returned soldier would be committed to that excess estimate. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. It would, therefore, be unfair to ask a returned soldier to enter into such a contract. The whole conception of the Act is in the interests of the soldiers alone. The Government are perfectly fair in the matter. A great many homes have been built, and well built, to the satisfaction of all concerned, on the basis of a cost of £700. Some of my honorable friends seem to have the idea that this standard price of £700 is to be increased to £S00. That, however, would be unfair to those for whom homes have already been built, since the basis of the principal Act was the erection of homes at a standard cost of £700. The Government «say that in some cases the cost is a little more, and in the circumstances they very properly propose in this Bill to provide for a margin of £100 to cover all contingencies. It is not contemplated, however, that the standard is to be altered, and that an £800 house is to be substituted for a £700 one. If that were done, these homes would probably cost nearer £900 than £800. The present trouble would thus be repeated, since every estimate would be based on the standard of an £800 house. </para>

                <para>I therefore submit that, in the light of their experience, the Government are taking up a very fair attitude. They want to continue to build the £700 standard type of house. The cases that have been mentioned by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell)</inline> and the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> are amply provided for in the proposal now before the Committee. To alter the principle of the Act in the way suggested by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> would be a serious mistake, and would not be in the interests of the returned soldiers themselves. By our action in increasing the maximum advance from £700 to £800, the Department will be given a margin of £100 to meet contingencies, and in that way will be able to do justice to all concerned. </para>

Where the estimate of £700 is exceeded, however, I think it is unfair to require the man for whom the home is built to pay the excess in cash. That, I am sure, is not the desire of the Committee. The repayment of the additional cost should be spread over a period of years. </para>

                <para>Unfortunately, there is too much red tape associated with all our Departments. In the United States of America a field marshal receives the same pension as a private. Here, as in the old country, the lower the rank of a pensioner the less he receives. I hope that the Government will go a little further than they have done in connexion with this scheme, and will establish a Commonwealth Insurance Department, or else make use of the State Insurance Departments of Queensland and Victoria. Unfortunately, the insurance companies, with the great power of their money, have not given the Victorian State Insurance Department a fair chance; but, as the result of its creation, premiums have been very considerably reduced. The United States of America insured every soldier, without medical examination, who had been accepted for service. Under their system a soldier could insure his life up to £2,000 for a premium of £15. Such a policy would have cost an Australian soldier £150 per annum. I want the Government to establish a system of Commonwealth insurance, and to insure every one of . these War Service Homes against fire. In that way, those of our returned men, for whom homes were built, would be saved a vast amount of money. The Victorian State Government used to collect from the State railway employees the premiums due by them to insurance companies. In that  way the companies, over a period of years, received by way of premiums £250,000, and paid out only £37,000. The Repatriation Department will have to collect the instalments payable from time to time in respect of the purchase money for these homes, and could at the same time collect the fire insurance premiums, so that the cost of the insurance scheme would be reduced to a minimum. It would thus be possible to insure at 'rates far below those charged by the insurance companies. I invite honorable members to read the splendid speech delivered by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 4687. It is a compendium of information on this very question of insurance. </para>
                <para>The honorable member showed . the following startling facts: - In Brisbane, where "the premium on a wooden building was formerly £5 2s.1d., the rate fell to £3 8s. when the Government insurance scheme was initiated. The premium on a brick building fell from £3 15s. to £2 10s. At Toowoomba the premium on a wooden building- fell from £3 12s. to £2 8s., and a brick building from 5s. to 4s. At Warwick the premium on a wooden building fell from £1 2s. 3d. to 14s.10d. ; and in the Darling Downs district the premium on a wooden building fell from £4 7s. to £2 12s. 2d. For the first time in the history of insurance, the State Insurance Department in "Victoria has actually returned the whole of the premiums paid by insurers for whom the necessity to insure has not arisen; that is to say, a refund has been made to persons who did not employ the number of workers covered by the premiums paid. Although my voice might be like that of the solitary pelican crying in the wilderness, I could offer a suggestion as to how these soldiers' houses could be built at an infinitely less cost, and by which they would ultimately become a most excellent rent-producing asset for the Commonwealth that would continue for ever and ever. I hope honorable members will forgive me for my reiteration of this argument, but after thirty-one years' close study of the question, I am certain that it is the only way in which the country can clear itself of the avalanche of debt that is, unfortunately, lying on it to-day. I would like to see the Government issue War Service Homes currency notes as the buildings progress, all rents payable for the soldier occupiers, which would be much less than the payments provided for in this Act, being earmarked and paid into a fund, and on a certain day in each year, when that fund has risen to a specified amount, so many of these currency notes being burnt. </para>

                        <para>- My purpose is to show the Government how they can save the extra £100 in the building of these homes. Perhaps another opportunity will be afforded me of doing so. Under no circumstances should our soldiers be sacrificed. Of the available manhood of Australia, 70 per cent, offered their services in the war; 43 per cent, were accepted, and 33½ per cent, left our shores; but we have not yet touched one penny of the last shilling. We are informed by the Commonwealth Statistician that the wealth of Australia prior to the war was £1,200,000,000, and that, during the war, it increased by £400,000,000, sufficient in itself to pay the whole of our war debt, and affording a great reserve upon which the Government can draw when the time comes to do so. I object to saddling the interest upon our war debt upon our children's shoulders. The Treasurer once said that he could readily see how Canberra could be built at no ultimate cost to the country. Surely he can see that the same can be done with regard to these soldiers' homes. The Commissioner, with or without control, and if he is the right man in the right place, will no doubt see that these soldiers' homes will not be a loss to the community, but ultimately an asset. </para>

If he is a married man, in all probability he will not have it, and if he is about to get married, he will want a little ready money with which to furnish his home.

                        <para>- He could not be certain, but every contractor takes care to have a margin '.to meet such contingencies. I am met with the reply that the soldier will not permit of any margin being allowed by the Commissioner. The soldier says, " I am entitled to an advance of £700, .and I want every penny of it spent on my house." That is one of. the causes of the trouble. So that it is not all on on© side. The soldier, rightly, is just .as rigid as he finds the Commissioner. I venture to say that the honorable member who has told us what can be done in South Australia would not care to undertake regular contracting under a system which compelled him to build right to the penny of his contract price on every occasion. There is hardly a house built on which extras have not to be provided for,  and which are mutually arranged and paid for. But it appears that none of the ordinary methods attached to private building can be allowed for in the building of these War Service Homes. The soldier asks for his £700 advance to the penny, and the Commissioner says that he will do his best to put up a house to the penny. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may do so, but if the advance is made £800 the soldier will still want every penny of it spent on his house. I do not blame him, but, on the other hand, he should not turn round and blame the .Commissioner if, through circumstances over which he has no control, prices mount a little higher, and he is compelled to say, " This is what the house honestly cost; there is value in it, and there is not a penny profit in any shape or form." It is fair that if it costs a little more the extra should be paid for by the soldier; but I agree that th* demand for a cash payment on the spot is a hardship. ' </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member misunderstood the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who, I take it, agreed to meet the case put by the honorable member for Premantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell),</inline> that if the Commissioner's estimate of £700 wa9 exceeded .the excess might be made part of the debt payable by instalments instead of cash. I would be delighted to hear that the Treasurer has. agreed to my proposal, which is that_ the- amount of £700 available under the old Act be increased to £800 £800 in all cases. ' That has nothing to do with the question which the honorable member for Fremantle introduced, and which was not really relevant to the clause. I do not say that an actual promise lias, been made, but there is a widespread . impression amongst the soldiers, whidh has not been discouraged by the Minister, that a Bill would be introduced which would make' available £100 more in each case for the purpose of building soldiers' homes. The Treasurer says the soldier insists on getting a £700 house. Let me direct his attention to what has happened in- my own electorate. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> spoke of what is done in South Australia.. It may be that for £700' a very fine house can be erected in South Australia, Western Australia, or Queensland, but so difficult is it to erect Houses near the metropolitan area of Sydney for £700 that the Commissioner lias been up against the municipal bylaws, which fix a minimum of air space for houses erected even in industrial centres. What is happening in the centres where house building, is expensive is that we are providing homes,, the rooms of which are smaller than the average in the localities in which they are built. In order to squeeze the estimate within the £700, we are building homes that the soldiers are very reluctant to buy. There hag been a demand that a greater sum should be made available- in order that homes more in accordance with modern ideas of decent housing accommodation should be provided. I' have had scores of letters asking when the £800 will be available, and the impression exists throughout New South Wales that the Minister has promised' that a BilT wilT be introduced to raise the- amount from £700- to. £800. I am sure that if the statement made by the Minister a few moments ago, that the proposal' in the Bill is only- intended to meet the case put by the honorable member for Fremantle represents what the Bill really means-, it is not what the soldier expects and- not- what he is entitled to, in view of the increased1 cost of building- soldiers' homes. The honorable member- for Kooyong. <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> said that we built a house for £700 three years ago and that we ought to- go on) building houses for £700' all. the way through1, even though, the- cost of building them may have doubled or trebled-. That argument is too absurd- to be presented to the Committee. What- we are trying to do for the soldier is not to build a house for a certain sum, but to give him a. home embodying a. certain degree of comfort 'and usefulness for his use and occupation. If it is found that the house which cost £700 three years ago to-day costs £800-,. our duty is to see that the soldier gets the right kind of house, and not that the design is cut down by £100 because material has gone up £100. I move the amendment to ascertain whether the Committee are going to. adhere to the £700 maximum of the Act, with the suggestion- that the Treasurer has accepted, or whether they intend to keep faith with the soldier and give him as good a house as could be built for £700 when the Act was passed,, but which in my judgment, will now easily cost £800. I wish to omit the words which impose on the Commissioner the- necessity of seeing that special circumstances, justify his action, in order that the Committee- may direct the Minister that the £800 maximum) shall be substituted for the £700 one. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and we cannot pin the Commissioner down to the exact £700. No man in the building trade can be expected even to tender for the work. He would rather do it on commission. Some builders have gone bankrupt because they could not complete their buildings. They cannot rely on bricks remaining at a certain price for a month. Every month those who control these materials meet and put up the price of bricks or timber. If the amendment of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> had been accepted, and the Department could have controlled its own staff, it would have known exactly what everything was going to cost. If they had a guarantee that bricks or timber  would not rise for six months, builders could tender correctly; but they cannot do so now. Of course, there is no guarantee that wages in the brick trade will not rise for six months. It is, therefore, absurd to ask the Commissioner to confine himself to a limit of £700. The soldier who gets a home for £720 or £730 is on a very good wicket. A good many are selling their houses at a profit of over £100, and people are glad to get them. I hope the Commissioner will have the power to keep on without increasing the amount. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should lite to explain why I have asked the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> to insert this clause. At present there is rather a loose control in connexion with the . repayments of these -moneys, and the clause is intended to bring them to account in the Treasury. There can be no adequate control over this finance unless every penny does come into the Treasury and is accounted for there. I am not saying that the money should not be used over again in the Trust Fund, 'but that at least should he left to the discretion of the Treasurer, who has to provide the funds. This is a proper precaution which gives the Treasurer a better grip of finance in connexion with the War Service Homes proposals. </para>

                    <para>.- Members ought to be informed what every trading Department of the Government is doing. This Department would be the purchaser of all kind's of materials, and as the tendency of the age is. to concentrate businesses into the hands of a few, we may expect to see the cement industry controlled by four or five companies before long. It is well known that when the- war broke out there were certain commodities in this country consigned from enemy countries: and owned by enemy subjects. Amongst those commodities was a quantity of cement, and people here who required cement, made up their mind's that at the sale of it they would bid- under the market price. Had it not been, that the Government itself required cement for certain works, and bough it. it at a fair valuation, these people would have go* it at a cheap rate. No Department should1 be placed at a <inline font-style="italic">disability</inline> as compared with private firms. I. wish, this  clause to embrace all Governmenifc industrial activities, such as the brickworks, which I hope- to- see started for- the supply of millions of bricks for the war service homes;-, and to  that end it would he far better, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has suggested, to strike out all the words after the word " year."- I believe that the honorable member is  'Opposed  to the action of the people who have inflated prices to the disadvantage of the returned soldiers. I should be prepared to support the proposed new clause if the honorable member did not ask for information upon so many minute details. </para>

Under that measure the Railways Commissioner is required, as soon as possible after the. close of each financial year, to submit to the Minister  an  annual report and balance-sheet showing stocks in hand. </para>

                <para>Once more I have to complain about the way in -which Bills are presented to this House. It is not at all creditable to the Attorney-General's Department that a measure should be presented to the House in  6uch  a way -that it is left to a private member to discover that there is no provision in it for the publication of an annual report of the operations of such a Department as the War Service Homes Department. That is due to the slovenly way in -which practically all Bills are presented to this House. I hope that the new clause will be -carried. If there is one thing upon which there is an honest difference . of opinion in this House it is the utility, or otherwise, of these State enterprises. There are honorable members who honestly believe that the State should embark . on these enterprises, and there are others who just as honestly believe that experience up to the present has shown that State- enterprises are not successful in some directions. There are State saw-mills in Western Australia and in Queensland, and their operation has been such that the Auditors-General in those States have had to complain pretty severely that details and working accounts of those enterprises have not been presented to Parliament. We want to avoid that kind of thing. I personally very much desire to know whether State enterprises upon which we embark are successful or not. As the Bill was introduced it was unnecessary for the  War Service Homes Commissioner to present any report at all concerning the work of his Department. I think that the thanks of the Committee are due to the honorable member for  Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> for submitting this clause. In my view, there is nothing in the fear expressed that, if the particulars for which the honorable member asks are given, we shall show our hand to private competitors in similar lines of business. Is it intended that the sawmills controlled by this Department . shall be run as ordinary trading concern's, or are their operations to be confined to cutting timber for houses for returned soldiers <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If we were about to enter into open competition with private saw-mills, there might be something in the objections which have been urged against the clause. But the whole of the statements made in connexion with the purchase jf saw-milling plant by this Department have been to the effect that there has been a Combine which raised the price of timber unduly, and the Government have, in consequence, been forced to purchase certain saw-mills to cut timber for their own purposes. If that is really the reason why saw-mills have been purchased, I cannot see the slightest objection to the publication of the fullest details of their operation. It would be very much better for this House, the Minister for Repatriation, and the War Service Homes Commissioner that the whole of the details should be presented in a report to Parliament in the same way as private trading concerns, whatever they may do publicly, present a report covering such details to their shareholders. </para>

I wish to know what will be the result of this enterprise. I have seen the results of 'similar State enterprises in Queensland and Western Australia, and they have not been satisfactory. I think it will be found that in both States the prices at which the State saw-mills were cutting timber for the Commonwealth were quite as high as those charged by any privately owned saw-mills.- </para>

The system in operation in them would not be tolerated for twenty-four hours in. any decently conducted private enterprise. As a matter of fact, no private enterprise could conduct its operations in any such way. This House has a right to insist upon the fullest information on all these matters, and I therefore hope that the clause will be passed as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member who has submitted this clause has often complained of the lack of information supplied concerning the working of Government Departments, but in this new clause it appears to me that he goes to the other extreme. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> was not quite ingenuous in dealing with this matter. He led us to believe that he is only asking in this clause for what is already provided for under the Commonwealth Railways Act. </para>

                        <para>- I think honorable members are stressing this matter unduly. There are many operations in connexion with every Government Department that go on in this way, but because one transaction has been dragged into the daylight, and looks large - and I think it is a pity that Parliament was not consulted in regard to it, if that could have been done - do not imagine that every- other little transaction should be dragged before the -House. If all transactions were referred to the House, honorable members could do nothing with them. Hundreds of thousands of these operations  are carried on by the Government during the year, and no matter what the House may do, it can never control the details of these departmental transactions.. That must .be recognised by every honorable member who has had administrative experience. May I recall honorable members to a middle, moderate, and sweetly reasonable course? I dislike extremism on either side; and I desire to bring the extremist  chairman  of the Public Works Committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> back to a sane, moderate course. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the honorable member that we are restraining the Commissioner in every reasonable way. I quite agree that the utmost publicity should be given to all the operations of this Department; but there is no need for the House to require a statement of every detailed transaction that the Department does from  year's end to year's end. Honorable members should be reasonable. There is no trouble in the Repatriation Department or the -Commonwealth Railways branch. The 'Commissioner of Railways makes an annual report, setting forth all the operations, of the Department, and that is laid upon the table. The amendment asks that the Minister and the Commissioner shall give this detail and that detail, and dot this " i " and cross this "t." That is going to extremes. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> might very well accept the suggestion made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> because in its present form the clause will limit the nature of the report to a great extent. A legal axiom, as applied to. the Constitution, states that the more you define the more you limit. That is a truism that we all ought to accept. If honorable members will turn to the Budget papers they will see there a fairly detailed balance-sheet in connexion with the Commonwealth Shipping line, giving gross expenditure on the fleet, office, and general expenditure in London and Australia, interest on capital to date, amount written off for depreciation, and so on. The Minister has promised a balance-sheet of that description in relation to the operations of the saw-mills. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We have special parliamentary papers dealing with the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, Cordite Factory, Clothing Factory, and other  Government  activities. All these returns are certified to by the Auditor-General, and a similar return in connexion with War 'Service Homes activities ought to be sufficient. I support in principle the contention  of  the honorable member for Dampier, and think that honorable -members ought to 'be thankful to him for having brought this matter forward, because it was a serious lapse on the part of the framers of the measure in connexion with a big Department like the War Service Homes, for by the time we have finished building soldiers' homes the expenditure might be in the region of £60,000,000. This money will eventually be repaid, but, nevertheless, Parliament must not lose its grip on big financial operations of this kind. </para>

My reason for desiring the detailed information was that when the Commissioner purchased, these mills in Queensland he made certain definite statements about the profits that were going to accrue from the transaction. I want to be able to follow up this matter next year and the year after to see whether his statements were justified or not, and in order that honorable members themselves may be able to arrive at a definite conclusion. We can, if necessary,, obtain other detailed figures later by asking for returns in regard thereto. </para>
