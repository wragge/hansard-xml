                            <para>- Complaints have not been received from Victoria to anything like the extent that they are coming from New South Wales. I think there must have been a misinterpretation of the regulations governing payment under the new scale, because it is complained that married men are now receiving less than formerly, whereas the regulations provide that a married man who is not satisfied with his pay under the new scale may demand payment under the old scale. </para>

For instance, I should say that the employees will select some delegates, and the employers select others. I do not know what other interests there are, but the great public interest has always to be served. However, the whole matter will have to be carefully considered, and I suggest that the honorable member place his question on the notice-paper, so that I may be able to give him a considered reply. </para>

Are the Government prepared, so far as their employees are concerned, to allow a charge of this kind to rest, or will they at an early date consider the justice of giving these people a living wage? </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid I am not able to answer the question, because there is no definite information in the excerpt referred to, but only a general statement made by certain people in the community as to the dire effects of the present condition of things. I am afraid that there have been complaints of the kind from the beginning of time; it is, indeed, the problem of the ages, and a continuous one, as to how to so arrange and adjust our human affairs that no one shall be in want. Any man who can make a contribution to the solution of that problem is under obligation to do so. May I add that I have seen many strange statements made before the tribunal of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> is  president.  The other day, for instance, I saw that a workman had. declared that he could not live properly without silk socks. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to make clear that, in bringing under the notice of honorable members the establishment of a branch of the "War Service Homes Department in South Australia, I am not doing so "with any idea of opposing the building of homes for soldiers, but because I believe that the inauguration of the Federal Department in Adelaide will lead to a waste of public money, and will make it more difficult for soldiers to secure homes for themselves. I realize, of course, that if action is to be taken it must be taken very early, for the reason that already applications have been called for the filling of quite a number of positions; and honorable members know full well that from the moment when an individual has been, appointed to a Government position, and he has dipped his pen in departmental ink, nothing under the sun will ever shift him. We have in South Australia a system, to which I shall presently refer, for the building of soldiers' homes; but I desire first to direct attention to what is proposed to be done by the Federal authorities. The Commonwealth Government, obviously recognising that in South Australia there was already in operation a system for the construction of houses for soldiers, appointed. Captain Bell, of theRepatriation Department, as  Deputy  Commissioner. At first,. I considered that that was a very good and economical arrangement. Working, as it did, in conjunction with the State Bank, it entailed very little, if any, increased expenditure to the Commonwealth. Later, however,  Colonel Baker,  who had been originally  Deputy  Commissioner, was appointed to represent the architects, Messrs. Kirkpatrick Brothers. This arrangement, however, continued for only a brief period. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duckmartin</inline> was sent over to represent the architects, and he has since been replaced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Milne,</inline> an Adelaide architect, to represent Messrs Kirkpatrick. The very latest situation is that a Captain Earle has been appointed  Deputy  Commissioner. Following his establishment in office, and having taken premises in Franklin-street, the  Deputy  Commissioner invited applications for the filling of a number of minor positions. Honorable members will perceive, by the following list, that it is intended to establish a Department of considerable strength :  - </para>

                        <para class="block">
                            <graphic href="092331192005065_3_0.jpg" />
                        </para>
                        <para class="block">The list does not include the salary of the Deputy Commissioner or touch on the outlay upon rent. It is fair to suggest that the Department will cost more than £7,000 per annum; and we know that when 'it has been established it will extend its scope and influence from this comparatively small beginning. I would raise no objection, in fact, it would  bo my duty to assist and support the project, but that there is already in existence' in South Australia a Department which is efficiently and satisfactorily meeting requirements. The South Australian Government, in 1916, passed an Act for the building of soldiers' homes, and since that period they have been carrying on with remarkably few complaints; generally, indeed, the Department has given very great satisfaction. Since the inception of this activity the State Bank has built and bought, and paid off mortgages upon houses, representing a total of 3,574 dwellings. In addition, there are about 600 houses in the course of construction, and their total approximate cost is £381,060. The average cost of each house built in South Australia has been £577 10s. lid.; that includes cost of land. The material in every instance is brick and stone. I invite honorable members to inspect photographs of some of the homes, which are on view in the Queen's Hall. They will note that the dwellings are of four and five, and, in some instances, more, rooms; and that they vary in appearance, all of them being modestly attractive. The lowest wall of any of the houses yet built measures, from floor to ceiling, 10 feet. The total amount spent by the State Government in building, to date, represents £2,064,139. The Act provides that the sum of £700 can be expended in the buying of land and the building of a soldier's home. Honorable members will agree, I am sure, that the price compares more than favorably with that for similar work, carried out in any other part of the Commonwealth. The South Australian Government have also very wisely purchased large areas of land, which have been specially town-planned, as the basis of future garden cities. These localities before very long will' rank among the finest assets which any State could possess. The areas are laid out with ample recreation reserves, and the streets are already planted with trees. The houses in the town-planned areas will cost only a little more than £500 each. </para>

                                <para>- No ; the State is raising the money from its own resources. The advances are made for a term not exceeding fifty years and carry interest at the rate of 4£ per cent, per annum. Those are a great deal better terms than the Commonwealth authorities are offering. In addition, the State Government provide that soldiers' homes shall be free of all rates and taxes, including water rates, for the 'first period of five years. Assistance of that nature, it must be admitted, amounts to a very considerable allowance. </para>

                        <para class="block">South Australia ought to be very proud Ot those terms, and the system ought not to be jeopardized by the establishment of a competing Department by another Government; because the moment the Commonwealth establishes a Department in South Australia for the building of homes for soldiers, it is only natural the officers of that Department will push matters for all they are worth to justify themselves, which means that they will be out to buy land and secure contracts for the building of houses. Thus they will considerably increase the cost of land and building material, thereby creating difficulty for the State in carrying out its work. The establishment of a Commonwealth Department for the building of soldiers' homes in South Australia will have a bad effect on the soldiers. </para>

                                <para>- No ; I intend to explain it further. The Commonwealth Act extends its advantages to classes of men not embraced by the South Australian Act. The latter is restricted to men in receipt of a salary of not more than £300 a year. And the Commonwealth will build houses for practically any returned soldier. </para>

                                <para>- I admit that it is an improvement on the South Australian Act. The Commonwealth Act also includes munition workers. However, the State Government, through their efficient Department, which has been established for twenty years, are prepared to administer that portion of the Commonwealth Act which makes provision for the classes of persons not covered by the State Act. There is no justification for creating a new Department simply to cover the classes of persons not covered by the South Australian legislation. It ought to be possible for the Commonwealth to act in cooperation with the State Governments, and, if necessary, appoint one officer to act conjointly with the State Bank in order to carry out the work of building houses for munition workers and others and soldiers in receipt of a bigger income than £300 a year. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member's interjection raises another issue. On an appeal to the electors, both the South Australian Government then in power and the Opposition pledged themselves that if they were returned to power t hey would establish a system of home building, and the Government, which was returned to power, carried out its pledge, and now feels it an obligation to carry on the work which it undertook. In any case, if the State Act were repealed, and the whole of the activities of building soldiers'  home3  were handed over to the Commonwealth, the soldier who builds in the future in South Australia will be placed at a disadvantage as compared with one whose house has already been built by the State Government. In South Australia we have already felt the competition of the Commonwealth. Contractors are beginning to withdraw their contracts ; in fact, one contract has already been withdrawn because the claim is made that since the Commonwealth have come into the business, the cost of bricks and material and so forth, has increased beyond the prices on which their tender was originally based. One contract now under consideration deals with the building of 1,000 houses. The contractors are now finding out that they cannot carry on their contracts at the present prices. </para>

                                <para>- The State legislation authorizing the resumption of land for public utilities does not cover the acquisition of blocks for soldiers' homes,  but the State Government purchase the land in the ordinary way, and find no difficulty in getting plenty of it at reasonable prices. If a soldier wishes to build a house in a particular locality, such as Park Terrace, Unley, where land is considerably higher in value than elsewhere, the State Bank will assist him in effecting the purchase if he is prepared to put down a little of his own money. The State Government do not insist on all the soldiers living in these garden cities they are building; they are prepared to build elsewhere, wherever a man thinks it advantageous for him to live. I do not submit this matter as a carping critic. If the Minister doubts what I say, I ask him to send a reliable officer to South Australia to make an investigation; and, if as the result of that visit the officer is satisfied with the manner in which the State are undertaking this work, then let us have common-sense co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the State iu this regard, and avoid the expense of building up a new Department. I am sure that if these inquires are made, the Minister will find that it will be beneficial to the soldier and the taxpayer alike not to create a new Department in South Australia for the building of soldiers' homes. I submit this matter to-day because it is urgent that it should be dealt with before applications for the advertised positions close. Otherwise, these officers will be appointed, and there will be great difficulty in getting them out of their positions. I hope that the House will give the matter the serious consideration it deserves, in the interests of the soldiers; and I confidently appeal to my honorable friends in the Economy corner. </para>

                                <para>- No. Some of the States are not undertaking the work of building soldiers' homes. If the Commonwealth is doing this work in New SoUth Wales and Victoria, there is no need for the States to step in, but where the States are already doing it, the Commonwealth should not interfere. Where, however, the States are not building these houses, let the Commonwealth do so. </para>

                            <para>. -  I wish to supplement the remarks of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> by making a comparison between the styles of houses built in South Australia and those built in Victoria. I have inspected many of the latter, and if the Minister for Repatriation will send to Adelaide a competent expert from his Department, I shall be guided by his decision as to whether the State authorities there are. not making a better job than is being made in the other States. The State Bank in South Australia is operating on eighteen different designs of houses. I have here a sample plan which shows one large bedroom  15  feet  6  inches by  12  feet, a second bedroom  12  feet by  11  feet, a drawingroom  13  feet by  12  feet, a dining-room  15  feet by  14  feet, a kitchen  12  feet by  11  feet  6  inches, and a bathroom, laundry, and conveniences. I ask honorable members to compare the sizes of those rooms with the sizes of the rooms in the houses we inspected in Victoria a few days ago. In every one of the South Australian houses, there is a clear height of  10*  feet from floor to ceiling in each room. I believe that the height in Victoria was  9  feet, but it is being raised to  10  feet. The South Australian blocks of land would average at least one-third larger than the blocks on which the houses in Victoria have been built. </para>

                                <para>- Neither is there any comparison between the prices of the land, nor the solidity of the houses erected in the two cities. I call the attention of honorable members to  photographs showing the finished work that has been put into the houses in Adelaide. Of the houses which have been provided, half have been constructed and the others have been purchased. I call attention to the fact that as soon as the Commonwealth Bank's officers stepped into the business of buying houses the value of similar houses rose within a week nearly £100 each, and as the honorable member for Adelaide said, the presence of two big competing parties for buildings led to an increase in every item of building material. The State Bank, as the agent of the South Australian Government, was engaged for eight or nine years prior to entering upon this work for soldiers in building houses for civilians. So that its officers have had a great deal of experience of housebuilding. During those eight years, and also during the last three or four years, since they have been building soldiers' cottages, they have employed continuously a number of small contractors. From the beginning the Department weeded out any contractors who showed a tendency towards "jerry" building, and only kept those in whom it had the utmost confidence - men who could be left to complete a house from foundation to roof, with absolute confidence on the part of the authorities that no bad work would be put into it. That is the reason why the State Bank has been able to erect these houses at an average cost of £577 10s. lid each. There is no comparison between that cost and the cost of houses built in other States. </para>

                                <para>- My policy is to do one thing well at a time, instead of starting impossible things. The charge of half per cent, for supervision covers everything. There are no architect's fees, neither are there any agreements, registrations or anything else to be paid for. I appeal to my honorable friends on the Public Works Committee to say whether a charge of half per cent, for the supervision of such work is not a very small one. </para>

                        <para>I wish now to make a few observations in commendation of the attitude of the State Government. It undertook this work in fulfilment of a pledge made long before the Commonwealth scheme was suggested', and, in accordance with that pledge, ' it charges interest on deferred payments at the rate of only 4$ per cent, per annum, which ds considerably less than what it has to pay for its money. If this competition between the Commonwealth and the State is to go on, with the result that prices of building material continue to go up, the State Government will not be able to continue the work. It is a question whether the Commonwealth should not find the money for the State Government of South Australia just as it is findings the money for the erection of war service homes in the other' States; but on this point of overlapping and competition \ am satisfied that I  shall  not appeal in vain to the opinion of the House. I ask honorable members to examine the photographs of buildings  erected by the South Australian Government and to carefully consider the whole question. I have only to say in conclusion that I feel fairly confident that the Minister for Repatriation does not desire to continue this unjustifiable competition. </para>

                            <para>. -  I am rather glad that the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> has brought forward this question, since the position of the Department will stand the test of investigation. I shall deal first of all with the comparison which the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard' Foster)</inline> made of the cost of war service homes here and of those built in Adelaide by the State. He touched the spot, although he did not seem to realize it, when he said that the price of land ' in the suburbs of Adelaide is much cheaper than in the metropolis of Melbourne. I think there is a difference of about £100 between the cost of the war service homes built in Melbourne and those erected in Adelaide, and it will be found that the higher cost of land in this State fairly well accounts for the difference. </para>

                        <para>There is a good deal to be said in favour of the building scheme which is carried on by the State Bank of South Australia. The scheme, however, was never intended to apply to the building of soldiers' homes. It was originated some years ago to provide for the erection of homes for workmen who were not in receipt of more than £300 per annum. Under that scheme a deposit of something like 40 per cent, is required, and the authorizing Act fixes the rate of interest at 4£ per cent. </para>

                                <para>- At all events, .some time ago it was suggested to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that the Commonwealth should finance the State Bank of South Australia in the building of homes for returned soldiers, since it had undertaken rather more than it could carry out in connexion with the State housing scheme.  His  reply was that he could not, having regard to the limitations imposed by the State Act. For instance, we erect homes for soldiers, soldiers' dependants, sailors, and nurses, as well as for munition workers and war workers. </para>

                            <para>.- The House is indebted to the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> for having in a very temperate manner brought this matter before it. He has a first-hand knowledge of the facts, being the Minister responsible for the South Australian legislation. My only concern in this matter is in preventing duality of control. Apparently in this case, as in so many others, immediately the Commonwealth takes a step forward it treads on the heels of the States, the State and Commonwealth authorities trying to do the same work. On a previous occasion, in connexion with the pensions, I made a firm protest, and took what action I could to prevent the establishment of two Departments, and I again tell the Minister that whenever it is possible , to prevent the duplication and overlapping of Commonwealth and State Departments, I shall consistently' try to prevent it. I can see ahead of us a thundering debt, which will be piled up as the result of huge programmes for naval construction and other defence work, and' unless the governing authorities of Australia set to work to define their respective domains, and keep within those domains, the financial drift will be hopeless. It behoves every member of the House to take a definite stand against duplication of effort. In my opinion, the Commonwealth, had it conferred with the States at the inception of the war service homes scheme, could have come to an arrangement with them which would have satisfied both parties. Recently I travelled with the Western Australian Minister responsible for the building of homes. He thought that he had concluded an arrangement with the Minister for Repatriation, but shortly afterwards he got a message calling it off. The Commonwealth Bank is going to carry out in Western Australia tie construction work which it sanctions. Thus there will be two separate building authorities, two staffs competing for the limited amount of building material available. </para>

It is woeful that, after so many protests in this chamber, this lack of business cooperation should continue. I shall not vote for a duplication of effort by the Commonwealth where work is being carried out effectively by a State. </para>

                                <para>- That would be to go to an even greater absurdity. I have  seen  so much of Commonwealth administration that I would be sorry for a distant State that had to intrust all its interests to this Parliament. In Western Australia a Department was formed many years ago for the construction of workmen's homes. I have never been in favour of either the Commonwealth or a State carrying out work of that kind on the day-labour system. But the establishment of the Western Australian Department has had the good effect of keeping contractors from putting their heads together. Where you axe not tied down to one system without competition, .you get good results. I believe that in South Australia they had a similar Department. In the West there are architects, clerks of works, and the full staffs necessary for the carrying out of building operations. When the war service homes scheme was agreed upon, the Commonwealth put a staff of its own into Western Australia. It is necessary to have a Deputy Controller in each State to administer the affairs of the War Service Homes Department, but I see no reason why negotiations for the carrying out of building operations should not have been concluded with the States. The Western Australian Department is at present building workers' homes, and could construct war service homes. Now, the Deputy Controller of the Commonwealth Department is building houses for soldiers in certain parts of the State, and the Commonwealth Bank employs another staff doing similar work. I went round with the Deputy Controller, and saw some very fine work that has been done by his Department. I was quite satisfied with the. work that he showed me; but when at Geraldton I was informed that at  Mullawa  an application for a soldier's home had been approved, but nothing was done for five or six months, and then, suddenly word came from the Commonwealth Bank that the whole matter was to remain in abeyance for some time longer. Then, at Geraldton, the Commonwealth Bank purchased land on which a war service home was to be erected, but a few weeks prior to the date arranged for the marriage of the young fellow who was to occupy it, word came from the Bank that the work was not to be proceeded with for some time. When I returned to Perth, I got the Deputy Controller to take the matter in hand, and to give a decision regarding it. When the Repatriation Departmenttakes work out of the hands of the State, those in the cities may be well catered for, but the requirements of those in the country cannot be met, because the Commonwealth Department has not a staff to do country work, whereas the State Departments have officers in different districts, and are able to carry out work anywhere without undue delay. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The  Deputy  Controller has no officials in the country, and, therefore, applications for war service homes coming from soldiers in the country are inordinately delayed. I do not think that the Government should put up houses in out-of-the-way places, where, if they were left untenanted by the soldiers for whom they were built, they would be of no value at all; but in districts having a recognised settled future, the Department should erect houses without delay, and the Government should be more ready to give assistance to persons living in the country than to persons living in the cities, so as to prevent the drifting of population to the cities. I do not say that the big city constructions should not go on, but the other work is, to my mind, of more importance. The duplication of effort by  the Commonwealth Bank and the Deputy Controller should be stopped. We do not want the Commonwealth Bank to send officials to Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth Bank, having satisfied itself as to the security for any advance, should allow the work to be carried out by the War Service Homes Department, instead of using officers of its own. I hope .that in the future there will not be the delays in the building of war service homes that there have been in the past. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that the Government will not agree to the suggestion of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell).</inline> In common . with other honorable members, I would, if I could, abolish duality of effort. There are many reasons why the Commonwealth should not hand this work over to the States. The Department in South Australia was brought into existence for the specific purpose of providing homes for workers with a- certain wage; and I have information to the effect that this Department has not proceeded with the work at anything like the speed expected. Whether that was because there is an unsympathetic Government in power I do not know, but they have done very little in the matter of workmen's homes. We are told that if there are two authoritative bodies seeking building material, it will have the effect of raising prices; but even if the States do the work, the volume of demand on their part will have the same effect. It is a fact that in South Australia now there is a greater scarcity of building material than in any other State; and, as I say, it does not matter how many Departments undertake this work, the volume of the demand will create difficulty. I am strongly of opinion that the Commonwealth should undertake this work. Of course, I regret that there should be any duplication, but if we make this special arrangement in the case of South Australia we shall have the other States, perhaps, asking for variations. The Government made a. great mistake in introducing the Commonwealth Bank into this business, for the Bank, when it had control of the finances, bungled matters. I undertake to say that a house, constructed under the supervision of the Commonwealth Bank will cost 10 or 20 per cent, more than a house built by another authority.. Under the circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank should be withdrawn from this work in every State; and I wonder that this has not been done before. We  did have &amp; hint that it would be done. </para>

It  seems that one Department dislikes doing work for another, and, if the work is done, it is at an increased cost.  I  do  not  say  it  is impossible for the Director of the  War  Service  Homes to  make arrangements in  South  Australia, for example, but  I  do not believe that such arrangements would give such satisfaction as  would  control by the Government. </para>
                        <para>I  have heard much of what has been done in Victoria in regard to war service homes, and  certainly  the work has been much better than anything  that  could have been done by  the States. The  building of these homes has caused an extra demand for material, but if  they  were not being built, other houses would have to be provided by the people.  If  other  States  follow  the  example of  South  Australia, we shall find  the  war service homes being erected  under  five  or  six different systems.  I  agree with  the  suggestion that a conference should be held, for it is quite possible that the outcome might be beneficial, though  I  have my doubts.  My  advice is that the work be handed over to the  State,  but that the conditions shall be set down in black and white to insure that the Commonwealth shall not be used as a "milch cow." </para>

                            <para>. - In  October last, in my place in the  House, I  registered my strongest protest against the triplication of work in connexion with the war service homes.  First,  there were the  StateSavings Banks,  which had experience and  all  the necessary machinery for the work; next, there was the sub-Department established  in  the Expatriation Department itself; and, thirdly, there was the Commonwealth  Bank,  which created a war service homes branch.  I  protested against the extravagance involved, and for reasons which  I  then stated.  In 1918,  when the  War  Service Homes  Bill  was before us, there was, with much approval, inserted section   50, by  which the Minister was specially  Authorized to  make arrangements with the several  State  Savings  Banks  for the purposes  of  the  Act. The  Minister  in  charge  of  the  Bill  commended the splendid work done  by  these banks  in  the matter  of  workmen's homes and so forth, and indicated that  it  was his intention  to  negotiate with them with the object  of  their undertaking the work; indeed,  he  said he was already in negotiation with them. Those negotiations were consummated in the following June, and, as a result, the State Parliaments passed Acts enabling the State Savings Banks to undertake this work. In Victoria - and I presume in the other States - the State Treasurer introduced the necessary measure, and indicated what had been definitely settled between the State and the Commonwealth. For some extraordinary reason, however, the Repatriation Department took up the position that they could not carry out the agreement; and it is believed that this was because of the determined pressure of the Commonwealth Bank. The business of the State Savings Banks had been entered upon by the Commonwealth Bank, and the latter viewed with a degree of dismay the undertaking of this work by the State institutions. The Minister,for some reason, yielded to the representations of the Commonwealth Bank, which immediately created a war service homes branch. The Savings Banks of the States were carrying out this class of work at an administration cost of  10s.  per cent.; nevertheless, the Commonwealth Bank took up the work. </para>

Colonel Walker was appointed Commissioner, and he was duly provided with a staff of architects and other officers; but they had not been very long at work when much friction and irritation arose between the Commonwealth Bank and the subDepartment. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think so; and it is not likely to be settled. It is the clear duty of the Government to insist that the Commonwealth Bank shall withdraw from all participation in the matter of the war service homes. The Bank ought to stick to its own business, and, certainly, war service homes do not come within its purview. </para>

                                <para>- I have not heard of any public explanation, and the incident is a very regrettable one. I do not wish to indulge in an attack upon the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline> I realize the magnificent work which he has performed ; but whatever may have been the motive which forced him from his original attitude, and permitted the Government to consent to this flagrantly extravagant arrangement, resulting in triplication of work, I urge that, even at this late hour, the Commonwealth Bank be called upon to cease its operations in this direction. Its activities have aroused an infinite number of complaints on the part of soldiers themselves. I have received no end of letters complaining of delays of a most unconscionable character, respecting the operations of the Bank. Occasionally I have forwarded these letters to the War Service Homes Commissioner, asking for a reason for such delays. All he has been able to say is, "I have no control ; I refer you to the Commonwealth Bank." It is a disgraceful state of affairs. In connexion with the work of the Commonwealth Bank, in having undertaken duties which it did not understand, and for which it was never equipped, it prepared and issued certain plans and specifications in regard to the homes it proposed erecting, and these were condemned in no measured terms by the Institute of Architects in Sydney. The whole trouble has arisen because the Commonwealth Bank has insisted upon undertaking duties which it had no right to handle. I congratulate the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> upon having brought the subject before the House, and I .congratulate him - as representing the South Australian Government originally concerned - upon the work so splendidly achieved in that State. It is an object lesson, which speaks for itself ; and it indicates the wisdom of the previous views of the Minister for Repatriation when he stated that the State machinery was. the proper machinery, of which the Commonwealth should avail itself for the purpose of constructing soldiers' homes. Economy and efficiency would be best consulted along those lines. Here we have a magnificent example, and a verification of the ideas voiced by myself, as well as by a number of other honorable members, when the section of the Act concerned was originally under discussion. We then commended the intentions of the Minister for Repatriation, and I now urge that he should see his way clear to insist that the Commonwealth Bank have nothing further to do with the construction of homes, and that, in the interests of reducing expenditure, he will permit the States to carry on. Of course, there must be some degree of supervision on the part of the Repatriation Department respecting the work done by the States, but that is a matter for easy and ready adjustment. Only a mere skeleton staff need be kept by the Commonwealth Department for supervision purposes. If the Commonwealth had availed itself of the State institutions from the beginning, in regard to the construction of . soldiers' homes, the work would have been carried on most actively, effectively, and economically. </para>

                            <para>.- One of the causes for all this trouble, I dare say, is that the Commonwealth Bank, having started a Savings Bank branch, is out to do certain work along the lines of the State Savings Banks, in the matter of the Credit Foncier system. I do not know whether the functions of the Commonwealth Bank are to be enlarged by pending legislation, "but some arrangement between Commonwealth and State Savings Bank institutions would be welcome, whereby considerable duplication might be ended. The Commonwealth Bank has engaged a firm of architects, which is to get so much for house designs submitted, and a percentage for supervision of building. It is a very pushing firm, working in association with a pushing institution, namely, the Commonwealth Bank. I have been wondering whether the architects have not pushed the Repatriation Department into fields of activity in which their services were not called for. </para>

If these architects have the drawing up of very many specifications for a considerable number of houses in South Australia, it will be merely and naturally adding to the income derived by them by way of commission. </para>

                                <para>- That is news to me. I take it that the Commonwealth authorities have the right to resume land. In this connexion, I desire to cite an individual case. A working man had purchased a block of land within a suburb in my constituency. He was about to build, when the Commonwealth authorities - I presume, the Repatriation Department - commandeered that block. They notified the owner that they intended to make use of it for a soldier's home. He had no grave objection to offer to that, of course, but was compelled to wait for months, and even after going to considerable trouble he could secure no information with respect to the intentions of the authorities. In exasperation at last, he said, " If you are going to take my block, please take it quickly, and pay me at once, because I want to buy another block in the same neighbourhood on which to build, and meanwhile the price is going up." He has at last been offered the price which he originally paid for his block, and he finds himself faced, with the position that if he requires to purchase in the same locality he must pay considerably more. Why should he be penalized because of the long delay of a Federal Department ? </para>

                                <para>- I think it will be found that the architects, in conjunction with the Bank, are pushing matters with regard to soldiers' homes, and are coming into competition with the State Savings Banks. I can testify to he magnificent work undertaken by the latter authorities. With regard to the triplication of activities, as disclosed' by the motion, I can only say that it is cruelly unfair to taxpayers, and is penalizing returned soldiers themselves. Let the best authority carry out the work in the best interests of the soldiers and the community. </para>

                    <para class="block">The principal portion of the motion is paragraph 6, which shows a way of financing the homes we ought to give to the dependants of our soldiers without any ultimate cost to the Government or possible chance of loss. The example set in the early part of last century by the people of Guernsey Island by the issue of currency notes for the building of their market is known all over the world to-day. At the time they wanted a new market it was very much more difficult to borrow money in the Home market than it is to-day; but fortunately for the Guernsey islanders they had a very clever man among them holding a position corresponding to the present-day Governorship. He asked the islanders if they had any bricklayers, stonemasons, and carpenters among them, and when they replied that they had, he said to them, " Why do you not build the market yourselves?" The thought planted by that able gentleman soon bore fruit. The body which corresponds to our modern municipality called a meeting of the citizens, and they agreed to accept currency notes for the work they put into the building. About 4,000 or 5,000 of these notes were issued in this way, and immediately the market was completed on land which the community owned, the people made a holiday, and all the street merchants were compelled to leave the crowded thoroughfares of St. Helens and occupy stalls in the market. Once a year as many of the currency notes as had been received in the shape of rents from the stalls, as well as any contributed by the municipality - using the modern term for the sake of convenience - were publicly burned, and in ten years' time the whole of the notes had been burned, and the market was the community's own rent-producing property for all time. 1 ask leave to continue my remarks on some future occasion. </para>

                        <para>. - I  shall occupy the attention of honorable members for only a few minutes in dealing with the amendments which I submitted when this question was last before the House. The urgent necessity for a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution has been stressed by previous speakers, who have pointed out that it is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth should have control over all Australian trade, commerce, and industry. In the House yesterday questions were asked in reference to the forty-two cases which are at present listed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the probability is that if the Commonwealth Parliament had had absolute power to legislate with respect to industrial matters we should not have had anything like that number of cases awaiting the attention of the Court. As I said last week, the States are carrying on in a very selfish manner. Each State practically is working wholly and solely for its own interests, and this is undoubtedly to the detriment of the rest of Australia. I am convinced that after going into the question thoroughly the proposed Convention will recommend the division of the States into smaller provinces, which would undoubtedly do away with a lot of State jealousies that at present exist. It would enable us also to overcome to a certain extent the difficulties of centralization. Each province would be made responsible for the administration of its own domestic affairs. The provincial councils, as the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> mentioned, would be given power to construct narrow gauge railway lines within their own boundaries, but if their finances permitted, they would no doubt have broad gauge lines. An amendment of the Constitution which would give the Commonwealth Parliament full control over railways would rid Australia of the break of gauge difficulty, which is one of its greatest curses. If the Commonwealth Government had complete power over the railways, I am convinced that one of the first steps taken by it would be to remedy that evil. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The recommendations of the Convention will have to be ratified by the people of Australia, and we can only hope to secure for those recommendations the indorsement of the electors by educating public opinion as to the reasons for them and their urgent necessity. The first of my amendments, if carried, will bring this proposal into the region of direct legislative action, and will greatly facilitate the calling of the Convention. T move the omission of the words " of section 51 " in clause 1, because I think we are all agreed that the Constitution generally requires to be amended. It is useless to attempt a patchwork amendment, and we can hope to have a practical amendment only after the Constitution as a» whole has been considered by the Convention, and recommendations have been made by it. If my second amendment be carried, the motion will provide that the Convention shall consist of an equal number, of representatives of each State. I make this proposal because I do not think it desirable to tie down the Government to any particular, number of representatives for each State, I have purposely proposed to omit the words in the original motion which provide that the members of the Convention shall be elected " according to the principle of proportional representation," since their retention would look like an attempt to induce the Government to recognise the principle of proportional representation, which has not yet been thoroughly debated. When I mentioned this matter on a previous occasion the, honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> inquired why I proposed to omit those words, and I referred him to the fact that, as the result of the recent election, according to a letter written  by him, 13,568 electors in my own division were not represented. The third amendment which I propose will not be necessary if my first amendment be carried. The urgent necessity for an alteration of the Constitution, so as to give the Commonwealth power to deal with Trusts, combines, railway communications, and the nationalization of monopolies, has been recognised in previous attempts to secure the approval of the people for an amendment of the Constitution. While we have dual control in each State, the position of affairs must remain unsatisfactory. We are hopeful that by an 'amendment of the Constitution, which will give the Commonwealth full power to deal with all national questions, leaving only matters of domestic concern within the jurisdiction of the State Parliaments or provincial councils, we shall aid in the development of Australia, and be able to overcome our social and industrial unrest. </para>

                        <para>. - In seconding the amendment, I desire to congratulate the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kerby)</inline> on his action in moving along the lines he has indicated. The temper of the House, I believe, is distinctly in favour of the summoning of a Convention as quickly as possible. Bub it is one thing to agree to' a general principle, and quite another to1 agree to a motion laying down a number of conditions as to the way in which the Convention shall be constituted, the number of representatives of each State, and the method of their election. That, it appears to me, is quite uncalled for at the present stage. The Government, in the Speech of  His Excellency  the Gove norge neral, at the opening of the Parliament, intimated that they intend to introduce legislation that will provide for the summoning of a Convention to devise ways and means of amending the Australian Constitution, and of bringing it more up to date, in the light of our twenty years' experience of its operation. That being so, if we simply affirm the general principle, and, in the terms of the amendment, express our opinion that legislative provision should be made for the summoning of this Convention, it will be a sufficient indication to the Government of the temper and the desire of the House. Proposals for amendments of the Constitution have been considered by this Parliament on a number of occasions. We have had almost innumerable opportunities of dis cussing the question again and again. Several Governments have tried to secure for this Parliament greater freedom of legislative action. They have endeavoured to obtain from the people of Australia authority to legislate along certain definite lines, but, so far, all such attempts have been unsuccessful. Only recently an appeal was made, but without success, to the electors to grant to this Parliament power to deal with the high cost of living. We are all individually feeling the pinch. The purchasing power of the sovereign is not nearly what it was a few years ago, and men and women receiving low rates of pay must have a very difficult task in making ends meet. I hope the Government will, at an early date, grant to' the House an opportunity to discuss the creation of a Convention, and I hope that we shall all bear in mind that the question of the steadily increasing cost of living is pressing more heavily on the community than any other subject. The increase is due, as we know, to different causes, and I hope the people will recognise that the Parliament should not be hamstrung, but should have ample power to deal with that particularly distressful phase of our social life. </para>

                    <para>During this debate, the desirableness of having a number of small States or provinces has been urged, and valuable contributions to that phase of the subject have been made by the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and the honorable ' member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who have both given a great deal of attention to this evolutionary feature of the life of the Commonwealth. There are at present Statesthat are unwieldy in so far as administrative control is concerned. Although in the matter of population they are not very big, yet from the territorial standpoint, they are too large to be conveniently controlled from any one centre. It would be advantageous to the Commonwealth, as a whole, if the division of some of the States into smaller areas were taken in hand. We should forget for the time being the old boundaries that exist, particularly as between New South Wales and Victoria. I have also in mind the north-west 'portion of this continent. We have there a very large territory rich in minerals, and rich from a pastoral point of view, which could be converted into a veritable mine of wealth for the whole community, if an opportunity for  its development were given, and there were greater concentration on the work of developing it. The small handful of people in Western Australia - the population of that State is only some 320,000 - has something like one-third of the continent of Australia under its guidance and control. We cannot expect a small population to finance the various undertakings necessary for the development of such a huge territory; but where there is natural wealth in the form of minerals and vast pastoral resources, action to exploit it should be taken on a broader line than has hitherto been followed. I believe that if a new State or province were created - I do not mind what name is adopted - that would lead to marked development. I do not say that the whole of the expense of that development should be borne by the taxpayers of Australia generally. Having been for some years in this Parliament, I know how many pressing problems face honorable members ; and I do not forget that other parts of Australia besides that to which I am referring are calling for development. Undoubtedly, however, the creation of a new State or province in the north-west of Australia would have a beneficial effect upon the development of that part of the continent. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the need for the unification of our railway gauges. This is a matter that has been the subject of various conferences of Railways Commissioners. Many estimates have been made of the cost of giving the railway systems of Australia a uniform gauge. It was estimated some years ago that the cost would be £8,000,000; but since then our railway mileage has increased so greatly that now it would probably be from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000. </para>

The question bristles with difficulties, and cannot be disposed of in a few sentences. </para><para>I wish fro say a word or two in support of the amendment. I am convinced that the alteration proposed in clause 1, asking that legislative provision be made for the summoning of a Convention, is sufficient indication to the Government of our desire to hurry forward the consideration of constitutional reform. Further, if we limited the scope of the Convention's review to section' 51 of our Constitution, we should be making a mistake. That section enumerates the powers that have been transferred to the Commonwealth, and upon it our legislative work is based. Bub an alteration of it might require an alteration of other parts of the Constitution, which could, not be considered by the Convention unless the motion were altered as proposed by the honorable member for Ballarat. As a representative of one of the less populous States, I am a supporter of equal State representation, and I am glad that the mover of the motion <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> who comes from the most populous State, has provided for its retention. If we limit the number to five or ten representatives, or to fifteen or twenty, in a motion of this kind, we shall be acting unwisely.

There are honorable members who feel very keenly in regard to proportional representation, for and against. The question has been debated at different periods here within my own knowledge, and many determined efforts have been made to introduce the principle in various ways. For us, at this particular moment, to accept the principle as applied to the election of a Convention, without any really satisfactory statement as to how and to what sections of the community it is proposed to extend it, would be very ill advised. I do not wish honorable members to misunderstand me. It may be necessary to grant to various sections of the community representation, but if my memory serves me rightly - although it is weeks since the motion was submitted - the mover did not give us any very clearcut ideas as to which sections of the community were to be granted proportional representation. After all, the main purpose of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> is to secure an expression of opinion from this House in regard to the calling of a Convention. He desires a Convention called as quickly as possible, and we should leave details for the consideration of Parliament when we have before us the proposals of the Government. Honorable members will then have an opportunity to make their presence felt, and to remove any clauses they may deem objectionable. 1 have no fault to find with the proposal for a Convention, but when honorable members weigh the matter carefully, I think they will 'agree that, if we affirm the principle of a Convention, and leave the details for consideration when there is a Bill before us, we shall amply meet all requirements. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I am opposed to the motion and to the amendment, and I intend to indicate a further amendment before I sit down. I am opposed absolutely to the delegation of any of the powers of this Parliament to an outside body. The Convention may be, or may not be, composed of people from outside this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- People outside this Parliament, who will be seeking election to this Convention, know less of the shortcomings of the Constitution than do those of us who have been members of the Parliament from the beginning, of for a considerable time, and have had to legislate under those short-comings. On a number of occasions this Parliament has tried to pass measures of national moment, and has found its efforts futile because of lack of power. We are all familiar with the fact that the High Court has at times ruled that we have not the power which those who framed the Constitution at the beginning firmly believed they were giving to the Parliament. Who should be more fitted to amend the Constitution, or frame a new Constitution, than those who are not familiar with those failures ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member speaks for his own electorate, and no doubt he is quite satisfied that they are good judges. However, as I say, I emphatically protest against the delegation of the powers and privileges of this Parliament to any outside body, and I regard the proposal as somewhat in the nature of a want-of-confidence motion in ourselves. A question of this kind should be taken up and boldly grappled with by Parliament itself. </para>

                            <para>- I have such implicit confidence in the people's judgment that I am not going to tell them, as the motion does, that we think they have done wrong in choosing the members who are in Parliament at the present time. The people deliberately elect Parliament from time to time, and I am not one to say that we are not capable of doing the work we were sent to do. The Constitution itself shows the way by which the people can be appealed to on a referendum if it is desired to amend the Constitution, and I cannot see why there should be a Convention to do what we have absolute power to do as the Constitution now stands. There were referenda in 1911 and 1913, and if the proposed amendments had been secured then they would have gone a long way - practically the whole way - to make the Federal Parliament supreme. </para>

                    <para>It would be going over old ground to deal with all the limitations in our Constitution ; but if we look at some of them it is almost unthinkable or unbelievable that the people could so long suffer under them,; they are a reflection on those who tolerate them. The working people of the country are very largely blamed for the industrial unrest and the strikes which take place, but at present, so long as an industrial dispute is confined within the limits of one State, there is no Federal power to interfere.. That is a situation which no sensible people should tolerate. A dispute exists which may be doing great national harm, but so long as it is confined within the boundaries of one State there is no power for the Commonwealth authority to step in. </para>

Some honorable members on this side have been criticised because we advised the people to vote "No." I do not say that the questions were identical. But that does not affect the fact that if honorable members opposite say that the questions were the same, they are at least inconsistent in having asked the people on the last occasion to vote "Yes," and, previously, to vote " No." </para>

                            <para>- Then, at any rate, I am pleased to learn of his present conversion, no matter at what time or stage it may have taken place. The honorable member admits that he is converted to the necessity for making the Commonwealth Parliament supreme. I appreciate his attitude; but why does he advocate a Convention in order to do that which this Parliament should do? </para>

                            <para>- I do not see how a Convention can become non-party merely because the delegates have been elected by the people. Honorable members are here to-day as the outcome of an election by the people; but this is not a non-party Parliament. If the honorable member for Grampians should be chosen as a delegate to the Convention, and the honorable member for Yarra were also a delegate, am I to understand that each honorable member would leave his party feelings behind him? </para>

But if it is to consist of gentlemen outside of Parliament, in order that there shall be no party spirit introduced, I, for one, shall object to this Parliament delegating its powers to an outside tribunal.

                            <para>- That is my principal objection to the motion. Even if there were a dilution, as the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> suggests, there would still be party spirit. If this Parliament is to hand over its duties and responsibilities to an outside body, we, in effect, will be moving a want-of-confidence motion against ourselves. The great mistake made in framing the Australian Constitution was in following the lines of the American Constitution, which places the central authority in a subordinate position to the local authority. The people of South Africa followed different lines in framing their Constitution; they made the central power the supreme authority, and I do not think there is any member of a legislative body in Australia, State or Federal, but would say that the Commonwealth Parliament should be the supreme authority in Australia in every way. Recognising this great outstanding principle, the Labour party two years ago got together and framed proposals to overcome the present untenable position, and their proposals were outlined a few nights ago by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony).</inline></para>

                            <para>- They are not Unification, but they certainly trend in that direction. It is thought to be unpopular now to advocate Unification, but I remember hearing the late  Hon.  Alfred Deakin asking the people to agree to Federation, and the principal argument he used was to point out the absurdity of having 'so many State Parliaments to administer the affairs of 5,000,000 people. The promise was held out to the electors that if they- would agree to Federation the expense of the upkeep of fourteen Houses of Parliament would be saved. Practically something in the nature of Unification was promised as an incentive to the people to vote for Federation, and I believe that thousands of persons agreed to Federation bearing in mind the distinct promise that the stupid scheme of maintaining fourteen Houses of Parliament would not be perpetuated. The Labour party have propounded a scheme by which our Constitution may be altered so .that the Federal Parliament may be the supreme authority, as .the central Legislature should be, and in order to give effect to it I propose to submit a further amendment to the motion after the amendment moved by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kerby)</inline> has been disposed of. </para>

                            <para>- It is on the same lines as our. proposal; at- any rate, the South African Parliament is not hamstrung at every - turn as the Commonwealth Parliament is. To-day the honorable member for ' Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> spoke about the duplication of machinery in the building of soldiers' homes. It is not the only instance in which this duplication occurs. We have two taxing Departments, State and Federal. No intelligent people in any part of the world would continue in the way in which we manage our affairs, with so much duplication of machinery for administering them. The system proposed by the Labour party would end all this, </para>

                    </continue><para>And  would make the Commonwealth Parliament supreme. The central authorities would also have power to create any number of provinces as might be necessary for the good local government of the people. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> would call it Unification, but it simply means that the National Parliament would do the work of the nation - much work of a truly national character which is now done by the State Parliaments would be the sole responsibility of this Parliament - and that there would be a .devolution of power from this body to local bodies for the exercise of control in local affairs. Such at scheme would give better local government and greater satisfaction to people in a local sense, and at the same time greater satisfaction to the people from a national point of view, because there would  be only one Parliament dealing with national affairs. The Commonwealth Parliament would have the power to -grant to each province a uniform written constitution setting out the powers and duties of each local legislature, and, of course, such a constitution, could be amended from time to time as necessity arose. Honorable members may call our proposal Unification if they choose; it does not matter what name, they give it; the great outstanding feature of it is that the Commonwealth Parliament would have unfettered power to do things we have often tried to do, and have been prevented from doing, and to deal with questions of a national character, the responsibility for which at present is a doubtful matter as between the Commonwealth and the States. Perhaps the honorable member foi1 Ballarat would temporarily withdraw his amendment to give me the opportunity of moving mine. </para><interjection>

                        <para>.- I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> which, provides, in effect, that at the earliest possible moment there shall be a referendum of the people with a view to altering the Federal Constitution on the lines laid down in the policy of the Labour party. Every honorable member, and the great majority of the people, must appreciate the necessity for a radical alteration of the Federal Constitution. Our experience of it is that it creates drawbacks and stumbling blocks at every turn. At various periods there has been expressed by the people an emphatic desire to have certain legislation passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Some of the legislation so demanded has been actually passed, but has been held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> No sooner has it been carried than it has bumped up against the Constitution, and in this way the wishes of the people have been thwarted. In this way the young nation is kept back. </para>

The honorable member for Eden -Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> proposes  the election of a Convention to make recommendations. The original Federal Constitution was passed by a Convention, and, without desiring to reflect in any way on the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of that Convention, I would remind the House that as the outcome of its labours we have a cumbersome instrument of government which at every turn stifles the activities of the National Parliament. I am convinced that the same result will follow from any future Convention summoned to deal with the Constitution. The Government of the day, comprised as it is of men most of whom have been in this Parliament from its inception, ought to know in what respect the Constitution has failed. They ought to know what they want, and should be prepared to state boldly what alterations should be made. The Nationalist party, the Country party, and the Labour party should each be prepared to say what alterations they consider necessary in order to give effect to the principles for which they stand. They should put their policy- to the people by means of a referendum, and stand or fall by it. It is quite possible that men will be elected to this Convention with but little experience of parliamentary systems and the working of parliamentary machines, with the result that the alterations recommended, although arrived at possibly in the best of good faith, will be of little real benefit, and, if  adopted,  will' leave us with a Constitution practically as cumbersome as that under which we are governed to-day. </para><para>The proposed Convention, I make bold to say, is undemocratic.

                            <para>- Under the" Constitution, each State- returns six members to another place, so that the representation of a small State is equal to that of a State which has three or four times its population. The voting power of a small State thus works out as being worth three or four times that of a large State. Another principle for which we stand, and which, I think, every honorable member who desires to have responsible and democratic government in Australia must support, is the repeal of that provision in the Constitution which requires that a proposed amendment of the Constitution, in order to become law, must be carried by a majority of the voters in a majority of the States. That provision means that in the three most populous States of the Commonwealth New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland - an overwhelming majority might approve of a proposed alteration of the Constitution, yet because in the three smaller States - Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia - small majorities were recorded against the amendment, it would be defeated. It would be quite possible for a proposed amendment of the Constitution to be accepted by a majority of at least 100,000 of the voters of the Commonwealth, and yet because of this requirement to fail. </para>

                        <para>- But this Constitution requirement trusts only a section of the people. It allows of certain interests being so manipulated, particularly in the smaller States, that legitimate desires of the people can be frustrated. We, therefore, stand for the abolition of the Senate and for the abolition of this requirement in the Constitution. </para>
                    </talk.start></continue><para>Doubtless everybody realizes the necessity for decentralization. Some of our honorable friends say that the proposals of the Labour party really amount to Unification, and that we want to centralize everything. Analyzed in its fulness, however, our proposal will be found to make not for centralization, but for the best methods of decentralization possible in Australia.. It seems to me that it is unnecessary to have a written Constitution except to guarantee to the people that no Executive Government, and no organization, military or otherwise, shall ever take from them the right of the native-born to exercise the franchise. Beyond protecting and guaranteeing to the people one or two principles of that kind, the Federal instrument of government should be as free and untrammelled as possible. We all know that the High Court, which is part of the Constitution, has involved the industrial world in a lot of trouble. The same may be said of other features of the Constitution. In placing the hoop-iron bands of a circumscribed Constitution around the aims, aspirations, ideals, and ambitions of a young and growing nation, we are playing with fire. When a people cannot get what they want through legitimate constitutional channels, they will take it by other means. That is a consideration that we must always bear in mind. We should have a Federal Constitution under which the Commonwealth Parliament would be supreme in respect of all national questions. We should give the Federal Parliament authority to delegate to provinces created with due regard to community of interests the necessary administrative and legislative powers for carrying out purely local affairs. If the Commonwealth Parliament were given truly national powers, we should have an end to the farcical railway system under which, because of differing State policies, travellers have to step from one train to another on reaching a State boundary, owing to the break of gauge. When the people know that they have constitutional powers to give full parliamentary expression to their hopes, ideas desires, and ambitions, they will become contented, prosperous, and happy, and the foundations will be laid of a mighty nation. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> spoke of trusting the people. We, too, say, trust the people. But to appoint a Convention to deal with the Constitution behind their backs is not to trust the people. The Convention may be composed of legal gentlemen whose proposals for the amendment of the Constitution will be couched in phraseology hardly to be understood by laymen. And then a hundred different interpretations will be given to them on various platforms, and no one will know what he is being asked to vote for. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- What the honorable member might consider a good man, politically speaking, I might consider a very bad one. Honorable members have spoken of the undesirability of dealing with the Constitution in a party spirit, but the object they have is to amend the Constitution which governs our political activities, and that postulates a convention composed of men who will approach their task with political prejudice. I urge the House to seriously consider our proposal. If it were adopted, the day would not be far distant when, to use the words of the advocates of Federation, we should, as one people with one destiny, be giving expression to our wishes in one grand national Parliament,. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows more about that than I do. The object of the amendment seems two-fold, namely, to prevent the calling together of a Convention, and also to provide for a referendum, the terms of which, as in the past, would be fixed by Parliament after a long and bitter party struggle, in which the majority had gained its own way. I think that we are all agreed as to the need for reforming both the Commonwealth and the State Constitutions, and this debate may be regarded in some way as a sequel v,o the most interesting discussion which we had earlier in the afternoon, when, by the honorable members for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> and Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> and others, attention was drawn to most glaring cases of folly, waste, and inefficiency, due to the clash of Commonwealth and State control in regard to the erection of war service homes. What was said during that discussion made a deep impression upon the House. Every thinking man and woman in Australia is aware that one of the greatest evils from which this community suffers is the conflict of Commonwealth and State authority. The people are being oppressed by the excessive expenditure which results from the wastefulness caused by the overlapping of these two sets of authorities. What we have to consider is how best to put an end to this, and here I am reminded of Wordsworth's immortal lines - </para>

As the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> has shown, the referenda of 1911 and 1913 utterly failed to secure the results that were wished for.

                            <para>- I do not think so, but if I did, I probably voted like everybody else - on party lines. No other course was open to the electors, because the terms of the referenda were finalized by party managers in party Houses. If this is to be done again, the efforts of this most honorable House and the other Chamber, which is so often in our thoughts, but must always be nameless, are doomed to failure. Proposals for the alteration of the Constitution are not likely to receive the endorsement of the people unless made by a Convention possessing its confidence. </para>

                            <para>-On that point I am compelled to differ from the honorable member, and I fear that there are still some germs of the party spirit in this Chamber on the present occasion. I do not think that wc can expect the people to have as much confidence in this Parliament, as a body to consider the amendment of the Constitution, as they would have in a Convention specially elected for that purpose. We are as a man ploughing the sands of the seashore if we expect such a work to be successfully performed alone by honorable members 'of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>The next question is how this Convention should be elected. I listened- with the deepest interest to the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kerby),</inline> the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell),</inline> the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> and the honor-  able member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> and none  seemed in favour of the principle of proportional representation. The honorable member for Ballarat referred to a letter which was published over my name in the daily papers some time ago. In that letter I drew attention to the fact that, owing to the present ineffectual method of election,, it appeared that while some 13,568 voted in his favour, 13,567 voted against him. </para>

                            <para>- I remind the honorable member that at the present moment he is not speaking to the amendment, but really to the main question, on which he has already spoken. I take the opportunity to remind honorable members that if they speak on an amendment after having spoken to the motion, they must confine themselves strictly to the amendment. The honorable member for Werriwa had not spoken to the main question, and, therefore, was entitled to speak both on that and the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I regret having exceeded the bounds of decorum. When I wrote that letter I had not made the acquaintance of the honorable member for Ballarat, but, since having done so, I am amazed to find that his majority should have been so small. During the whole of the discussion this afternoon on proportional representation, I do not think any honorable member has really addressed himself to the principle and practice of that system. </para>

                    <para class="block">In order that honorable members may better understand and appreciate the advantages of the agreement set out in the schedule to this Bill, it will be necessary for me to say something on the part played by oil in modern economic and national life. Just as the first half of the last century was called the steam age, so the time in which we now live may be fairly called the petrol age. To-day, as from the beginning of the machine manufacturing era, the welfare of nations depends largely on fuel. But whereas formerly the fuel on which manufacturing nations relied was coal, they have now a choice between coal and oil. The effect of the oil engine upon civilization is most marked. It may be said that the internal combustion engine has effected as great a revolution as did the steam engine. If honorable members will try and conjure in their minds a picture of a world without oil. without oil-engines in any of their manifold forms, they will see a world very different indeed from that in which we exist. If they look upon these two pictures of what was and what is, they will be struck with the absolute dependence of the nations upon oil. They will be impressed by the extent to which the civilized world has adjusted itself to the motor with the internal combustion engine in some one or other of its various forms. That which we call civilized life depends to a very large extent upon adequate supplies of oil. It is vital to us, as to all nations, that we should have not only an abundance of fuel - both coal and oil - but that  Ave  should have it cheap. It may be said that every increase in the price of fuel is a tax upon industry, and affects wages, which in turn affects the standard of living. Not only is oil the very spirit of the life of industry, but in war, as well as in peace, its power is pre-eminent. The last war was a petrol war. Those millions of men could not have been fed; that great Front, stretching thousands of miles, could not have been maintained; munitions could not have been carried; aeroplanes and tanks' would have been inanimate things without oil. That complete dependence upon oil which is the lot of all nations is in Australia intensified by our geographical position. To us, oil is essential for our defence. When we consider our isolation, our vast coast-line and our wide spaces, we see at once that without a swift-driven navy, without means of transporting men rapidly, without cohorts of aeroplanes, our position is untenable. And yet it has happened quite recently that, notwithstanding our complete dependence upon oil for national defence, such small quantities of oil have been available as to have absolutely prohibited the navy from moving had an emergency arisen. Oil is vital to us, and, indeed, to 4 all nations. As every honorable member must know - and I merely remind them of facts which are as patent as the facts of night and day - the supply of fuel of all kinds is limited. It is said - I know not how true it is - that the supply of oil is not likely to outlast the increasing demands of the next few decades. It is certain that the demand for oil has increased portentously, and that it now plays a part in the national and economic life of nations second only - if second - to that of coal. </para>
                    <para>To show how the world's consumption of oil has increased, I propose to quote some figures. In 3910 the world's consumption of crude oil was about 32S,000,000 barrels; in 1914 the total quantity had grown to close upon 400,000,000 barrels. In 1919 it was estimated at 600,000,000 barrels! The position in Australia may be shown by the following figures relating to residual and refined oils: In 1910 we consumed 25,725,000 gallons; in 1914-15 our consumption was 43,000,000 gallons; and in 1918-19 it was 51,000.000 gallons. Roughly, the world's consumption of crude oil doubled in ten years. In the same period our consumption of the residual and refined products increased in the same proportion. Those figures show beyond all doubt that the world is becoming more and more dependent upon oil, and that the tendency in that direction is as marked in Australia as elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>I said just now something about the part which oil played in the defence of Australia. I propose to quote some figures to show to what extent our Navy is dependent on oil and the extent to which the Commonwealth and the Government are consumers of oil. In 1910 the Navy consumed 1,000 tons; in 1914 it increased to 10,000 tons, while in J 919-20 we are consuming 50,000 tons. These figures speak for themselves. And when we consider the price at which we bought oil in 1910, and the price at which we are buying to-day, honorable members must be impressed with the gravity of the position and recognise the need for some immediate remedy. "Clearly, the necessity for securing ample supplies of fuel oil - that is to say, the oil used for generating steam in vessels of the Navy so constructed as to permit of fuel oil being used in place of coal - is obvious. Since it goes without saying that' oil is vitally essential  to this country for defence   pur-   poses, and for other purposes also, I want to turn now to the question of supplies of oil, which is, as I have termed it, literally the spirit of the life of industry and the means by which this nation maintains its first line of defence, namely, the Navy. What are the sources of supply? Where are they? Who control and own them? First, as to the sources: There are two, namely, shale oil- and well oil. Shale oil, of which we have had some experience in this country, can be dismissed in a few words. The quantity of shale oil produced as compared with the volume of oil consumed in the world is so small as to be for all practical purposes negligible. In this country, despite the offer of a bonus of  2¼d.  per gallon in September, 1917, to Australian companies producing crude oil from shale, because the bonus previously offered was not considered sufficient, the production of oil from shale in Australia is only about 2,800,000 gallons per annum, whilst we consume ( of oil and its derivatives 52,000,000 gallons per annum. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> speaking in 1917 on the Shale Oil Bounty Bill, said - </para>

                            doubt whether the extraction of crude oil from shale is the wisest course to follow for the production of oil in Australia. . . . Most honorable members will agree with me that it would have been sufficient to make available £35,000 a year or thereabouts to encourage boring operations.

                    </quote>
                    <para>We may then put shale on one side as a source from which we can hope to derive supplies of oil adequate to meet our requirements; whether it be for fuel oil, benzine, motor spirit, or oil for lighting purposes. </para>
                    <para>At present we have no oil wells in Australia or its Territories. I shall later touch shortly this aspect of the question. But, as I have said, we have as yet not discovered oil in Australia. The chief sources of liquid oil throughout the world to-day are the United States of America, Mexico, Russia, Persia, Roumania, and the Dutch Indies. For all practical purposes, with the one exception covered by this Bill, all these supplies are controlled by a few very great foreign companies, of which the Standard Oil Company is the chief. I suppose that we have all said a great deal about the Standard Oil Company in our. time. I know that I have done so. Its power is very great. To what extent these great companies - and I shall quote them, so far as I have been able to compile a list, in a moment or two - work together under any arrangement I cannot say. But we have to look at the facts, and I think that they speak in a manner that none but those who are wilfully blind can misunderstand. It might be perfectly true if those great companies told us that there were no arrangements by which the world has been parcelled out for the supply of oil, or no arrangement as to competition either in price or in any other way, between them - I mean no arrangement binding at law or cognisable by the Courts, for it will probably be found that such arrangements, if any, are what is known, for some obscure reason, as "gentlemen's agreements." But it is, I think, pretty obvious that there are arrangements of some sort which, in fact, bring about the result I have suggested, and present effective competition. </para>
                    <para>The principal oil companies in the order of importance in the world to-day are: The Standard Oil Company; the Royal Dutch "Shell" Group; the Anglo-Persian and Burmah Oil Companies, which I bracket together, because their operations are interlocked; the Mexican Eagle Oil Company, now controlled by the " Shell " Group ; the Mexican Petroleum Company; the Union Oil Company, of California; the Waters Pierce Company, of Mexico; the Texas Oil Company, and  Nobels',  of Russia. In addition to these, there are three large Roumanian companies, which are controlled, one by the Standard Oil Company, one by the " Shell," while the other, before the war, was controlled by the Deutsche Bank. I am unable to say who owns this now. ' There are a number of companies, of a subsidiary nature, of whom one hears a great deal, but they do not own oil wells.  The- companies to which I have referred by name are the companies which actually own the great oil wells of the world. </para>
                    <para>The companies that supply Australia's requirements are, mainly, the " Shell " Company, the Standard Oil Company, and the Texas Oil Company. I want honorable members to follow a few figures I intend to give, because they are very interesting. The "Shell" Company supplies nearly all the fuel oil and a large proportion of the benzine consumed in Australia. The Standard Oil Company supplies most. of the kerosene- and practically all the lubricants. As I have said, whether the trade is divided in this way by mere- happy or unhappy chance, I am unable to say; but the facts are as I have stated them. Of  5,811,824  gallons of residual oil, that is to say, fuel oil, imported for the year ending June,  1919,  all but  40,000  gallons were supplied by the " Shell " Company, whereas of  7,440,097  gallons of lubricating oil imported, less than  100,000  came from the ".Shell" Company, and the rest came from the United States of America. Of  16,672,963  gallons of kerosene and other- refined petroleum burning oils imported,  14,548,123  gallons came from the United States of America. It is very clear, therefore, that we are dependent upon three companies, two American and or.s Dutch, for our oil supplies, lj is evident, also, that under some arrangement, or bv mere blind chance, we are  supplied  from one source with all lubricating oils and kerosene, arid from another with all fuel oils and benzine. It is perfectly obvious that the result must be that, whatever price they like to charge us,  Ave  must pay. ' I shall  show  exactly how that affects the Navy. and  how  it has affected the consumer. </para>
                    <para>The position as so far set out is this : Oil is an essential of modern life. Broadly speaking, those nations are most prosperous that use the most oil. The United States of America consumes  6,000,000  tons of benzine a year, or about six times the total pre-war consumption of the United Kingdom and all Europe. America is the most prosperous nation in the world, and she is prosperous because she has recourse to machine production, and 'machine production is more and more becoming production by machinery driven by internal combustion or oil engines. It is most important to note this fact, foi- it shows that oil is the key of industrial success. </para>
                    <para>We depend here for our existence as  a  nation on oil for fuel for our Navy. We depend on oil for our industries,  and  for those means of production which we must have. When I was in France, twelve months ago, one of  the  most striking signs of the times  was  the tremendous number of .tractors adapted for farming. The oil engine has' revolutionized or is revolutionizing the industries of the  world.  During the  Avar  tens and hundreds of thousands of tractors were put on the land in order to provide food for the fighting millions. Oil was the spirit of their life. With oil the millions made </para>
                    <para class="block">Avar, with  oil they tilled the land, and  with  oil they- drove battleships, merchant ships, and submarines. I have  shown  that six or seven great companies  Own  the means by  which  the great mass of the people of this  world  must live. We are in this position : We must have oil for our defence and for our industries. We have no oil of our  OWn  and no assurance of adequate supplies from overseas. All the supplies we do get come from foreign nations and from companies  whose  actions, I suppose, are governed by commercial "principles, and  will  sell or refuse to sell, as the mood, or the opportunity, or the inducement, suggests. The position can hardly be said to be satisfactory. We must have oil,  Ave  have none here, and cannot rely on getting  it  from abroad. It must not be forgotten, either that foreign .oil  when  it comes here must be refined oil. We have neither crude oil nor a refinery for treating it. </para>
                    <para>This brings me to a point' I said I  wo.uld  touch upon. We firmly believe - I do, at any rate - that we shall find oil in this continent or in one of our Territories. I hope that I am' not one of those unreasoning optimists  who  sees things just as he wants to see them, but I believe there are abundant signs for those who have faith that  Ave  are going to find oil. But  when Ave  have found it, it will b« useless to us unless  Ave  can refine it. If  Ave  found oil to-day in New Guinea,  we  could not use it until it  was  refined,- .and it  will  take  two  years to build a refinery. Crude oil cannot be used, so that if for no other reason,  Ave  ought, to immediately provide means for refining oil. At present we have neither any guarantees of oil from abroad, nor supplies of indigenous oil, nor means of refining. </para>
                    <para class="block">The first essential is that we shall have effective guarantees of adequate supplies of oil, and the second is that we should put up a refinery to deal with them. </para>
                    <para>I wish to deal now very shortly with another phase of this question - the price of oil. I have said that we must have adequate supplies of oil, and, what is obvious., both for our national and industrial needs, that we should get them as cheaply as possible. In a moment or two I. shall show what it costs us to buy oil for the Navy. If we are to be a great manufacturing nation, we can only be so on the basis of machine production. Whether it be in the primary or the secondary industries, our production must be based on machine production, and on systematized and organized effort; and at the basis of all modern production some kind of fuel is essential,' and oil is one of the most convenient and effective forms of fuel. Now let us take the prices, and see how they have increased during the past few years. The average . price per unit of quantity as declared at Customs was for - </para>

                    <para class="block">Residual oil is the oil we use for the surface ships of our Navy. Solar oil is used for submarines. Now I come to the prices on the Australian markets - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">These figures all relate to the refined products of oil. We come now to the base from which all these spring - the crude oil. Taking first what is referred to in the oil trade as the bellwether of oil, Pennsylvanian crude, we find that its price has risen from less than $2 in 1914 to $6 in 1920. There has been a rise of $2 in the last twelve months, and a sharp rise in the last few months. I hope honorable members will not forget that six companies own these oil supplies. I have mentioned the names of eight, including the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and one of them is the Mexican Eagle Company, which is controlled by the " Shell " group. Whether all are related or interwoven I cannot say. But the fact remains that this essential to the life of modern man is controlled by a few great corporations, who regulate the price we pay. I shall show what this means to us as a nation, quite apart from what it means to individuals in the community. In 1910 the Australian Navy paid £3 5s. to £3 10s. per ton for its oil. In 1914 the price rose to £4 5s. and £4 10s. In 1920 the price was £9 10s. to £10. As we are buying 50,000 tons per annum, we are now paying per annum over £200,000 more than we should have had to pay in 1914 - or nearly as much in one year as honorable members are now asked to agree to provide for the establishment of a refinery in Australia, assuring to Australia 200,000 tons of crude oil per annum, which will supply more than is required for the needs of the Navy and for half the motor and lighting requirements of Australia. I repeat that we are at present paying for the oil we need for the Navy over £200,000 more per annum than we were paying in 1914. I do not say that we are paying more than a fair price. I do not know what is a fair price for the oil. If I am asked whether the increase in the price of petrol or crude oil is due to the augmented demand for oil or to profiteering by the great oil companies, I say I do not know. The demand is phenomenal. In America it is such that it is fast overtaking the visible supply, and it is a matter of less and less importance to that country whether she can find a market oversea for her oils or not. She has a huge 'home market. But whether that demand is responsible for the present price of oil, I cannot say; but what I do know is that the price of oil to-day is determined by the demand and by the six or seven great oil companies. I leave it to honorable members and the country to determine which of these two factors is the greater in the matter of fixing the price. I deal with the facts, which are pretty obvious, namely, that we require oil, that we must have adequate supplies, that we must get them as cheaply as possible, and that we have no means of getting them at all, and certainly no means of getting them cheaply. </para>
                    <para>As I said a little while ago, the United States of America alone uses about 6,000,000 tons of benzine per annum, or about six times the pre-war consumption of the United Kingdom and Europe. I have pointed out what I think it was very  proper to point out - that America is, perhaps, the most prosperous country in the world - and there is a vital connexion between these two things. -Canada, with far less need to erect refineries than we have, has fourteen of them, seven having been erected since 1914, and these have a total capacity of 1,500,000 gallons per day. Canada has fourteen refineries, Australia not one! It is very obvious that immediate steps ought to be taken, as is provided in the Bill, to insure ample supplies of crude oil and to establish a refinery to deal with them and such other indigenous supplies as may be found in Australia or in the Territories. This Bill is a measure to  ratify  an agreement for that purpose made with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. </para>
                    <para>I do not know that it is necessary to dwell at any great length upon the position which the Anglo-Persian Company occupies in the world. Its history is pretty well known. It is crowned, so to speak, with a halo of romance, and we may derive some satisfaction from our knowledge of the connexion of the founder of the company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline><inline font-style="italic">W.</inline> K. D'Arcy, with Australia. He was one of the directors of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. Some twenty years ago he acquired interests in Persia, and spent a large fortune in endeavouring to develop the oil-bearing regions there. He lost much money, but managed to interest far-seeing and enterprising men in his schemes. The pioneers had a chequered career until in 1904. Lord Fisher, that most remarkable man, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, and who was one of the first to foresee the part that oil would play in the life of the world and as a fuel for the Navy, concluded that without oil that arm of defence was likely to be ineffective, and looked around with the object of securing within the British Empire sources of supply. He was mainly responsible for preventing the Persian concessions from falling into German hands. Honorable members will recall the Kaiser's dream of a railway from Berlin to Bagdad. The East ° was to be his, with all its greatness and all its richness. Thanks to Lord Fisher, the company, which was then struggling, found its feet, and in 1909 it was formed into what is now known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1913 a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons under which the British Government became officially responsible for the progress of this company, and on the outbreak of the war they acquired a controlling interest in it. The position now is as follows: - The capital of the company is £20,000,000, the issued capital is  £17,500,000, made up of £5,000,000 worth of 5 per cent, debentures, £5,000,000 worth of 6 per cent, participating preference shares, and £7,500,000 of ordinary shares. .The debentures carry no voting powers, the preference shares carry one vote per share, and the ordinary shares two votes per share.* The votes number 20,000,000, of which the British Government hold 10,001,000 on account of 5,000,000 ordinary and 1,000 preference shares. The balance of the shares are held as follows : - The Burmah Oil Company - a purely British company - holds 2,500,000, less a negligible number which are held by the heirs of Lord Strathcona and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> D'Arcy, its founders; and the British public own 4,999,000 preference shares. The investment of the British Government in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company cost them £5,000,000, and is roughly estimated to be worth £50,000,000 on the open market to-day. This company has been developed entirely by British capital and British enterprise. It is controlled by the British Government, "which holds a majority of its votes. It has no relation, direct or indirect, with any of the companies I have mentioned or with any other company. The Burmah Oil Company is one of the companies which was formed in Burmah by British capital, and was itself the company which assisted the infant Anglo-Persian Oil Company to its feet. The latter company owns, in Persia, Timor, Mesopotamia, Africa, Trinidad, Borneo, and other places, extensive oil fields. It is estimated that the Persian fields alone are as large as the combined fields of the United States. It has a fleet of tank steamers in being of 230,000 tons, which is to be built up to 500,000 tons, and this fleet will be worth £15,000,000. Here, then, is a company purely British in its origin, in its development, in its capital, and in its control, which possesses the most extensive oil fields in the world. It has a fleet and oil wells which make it perfectly independent of all shipping rings and oil corporations. It is willing to make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government to erect a refinery here, and to supply this country with 200,000 tons of crude oil per annum at current rates until such time as we find oil in Australia or its territories. When we find it, and in proportion to the quantity in which we find it, the company's oil will be retired and our oil will be refined at the refinery. In this refinery, the capital of which is set down in the schedule at £500,000, we are to take up £1 more than half of the shares, in order that we may exercise exactly the same control as that which is enjoyed by the British Government. We shall be entitled to half the profits accruing from the enterprise', we shall be assured of ample supplies of fuel oil for our Navy, and we shall give employment to a very large number of men, either immediately or in the immediate future. We shall also be ready to refine our own oil when it is found.. From, this 200,000 tons of crude oil it is estimated that we shall get per annum 40,000 tons of benzine, 33,300 tons of kerosene, 9,045 tons of lubricating oil, 72,000 "tons of fuel oils, 4,500 tons of wax, 9,000 tons of pitch. These commodities, other than fuel oils, will be sufficient to supply about one-half of our total requirements; while in regard to fuel oils the supply will be more than sufficient. The agreement is, for all practical purposes, an analogous one to that entered into by the company with the British Government, excepting, of course, that it is of an incomparably narrower scope. But so far as Australia is concerned, and to the extent that we put our capital into the undertaking, our position is analogous. It will give us the same control over this refining company that the British Government has over the Anglo-Persian Company. The agreement is with the Anglo-Persian Company for ' the purpose of forming a refinery company which will be registered in this country and in this State. The net effect will be that the Commonwealth Government will have a half share in the enterprise, the Anglo-Persian Company will have one-half of the remainder - that is to say, a 'quarter share - and the British Government will also have a quarter share. This Anglo-Persian Company is now a company which is truly Imperial in the best sense of the term. It is a company whose supplies are scattered throughout the Empire, and whose capital and resources, as well as the enterprise to which it owes its development, are entirely British. This company, controlled by the British Government, comes to the Commonwealth Government and asks us to become a partner with it in this venture. If the inducements were much less attractive than they are, I should be one of the first to advise honorable members to accept it. But being in the position we are, and asked by a company such as this, British in essence, controlled by the British Government, it would be incredible folly for us to reject this offer. For an expenditure of £250,000 we are offered a partnership with this great company, whose experience in much wider fields absolutely insures success in this enterprise. I remind honorable members that it is the Anglo-Persian Company's knowledge and experience that we are buying, under this agreement. It is not proposed to interfere in any way in the management of this refining company, but we shall have the right to prevent it' from selling its refined oil to any foreign buyer without our consent. We shall also be able to insure a sufficient supply of oil for our naval requirements, and have authority to veto any proposal likely to interfere with the status of the company. In addition, if at any future time further capital is to he called up, this may only be done with the consent of the Commonwealth Government; and in any case the relative positions must be maintained so that the Government will always hold a majority of the shares. </para>
                    <para>It is impossible at this stage for me to anticipate all the points - I can hardly call them objections - that may arise in honorable members' minds, so I shall not endeavour to do so. I would not be in order if I attempted to deal with .the schedule, item by item, but I may inform honorable members that I have been through it very carefully. In fact I am responsible for its present form, and as Attorney-General I declare that it amply safeguards the interests of the Commonwealth. It provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that the Government may resume the works after a period of fifteen years have elapsed, but whether the Government will be inclined to do so or not, I am unable to say. I do not know that very many of us would care to pierce the veil of the future to that extent, for I have no doubt some honorable members feel that fifteen years hence they may be in a place where oil would be regarded as an embarrassment of riches. In my opinion, the agreement is a good business deal for the Commonwealth. It is one of those schemes that are long overdue, but long overdue as it may be, the proposal is a clear indication that the war has made this country known in places where, perhaps, it was not heard of before. This great firm, with others, is coming to Australia. Some are coming for one reason and some for another, but apparently they all realize with us that Australia is a good place to be in. I have told the representatives of these firms that we have our troubles here just as other countries have, but that nevertheless Australia is a good place for all men to live in. These big English firms understand the trend of the times, and evidently they are satisfied that Australia presents to them opportunities which are not to be found in other countries. I have much pleasure iri moving the second reading of the Bill, and I strongly advise honorable members to assent to it. </para>

                        <para>. - In the absence of the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> ' I desire to place before honorable members the Supplementary Estimates for the year 1917-18, and to give the following particulars in relation thereto : - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Supplementary Estimates for the year 1917-18, now submitted, are for the purpose of obtaining an appropriation of Parliament to cover the expenditure made out of the Treasurer's Advance during that year. As has frequently happened in previous years, a considerable time has elapsed since the closing of the year's accounts and the passing of these Estimates by Parliament. Honorable members are aware that the preparation of the Supplementary Estimates is postponed' until the accounts of the year are finally closed, and a suitable opportunity has often to be awaited before they can be placed before Parliament. In regard to the present Estimates, the year closed on the 30th June, 1918, and the final audit of the accounts was not completed until the 17th December, 1918. These Supplementary Estimates were available for presentation to Parliament last year, but it was not practicable ' to place them before the House for consideration. </para>
                    <para>Pull particulars of the expenditure included in these Supplementary Estimates were contained in the Treasurer's finance statement for 1917-18, which was presented to the House on the 19th December, 1918. With regard to the total amount of £601,982 required under Ordinary Services, £206,398 is for war expenditure and £395,584 for the usual requirements of .Departments. Most of the items explain themselves, but there are some which, perhaps, call for comment. Generally speaking, it may. be said that owing to war conditions and the greatly increased prices which have obtained during the last few years, it has been difficult to forecast the expenditure as accurately as in normal times. </para>
                    <para>One item for which additional appropriation is required, under the Prime Minister's Department, is the administration and the working expenses of the Port Pirie wharf. The vote is being in-  creased from £2,000 to £13,882. Against this expenditure, however, the collections of the wharf amounted to £20,715, so that this service has been conducted on a payable basis. There is an increase in the amount to be voted for the High Commissioner's Office of £12,977. This extra expense is almost wholly attributable to war conditions. </para>
                    <para>Tinder the  Department  of the Treasury, a large sum of £38.177 is required above the amount originally estimated for Taxation Office contingencies. The increased taxation has necessarily made heavy and unavoidable expenditure in this branch. 1 should mention, however, that against that sum, owing to permanent appointments not being made a3 early as anticipated, there was a saving in the original appropriation for the salaries of the taxation officers of over £9,000. </para>
                    <para class="block"> There is also an increase of £49,000 for interest on transferred properties under the Department oi Trade and Customs. This- increase is in respect of lighthouses taken over by the Commonwealth from the States. An additional amount of £28,410 has been provided for rent of buildings. Of this amount, over £21,000 was paid to the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, on account of office accommodation for Commonwealth Departments. This sum included a considerable amount for fitting up of offices and arrears of rent from the time the Departments first occupied the offices. </para>
                    <para>In the Postmaster-General's Department -an additional ' amount of £24,547 is being asked for. That sum comprises a large number of items, none of which call for special remark. </para>
                    <para>Under War Services, £172,078 has been provided to cover war pensions in excess of the amount originally estimated, namely, £2,600,000, and £23,186 is required for the War Pensions Office. That sum is in addition to £37,168 originally voted. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the Supplementary Estimates for Additions, New Works and Buildings, the total amount asked for is £2,088, and is required to cover several small items not foreseen in the original Estimates. It will interest honorable members to know that of the amounts originally voted for the payments out of revenue in 1917-18 the following amounts were unexpended: - </para>

                            <para>.- I think this is the eighth or ninth occasion on which the Supplementary Estimates have been submitted after the money has been expended. Honorable members know by experience that this has been the practice for many years, and it destroys the arguments used on political platforms that certain amounts under the item " Contingencies " have been expended before a statement has been submitted to Parliament. Any honorable member who has been a Minister for five minutes knows that it is impossible to spend even 5s. without a voucher. In passing the Supplementary Estimates we are not agreeing to the expenditure, because we have not had an opportunity of voicing our objections, but there are some items which I would like to comment on. The money has already been spent, and we are now only validating the action of the Government. In dealing with the ordinary Estimates, although the period which they cover will expire in eight or nine weeks, it is still possible to criticise some of the expenditure, but it is useless criticising the disbursement of money which has already taken place. </para>

                            <para>- They are yet to come. I wish, however, to deal with a matter mentioned by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> and I regret that the honorable member for Adelaide? <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> is not in the chamber. This afternoon I had occasion to interject concerning the gantries or grabs erected at Port Pirie. That plant was installed there on the distinct understanding - I think the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> was Treasurer at the time - that the South Australian Government would defray the cost. When I stated that the South Australian Government should pay for the cost of installing that plant, the honorable member for Adelaide interjected, "No; you will never get a penny for it." South Australia, having entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth, should be compelled to pay. </para>

But the position, eighteen months or two years ago, was that passengers had to wait at least nine hours in Kalgoorlie before they could proceed to Perth. If the West Australian Government repudiated their agreement, that is no reason why the South Australian Government should act similarly. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think this is the first occasion on which the honorable member for Yarra has raised this question, and, inferentially, cast a reflection on a State that has always been extremely honorable, and an example to others. The mechanical coal handling appliance at Port Pirie is not perfect, because it should have been electrically controlled. At the time of its installation, it was impossible to obtain the necessary electrical plant, so it had to be an improvized plant, or, in other words, constructed out of a scrap-heap. The installation of the plant was a matter of vital interest to the Commonwealth Government, as well as an advantage to' Port Pirie, because in the absence of such a plant the Broken Hill Proprietary Company could not have supplied the Imperial authorities with lead for war purposes. That statement has been made deliberately. </para>

                                <para>- When that agreement was entered into, it was a definite undertaking that the Commonwealth Government would construct the line within a given period, and that they did not do-. 1 am sure ' of my facts, because the Western Australian Government at one stage raised loan money specially and expressly to build the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle section on the 4 ft. <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> in. gauge, but that money was diverted to other purposes owing to the delay which took place in the construction of the railway. That is a matter of history, and I am simply repeating it for the information of honorable members. The delay in Kalgoorlie is, after all, really a blessing in disguise, because even under the most advantageous conditions existing to-day it takes sixteen hours to run from Kalgoorlie to Perth. Taking into consideration the arrival time in Kalgoorlie, and allowing a fair hour for connexion and possible delays to the East-West train, you could not leave Kalgoorlie before. 11 a.m., which would mean that if you went straight through you would arrive at Perth at 3 o'clock in the morning. </para>

                                <para>- They have altered their time-table within the last few days, with a view to making it much more comfortable and suitable. The South Australian railways have altered their timetable, so that instead of leaving Port Augusta at 5.30 in the morning on the journey from the West, and the passengers having to turn out at 4.30, they now remain till 7 o'clock, have their breakfast, and leave Port Augusta at S a.m. That is a much better and more sensible arrangement. The solution of the whole difficulty will come when the line itself settles down more and is ballasted. The original estimate and scheme for the line did not provide for ballasting. When the line is ballasted and it becomes possible to run trains over it at a decent speed, the running time will be cut down, and passengers will be able to arrive in Perth at a suitable hour. </para>

                            <para>. - It is very amusing to hear the excuses put up by South Australian members for not paying their taxes. One honorable member said that those gentlemen were smiling when they spoke. They say the tiger smiles before he chops up his prey. I am afraid the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> is like the tiger. When he smiles, look out for squalls. He complained about the machine at Port Pirie being a scrap-heap concern. The South Australian people were glad to get that scrap heap concern at whatever it cost, but directly the. Commonwealth  wants  the money the South Australian Government makes all sorts of excuses, and will not pay it. In fact, it has not paid a copper up to date. The honorable member for Wakefield has not explained why the South Australian Government has not paid the Commonwealth that money. Because it is a payable concern now, the South Australian authorities want us to cut it out, and then sell them the machine. </para>

                                <para>- When the Commonwealth did its part, the South Australian authorities began to make excuses; they said it was not the machine they wanted; that they wanted an electric motor; that they did not want a gas engine; and that they did not want steam power. They wanted something that would do the work. The Commonwealth supplied them with a thing that did the work, and now they do not want to pay for it. There is this to be said, however, that even if the South Australian Government does not pay for it, the Commonwealth Government was under an obligation to supply the Imperial Government with lead, and whether it is a payable concern to-day or not does not matter, so long as we succeeded in what we set out to achieve. So far as that is concerned, I am quite satisfied even if the thing is a dead loss. I am told that fully 80 per cent, of the lead used by the Allies came from Broken Hill,and that there were always boats available for Port Pirie, when they were not available for anywhere else. Still, the least the South Australian people can do is to pay their taxes. The honorable member for Wakefield says that, the South Australians are always willing to fulfil any bargains they make. They unloaded one undertaking on to the Commonwealth to a nice extent, and so far as all the good the Commonwealth has got  out of the Northern Territory deal is con.cerned, I would vote to-morrow to hand it back to them, giving it to them free of debt, and letting them make a fresh start with it. That is what I would do if the South Australian Government would take it back. </para>

                                <para>- There are a few people in the Commonwealth who would fix up the war debt to-morrow if they had their way, but I notice that they have nothing to fix it up with themselves. It puts me in mind of the men out we3t when the Labour party first came into existence. Every man that was " on the creek," and had nothing  in  his tucker bags, was a red-hot Socialist and good Democrat, but once he had his kidneys lined, and was in a permanent job on a station, he would say, " This Labour business is no good to me." I have the greatest faith in the finances of Australia to-day, as I had when Federation was first consummated. I look upon this as the best country under the sun, both financially and for the people in it. People talk about what we have suffered, but we have not suffered one-thousandth part of what they have in other countries. We are the best-off place in the world. I was reading in an English paper to-day about the prices of things at Home, and comparing them with prices here. In the English provinces the ordinary commodities of life are unprocurable to the working people. We should not cry "stinking fish." The finances of the Commonwealth, and of every one of the States, are in a very buoyant condition, and I am looking forward to the great Protectionist Tariff to bring in more revenue than was ever brought in by any Revenue Tariff or. Free Trade Tariff in any country in the world. It is going to do what a lot of people have always said a Protectionist Tariff would do. It will bring about prosperity, higher wages, ,better conditions of living, cheaper clothes and boots, and cheaper commodities generally. In fact, every one will be happy and smiling, and we" shall have three months' holiday out of the twelve every year. Even with only nine months' work, this will be an El Dorado. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking on the Supplementary Estimates, and I ask your protection, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> from the honorable member for wooltops.  It is no use making a noise about this money, because it was spent in the financial year 1917-18. I believe there is still another dose of supplementary estimates to come, but it is not of much use to talk about it. The only thing that concerns me is that South Australia should pay its taxes. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> said by interjection to-day that we were not going to get a "bob" out of it, yet the honorable member for Wakefield tells us to-night that South Australia always pays its debts. If I had my way, I would stop the £77,000 out of South Australia's share of the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The Government have a pull on the State by that means. I would make South Australia pay this sum for the mounting of the grab in that way, and then let them fight it out afterwards. If we wait much longer, there will not be enough population in South Australia to take it out of. Why the. people are deserting South Australia I do not know. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to once more refer to the question of invalid pensions as these affect tubercular and similar cases. There are many unfortunate individuals in the community who, by reason of tubercular disease, are unable to follow any occupation. Many of these have been in hospitals for months or years, and only recently some were turned out of the Austin Hospital, at Heidelberg. Amongst those turned out are sufferers who have parents in receipt of wages which at one time were considered large, but are not so considered now. Unless parents who find themselves unable to support the sufferers turn them out into the streets, invalid pensions are not granted. </para>

                                <para>- It is a fact, and it is not the first time that such cases as I refer to have occurred. In one case that has been brought under my notice, the parents are in receipt of a wage of £4 per week, and of their four or five children some are dependent, others semi dependent, whilst the eldest is suffering from tuberculosis, and cannot earn a living. He left a sanatorium to return home, and' because the parents are willing to give him a shelter he cannot secure a pension. The only way to obtain a pension, as I say, is for the parents to put the sufferer on the streets. If that be done, they have to sleep in the street, or be locked up, until a pension can be secured, and we all know that the business of getting a pension cannot be got through in three or four hours. I am sure that there is not a member in the House who has not heard of cases of the sort. For years I understood that the Commissioner had special powers to deal with such cases on their merits. </para>

                                <para>- I have had five similar cases of hardship brought under my notice in the last two months. Some years ago 8s. a day might have been considered a fair wage, but now 16s. is worth no more than 8s. was then. We still base the power of the parent to maintain his children on the rate of the old cost of living. It is no pleasure to me to be continually bringing these cases before the House, but there are so many that they cannot be neglected. It certainly is not according to the spirit of the Act that a parent should be compelled to throw his invalid children on the street in order that they may obtain a pension. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will promise that such cases will be considered in view of the present high cost of living I shall be satisfied. </para>

I have fought the matter out with the Victorian  Deputy  Commissioner, and I believe that all the  Deputy  Commissioners have endeavoured to deal with such cases in the spirit of the Act, but find it impossible. I took cases to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> when he was Secretary to the Treasury and the real Commissioner of Pensions, and also to his successor, but there seems to be a disinclination to alter the decisions arrived at some time back. The present is certainly not a humane way of administering the Act. </para>

                            <para>.- Last night, when we were discussing the War Pensions Appropriation Bill, I pointed out the unfairness of sending soldiers to the Austin Hospital for Incurables while civilian patients were removed to make room for them. I gave all particulars connected with the civilian patients, and stated that forty had been removed from a ward into another part of the hospital, where I was informed the wards were insanitary. My anxiety was that justice should be done to both soldiers and civilians. The secretary to the hospital is anxious to have it made clear that the forty patients were not sent out into the street, as the newspapers made it appear, though I know some were sent out.  I  make this explanation in order that no stigma may rest upon the hospital. </para>

                        <para class="block">This is a camp for trainees, and in the course of a few months similar camps will be held at Broadmeadows, Seymour, and elsewhere. It is rather curious that at the time the scandal arose at Liverpool similar complaints were made as to the failure of the organization at Broadmeadows. In July, 1918, it was decided to hold the camp on 2nd September. There were, therefore, more than  six weeks in which to make preparations. The number of officers and men was correctly estimated on 16th July. Yet when the lads reached the camp it was found that there were insufficient tents to house them. The tents were deficient in number and gear, some being without flies, and some without poles. Blankets were not issued until between 6.30 and 8.30 p.m. - they had not been received in time. The lads arrived in camp, after a wearisome journey, at 11.50 a.m., 12.15 p.m., and 3 p.m. No food was available for them until about 3 o'clock. There was no salt for nearly a week, 'and meals were cooked without it. There was no issue of firewood, and the lads were sent to steal it. There were 63,000 lbs. of straw in the depot when the camp opened, enough for 6,300 men; yet no straw was available for the lads to sleep on for several days after the camp opened. No vegetables were available until the evening of the second day. Tent boards were not available, and the lads had to sleep on the bare ground, without straw, and only a blanket beneath them.  Colonel Kirkland  reported that it was not until the 14th - twelve days after the camp commenced - that the equipment was complete. After the camp the principal medical officer reported that during the whole of the thirty days' training the tents had not been struck or the ground aired, and he ordered this to be done before another batch of trainees was brought there. Another report states that, without doubt, a great deal of sickness was caused by the want of proper bedding, flooring, and blankets. One lad died of meningitis - part of the camp was known as " Meningitis Flat " during the early days of the war - ten days after his return from camp. There was a similar scandal at Broadmeadows. Some honorable members, who have been through the rigours of the war, evidently look upon these matters lightly; but I desire honorable members to understand the objects of these camps and the conditions under which they are conducted. These young men. were taken out of comfortable homes, and out of the mines, and were subjected to disabilities which I have just indicated quite unnecessarily, and merely because of the failure of some responsible officers to do the work they were paid to do. The country is disbursing large sums by way of salary to men who are regarded as efficient, and yet the health and the lives of these trainees are jeopardized because of the failure of certain responsible officials to do their simple duty. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly not; but my purpose in calling attention to these matters again is to insure, if possible, that they shall not be repeated this year. The reply of the Department, when inquiries were made, was that there was nothing to worry about, and that the officer appointed to make investigations had reported that all was well. Yet the occurrences upon which that officer was' required to report were exactly those I have just indicated. If our lads are to he subjected to treatment such as this, the sooner we close the training camps the better. We are sowing in the minds of the rising generation a hatred of military training and preparation. Conditions of discomfort and danger were natural enough in the emergencies of war, but they are not such as our young Australian trainees should be compelled to submit to in times of peace. This camp was in the vicinity of a great city, and such of the necessary facilities as were not available within the camp itself could have been speedily requisitioned. There was, in fact, no excuse for the camp being conducted as it was, and it is reasonably certain that that lad lost his life because of the failure of certain officers responsible to do their work as they should have done. As a matter of fact, they altered the date of the youth's death one week, in order to place it a little further away from the day on which he left camp. Not only at this camp, but at Broadmeadows also, the health and lives of trainees were in jeopardy. Yet the officers responsible have not only been retained in the service, hut have escaped without reproof - indeed, with a whitewashing report. The whole circumstances indicate an utter disregard for the welfare of trainees and absolute neglect on the part of responsible officials. I hope steps will be taken to sec that the work of preparing for the camps is in  future put in hand in ample time, and that it  is  placed under the control of capable officers. And if there should be any further scandals I trust that those responsible will be no longer retained in the service. </para>
