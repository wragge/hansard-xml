                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - I moved the adjournment of the House three or. four weeks ago to discuss the matter which I propose to raise again &#171; to-morrow ; &#39;but it was impossible to take a vote on it on that occasion. Many honorable members of other parties feel as strongly on this subject as do members of the Labour party. A definite pledge or promise, or, as the Prime Minister said once, threat, was made at Bendigo in regard to the wheat. It has been suggested that the motion :a to be moved because the Victorian election is close -at hand, but I am merely following up my action of a month ago, when the date of the election had not been fixed. I do not think that the debate on my motion will be long drawn out. It could be short and sharp, and followed by a vote which would determine whether the Government has done right or wrong. I realize that in the absence of the Prime Minister his  deputy  is in a difficult position. If the Government intend to treat the motion, as they ought to do, as one of censure, the only logical course for them to pursue is to move the adjournment of the House. The motion could then be discussed to-morrow in the presence of the Prime Minister. It cannot be discussed in his absence, and I take it that the duty of the Government is not to proceed with any business until it has been disposed of. They should take the ordinary course, and adjourn the House now until to-morrow., </para>

                    <para>-  Order! I would again call the attention of honorable members to an unfortunate and irregular practice which has arisen of late, and which, if developed, is likely to bring the business of the House into a state of chaos. Leave is asked, generally by a Minister, to &#91;make a statement, and, as a matter of courtesy, is usually granted. The Minister has. no sooner completed his statement than another honorable member asks leave to make a statement, and honorable members naturally desiring to be uniformly courteous, as a rule, do  not  object. This usually takes the form of a reply to the original statement by the Leader of the Opposition. I would point out, however, that if  other  honorable members are to obtain such leave, we shall constantly be having an irregular debate, just as we have now, with no question before the Chair. This procedure is contrary to all the procedure and practice of Parliament, and I hope that honorable members will realize the unwisdom of a practice which, if encouraged, must set at naught  all  rules for the orderly conduct of business. If the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

                            <para>- In connexion with the work of the Chamber, Committees are appointed for various purposes, and I think we should be enlightened as to their scope and power. As a member of the House Committee, I desire to know what powers and privileges that Committee possesses. I wish to know what control it has of the various matters with which it has to deal on behalf of the House. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  President  have absolute control, I have no objection to offer, provided that the House is so advised, and holds them wholly responsible for the administration of these details. But when Committees of the House are appointed, I think honorable members look to them to see that their privileges are conserved and convenience studied. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is present, I should be glad if he would let us know where, according to precedents, the duties of the House Committee and Library Committee begin, and where they end. I understand that the Library Committee has recently passed a resolution in regard to the salaries of officers who come within their control. I do not think they have the power to increase or reduce the salaries of attendants; but, if they have, the House Committee should have the same power. As a member of the House Committee, I hope that no such authority rests in these Committees. The salaries of parliamentary officers should be  dealt with either through the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, or in some other way, so that honorable members may not have to address themselves to such questions. At the same time, if, as a member of the House Committee, I am to be a mere dummy, I shall at once resign from that Committee. </para>

I have no desire to offer any excuse. My failure to take part in the division was due to a blunder, for which I accept the full responsibility; but I wish to put myself right as a member of this House. Those who know me will readily admit that I am not one of those who, having entered into a fight, will endeavour to sneak out of it; and I want to assure honorable members that it was because I did not hear the bells ringing for the division that I failed to put in an appearance. I read with much indignation in the newspapers on Saturday morning a statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that, while I was talking to him in his own room, he had distinctly heard the bells in the anteroom ringing for the division. I was in his room at the time, but I did not hear the bells ring. </para>

                            <para>- I put it to honorable members that a similar experience might befall any one of them. There are no bells in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> room, but &#39; the bells might have been ringing in his anteroom while I was talking to him ; and if ho says that he heard them, I am satisfied that he did. We were discussing matters relating to the House Committee, to which I do not wish to refer here, and I certainly did not hear the bells ring. I should like to ask honorable members what they would have done in the circumstances. I notice by the newspaper reports that the  Speaker  himself was paired on this occasion with a member opposite. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not pursue the subject. I hope some statement will be made to show what the powers of the Sessional Committees are, so that members may know where they stand, and that I for any part may know whether to remain on any of them or not. I do not care to accept responsibilities as a member of a Committee unless I know what the powers and duties of that Committee are. If the control and power are given to the  Speaker  of this House and the  President  of the Senate, I am quite prepared to abide by anything they do; but while we have Committees, the scope of their powers and duties should be understood by honorable members, so that we may be able to get along without friction. </para>

                        <para>. - With regard to what appears to be an imputation upon myself by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> of a lack of courtesy, in not notifying him that the division bells were ringing on &#39; Friday last, I can only say that I am surprised at the honorable member&#39;s statement. I certainly could not know by intuition that the honorable member did not hear sounds which&#39; were distinctly audible to myself. In any case, it is no part of my duty to tell any honorable member that a division bell is ringing, though I would certainly have done so as a matter of courtesy had I had any reason to believe that the sound of the bells was not audible to the honorable member for Dampier. The honorable member came into mv room to  see me about certain other matters, and when we were in conversation the bells certainly did start ringing. </para>

                            <para>- I could not assume that the honorable member did not hear a bell which was distinctly audible to myself. When Isay &#34;distinctly audible,&#34; I do not mean that the bell was ringing very loudly. As a matter of fact, it is rather subdued in tone, because it rings in only a very small area in the vicinity of my room, and not in my room itself. Every honorable member was, of course, aware that a division was expected about that time. The bells rang quite audibly to my ears, at any rate for a while, but afterwards their sound was less distinct, and it is quite conceivable that the honorable member, with his back turned to the door, and speaking to me, did not really hear it. While the facts may exonerate him from blame for non-attendance at the division, it does not, I think, give him sufficient warrant for accusing me of lack of courtesy in not telling him that the bells were ringing, when I would naturally assume that he could hear the sound as distinctly as I could myself. I can conceive a situation where a reminder of the kind might not be desired, though I do not suggest it was so in this case. When the matter was reported to the Committee, the Serjeant-at-Arms immediately made inquiries in the neighbourhood and found that the bells had been ringing. When I say I distinctly heard it ringing, I do not wish by that remark to convey any imputation of untruthfulness whatever to the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I did, but the honorable member may not have heard them. The reason why I heard them distinctly may be that I am accustomed to hear that bell. The honorable member is accustomed to hear louder bells in other parts of the building, and that fact would probably account for his not having heard this one. Had I known that he did not hear the bell, I should have reminded him that it was ringing. I hope the honorable member will absolve me from any intentional discourtesy to him, and from any desire at all to place him at a disadvantage through his presence in my room. I am sure that honorable members who know me will absolve me from any such intention. </para>

                    <para class="block">Library is concerned, I have always made it a practice, as  Chairman  of the Library Committee, to follow precedents established by my predecessors in office, and submit for the concurrence of the members of the Committee proposals in relation to appointments, promotions, and salaries. I think it is always a wise policy for the Presiding Officer to fortify himself with the advice of those with whom he is associated on the Committees, even although the Committees have no statutory power of nomination or recommendation.&#39; It was only quite recently that I discovered that the Committees had not that power; my attention having been called to section 14 by an officer of the Bouse, in consequence, I think, of a query by the Auditor-General in regard to same action that had been taken on one occasion. In order to satisfy my mind as to the actual ,position, I sought an opinion from the Solicitor-General, who informed me that the  President  and the  Speaker  are solely responsible, under the terms of the Act, for all appointments, promotions, &#38;c, in the Library. The Committee may make a recommenda-1  ion, but, in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran&#39;s words, &#34; it has no statutory status whatever,&#34; and no practice, however long continued, can deprive the  President  and the  Speaker  of their statutory powers, and they can ignore a recommendation of the Library Committee if they please. The terms of the appointment of the Library Committee give no indication of its duties or powers, and even a joint sitting is not provided for in the motion in the House of Representatives, though it is &#60;n the Senate. I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran again this morning on the subject, and he confirmed the position as already explained. That opinion- applies to all the Committees. So far as the House of Representatives is concerned, the  Speaker  is the only statutory authority provided for in regard to such matters. In the Department of the Senate, the-  President  only is clothed with statutory authority. And in regard to- questions of -appointments, promotions, and salaries of -staffs of the joint Houses, the  President  -and the  Speaker  conjointly have the sole statutory power. </para>

                            <para>- They are  controlled by the  President  and the Speaker; but the  President  and I, after consultation, came to the conclusion that, as employees of Parliament have not the same facilities for appealing to the Arbitration Court as are enjoyed by outside employee&#39;s- engaged in similar occupations, it was only a reasonable policy, in their interests, that awards made in regard to similar officers of the general Ser vice should apply also to officers of the Parliament. In the revision of salaries we have been guided by that view. </para>

                            <para>- I have placed no obstacles in the way of officers appealing to the Arbitration Court or any other Tribunal which Parliament has appointed to deal with such matters. The present position is very unsatisfactory. In my opinion, neither the  President  nor the  Speaker  is competent to form a judgment as to -what are fair and reasonable rates of pay for officers and employees of Parliament. Nor is any ordinary Committee of Parliament fortified with the necessary knowledge to do so. Such a decision requires a careful examination of all the conditions and circumstances  in comparison with the conditions under which men in similar occupations outside the parliamentary service work. An investigation of that kind can best be made by some permanent officer who is acquainted with that class of work, and the  President  and I contemplate asking the Public Service Commissioner&#39; to lend us the services of an efficient and experienced officer to advise us in regard to the Parliamentary Service, pending a possible alteration in the Public Service Act, by which all Parliamentary officers will be brought under the control of the Commissioner, as far as classification and salaries are concerned, leaving them in al! other respects under the control of the Presiding Officer of each House. The existing situation is very unsatisfactory. No matter what the Presiding Officers may do, some dissatisfaction is bound to result. For instance, some anomaly in the conditions of employment in the Library or in the Department of the House of Representatives may be brought under the notice . of the  Speaker,  who, in endeavouring to set right that anomaly, after consultation with the hoad of the Department concerned finds that he is creating disorganization in other Departments. As soon as one link is disturbed the whole chain gets out of gear, and the  Speaker  is met with protests from quite unexpected quarters regarding the effect of his action upon the seniority and right to promotion of other officers in other Departments of Parliament. The matter has then to be reconsidered, and <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> further adjustment made, but that, in turn, only leads to further dissatisfaction, requiring still more readjustments. This process is being continued throughout the year. I am safe in saying that there has never been a week while the House has been in session when I have not had before me questions of salaries, promotions, and seniority in one form or another. The whole subject is a veritable Chinese puzzle, and I should be glad to be relieved of the unpleasant duty an&#39;d responsibility of constantly making these adjustments. My one desire is that everybody shall be fairly and adequately paid for the work he does; but even in that desire I arn confronted with difficulties. If I were the sole authority in the building I would know exactly what to do, but the trouble is that, as soon as I endeavour to adjust the conditions of employees of the House of Representatives, my decision affects similar employees in the Department of the Senate. Naturally, the  President  of the Senate will resent my taking any action of the kind which, involves a disarrangement of his staff without having previously consulted him in order to arrive at a uniform policy for both Houses. This difficulty cropped up in the early days of this Parliament between the then <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker, Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, and the then  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker. Any advantage conceded  to employees in the House of Representatives was immediately made the basis of a claim for a similar concession to the employees of the Senate. The employees of the two Departments played against each other in turn, until an understand ing was arrived at as a result between the Presiding Officers that, in order to avoid continual complications and preserve a fair relationship between the different staffs, all decisions affecting the officers of both Houses should be the subject of consultation between the  Speaker  and the  President. </para>

                            <para>- With&#39; the Victorian standard they compare very  favorably.  Only within the past two or three weeks there has been another award made in New South Wales, which excludes certain parts of the State; but the Public Service has, I understand, been expressly excluded from that award. As far as has been possible, endeavours have been made to adjust the salaries paid in this building in keeping with the terms of the most recent awards affecting the Federal Public Service; and those salaries will be subject to alterations from time to time as awards are varied. It is quite possible that there may be further variations in the cost of living. The cost of living has increased since the rates to the lower-paid officers of the House were enhanced. 1 made inquiries only this morning from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> upon the subject of the cost of living, and he informed me that, since the award was made, there certainly had been an increase in the cost of living. I am waiting now for further particulars from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> with a view to giving consideration to a request which has been made by the cleaners, through the heads of Departments concerned, for a further addition upon the increases already given. </para>

                            <para>- The lowest wage paid to male employees is &#163;182. There are only two or three employees, however, who receive that sum. Beginning with the housekeeper, I will furnish the particulars of salaries paid to employees of this House. The housekeeper previously received a salary of &#163;265. His present salary is &#163;280. The next officer was receiving &#163;216, which salary has been increased, under the present Estimates, to &#163;250. The next in order on the messenger staff previously received &#163;200 per annum. His salary is now &#163;212; and, together with his bonus, the total which he receives is &#163;232. There has really been an increase of &#163;32 in the case of each of the messengers over and above last year&#39;s pay; that is, with increased salary and bonus combined. The next messenger previously received &#163;184. His salary is now &#163;196 ; and, with his bonus of &#163;20, he is now receiving, in all, &#163;216. The other two messengers previously received &#163;168. Their salaries have been raised to &#163;182, plus the bonus of &#163;20 each, bringing their salaries up to &#163;202. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, so that the lowest sum, including bonus, paid to any messenger in this House is now &#163;202. These amounts hold good until the end of December next when the question of bonuses, I understand, may again be reviewed by the Arbitration Court. But, whatever may be the result of that review, the amounts paid to employees of the House will not be less than they are now receiving with their bonuses. That is to say, the lowest wage of the present messengers will amount to &#163;202 if the bonuses remain as at present. If the bonus is increased by any new Public Service award, the amounts received will be subject to revision. </para>

                            <para>- So far as is possible, they are. In regard to cleaners, an award was made. They were previously receiving &#163;158, and a bonus was given in addition. Upon this point I am speaking from memory, and subject to correction. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers later reviewed these wages and award, and discarded the bonus while increasing the ordinary rate of pay to absorb and extend it, and we have brought the cleaners&#39; wages up to the amount specified in the award. In the course of his decision <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers pointed out that the cost of living did not appear to be merely a temporary matter which was liable to be altered at any time; he added that he saw no possibility of the cost of living coming down immediately. He thought, in the circumstances, that it was not advisable to grant a bonus, but to permanently increase cleaners&#39; salaries. Their wage, therefore, was increased from &#163;158 to &#163;182, in the terms of this award. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In the fixed salary of &#163;182 there was embodied the bonus, with something more. That is the amount which the cleaners are receiving at present. There are only three of them, but it is fair to say that one of the three really earns a little more, because he attends to members&#39; luggage and other matters for which he receives an additional sum to his remuneration as cleaner, which augments his salary to some extent. </para>

                            <para>- I have only just explained fully that they get now a  fixed increase instead of the bonus, in terms of the award. Of course, if the Arbitration Court awards them a bonus, the bonus will be paid to them. The amount of their salaries, therefore, is subject to any arrangement as to the payment of a bonus which the Court may award from time to time. But if the bonus be paid to them in addition to their salaries, what will immediately happen? The messengers, who at the present time receive &#163;182 per year with the bonus, and who are supposed to be promoted from the ranks of the cleaners, will then possess no advantage over the cleaners, and fresh complications as to status, seniority, salary and promotion will at once arise. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable member did not catch the explanation which I made earlier in my remarks. I then pointed out that the salaries attaching to employees of both Houses must bear some relation to each other. If the salaries granted to employees of the Senate were raised by the  President  without any reference as to what the  &#39;Speaker  of this Chamber proposed to do in regard to the salaries of employees of this House, naturally there would at once be a protest by the employees of the House of Representatives, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> A demand would at once be made by officers of similar rank for similar treatment. Whatever was done in one House would be used as a claim for the same thing to be. done in the other branch&#39; of the Legislature, and thus we should have continual trouble in adjustments and re-adjustments. To avoid that as far as possible, consultations are held between the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of this Chamber, with a view to arriving at agreements as to what shall be a basis for each House. But if there should be a difference of opinion between the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  President  of the Senate in regard to such matters - and there may not be, and frequently is not, unanimity - difficulties immediately arise. </para>

                    <para>Upon th&#171; present occasion, I shall not trespass unduly upon the time of honorable members, because I spoke upon this question on Friday last. If my information be correct - that the employees of this Parliament are grouped into five separate Departments - the position is a ridiculous one. There are five Departments, I am informed, to control some seventy-five officials - that is one Department for each fifteen employees. There is an old Eastern, adage which is very true, and of which I am reminded at present. It is that &#34; That officer rises quickly to eminence who basks in the sunshine of the presence of his superiors.&#34; In other words, the man who is always under the eye of his superior officer has a better chance of rising- in his profession or calling than has the man who is never seen by the head of his Department. The system which at present obtains in this House must, in justice to our officers, bo altered. It is ridiculous that men who are sent here as representatives of the  people should be asked to act upon Committees when these Committees can only play a fool&#39;s game. I speak more particularly on behalf of the Library Committee. If matters relating to the powers of that Committee are not settled in a more sensible way, either by means of a resolution of this House, or by the passing of legislation dealing with them, and if my colleagues will resign from that Committee as a protest, I shall certainly resign with them. </para>
                    <para>At this point I desire to make it perfectly clear that I have nothing but respect and regard for the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in reference to the Committees&#39; of this Chamber. I wish that I could say the same in regard to another gentleman to whom I alluded on Friday last. Subsection 3 of section 14 of the Public Service Act provides - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The officers of the Senate, the officers of the House of Representatives, the officers of the Parliament Library, the officers of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the officers of the Joint House Committee shall be deemed to constitute separate Departments under this Act. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">My information, therefore, that the employees of the Commonwealth Parliament are grouped under five separate Departments is strictly accurate. I am not quite sure of the number of officers who are employed in the building, but, from a perusal of the Estimates, I gather that the total is seventy-five. Is it not the acme of folly that there should be five separate Departments to control seventy-five officers of this Parliament? There must be some way out of this condition of affairs. It was never intended by this democratic Parliament - for, with all its faults,&#39; it is a democratic Parliament - that one gentleman, if he so desired, should have the power to block everything. </para>

                            <para>- Bad laws, if administered by good men, may be much better than good laws badly administered by men who are not honorable. I understand that grave dissatisfaction is being experienced by every Committee appointed by this Chamber. That dissatisfaction has now reached such a point that if something be not done, and done quickly, to remedy the existing condition of affairs, these Committees will resign as a protest. If my colleagues upon the Library Committee resign their positions I shall feel it my duty to resign with them. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable member for his flattering reference. I voiced my protest upon this matter very strongly on Friday last, and I shall not delay honorable members by referring to it at greater length now. I have nothing but contempt for the practice which is at present followed in regard to the powers of our Parliamentary Committees. This is  not the first Library Committee of which I have been a member. In the State Parliament of Victoria the  President  of the Legislative Council and the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly always carried out their duties in a gentlemanly and humane way. I have had some experience on our Library Committee, and I can say that it has never arrived at such an <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> as at the present time. If any honorable member feels it his duty, by way of Bill or otherwise, to propose that the House Committee shall act, first with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and then with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I shall gladly support him. I understand that certain action is being taken in another place, and I commend that as a good example to follow. </para>

                        <para>.- The position of the vario&#62;us Committees of this House is by no means satisfactory. Certain honorable gentlemen are appointed to these Committees in Parliament after Parliament, and yet they have practically no voice in the control of the employees, or in other affairs of the House. All that these Committees are asked to do, apparently, is to approve of some expenditure or action by others. This Parliament creates and provides for the  payment of the Public Service Commissioner, and yet, to-day, according to the statement of the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> we cannot control the few employees about the premises; who are left to the whims of others. It is tune that Committees were either abolished or given the power to act as they think best. Surely this supreme Parliament, as we claim it to be, ought to be able to manage the few servants in this building. In a little trouble which occurred a while ago, all the correspondence which passed, I take it, from the  President  or the  Chairman  of the House Committee, was signed by the Secretary as on behalf of the Joint House Committee. To this I distinctly object, for we, as a Committee, knew nothing about the matter. There has been only one meeting of the Joint House Committee since the beginning of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>.- I have no desire to reflect on the honorable gentleman who occupies the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> . but, in my opinion, the members of this Chamber should, through their delegates on the Committees, have some say as to the wages and conditions of those who attend to our wants here. It is an invidious position in which honorable members find them selves in this regard. If an injustice is being done to any person who assists us with our correspondence, or attends upon us in any other way, we ought to be able to exercise some control through the House Committee. The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> in his explanation to-day - though whether intentionally or inadvertently I do not know - said that one of the workers in receipt of &#163;182 per annum, or something less, I think, than &#163;3. 10s. per week, is able to supplement his income by attending to honorable members&#39; baggage, and so forth. I hope that neither Mr:  Speaker  nor. the  President  of the Senate is prepared to make that a basis for fixing the wages of the employees of this Parliament; - that there shall not be taken into account any gratuities they may receive for services rendered to honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- What I am concerned about is that the  Speaker  has told us that he and the  President  of the Senate take full responsibility for all increases in salaries, and alterations in working conditions, and matters of that kind. That means that the employees of Parliament have not the . same privileges as outside workers, for they cannot approach the Arbitration Court and state a case for increase of salaries or redress of any other grievances. Neither are they paid overtime, although I suppose they get other privileges with regard to holidays. On the other hand, they have to remain here as long as the House is sitting. If we decide upon an all-night sitting, they have to be in attendance, and get no extra payment. No matter how good the working conditions may be, the employees of the Parliament are put to the same expenditure as are other employees of the Public Service, and they are not paid anything like an adequate wage under the present conditions of living. It is all right for us. We have looked after ourselves. </para>

                            <para>- No; because I thought that that was a most statesmanlike act on the part of honorable members. It is the newspapers that refer to it as the &#34; salary grab.&#34; The honorable member knows quite well that I never had any doubts on that question, and I have never heard of any discontent among the people I represent concerning the increase we voted in our own salaries; but I said at the time that I hoped the lesson would not be lost upon the workers outside. It is the duty of those who claim to represent the working class, as a class, to insist that those who wait upon us and attend to our wants get at least decent living conditions and decent wages, especially as we took such good care to get well ahead ourselves of any increase in the cost of living. </para>

                        <para>- I want to say a few words upon this matter, because I am a member of the House Committee. The question that has been raised will have to be dealt with at  Some  time or other. I have been a member of the House Committee for six or eight years, and I doubt very much whether the Committee has any power whatever. We may talk as much as we like. As a matter of fact, to all intents and purposes this building and everything associated with it belongs to the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> It is idle for honorable members to laugh. This Parliament has no power over the matter. If it had, is it likely that the present condition of affairs would have been allowed to go on for so long ? If we have power to do anything, it is time the Government formulated a scheme to deal with the whole of the Joint Committees in an effective manner. I got into terrible trouble once for advocating that an official on this side should get the same pay as an official on the Senate side. The other day a man started as a cleaner over there at &#163;202 a year. It is not a penny too much, but on the House of Representatives&#39; side he would get only &#163;182 a year. I want to know the reason for this difference. A cleaner on this side would not do less work. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a matter of fact, he would do more, because there are more members to create work, and yet he would get &#163;20 less. We have two returned&#39; soldiers on this side; they have been here for twelve months, are working efficiently, and yet they are getting &#163;20 a year less than the man on the Senate side. This position should not be tolerated, yet it is. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> made some flattering references to his majesty the  Speaker.  All I can say is that I never can get a meeting of the House Committee on this side. </para>

                            <para>- I have never yet known a question to be decided by this Committee. The moment I have tried to get matters affecting this side dealt with, our Czar has said, &#34;We cannot deal with that here; you must refer it to the Czar on the other side.&#34; I listened very attentively to what the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> said in reference to the request put forward on the other side of this building, that any increase given to the House of Representatives&#39; attendants should also apply to Senate attendants, but I contend that a man who is working on this side has an equal right to receive whatever increased rate of wage is paid to a cleaner on the other side of the building. I want to know how the difficulty can be obviated. </para>

                            <para>- If that is so, the sooner arrangements are made by which it can be obviated the better it will be for the servants of this House. I am not too keen on placing them under the Public Service Commissioner. They suffer many injustices now, but I think they would suffer still more under him. Certainly their grievances can be ventilated now, but under the Public Service Commissioner they would have very little opportunity of bringing them under the notice of honorable members. We ought not to tolerate a system which will give one man more pay than another who is doing the same class of work, particularly when the increased wage is given to a new servant who has yet to learn his duties. Is it fair that a cleaner on the Senate side, who started work a fortnight ago, should get &#163;20 a year more than is paid to cleaners on this side of the building who have been in their positions for two years? </para>

                            <para>- This question is always cropping up. It is annoying to a member of the House Committee to be asked why certain things are not done when the members of that Committee know that they are powerless to do anything. Nothing is more productive of disruption than the unfair treatment of one section of employees. Recently, when a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria was overlooked in the matter of the appointment of the Chief Justice of the State he made the remark that an injustice of that sort would make a man say, &#34; I will do just my bare work, and that only.&#34; I do not blame men for doing just their bare work when they find that others who are doing the same class of work are getting better pay. It is the responsibility of the Government to bring in a comprehensive scheme for the management of all those associated with this building; otherwise honorable members will be constantly bringing forward matters which ought not to occupy our time when we have so many other important questions to consider. </para>

                        <para>. - Last week we heard several honorable members express the desire to strike out certain items in this expenditure when the Committee came to deal with the Estimates in detail. Although they were not willing to reduce the total vote, they assured us that the items of expenditure would be dealt with very severely. Honorable members should be given an opportunity of proving that what they said last week was not cant and humbug, and of making their position clear to their constituents by showing that they are really in earnest in this matter. It is the desire of quite a number of honorable members to exercise some control over the various spending Departments of the Commonwealth. We were assured last week that the matter of reducing expenditure and dealing with the items in detail was not a party matter, and that every honorable member would be able to vote according to his convictions. The history of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department is worthy of some detailed consideration. It was established eight years ago, when the present High Commissioner was Prime Minister, and at that time the total sum provided On the Estimates was &#163;11,795. Nearly all the members of the present Government strongly objected to the formation of that Department, and pointed out that other subDepartments would come into existence. It was also stated that these subDepartments could be better handled by some other Minister. Despite the fact of these protests we find that year after year the expenditure is continually growing. If the expenditure was necessary, one would not complain; but we have to consider whether the various activities which are conducted by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department should not be placed under different control, and where they rightly belong. During recent years the Department has been dealing with sugar, wool, wheat, shipping, the administration of Papua, mining, and price-fixing. All these branches of governmental activity have been dealt with by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, and. the continuance of this has brought about a state of affairs which does not permit the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> to efficiently and expeditiously supervise and control the proper work of his own Department. The Prime Minister&#39;s Department should be for the purpose of co-ordinating the work of the various </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Departments, keeping in touch with State Governments throughout the Commonwealth, and with the Imperial Government on questions of Imperial policy. Since I have been a member of this Parliament I have often wondered why the question of sugar, for instance, could not be controlled by the Department of Trade and Customs, where it really belongs. The Minister in charge of that Department is thoroughly <inline font-style="italic">an fait</inline> with the whole question of sugar. He has two mills in his own electorate, and a considerable number of cane-growers have supported him for quite a number of years. Probably nowhere in the Commonwealth could we find any one more capable of dealing with the question of sugar in its various aspects than the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> At present only a portion of the work i3 handled by that Minister, while the bulk of it is controlled by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. The same may be said in regard to the embargo on the export of sheepskins. The practice adopted in the past may have been necessary dur-, ing the war period, because certain negotiations with the Imperial Government, particularly in regard to wholesale purchases, were necessary. But the war has been over for nearly two years, and it is now time such commercial activities should be handled by the proper Department. A month or six weeks ago, a conference of. all those associated with the export of sheepskins was called by the Prime Minister, at which the Minister for Trade and Customs was not present. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely endeavouring to show that, irrespective of what ability a man may possess, it is impossible for him to have a grip of the different subjects in every detail. By a flash of intuition possibly a right decision is sometimes arrived at, but frequently the wrong procedure is adopted. The same may be said concerning&#39; wheat, which is a question that is to form the subject of a censure motion to-morrow. These are ordinary commercial activities, and if the work had been undertaken by a Department that was not overloaded with responsibility we might have had a more satisfactory settlement before to day. During the war period it may have been necessary for the Government to exercise certain control over metals, but now the war is over this question should be dealt with by the proper Minister. According to the information before us, the Prime Minister&#39;s Department handles also the question of shipping and mail services to the Pacific Islands, Commonwealth shipbuilding, Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, Commonwealth Shipping Board, and the Port Pirie wharf. A few moments&#39; reflection will show that questions such as these could be more profitably dealt with by another Department, where the officers are not dealing with the relations between the various Governments, but with work such as questions like these entail, and where trained administrative staffs are in existence to deal with these matters. In connexion with shipbuilding and the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers,&#39; we have to consider &#39;whether the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> and the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> could not handle the work more expeditiously and efficiently. The matter of providoring  is one item&#39; alone in which single control by one authority could secure great savings. There is also the question of handling dock-yards and standardizing the whole of the requirements in connexion with the construction and handling of ships. Surely this work could be more expeditiously carried out by officers intimately associated with the business. </para>

He mentions, among other things, that a firm bought boilers from one Department of the Service at &#163;540 each and sold, them to another Department for &#163;750 each, although the officials of each Department should have known what was being done, because tenders were publicly called for. </para>

                    <para>Many of the officials who are now under the Prime Minister should be transferred to the Departments of the Navy or of Home and Territories. That would certainly allow a reduction of staff, and would give an opportunity for other economies in the saving of stocks, more efficient  storekeeping,  and the standardization which it would make possible. The Commonwealth Government line of steam-ships must be supplied with coal and oil, and so must our war ships; and, unquestionably, supplies could be best arranged for and managed by one set of officials acting both for our Navy and for our mercantile marine. &#34;We shall never have a properly equipped N&#34;avy unless our mercantile marine is worked in connexion with, and as an adjunct to, it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the economy which I desire does not mean the mere sacking of men; it means the proper marshalling and management of the resources of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arnold</inline> Gridley,  who during the war was Controller of Electrical Power in Great Britain, is now visiting Australia. He was able by standardization, grouping, and proper management to generate with &#163;800 worth of coal 2,000,000,000 units of electricity, by utilizing materials that would otherwise &#39;have been wasted. It is estimated that in Great Britain a saving of something like &#163;100,000,000 can be effected by the substitution of sixteen power-stations for over 600 which were used during the war. We should be able to effect similar economies here. No&#39; one man can properly conduct all the activities with which the Prime Minister is now charged, and it will be of great advantage to the Commonwealth for business which properly belongs to other Departments to be transferred to those Departments. </para>

                    <para>Because the Prime Minister is continually mixed up with matters that are not properly under his administration, the business of his Department is not being expeditiously performed. Some three months ago I asked in. this House whether Australia would be represented at the Pan-Pacific Scientific Conference which was to be held at Honolulu in about three weeks&#39; time, and was informed that the matter was to be considered, although any representative that might be appointed should then have been <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to Honolulu. The New South &#34;Wales and Queensland representatives at that Conference have returned; but I have not heard of an Australian representative. The importance of the Conference was admitted by British, American, and Australian newspapers, and no country has a greater length of coastline washed by the waters of the Pacific than has Australia. &#34;We were not represented at the &#39;Conference because the Prime Minister was too much engrossed with other work. </para>

The classical example  is  the electrolytic production  of  aluminium, which  is  now certainly the  most  important electro-chemical industry. In the processes of Hare and  Heroult,  the electrolyte  is  a fused solution  of  alumina  (as  solute)  in  the double fluoride of aluminium sodium  (as  solvent). Carbon anodes are used, while the melted aluminium metal  in  the bottom of the pot forms the cathode. The temperature  is  900 C. The alumina  is  decomposed by the current, and fresh alumina is added  at  intervals  to  the bath. According  to J. W.  Richards, the production  of 1  kg. of aluminium requires 22 K.W.M. </para>

                        <para>. - Incidental reference has very frequently been, made to the High Commissioner&#39;s Office during the past three or four months, and I have more than once voiced the complaint of visitors who have spent a considerable time in the Old Country and have been exceedingly disappointed by the failure of officials at Australia House to give them the assistance which they looked for. Australia House is reported to be anything but an attractive and useful centre working in the interests of the Commonwealth. The reports I have heard have not been prejudiced, but have been very sincere statements of regret that Australia House to-day is not answering the purpose for which it was intended, and is not justifying the enormous expenditure incurred in its construction and administration. I have heard these reports from soldiers whose political sympathies are with honorable members opposite, as well as from soldiers whose sympathies are with honorable members on this side of the House. They are unanimous in the complaint that there is a deplorable lack of energy and enterprise in the direction of usefully advertising this country. That ought not to be. I have a very shrewd suspicion that the Government know, and have known for a long time, that this condition  o&#39;f  affairs exists. If so. the Committee ought to know where the weakness lies, and the trouble should be remedied  at the earliest moment. It has been said that only a very small proportion of the employees in the High Commissioner&#39;s Office have any knowledge* of Australia, of Australian products, and of trade possibilities with the Old Country. That ought not to be. There ought to be a substantial representation of Australia in the High Commissioner&#39;s Office. There should be stationed there officers with a complete knowledge of Australia. There should be specialists who know something of Australia&#39;s possibilities and productive wealth, and who by their very presence would help to advertise Australia from a trade point of view. I am told that such officers are not to be found in Australia House. A constant supply of fresh men from Australia should be sent there. Officers should be sent Home for a few years and then replaced by men equipped with a thoroughly up-to-date knowledge of Australia. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> only  last week promised that, if desired, particulars would be given in regard to every item in the Estimates, and I want detailed information about the expenditure on Australia House. </para>

I desire to know whether the staff of that section of Australia House whose present duty it is to look after Australian interests and the disposal of Australian products, consists of men who are familiar with our producing conditions and have a thorough knowledge of the products that we desire to put in increasing quantities on the Home market. I should be glad if the Treasurer would also give us a statement showing the number of employees in Australia House, and their distribution in regard to different interests. Is it proposed to attach to the staff, officers whose duty it will be to develop our trading conditions? I do not think there is a special section attending to trading interests, and, if that be so. I desire to. know whether there is any -attempt to utilize the staff of Australia House in co operation with the Agents-General, so as to promote Australian interests. Will the Treasurer also tell us whether Australia House is fully occupied? Are those portions of it which are not required for the purposes of the High Commissioner fully leased so that there is , no dead weight attaching to it? </para>

Will the Treasurer inform the Committee what information the Government have up to date in regard to the success of the Trade  Commis.sioner  there, and whether there is any promise of greater success in the future ? The United States of America is a vast country, and I do not think we are likely to have any practical results from the appointment of one man to represent us there, I am not opposed to expenditure in these  dirctions  if there is a possibility of a return, but if these offices are being established from a trade point of view it seems to me that, instead of having one man located in one centre, we must have a dozen men to cover the different areas. </para>
                    <para>The next matter to which I desire to refer relates to Commonwealth shipbuilding. Having regard to the careful husbanding of the finances, this is a subject on which the Committee should have some information. In the matter of construction, judging by the reports submitted to us, some really good work has been done. In the past, for special reasons, the cost of construction, relatively, has been satisfactory. One reason, I believe, is the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> very wisely, secured an understanding - and it seems to have been effective - with the trade unions involved that certain conditions should be observed during the currency of certain contracts for ship construction. For a time the resultant costs of construction per ton as compared with costs in other parts of .the world were eminently satisfactory, but the Committee ought to know whether that satisfactory condition obtains to-day. </para>

                            <para>- If what I have heard is true, I am very glad that they have. The Prime Minister sought a renewal of those conditions, and I believe he has said that without a renewal he would not proceed. I hope he will stand to that. We have no opportunity to form an opinion simply by a quotation of estimates, because we do not know the class of ship and the class of work involved in respect of certain estimates that have been published. It may vary extensively, involving an additional cost of 20, 30, or 40 per cent., according to the type of ship, so that quoting to-day a certain price for dead-weight tonnage construction and another tender to-morrow, we cannot possibly form any idea as to whether the latter is a satisfactory tender unless we know all the conditions of the varying kind of ship that is to be constructed. I hope the Treasurer will note that point; but, apart from that, the cost of construction in the Old Country and in other countries has receded very considerably in the last few months, and&#39; if we are not going to get on even terms, or as nearly as possible on even terms, in regard to cost of construction, we ought to call a halt. Take the position of Inter-State shipping in Australia.. If Inter-State shipping in Australia were left to the Inter-State shipping companies, the people would be ina pretty bad position, because they have not the tonnage to deal with more than three-fourths of the trade under present conditions. The reason why the Inter-State shipping companies are not restoring prewar tonnage is that they are business men, and know that it will pay them infinitely better to wait until shipbuilding costs recede very considerably than to build at the present high-water mark of costs. Subsequent events have proved that, even to-day, they can buy tonnage at a very big percentage less than they can construct. </para>

                            <para>- Australian ship-owners do not, or will not, involve themselves in the cost of supplying tonnage up to pre-war figures, because they know it will pay them handsomely to wait until the cost of shipbuilding goes down. The Minister infers that it has not gone down yet.. At any rate, it is expected to come down, and&#39; it is the biggest certainty in the world that it will come down, as everything else will. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but it is difficult to buy new skips. Australian ship-owners know their business, and have refrained from building ships, which they want badly, because they could not run the Inter-State shipping if it were not for the Commonwealth withdrawing its oversea vessels to assist the Inter-State shipping. That is the position to-day. It is putting the Commonwealth in a very awkward position for the future. If they are waiting, and the Commonwealth withdraws its oversea vessels, which have been making a lot of money, and puts them into a trade where they will barely pay expenses of running- </para>

                            <para>- The point I emphasize is that if the Commonwealth does it when nobody else will, then, when normal conditions come, the Commonwealth will have to compete at a very great disadvantage. Incidentally the reduced profits of Commonwealth shipping are, to some extent, the result of the Commonwealth having to withdraw its ships from oversea work, and from the big profits they were making, in order to come and assist &#39;the Inter-State trade. I wish the Government to tell us their policy in this regard, and to state whether they are justified, on the very top of the market, when everybody knows that there is going to be a slump in every industry, in going on with ship construction, particularly if the industrial unions will not give a fair deal. If they do not, I hope the Prime Minister will keep the promise he has made to the House two or three times, and that he will not build another ship until they do. </para>

                        <para>.- The Prime Minister&#39;s Department seems to be one of those which grow with lightning rapidity. People often say that if the Government start a Department it will become a huge affair in a very little time. This Department started in a small way eight or nine years ago, and has certainly developed to very large dimensions. No doubt the war had a good deal to do with its rapid extension. I cannot see much use for it. I doubt if it ought ever to have existed. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> see nothing that it did throughout the war that could not have been just as well done by other Departments, with the addition of proper experts, at the time. </para>

                            <para>- It ought not. There is, strictly speaking, no portfolio of Prime Minister. The Department was started by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and there was really no reason for its creation. Strictly, it ought not to be there. However, it is there, and I should like to know from the Treasurer whether it is to be reduced. Now that the war .is over, are many of its activities and many of &#39;the matters with which it deals now, and which, more or less, fit themselves properly into other Departments, to be taken away from it, or done away with altogether&#93; Is the Prime Minister&#39;s Department to be cut down to a small affair again ? Last year the vote was &#163;199,000, and the expenditure &#163;309,000. This year the vote is &#163;304,000, and if the expenditure is to exceed the vote in the same proportion it. will reach &#163;500,000 before the twelve months are out. Now that the war is over, there is no need to extend the Department. It ought to be contracted, and, if it does contract, the staff ought to be reduced. I suppose the present staff are all members of the Public &#34;Service, and, if work cannot be found for them in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, they will have to be farmed out somewhere else. That is all right, but, when their term is up, there will be no need to appoint successors to them, whereas, if the Department continues in its present form it must grow. It will expand, but, if it were not there, the Commonwealth would be doing just as much effective work through the other Departments. If it remains, it will be &#39;carrying a lot of people who are quite unnecessary. It has been stated, by interjection today, that if we did away with the Department we should not save anything. I think we should save a good deal, for, if it were not for the Department being in existence to-day, all the work would be done with very much fewer hands through the other Departments. There would not be the same circumlocution and duplication in many ways, and we should certainly save a good deal of administrative expense. </para>

                    <para>An item of &#163;13,000 appears for the &#34; upkeep of Australia House.&#34; Last year the vote was &#163;9,000 and the expenditure &#163;12,600 odd. What is exactly involved in the upkeep of that establishment? Surely it has got into its stride? One would think that the cost of upkeep would not be on the increase. Last year &#163;320 was estimated for rent, and the expenditure amounted &#163;1,535. For the current year the Estimate is &#163;450. I should like to know what that item represents. Why is the salary of the Secretary to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department to be advanced to &#163;1,250 when the salaries of other departmental heads are increased only to &#163;1,000 or &#163;1,100? </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that, because there are various items which call for explanation. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> referred to the fact that the vote for last year was &#163;199,000, and the expenditure &#163;309,000. That increase is so startling that it re quires some explanation, not only of the increase &#91;itself, but also of the extraordinary blunder that must have been made in estimating the expenditure of the Department. If in any ordinary commercial concern that was at all worried as to what its outgoings would be, the expenditure actually exceeded the estimate by 50 per cent., a crisis would be at hand. That increase in expenditure should be explained to the Committee. I do not credit the suggestion that we may get another 50 per cent. increase on the estimate for the current year. If that does happen the position will be disastrous, because the expenditure will then be in the vicinity of &#163;450,000. I assume that the Pacific Islands will be administered by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, and, having regard to the obligations we have undertaken in respect of them the expenditure provided for on these Estimates is very small. The Committee should know exactly what is to be done in regard to those Possessions, and whether they are to be made self-supporting, and from their own revenue pay all administrative expenses, or whether the cost of their administration is to be met out of the revenue of the Commonwealth. The item for contingencies should be looked at carefully. Whilst it was estimated last year at &#163;12,000 the actual expenditure was &#163;18,000. If honorable members will take a careful survey of the Estimates they will notice that increased expenditure on contingencies is an unhappy habit that all Departments have developed. Invariably the estimated amount is exceeded, and a further vote becomes necessary. Some word of warning ought to be uttered that these additional amounts will not be voted without full inquiry as to the responsibility for the original underestimate. This practice creates a suspicion that the Departments are trying to hoodwink Parliament by placing on the Estimates the minimum amount, and trusting to luck to get a further vote when the original estimate is exceeded. The item for the maintenance of motor cars, including wages and expenses of chauffeurs, should bo explained. My experience has taught me that this is an item that one must watch, otherwise it will eat up a large sum of money. Last year, the House voted for this service &#163;1,250, but the expenditure totalled &#163;3,831, whilst the estimate for this year is &#163;3,500. I, personally, have on my shoulders responsibility for a garage containing between thirty and forty cars, and I know that, unless there is extraordinarily careful supervision, there is nothing that has the same power of eating up money as has a garage and all the accessories of motor cars. Amongst other items in regard to which we should have some information is the estimate for the Basic Wage Commission, which has already cost &#163;11,494. A further expenditure of &#163;10,000is provided for on the Estimates. When we are spending money at that rate we ought to have some statement as to the progress that is being made, and the indications of whether or not a useful purpose is likely to be served. There is an item of &#163;1,450 as a payment to the International Agricultural Institute at Rome. Is that recurring or non-recurring expenditure? It is hopeless for the Committee to try to deal with all the items in this Department. It is only possible to concentrate on a few which honorable members regard as hopelessly extravagant, and take a vote upon a proposal to reduce them. That is the only way in which we shall be able to do any good. For the travelling expenses of Commonwealth Ministers &#163;1,000 is set down. Everybody will agree that Ministers should be recouped all expenses they incur while travelling on the business of the country. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. This is a new item on the Estimates, but I think expenditure of this character should be considered on the basis of what is reasonable and useful. It is items of this kind, which, though small in themselves, in the aggregate inflate the Estimates to startling figures. The Audit Office shows an increase of &#163;6,000 in the expenditure on salaries, but there is a compensating feature in a saving of &#163;3,250 in respect of temporary assistance. Is there the same requirement for the services of the Audit Department as there was during the period of enormous war expenditure? Although the expenditure is reduced very little this year, it is mainly represented by large items rather than those detailed items that require the constant attention of an audit staff. I doubt whether the reduction that is shown is all that could have been effected under existing circumstances. In the Governor-General&#39;s Department, &#163;2,500 is set down for official telegrams and postage, although the expenditure last year was &#163;4,207. Is that merely a recklessly optimistic estimate which we have no hope of realizing ? Although the war is over., the relations between the Mother Country and Australia are daily becoming closer, and there are more matters of detail to be dealt with by letter and cable. Therefore, I doubt very much whether the reduction that is estimated will be effected. In connexion with the High Commissioner&#39;s Office there are numerous items to which I do not wish to refer in detail, but again there seems to be a rather optimistic estimate that temporary assistance and typists will cost only &#163;1,000 this year as against an actual expenditure last year of &#163;10,704. The estimate for last year was &#163;4,500, which was exceeded by over &#163;6,000. I should think that there must be this year a similar increase on the estimate. For advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, the estimated expenditure is &#163;3,400, the same as the vote for last year. But surely advertising is an activity that will come under the control of the immigration authorities to a large extent when they are established? </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that advertising is one service that certainly should be transferred to the immigration authorities. It is beyond the power of anybody to offer any suggestion in regard to Commonwealth shipbuilding and the Commonwealth Government line of steamers. Whilst it may be necessary for these items of expenditure to be included in the Estimates, they can convey nothing to any honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- The point I want to stress is that these expenditures are incurred, and that we should be in a position to receive the fullest information regarding the operations of. all such ventures as the Commonwealth Shipping line or ship construction branch. I suggest that, unless something is done to place before honorable members the fullest particulars, we shall &#39;have to take a more emphatic course. By requesting complete information, I do not mean information such as the type of detail generally supplied concerning Government industrial matters. In regard to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, for example, we have been furnished with an infinity of detail which must have cost considerable money, time, and trouble to compile. Yet, all those details afforded no real information after one had laboured through the mass in search of what was wanted. All Government ventures should be treated as would be any private undertaking. That is to say, the persons responsible should furnish a balance-sheet showing tue amount of capital put in by the Government, the assets held by the enterprise against that advance, and the profit and loss. We should be able to learn, at any time, what profit, if any, has actually been made by the venture in question during the financial period under review. </para>

                            <para>- The Government who will not regard such requests are heading for disaster. This year there has been put down a- sum of &#163;3,000,000 with which to construct ships. We would constitute a feeble Parliament if - after having agreed to that amount being lent to the Government shipbuilding venture - we failed to secure full information when the  time came to consider where our money had gone, what had been done with it, and what amount of return we might reasonably look for. </para>

                    <para>Another matter requiring imperative consideration is, as to whether great enterprises, such as those to which I have been alluding, should continue to be controlled by one or two men. In all these concerns there are. at the most, but two minds, namely, that of the Minister and of the responsible head of the Department; and it remains with the Minister, in the last resort, to determine the whole question of policy in regard to a concern which is bigger than almost any private enterprise in Australia. What would be the conditions if these ventures were privately financed and controlled? Would any private enterprise care to place the matter of policy and of management in the hands and at the mercy of one individual, so that success or failure would depend solely upon his brains, or lack of them ? If we are to continue to run a Commonwealth line of vessels and a Commonwealth shipbuilding enterprise as an ordinary trading or commercial venture, there must be a change of control, so that our Commonwealth money shall not depend for  its  safekeeping and wellbeing upon the mind of one man more or less adequately equipped to hold such authority and responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that we should be furnished with particulars defining, for example, the Commissioner&#39;s actual duties and responsibilities, and that we should be informed, also, how far successful or otherwise his activities have been. Opportunity should be given Parliament to consider th.e, question of trade commissioners as a whole. To-day Australia is iu a very fortunate position in that whatever she can offer the world in the line of primary produce is. generally, readily absorbed. Here, though, I should not forget to mention that we are now witnessing the turn of the tide with respect to our lower grade wool. Our fortunate position will not continue indefinitely. Let us consider our great commodity which has so stood by. us, and is coming to our rescue more emphatically than ever, and which will be our salvation in the future. I refer to wheat. It is a matter of extraordinary good fortune that we should be in a position to dispose of our wheat, and obtain not merely a good, but a really high, price for it. I had considered that when the war was over it  would be almost impossible for us to dispose of our wheat. I had in mind the extremely high prices ruling, and the fact that more land than ever before would be put under wheat. This was actually occurring in the Argentine, and in Canada, and the United States of America. Even the cotton lands of the southern States, valuable as they were for cotton production, were being put under wheat because growers were attracted by the prices which would be available to them. I had considered, therefore - and so had very many others - that so soon as the war was over there would be an enormous recrudescence of wheat-growing. I had thought that practically the whole of Europe would be sown for wheat again, instead of which, however, we have witnessed the outbreak of more wars, and have learned of even less production than during the worst of the war years. The whole of Russia&#39;s supplies, for instance, have been cut off from the markets of the world, or the Russian fields have not been sown; but had Europe gone in for wheat-growing upon the enormous scale which was reasonably expected, we would not have been able to give our Australian wheat away overseas within a matter of eighteen months or two years from the termination of the war. That position, even now, is likely to arise some day; and we should not forget that, of all the wheat-producing countries, we are the furthest from the European market. It is imperative, therefore, that we. should try to open up the East as the great source of disposal for our wheat. With China turning every day more and more from a rice-consuming to a wheat-consuming country, Australia has probably a better opportunity than any other part of the world to dispose of her wheat in the East. There, however, we have not been watching our interests. We have not appointed commissioners or agents; and, if we do not soon do so, then, despite the fact that we are the nearest wheat-producing country and the most readily able to furnish supplies, our chance will have been lost. </para>

Then, again, there is the factor of the opening of the Panama Canal; that great work was not in existence at the time of the Minister&#39;s inquiries. However, I merely desire to raise the point at this appropriate opportunity, and to stress that we must consider the policy of furnishing Australian trade representatives, or commissioners, in the East. Even if it should involve additional expenditure, it is imperative that, in the near future, this question should be taken up. </para>

                    <para>I apologize for having gone into considerable detail upon specific items, but my purpose has been directed to pointing out the grave danger arising from careless underestimation. We should draw attention to some of the items, and utter a warning that we intend to look with a critical eye upon all suggestions that the Estimates be increased merely for the reason that, in the original furnishing of estimates, an underestimation was made. There is little reason or justification for underestimating. We should be able to look for some relief from this source by means of reduction rather than that we should have to consider increases solely because departmental officials have not provided a fair statement of estimated requirements. </para>

                        <para>. - The salary tor the Australian Commissioner in America is set down - I note - at &#163;3,000 in one line of the Estimates, and, in another, an allowance of &#163;2,000 is provided. There is a similar sum in different columns, with respect to the salary of his secretary, and in regard to other items. This  is a small matter which, I think, requires clearing up. Concerning the Commissioner himself, and his duties in America, the Government might well furnish a full statement of particulars: Who is this gentleman, and &#39;what is he doing in America? What is the nature of his staff, and what is the establishment generally- costing? A friend of mine, who arrived in Australia a fortnight ago from America, said he did not know where to find the Australian Commissioner. Eventually, after considerable inquiry and search, &#39;he discovered him in the eighth story of a building; but practically nobody knew where he was or what he was doing. What is the Commissioner doing for .the benefit of Australia? The cost of his establishment in the United States of America is set down here at &#163;12,000. It is a large item. Is it justified, or is it likely to be justified ? </para>

                        <para>.- Without unreasonable delay Parliament should be acquainted with the future intentions of the Government concerning shipbuilding. It is of no use to carry on in an uncertain fashion, because that policy would only discourage people who have put large sums of money into the business. They did so because it was understood to be the policy of the Government to encourage and continue the industry in Australia. It has been remarked that the difficulty has been to build as cheaply here as in Great Britain. At present vessels cannot be built more cheaply in the United Kingdom than we are able to- build here. We understand that the policy of the Government is to encourage shipbuilding for the future, and that it is intended to deflect 25 per cent, of import duty in connexion with vessels to arrive for Inter-State service after a given date. Even if the cost of const-ruction in the United Kingdom, or in other parts of the world, were to drop, the outcome of this imposition, amounting to 25 per cent.-, would still favour the construction of shipping in the Commonwealth. We know that vessels are now required around our coasts, and that there is not sufficient tonnage available. If no ships of light draught are built or brought into Australian waters during the immediate future, then, during the next sugar season in Queensland, there will not be sufficient shipping to handle the commodity. There is a certain class of vessel of low draught which is suitable for this trade, but we have not sufficient of that tonnage available now. Something should be done now to insure our getting the sugar away from Queensland ports as speedily as possible after manufacture. There is no room to accumulate large stocks safely at the different ports in Queensland; and, if the sugar is left stacked there for any length . of time, it may be considerably damaged, if not utterly destroyed, by cyclones or floods. I am giving this information to the Treasurer because I think that, in matters of this kind, we should make provision in advance. I should like the right honorable gentleman r;&#62; know what one firm alone has done as the result of entering into a contract for the manufacture of a certain class of steamers.

                        <para>To show how important it is that there should be a definite programme extending over a period of several years, I desire to point out that before we could do a single thing towards starting on&#39; the present contract for four ships for the Commonwealth Government we had to lay down slips, pile same, amounting to hundreds of piles, erect uprights and staging, manufacture machines, such as punching and shearing machines, hydraulic and manhole punching machines, bending machines, rolls, furnaces, bending blocks, scrieve boards, mould loft and plant, and machines of all descriptions. This has been done at an expense of something like &#163;40,000. This is only on preparatory work, and has nothing to do with the actual building of the ships. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am sure honorable members will see that if all this money has to be expended for the purpose of making these slips effective for the construction of vessels, the owners of the slips should be informed as soon as possible of what is to be the future policy of the Government. To make a success of shipbuilding in Australia it is absolutely essential to give confidence to both employer and employee; that the Government should have a defence programme extending over a period of years to encourage private firms to thoroughly equip, and enable them to compete in the open market with Great Britain, Japan and America. It would also help to steady the workmen . We have an assurance from Ministers in the imposition of an extra duty upon the importation of vessels that they intend that ships shall be constructed here. But we do not see any steam-ship companies taking part in the construction of the vessels which will be required by the Commonwealth within the next year or two. I ask the Treasurer whether he can say when the shipbuilding policy of the Government will be announced to the country, so that &#39;the necessary preparations may be made, and these people may know precisely where they stand. If we give a guarantee to them which will extend over a definite period, we shall naturally get work done very much cheaper than we can get &#34; catch &#34; work done, such as obtains at present. In Newcastle, we are encouraging large steel works to produce plates for the construction of ships; and, naturally, if they are to incur an enormous expense to enable then* &#39;to provide plates 6 feet wide, they should have some assurance that those plates will be utilized promptly within the Commonwealth. Otherwise, the money which they are expending to provide the necessary facilities to produce the plates will be practically unproductive. Recently I visited the steel works in Newcastle, and had a talk with the manager there. From&#39; him I learned that the cost of manufacturing these plates is a very considerable one, and that the company is trusting to the Commonwealth Government to put forward a shipbuilding policy which will warrant the expenditure which it is now incurring. That policy should be made public as soon as possible in order that shipbuilders may know exactly where they stand. </para>

                        <para>. - In the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, I notice an item which reads. &#39; Australian Commissioner in the -United States of America, &#163;10,S90,&#34; and I observe that this represents a decrease of &#163;4,837 upon the vote for last year. Just as I entered the chamber, the honorable, member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was making a reference to this particular item. I certainly think that the Com.mittee is entitled to further information in regard to it;, but I wish to go a step further. The Prime Minister intimated, some little time ago,, that a departure was about to be made, in regard to which I take the strongest exception. He proposes that there shall be a diplomatic representative of Australia at Washington, and I believe that his idea is founded upon action which has been taken by Canada, which Dominion has nominated a representative in that city. But whatever justification there may be for the appointment of such a Commissioner by Canada, by reason of its contiguity to the &#34;United States- of America, and of the fact that a great many questions will arise as between those two countries, there can be no justification whatever for the appointment of a diplomatic representative of Australia to Washington. As a matter of fact the questions which will arise in that connexion, as between Australia and America, will be very few indeed. Such questions, if they have arisen in the past, have been settled in the most satisfactory manner through the Foreign Office of the British Government. Of course, the British Government have their Embassy in the United States of America - an Embassy which is fully equipped with all possible information, and which exerts a vast influence. Necessarily, it is in a position to deal with any questions which may arise as between Australia and America in an infinitely better way than we could deal with them. The experience of the past is such as to suggest to us the desirableness of continuing the existing system of diplomatic unity so far as the British Empire is concerned. I can quite understand even the possibility in the_ future of the Dominions agreeing amongst themselves to representation side by side with the British Embassy at Washington. That course may be desirable, working, of course, hand in hand with the British Embassy. All the Dominions may be so represented. But I do not say that that course is necessary, nor do I think that it is. I can, however, understand a movement amongst the Dominions in that direction. But for Australia to attempt to establish a diplomatic representative in America would be a grave mistake, and would constitute a serious departure from the diplomatic unity of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- I did  not know  that. But I know that the Prime Minister has intimated his intention of introducing a Bill having for its object the appointment of a diplomatic representative of Australia at Washington. I protest against this step on the ground that it will be a wanton and unnecessary act in these days of economy. That, however, is a minor matter as compared with the more important consideration, which is that such a step would involve a departure from the diplomatic unity of the Empire, and would result in complications which we at present can scarcely realize. The possibility of Australia speaking with a different voice from that of the Mother Country would inevitably result in conflict. This is a matter which should not be decided with: any degree of hastiness. I desire, therefore, to be assured that there is not included in this item of &#163;10,890 any money towards the establishment of a diplomatic representative in America. I would urge that, if this matter is to be dealt with at all, it should be dealt with by the Dominions at the approaching Constitutional Imperial Conference. Hitherto we have rejoiced in our ability to speak with a united voice so far as the Empire is concerned. But, if a departure of this kind is to be made, and if we are to cease conducting our diplomatic relations .through the Foreign Office of the Mother Country, we shall certainly embroil ourselves, and also the Empire, quite unnecessarily. I cannot conceive what can be the justification for such a suggestion on the part of the Prime Minister. There is, however, a good deal to be said for the appointment in other parts of the world of &#39;Trade Commissioners, who would aim at the development of the commercial and trading interests of Australia. That is very desirable, and the functions of the Australian Commissioner who has already been appointed to the United States of America might well be extended, .so as to make them more embracing, with that objective in view.  But  when it comes to a matter of # the conduct of diplomatic relations on&#39; behalf of Australia, the position is entirely different. </para>

                            <para>- Hitherto I have refrained from criticising our unfortunate position in regard to the High Commissioner&#39;s Office in the Mother Country. That office is certainly no credit to Australia, and, indeed, has constituted a very serious difficulty. The utter inefficiency of that Department during the war period, so far as trade and commerce is concerned, was very marked. It was in a condition of such hopeless confusion that we were quite unable to get any business satisfactorily transacted there. My object in rising was to ask for an assurance from the Treasurer that this item for &#163;10,890 does not include  any  contemplated expenditure in regard to the appointment of a diplomatic representative at Washington. </para>

                        <para>.- In dealing&#39; with this Department - now that the debate upon the want of confidence -motion has been concluded - I hope that honorable members will take an independent stand in regard to any items upon the Estimates which they may consider exhibit a lack of appreciation of the urgent need which exists for the exercise of the most stringent economy. I have no desire to embarrass the Government or the Treasurer, but I do think that, with the enormous responsibilities with which we are faced, it is our duty to reduce our expenditure as much as we reasonably can. I am no advocate for. foolish economy ; there are many ways in which we can advertise and build up this country, and it would be foolish not to spend money for that purpose. I may be wrong, of course, but. in mv opinion, I think that the Prime Minister&#39;s Department should not be regarded as a general administrative Department. The Prime Minister himself has duties so multifarious that he cannot give that attention to his administrative work that Ministers of other Departments are able to give. It must not be forgotten that the Prime Minister&#39;s Department is not really a Department, but  merely  a branch, which has grown up recently, and particularly during the war. Now it, perhaps, may be described as a huge administrative Department with many sub-Departments. There has not been that building up in connexion with this Department that there has been in connexion with the others, which have taken years to grow, and have produced  specially-trained  officers. For instance, under the Department for Home and Territories quite a number of sub-Departments have been gradually built up. and the same remark applies to other Departments : but in the case of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department its growth has been sudden, and has not produced that wealth of experience we find elsewhere. In saying this I have no desire to reflect on  any  of the officers, beyond saying that  they  have not the advantage of that life-time experience which is at the service of other Departments. The other  day  the Treasurer asked for instances of where the Prime Minister&#39;s Department had interfered with other Departments. It is a fact that, not content with the control of matters strictly within its purview under the Estimates, the Prime Minister&#39;s Department and the Attorney-General&#39;s Dement have  continually  interfered with other work. As an illustration, the question of the export of metals ought to be under the sole control of the Department of Trade and Customs; yet when I refer, in connexion with this matter, to the Minister for Trade and Customs, I am told that it comes within the scope of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. Why should the Attorney-General&#39;s Department interfere in such a matter? Of course, I can understand the Minister for Trade and Customs seeking legal advice from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, but there should not be the present administrative interference. Then the Prime Minister&#39;s Department has interfered with and used in this connexion the Australian Metal Exchange. A little while ago, some people desided to export scrap iron from Western Australia, and the whole of the subsequent trouble arose through the interference of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department and the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, though, of course, it is a matter for the Department of Trade and Customs. In the case of sugar, we find  Colonel Oldershaw,  an official of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, assuming control, although the Minister for Trade and Customs meets deputations and makes promises, not only to people outside, but to honorable members of this House? In reference to any commodity or works, there ought to be definite control of these matters by definite Departments. For instance, shipbuilding should be at once taken from the administration of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department and placed under the Minister for Home and Territories. </para>

                    <para>It is understood that the Government propose to appoint Trade Commissioners; and, if these appointments mean what was indicated by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir</inline> Robert Best), then, of course, they should be under the control of the Prime Minister. If it is the intention of the Government to appoint a number of such Commissioners, Ministers ought to take honorable members into their confidence and explain how it is proposed by this means to build up the trade of Australia. I quite agree with the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> that it is possible to create a big export trade with Eastern countries. Recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Kingsmill,  President  of the Legislative Council of Western Australia, after a visit to the north and east, published a most interesting report showing the great possibilities in this direction. </para>

                            <para>- I impress on the Government the danger of appointing any representatives, either in America or elsewhere, with ambassadorial powers, for in such appointments there is an element of grave danger which may cause irretrievable injury to Australia and the Empire. However, we have no knowledge that it is really the intention of the Government to appoint Commissioners of the kind at the present time; and I only hope that they will not do so, for I should feel compelled to strongly oppose the proposal. With Trade Commissioners, pure and simple, some good could be done in building up the trade of Australia. If these appointments are made with discretion, and a proper scheme of advertising entered upon, particularly in the Eastern countries, and, perhaps, in other parts of the world, much good might be done. However, as I was saying, the Prime Minister&#39;s Department is growing enormously. I understand the mover of the amendment will withdraw it so as to enable the items to be dealt with separately. There are one or two subjects which I think the Committee might deal with in a very drastic manner, and in connexion with which we should have some explanation from the Minister. It is my intention, at the proper time, to get the opinion of the Committee as to whether or not it would be wise to transfer some of the Government activities from the Prime Minister&#39;s Department to that of some other Minister.&#34; I have urged previously that this should not be the main administrative Department of the Commonwealth. I hope the Committee will agree, for instance, to place shipbuilding under the control of another Minister. Then there is the question of mail services, and the Port Pirie wharfs. There is no reason at all why these matters should come under the control of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. The&#39; Minister for Home and Territories has been dealing with shipping for a long time, and understands his work. I hope, therefore, that these matters will come under his control. </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to say anything concerning the High Commissioner himself, but I think we have not received anything like the satisfaction we are entitled to expect from the enormous expenditure incurred in that Department, the sum spent last year being over &#163;63,000, to which must be added the salary of the High Commissioner himself. I agree with the remarks made by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> that we ought to get from revenue any money required for that office building. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The honorable member will find the item in the Loan Estimates for this year. Undoubtedly there was heavier expenditure in the High Commissioner&#39;s Office during the war owing to the necessity of looking after the interests of Australians at Home, and I make no comment as to the cost of temporary assistance; but we are now back to normal times, and the expenditure incurred by this office is greatly in excess of the value received.&#39; The High Commissioner&#39;s Office, like the  Agents&#39;-General  Departments, should be a fine trading establishment. The Agent-General for Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J.</inline> Connolly, has been doing wonderful work in England. </para>

Unfortunately, I see no attempt on the part of the Commonwealth High Commissioner&#39;s Department to do as well for Australia as a whole as the Agent-General for Western Australia is doing for his State. And that is what we want. I should expect a fortnightly letter from the High Commissioner telling the people of Australia about the possibilities of trade development in the Mother Country, and how far he was helping in that direction. </para>

In my judgment, the High Commissioner ShOuld control them. He is the gentleman to whom we look for protection of our interests in the Mother Country. It is possible that an immigration officer might paint too rosy a picture of the conditions in Australia. The High Commissioner should be able to control and advise the Commonwealth Government if good work is being done in connexion with our immigration policy. I am greatly in favour  of immigration,  but  I do not want  it  to be possible for any immigrant to be able to say honestly that he has been brought out here under false pretences. </para>

                    <para class="block">The High &#39;Commissioner&#39;s Office is costing more than double what  it  should cost, judging the value of the work done  by  the benefits accruing to Australia, and I  am  hopeful  that  the Committee  will  consent to this reduction as an intimation that the Office must be re-organized in accordance with the wishes of honorable members. The item &#34; Medical Officer, &#163;S00,&#34; I think, could very well be struck out, because, as apparently there are only twenty-three persons in the Office of the High Commissioner, there seems to be no need for the services of a medical officer. No explanation has been !given -in regard to the item of &#163;5,000 for &#34; stationery, travelling, and incidental expenses.&#34; This seems a large amount, but this, again, is an item which, I think, could very well be reduced. Another item which appears excessive is &#34;Upkeep of Australia House, &#163;13,000.&#34; Last week, I mentioned that Australia House had become, to a great extent, a place of amusement, and it is quite evident that, if we are to maintain for the benefit of our officials in London, and the few Australians temporarily there, a house at which they can obtain amusement, the cost of upkeep will be heavy, but this, again, is an item which, I think, could very well be reduced, particularly as it does not include taxation or the salary of the caretaker. There is another item of &#163;3,400, for &#34;advertising resources of Commonwealth/&#39; Does any honorable member claim that we are getting value for the expenditure of this money? In any case, I hardly see the necessity for spending &#163;3,400 in advertising the resources- of the Commonwealth when we are informed that &#163;100,000 has been placed in these Estimates for immigration, and that we are sending agents to Great Britain to advertise Australia with a view to securing more immigrants. In my opinion, the best place to advertise Australia, if we wish to encourage immigration, is in Australia. The people of the Commonwealth will always .be &#39;willing to pay for efficiency, but I do not think that many of us can claim that efficiency has been displayed in the Office of the High Commissioner to the value of &#163;53,974. I hope that the decision of the Committee will be an indication to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen that the opinion of honorable members is that the expenditure on the High Commissioner&#39;s Office must be reduced. It is&#39; a task which ought to be undertaken by the High Commissioner himself, and I trust that the next gentleman appointed  to the position will receive definite instructions from the Government that the expense of his Office must not he anything like what it is to-day. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech of the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> is an example of what frequently faces one in a Committee of this kind. The honorable member knows all about the matter before he rises to speak, and, after moving for a reduction of the vote by over &#163;8,000, directs his attention to certain items on which he considers there should be retrenchment, but about all of which he confesses he knows nothing. </para>

                            <para>- I was in Australia House as frequently as my friend was, and I did not see any of those amusements to which he has made reference; yet, because it happens that at some time or another a dance was held there, the place must be written down as having been given over to that sort of thing. Such criticism is very unfair, and has neither sense nor intelligence in it. The honorable member might just as well say that because a dinner is held occasionally in Queen&#39;s Hall, this House of Parliament is given over to amusement, or is merely a place of refreshment. Such an assertion would not be fair, nor are the remarks of the honorable member fair as applied to Australia House. When I was in London, there was a steady stream of visitors to Australia House all day long, and this place, which was supposed to have been given over to amusement, was then filled with war memorials. </para>

                            <para>- No; but it does not follow that the space they occupied is in future to be used as a dance room. To declare that the incidental occurrence of a dance in the building, a mere once in its history, converts it into a place of amusement as a normal condition of affairs is not fair criticism. We have built in London a house which cost &#163;1,000,000, and my conviction is that it is worth &#163;1,000,000 a year to Australia, even if it does little more than exist as a building. No one can go through the Strand without stopping to look at it and inquire what it is, to whom it belongs, and all about Australia. Therefore, as an advertisement alone, it is worth an immense amount of money to us. It houses activities connected with the Customs Department, and our Naval and Military affairs. We have a Navy officer, who is the liaison officer between the Commonwealth Government and the Imperial Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Woolnough,</inline> one of the best officers who has been sent from our University, inspects our machinery before it is despatched to Australia. We must have officers to make inquiries concerning our naval requirements and keep in. touch, as far as possible, with what goes on at the Admiralty. These officers are necessary and useful, and are such as we should have in London. </para>

                    <para>May I remind honorable members that the State Governments are similarly represented, as they have their scientific men to advise what should be purchased. If honorable members are going to dispense with these officers, they had better start an agitation for the State Governments to act similarly, and so maroon Australia that no business at all will be done. These representatives are selected because of their special qualifications and service, but because they are out of sight and, generally, out of mind, some begin to think that they are perfectly useless, and are doing nothing but drawing their salaries. These men. are busily engaged throughout the year in performing useful work for the Commonwealth, and earn their money by working earnestly, laboriously, and sincerely in the interest of Australia just as if they were right under our eyes. The mere fact that we do not visit Australia House as we do other Departments does not prove that these officers are not performing useful work, administratively and scientifically. Australia House is an imposing structure, accommodating a number of activities, all of which are of use to the Commonwealth, and we could not dispense with these activities in relation to the Navy or Army without decreasing the efficiency of those services. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Honorable members can obtain all the information concerning the activities of Australia House in that document, and it would be much better if they perused the report, because we would not then have so much criticism. We shall receive in rents from various State Governments and from other tenants occupying rooms in the building during the year, &#163;23,400. The estimated net cost of maintenance is &#163;34,128. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It must be remembered, however, that if we were not occupying offices in Australia House we would have to rent accommodation elsewhere, the estimated cost of which would be &#163;30,000 a year. There is interest and other items connected with Australia House, and honorable members must make up their minds whether the expense of this agency in London, set against the whole activities of the Commonwealth, is worth, the money or not. For instance, every day Australia House is besieged by persons who go from Australia to London, and, on an average, there is a colony of 3,000 Australians in London. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable member has; but I could quote opinions quite contrary to those which he would doubtless instance. These gentlemen have, perhaps, been to Australia House, and have not been treated in what they consider a proper manner. The honorable member could probably criticise the treatment shown to visitors in other Government Departments in&#39; Australia, because, occasionally, persons visiting Commonwealth Departments here do not always receive the courtesy and consideration to which they think they are entitled. It is so in connexion with the 3,000 Australians who are perpetually in London. I do not suggest that the same 3,000 persons are there the whole time, but on an average there are 3,000 Australians in England who go to Australia House in search of all kinds of information. It is quite possible that some visitors return without having gained all they desired. </para>

                    <para>There are many who go to Australia House to obtain particulars concerning Australia and its commercial interests, and altogether, the Commonwealth Offices are serving a very useful purpose in that respect. Honorable members must not lose sight of the fact that immigration is going on all the time, even when no special effort is in progress, because ships are continually bringing new settlers to Australia. All these people are dealt with at Australia House, and the fact that our officers there are conducting a publicity campaign, and facilitating the movements of these people, is one reason why the steady stream continues. We are now proposing to accelerate that flow, and instead of immigrants coming in driblets we hope, with improved organization, to considerably increase the number. We do not see or hear of all that is being done, but that is no reason why we should say that our representatives are not doing anything. . </para>

                    <para>As to the upkeep of Australia House, I may remind honorable members that the cost of maintaining any institution in London is naturally very heavy. Included in the items under this heading electric light and power amounts to &#163;2,500 a year. Other items are the supply of coke, &#163;1,500 a year, wages &#163;6,000, war bonus &#163;1,500. The total is also made up of a multitude of small items which include rates and taxes house requisites, engineering and joinery repairs, electric clocks, automatic telephones, and there is an item of &#163;30 for window breakages. I do not know what they have been doing to incur that expenditure; but that is a sample of the items for upkeep. </para>

                            <para>- That relates to a vacancy in the office that has arisen owing to the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> who has been in London for many years acting as medical referee for the Government, inspecting immigrants, and supervising the medical work in connexion with their despatch from London. It is not a new office. As to the general activities of the Department, I would like to remind honorable members of what is an undoubted fact that we spend a great deal less in this respect, considering our population, than any other country in the world.Honorable members know quite well that Sweden, and the Netherlands - very small communities - have their officers in Australia, and if they consider it desirable to be represented in an outpost of the world such as this it should surely pay us to have our officers in the great metropolis overseas. The same remark will apply to the United States of America; and Canada, again, has to my knowledge had a Commissioner in Australia for the past twenty years, and would not maintain a representative here if her people did not find that it paid them to do so. </para>

                            <para>- There are twenty-three provided for in these Estimates; but there are also the other activities that I have mentioned. We have a Naval staff and a Military staff in London. Colonel Buckley is our military representative, a business man of independent means, who was one of the best officers we ever had in the Defence Department here. He is a well-to-do man, but in London, as in Australia, he keeps at his post for sheer love of the work. There is not a harder worker in London than he. </para>

He has been in London for a good many years now, and conducts campaigns to assist immigration and the general advertising of the resources of Australia. Work of this kind is going on all the year round, and to assess its value aright it would be necessary to investigate its effects upon the relations between Australia and the United Kingdom, and the benefits it confers upon this community in all sorts of ways. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so; but circumstances have been entirely altered by the war. Our status in the Empire requires us to maintain a Minister for External Affairs, as do also our responsibilities in the Pacific and our connexion with the League of Nations. It must not be forgotten that the Commonwealth started with a Department of External Affairs. That Department has been merged in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. Criticise him as you may, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has, during the past twelve months, since his return from Europe, saved this country many hundreds of thousands of pounds by keeping the industrial peace. That is an activity centred in his Department. It is fortunate that we have had some one with his long experience of seafaring men to deal with our shipbuilding difficulties. In considering results, the troubles from which we have escaped by reason of what has been done by the Prime Minister should not be forgotten. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made to the Island mail service, the vote for which is increased this year by &#163;18,000. That increase is due to an enlargement of the scope of the mail service and to increases in costs of running generally. Where should that expenditure be provided for if not in the Estimates of the External Affairs Department? The service is to provide communication with the Islands, which are to be administered by that Department. Take, again, shipbuilding, which does not cost the taxpayer of this country a penny. The items under that bead are merely advances to trust funds, and are balanced by the profits. </para>

The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> said, &#34; We must not build any more ships if we cannot build them as cheaply as they can be built elsewhere,&#34; but another honorable member said, &#34; We must build ships anyhow, because without them we cannot move our produce.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- So far, ships have been built as cheaply here as they could have been built elsewhere. I do not say that that will continue for all time, though I hope that it may. The amalgamation of our shipbuilding and the placing of it under one control is in contemplation. &#34;We are&#34; going to take the control from the Navy Department, and I hope that thereby a big saving will be effected. We intend to get the best commercial management, and there seems no reason why we should not be able to build ships as cheaply as they can be built overseas, though there is no reason for criticism on that score at the present time. I agree with those who say that the strictest commercial tests should foe applied to the work done. One of the chief things is to maintain industrial peace, which happily we have been able to do during the past two years. Efficiency, continuity of operations, and industrial contentment and peace are essentials. That we have been able to keep industrial peace is largely due to the Prime Minister, who has ways of dealing with industrialists when he can meet them face to face such as few other men possess. </para>

                            <para>- I am not flattering him; I am speaking the truth. I have been with him on these Conferences, and I say that few men could do better with the industrialists of this country than he does. The results are to be seen in our shipyards to-day. We must, therefore, recollect that there have been advantages flowing from the Prime Minister&#39;s dealings in these matters, and that they more than offset any disadvantages. I admit at the same time that the Prime Minister is always doing the work of three or four men. It is his way, but he does it efficiently and well. While there have been innumerable strikes during the past twelve months in nearly every other country, we have been kept almost wholly free from them. A great deal of the credit for that happy state of affairs is due to the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>As to shipbuilding, the salient points are these: We want ships. We have these two yards of our own, and we must do something with them. They are manned by efficient staffs, and, when they are amalgamated, I believe we shall still be able to produce ships in Australia as cheaply as elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the question of agencies abroad, to which, perhaps, I ought to have referred when dealing with Australia House. I have only to say that, in this regard, again, we are very much behind the rest of the world. Take, for instance, America. One finds that nearly every small community has official representation there. When the Prime Minister and I passed through the United States of America, on our way Home, we found that Australia had no one to represent her there. One illustration will show the need of having some one on the spot. Our shipbuilding here was being held up for want of plates which we had purchased in America. When the authorities of the United States of America entered upon their shipbuilding business they cancelled our order for plates, and we were left without supplies to complete our ships. We had no one there to put our case. Our only means of communication was through the British Embassy, and the British Embassy had then, as it always has, tremendous commercial interests of its own, and as much as it could do to look after its own affairs. We found, on the other hand, that Canada had twelve of the best business men to be found in the Dominion operating all the time in the United States of America. In Washington we had not a representative; the position was the same in New York. Canada and every other country had agencies there, but we were entirely without representation. Honorable members must make up their minds as to whether these agencies pay. The experience of other countries is that they pay handsomely, and they are being multiplied all over the world. If it pays Canada to maintain an agency here at the Seat of Government, and to have a separate office in every State of the Commonwealth it should pay us to have at least some representation in a country like America. </para>

He says that we need to get into much closer touch with America than we have been. It is to our business, as well as our diplomatic and political advantage, to do so. The United States of America is one of the great Powers abutting on the Pacific. We have to get into closer touch with her, politically as well as commercially, and the closer the intimacy we can breed and perpetuate with her, the better for our future safety, as well as for our future prosperity. </para>

                    <para>Then, again, take the East. It has been well said that we are building here a Western nation with an Eastern trade outlook. I believe that to be true. The East in time will become, perhaps, our best customer for our raw products, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that we should have representatives in all these countries where there is business to be done. Honorable members must not imagine when they see, for this purpose, a proposed vote of &#163;10,000 on the Estimates that there is no credit to be set against it. The credit may even be intangible; it may be impossible to locate it, but it is none the less there. If we create an atmosphere of commercial intimacy, knowledge, and commercial amity, that in itself is worth more than we pay, to say nothing of the tangible results which from time to time express themselves in our imports and exports. In all these matters we must make up our minds that the authorities in other countries are not fools. They know what is to their advantage, and we cannot do better than follow in the footsteps of the most enlightened nations of the earth, who are multiplying instead of decreasing these agencies. We have only to see that good men are selected for these positions. If a man is selected for any one of them, and he cannot make more out of it for the country than his salary and expenses, he is not worth much. </para>

The United States of America is a tremendously big country, and in travelling through it one finds that some of the big nations have agencies in nearly every State. It pays them to have them. We have, as I have said, only one in New York. We want in addition one in Washington, who would be able to look after, not merely the commercial and material side, but also our political interests. </para>

                            <para>- I think so; but it does not necessarily follow that we are interfering with the ultimate unity and efficiency of our Empire diplomacy when we put our Australian view to the Government at Washington just as other nations making up the Empire are doing. Canada has, and has had for a long time, her representative at Washington. She proposed last year to alter his status and to make him an Ambassador, but I think she has deferred that proposal pending discussion at the Imperial Conference next year. Something should be done by us to establish an agency at Washington, in addition to one at New York. That is an imperative necessity of the moment, and it would pay Australia over and over again to assent to it, even if the cost should be very much more than our present agency. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The High Commissioner will be wise in giving a new man who knows his job his head, but, at the same time, the final control must be with the High Commissioner. If we can galvanize that section of our activities in the Old Country into still greater activity, it will be worth all the money we propose to spend in that direction. It is a vital necessity. As I have said before, we must people or perish. We have not enough people to hold this country or to meet readily and easily our financial and other obligations as they arise. To people this country should be the chief objective of any Government which holds office, and the moment it neglects that duty it should be removed from office. </para>

                    <para>I, therefore, suggest to my honorable friend who has submitted this amendment that he should allow it to stand over until next year. By that time the reorganizations already in process will have been made, and when the honorable member sees what has been done he will be able to criticise it. I have no doubt whatever he will have a very much better view of it than he has to-night. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable member is, since no man in his position can know all that is doing in Australia House. It has always seemed to me to be somewhat unfortunate that Australia House is so far away. It is out of sight, and very often, I am afraid, out of mind. It is only when we see the cost of it on the Estimates that we begin to wonder whether it is doing anything. </para>

                        <para>. - The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has given us a really excellent description of the work that ought to be done by the High Commissioner&#39;s Office. Unfortunately, all the reports we receive show that this work is not being done. The truth is that the High Commissioner&#39;s Office has been made, to a very large extent, the plaything of party politics. The position of High Commissioner will become vacant in January next, and the gentleman who is to be appointed to fill it should have been selected weeks ago and sent to England. To him alone should be left the work of reorganization. The present Commissioner could be given leave of absence. We all regret very much to hear that his health is far from satisfactory. If it is such as it is reported to be by those who have recently been in his office, it is cruel to keep him there, and he should have been given leave of absence long ago. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> were in England for some time, and if any reorganization were necessary they could have suggested it. But it is not fair to Australia that the appointment of a successor to the present High Commissioner should be left until the last moment. I repeat that he should have been appointed weeks, if not months, ago. The gentleman who has to do the work in the office should be the man who is to re-organize it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.D.</inline> Millen may re-organize the office in a way that the new High Commissioner may disapprove of entirely, and he may set to work to re-organize it again. I therefore urge the Government to make that appointment at once, and let the gentleman appointed proceed to take up the work and re-organize the office. Heaven knows, and reports which have reached us show, that it is sadly in need of reorganization! </para>

                    <para>Mr.McWILLIAMS.- I was not in the House in the time of the Barton Government. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was also Treasurer in the Deakin Government. That is the only time in the Federal Parliament that I have known any material reduction to be made in the Estimates. The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> says he intends to move for reductions. I hope he succeeds, but when he has been as long in the House as some of us he will realize that it is practically impossible to secure reductions in items, because when one man objects to an item another will support it, and <inline font-style="italic">vice vers&#226;.</inline></para>
                    <para>There is a general feeling that the people of Australia have not obtained, since the very first day that the High Commissioner&#39;s Office was created, a fair return for the money spent on it in London, or from Australia House. That is my opinion, the opinion of a good many members of the House, and certainly the opinion of a great many people of all classes who have been to England and have visited Australia House. On coming back they have told us that Australia is not receiving a proper return for the amount that she is expending. There is very important work to be done in the way of immigration. For the first time since it has been inaugurated, a great work in that direction will be put, I hope directly, in the hands of the High Commissioner. His office should be the  centre of the whole system for immigration in the Old Country. As the Government are undertaking an immigration policy, surely it it common sense to appoint the new High Commissioner now, and let him make his arrangements in accordance with his objectives. </para>

                            <para>- Then, if the new man were appointed now, I doubt if he could get to England, after completing his arrangement.-: in Australia, much  before the office became vacant. We all know that the High Commissioner&#39;s Office will have to &#39;be completely reorganized in view of the new work that it is proposed that it shall undertake. It is not fair to Parliament, or to the people of Australia, to allow it to be reorganized by a Minister who does not intend to remain there, with the risk of the re-organization not suiting the views of the new High Commissioner, who may have to start to re-organize it all over again. I know nothing about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Hunter, but I do, unfortunately, know something about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes,</inline> the other immigration agent who is going to England. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the motion of the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell).</inline> I listened at the outset with particular attention to the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> Although the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> said that the Treasurer gave us a very good account of what should be done by the High Commissioner&#39;s Office, the principal point in the Treasurer&#39;s speech seemed to me to be the fact that it serves in England to-day as an information bureau for wealthy tourists. The Treasurer said there were a number of Australians holiday-making in England when the war was on, and afterwards, and that they found it very convenient to go to Australia House to obtain information. I have no doubt that our wealthy tourist friends do find it convenient, but I do- not think that is the purpose for which the High Commissioner was appointed or Australia House built. The Treasurer also said that the Government are sending Home a gentleman named Percy Hunter to deal with the question of immigration. That appointment is another illustration of the policy of spoils to the victors. Percy Hunter has been the chief Nationalist organizer in New South Wales for some time; in fact, the arrangement entered into when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> formed the Coalition Conscription Government in New South Wales was that Wade was to get the Agent-Generalship, Percy Hunter was to be appointed Chief Organizer, and Cohen was to get a Judgeship. The same Percy Hunter, who has been a very good organizer for the National party, is now being sent to England at our expense, allegedly to be employed there as Immigration Agent. I do not know whether he is fitted for that position, but I agree with the honorable member for Franklin that the High Commissioner should control immigration, and be responsible for the immigration policy at the other end. Although I listened carefully to the Treasurer&#39;s speech, I did not hear him give a satisfactory answer to the question I raised in the House the other evening, when I asked what was the necessity to spend &#163;10,000 on the trip of the Prime Minister and the right honorable gentleman to England, to the Peace Conference, and to various other places, if we are getting value for the money, we are spending over there. </para>

                            <para>- It is something that the people should be continually reminded of. The Prime Minister and Treasurer&#39;s trip will never be recorded in history, because it is a matter of so little importance; but the spending of &#163;10,000 in that way is a matter of national importance. The most noticeable thing I read of in connexion with the Treasurer&#39;s trip  was  that he had drunk a cocktail while in America, &#34; and threatened to win the war with one hand and kneeling if he got another drink. The sum of &#163;10,000 was spent on that trip, and &#163;1,500 on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> trip. I do not know what was spent on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt&#39;s</inline> trip, but I earnestly hope we shall hear something about that event tomorrow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen is now on his way to Europe to attend a Conference, which, we are told, is not going to take place, and also to re-organize Australia House. If Australia House and the High Commissioner&#39;s Office are to be reorganized, the work should be done by the High Commissioner. If the High Commissioner is doing the work for which he if paid, and if Australia House is serving the purpose for which it was erected, there is no occasion to send Ministers over there every twelve months. If it is necessary to send Ministers there every twelve months, there is no need to saddle the people of Australia with an expenditure of over &#163;50,000 a year to keep Australia House going. I intend to vote for the reduction moved by the honorable member for Darwin ; but, as I should like to move for the total wiping out of two items prior to that, and cannot do so unless the honorable member&#39;s motion is first withdrawn, I ask him to withdraw it temporarily, to enable me to submit an amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I see an item of &#163;4,000 for &#34; relief of loyalist workers in connexion with the maritime strike.&#34; I have never give any assistance or countenance to so-called loyalists. I would call them by another name if the Standing Orders permitted me to do so. I shall never give them any quarter, and I do not intend to assist the Government to spend even &#163;1 of the people&#39;s money on these loyalists, because such expenditure is an injustice to the men who were engaged in that industrial upheaval, and also the people generally. I shall always be opposed to any help being given to loyalists in any shape or form. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>.- I also am opposed to voting any sum for the inculcation of the principles of non-unionism in the minds of the people of this country. This item relates to a period when trade unionism in Australia was jeopardized by the actions of the present Government. We know perfectly well that the Government formed &#34; scab &#34; organizations all over Australia for the purpose of breaking up trade unionism - a futile endeavour as those who are acquainted with unionism in Australia must know - and it was done at the expense principally of unionists, because, after all, they are the people who bear the main burden of taxation. The present Government have made repeated attempts to smash unionism at the behest of the employers&#39; organizations. No matter how much money it may spend, no Government has the slightest hope of accomplishing that aim. </para>

                            <para>- The present Government have tried very hard indeed. They formed &#34; scab &#34; organizations in Victoria, and individual members of the Ministry travelled the country in advocacy of them. Similar bodies were brought into existence in South Australia, Western Australia, and New South Wales, and were heavily subsidized by the Commonwealth and State Governments. In New South Wales over &#163;1,000,000 was spent by the Nationalist Government at the behest of the employers in endeavouring to smash trade unionism. Now the Committee is asked to agree to an item of &#163;4,000 for the relief of &#34; loyalists.&#34; Notwithstanding all the money spent by the present Commonwealth Government and other Nationalist Governments, and all the efforts which have been made by such Governments, both individually and collectively, trade unionism is probably in a stronger position to-day than ever before in its history. I object to any public money being spent on men who would &#34; scab &#34; on their fellow-workers by taking the jobs of men who were fighting for principles, and I protest against any Government spending money which should be spent by the employing class, if it is to be spent at all. The Committee should reject this item, because it is a blow directed at trade unionism generally. </para>

                        <para>.- I also oppose this item. The word &#34; loyalist,&#34; used as it is here, is alone sufficient to incite one to opposition. To whom were the men loyal? Certainly not to their own class, and therefore not to their own interests. That is proved by. the fact that we hear of complaints by them that they have been pushed into the background by the very Government who made use of them. I hope that those honorable members who at one time were members of the Labour party will show where they stand in regard to unionism. Will they support this amendment, or have they so far fallen away from the principles which, as prominent trade unionists they held at one time, that they will vote for a financial grant to help individuals who proved false to their . own class ? </para>

This is an item of &#163;4,000 by way of payment to these men, because they were dispossessed of their work as the outcome of an arrangement by which they all left the wharfs in order that the unionists might take their places. </para>

                        <para>.- To my mind, the payment of an item of this kind amounts to deliberate dishonesty. In their efforts to get men to fill the places of the unionists, and to break down trade unionism, the Government had to offer something a long way in advance of the claims which the unionists themselves had made before going out on strike. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph</inline></para>

                            <para>-  I remember how, on the steps of this very House, I and other Labour members met hundreds of these men. Some of them actually sought interviews with Labour representatives to put to them the justice of their claim. They held that they had been persuaded by the Government, upon certain promises, to undertake work on the wharfs. But, they said that, as soon as the Government found the position impracticable, and their stand untenable, they disregarded their undertakings. Thus, these so-called loyalists found themselves left in the lurch, penniless, and dependent upon charity. I was actually interviewed, together with others, on the steps of this House, by numbers of men who pathetically put their position to me. I pointed out, as was only natural, that we of the Labour party could scarcely be expected to feel very warm sympathy for those who had - to use that expressive but somewhat vulgar term - &#34; scabbed &#34; on their comrades in that great industrial upheaval, when all the forces of the Commonwealth Government were employed to support their friends against the recognised members of labour unions. But there certainly was a measure of justice in their claim, and I cannot help recognising it. However, I see no reason now why the unions, having so long supported their unemployed unionist comrades - save for that small measure of assistance to which the Treasurer has alluded, and which the Labour party succeeded in wresting from the Government - should now be called upon, as members of the community generally, to support the friends of the Government. I maintain that the Government party ought to make compensation themselves. They should look after their own friends, and pay them out of their own pockets, and not place the burden upon the taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to call attention to the item, &#34; Contribution to cost of Secretariat - League of Nations, &#163;15,000.&#34; I suppose honorable members will be surprised at my action in moving that this item be deleted. But whilst I agree with the ideal of a League of Nations, I cannot stand for the League as it exists today. If we had a League of Nations in the true sense of the term, and if it were taking effective steps to prevent future wars, to bring . about a reduction of armaments, or to abolish militarism and conscription in the different countries of the world, I should be found supporting it. But although we have fought the war which was to end wars, although we have a League of Nations which was intended to maintain peace in the true sense of the word, we find that the world to-day is in a greater state of turmoil than it ever was before. There are more wars raging to-day than were ever previously waged in the world&#39;s history. I notice from the cables in the daily newspapers that at a recent meeting of the League of Nations the fact was disclosed that it did not possess sufficient money with which to pay its cigar bill. </para>

                        <para>.- It will be noticed that the expenditure last year for &#34; stationery, travelling, and incidental expenses,&#34; in connexion with the High Commissioner&#39;s Office was &#163;4,500. This year it is anticipated that it will be &#163;5,000. I think that we might well reduce that item by &#163;500. Then the total proposed vote upon the High Commissioner&#39;s Office is altogether beyond what it should be. We ought, therefore, to emphasize the fact that we desire economy to be exercised. Last year the upkeep for Australia House amounted to &#163;9,000. I think that that amount may well be reduced by &#163;4,000. Consequently I move - </para>

But I rose mainly to say that, personally, I am very dissatisfied with the information, or rather the absence of information, about the expenditure at Australia House. With the kindliest  intentions,  I say that, in regard to this expenditure, we have a special claim to know the fullest details. . As to the expenditure in any or every part of Australia, we can get the necessary information from the representatives of the States affected; but that, of course, is not so in the case of expenditure in  London;  and, therefore, the Government ought to give us every detail of the latter. It is well known to be the intention of the Government to re-organize the London Office, and I hope that my suggestion will be borne in mind. </para>
