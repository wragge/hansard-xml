                        <para>- The question has been put to me about twenty times, and on each occasion I have given the answer that I propose to repeat now, which is that as soon as the state of public business will permit, a measure providing for the holding of the Convention will be introduced into this House. The Government, of course, has its own views, for which it will endeavour to obtain acceptance, but there will not be, and ought not to be, any party colour about the measure, and, therefore, we shall accept the decision of Parliament concerning it, and will act on it. It is intended to introduce the Bill before Parliament adjourns for the Christmasholidays, and, should that be humanly possible, to pass it before the adjournment. In any case, it will be introduced before we adjourn, so that honorable members and the country may know what is in it. Should the Bill not be passed before Christmas, it will be dealt with on the reassembling of Parliament after the adjournment, and then every step necessary and proper will be taken to enable the people to express their opinions. </para>

Therefore, I ask the Minister for Home and Territories if he will arrange with the lecturer for another  lecture, to correct the wrong impression created last night? </para>

                        <para>- That is a question at once urgent and important, and, as such, to be welcomed like an oasis in the desert of Sahara. The intention of Ministers is to take such steps as may be necessary and proper to enable the government of the country to be carried on, while at the same time consulting the convenience of members, so that on Tuesday next they may pursue their individual predilections as prospects of pecuniary profit may suggest. The Government will be prepared to favorably consider a suggestion for adjourning from Friday afternoon until Wednesday afternoon, but think that the House should meet on Thursday morning to make up for the loss of time on Tuesday. I shall be guided in this matter by the wishes of honorable members. I think that the adjournment over Tuesday will meet with general approval, though one or two may regard it with jaundiced eye. I am rather doubtful about the reception that will be given to a proposal to meet on Thursday morning. </para>

                <para class="block">Owing to the increased number of subscribers at the Ascot Vale Telephone Exchange, the existing equipment, which is becoming obsolete, can no longer be made to serve the area efficiently. It is therefore proposed to erect a new building on a site which has been acquired for the purpose at the corner of Ascot Vale-road and Gladstone-street, and to provide accommodation for an automatic equipment which will have an immediate capacity of 2,800 subscribers' lines, and an ultimate capacity of 8,000. The proposed accommodation is comprised in a simple brick building of one story, which will contain a switch-room 4,032 square feet in area, battery-room with an area of 480 square feet, a room, for air-conditioning plant, of the same size, and a small lunch-room, lavatory, &amp;c. There will also be a linesmen's-room and office detached from the main building. The floors generally will be of concrete, and that in the switch-room will have a woodblock surface. The walls and ceilings will be cement rendered, and the roof will be of tiles. Generally, the buildings will be highly fire resisting, and as nearly as practicable dust proof. The estimated cost of the work is £5,418, to which will require to be added the cost of air-conditioning plant  -  £1,500  -  making a total of £6,918. The estimated total cost of the project, including site, buildings, and mechanical and electrical equipment, is £84,186. </para>
                <para>At present there are existing in Sydney twelve automatic exchanges, namely, Ashfield, Balmain, Burwood, Chatswood, City North, Glebe, Homebush, Lidcombe, Mosman, Newtown,. Parramatta, and Vaucluse. In Melbourne there are only three automatic exchanges - Brighton, Malvern, and Collingwood. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to establish automatic exchanges in Victoria at Ascot Vale, Box Hill, Canterbury, North Melbourne, and South Melbourne. In Sydney,five of these exchanges are to be established, namely, at WilliamPaddington, Randwick, Gordon, Waverley, and City South. In Brisbane three exchanges are to be erected, namely, at Albion, Newmarket, and South Brisbane. The plans and specifications are ready, and I am asking honorable members to deal with this matter at once, as the Government are anxious to get the proposal before the Public Works Committee, with a view to providing employment at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I should like to hear from the Minister an explanation as to why the connexion of a considerable number of subscribers with the new automatic exchange in Sydney is refused, upon the ground that the Department does not possess the necessary automatic equipment, whilst simultaneously proposals to erect automatic telephone exchanges in new centres are being placed before Parliament. It is well known to the Postal Department that a great deal of inconvenience has been caused in Sydney by reason of the fact that the promise of the Government to connect subscribers within a definite area with the new exchange has not been honoured, and that the newer applications for connexions have been refused. The result is that when one subscriber desires to communicate with another, it is not sufficient that he should know the area within which that subscriber is located, but he must also know whether he is a new or an old subscriber. I gathered from figures supplied by the Department a little time ago that during the period of shortage of telephone material there has not been that fair distribution of material which one had a right to expect. In every instance, Melbourne in particular, and Victoria in general, have been given a preference over other capitals and States, in the allotment of the material which was available. Here is another instance of a big expenditure being asked for works close to Melbourne, while the requirements of the Sydney exchange, which was authorized a year ago, have not been met. "We ha.ve had upon the business-paper yesterday and to-day three proposals for expenditure upon works in Victoria,' two of which are works of very doubtful urgency. The third proposal is one to establish new automatic exchanges in Victoria, when the Department is unable to give subscribers connexion with the new automatic exchange in Sydney. </para>

Any money which there may be to spare should be expended in New South Wales. When we realize that New South Wales is the only part of Australia which should be considered at all - and we have had strong evidence of that in the speech of the honorable member who has 'just resumed his seat - I wonder that the Government have the temerity to suggest that any money should be expended in Victoria. Personally, I do not care what the  honorable member may say in that connexion. I have too much confidence in the good sense of the House to  take any notice of his remarks. If I could do so without a breach of parliamentary procedure I would attach a prefix to the word "notice." .It is individuals like the honorable member who lend colour to the assertion that there is a lot of .parochial feeling in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, in Victoria we have individuals who think that any money which is expended outside of this State is absolutely wasted, and in that view they are supported by the press of Victoria. I object to representatives of New South Wales strengthening this parochial feeling by taking exception to any expenditure that may be proposed in this State. It is that sort of attitude which induces Victorians to take exception to expenditure upon Canberra. Surely it is time that we took a broader view of things. The honorable member for Illawarra is playing right into the hands of those who talk economy so far as any other State but their own is concerned. I hope that honorable members will not follow the example" set by the honorable member yesterday.  His  exhibition then was disgusting. </para>

                        <para>- Some applications in Victoria were made more than two years ago. If the system of establishing automatic exchanges in different centres around Melbourne will relieve the present congestion, upon the Lonsdalestreet exchange, which possesses more than 12,000 subscribers, it will have a very beneficial effect. "We undertook the task of undergrounding the whole of our telephone wires some years ago - I believe eight - but it is now said that the tunnels are too small to convey the whole of the necessary wires. I cannot credit that statement. I should have expected the authorities to look ahead at least twenty or thirty years, or even longer, when the work was begun, because telephoning is becoming far more popular, notwithstanding the increase in the charges. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> was Postmaster-General he put the charge up to Id. per call, and it was said then that people would disconnect their telephones, but, as a matter of fact, there has been more connecting ever since. Whether a man has a telephone in his private house or in his business place, he finds that he cannot do without it. That has been the experience of . most of us who have had telephones for any length of time. The only time we do not want it is when we are going away for a holiday, but even then we find that people can discover our whereabouts, and ring us up.' I have no doubt the Postmaster-General will be able to answer the speech of the honorable member for Illawarra. If he can, I think it will allay any suspicion that may exist in the mind of the public that fair treatment is not being meted out to the various parts of Australia. If the Public Works Committee find that an automatic exchange is necessary at Ascot Vale, I have no doubt they will say so, but if they find that it is not necessary, as an Australian Committee, looking at things from an Australian stand-point, they should have no hesitation in turning it down. </para>

                        <para>- It takes a long time to construct an exchange, and probably well over twelve months will elapse from the starting of the work before the first conversation takes place through it. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> stated that there were three automatic exchanges in the Melbourne metropolitan area. These were Malvern and ' Brighton, and the proposed exchange at Collingwood. </para>

I shall take the opportunity of getting the actual figures in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond),</inline> which I know will be shown to be absolutely inaccurate. -I cannot understand him making such a speech in view of the statement of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Groom)</inline> in moving this motion, that at the present time there are twelve automatic exchanges in and around Sydney, and that in Melbourne there are only three, including one which is now about *o be built. In face of that fact, the honorable member says that everything is being done in Victoria. Five new exchanges are proposed for Melbourne, five for Sydney, and three for Brisbane, but none of these has been started yet. I cannot understand how anybody can assert, in view of the fa'ct that Melbourne has only two automatic telephone exchanges in operation and one in course of building, while Sydney and suburbs have twelve, that everything is being done in Melbourne and nothing in Sydney. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the proposal of tie Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to refer the proposed work to  the Public Works Committee, because I consider that the installation of the automatic telephone system throughout Australia will be a great step forward. It is a system that should not be restricted to any one State, and an endeavour should be made to have similar exchanges established everywhere. While pleased to see the Minister taking the step of referring this work to the Committee, I think he should also see that proposals are made for the extension of the automatic system to other States which do not yet possess it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not making any kick about Sydney in that particular matter. I think Sydney is progressing fairly well so far as having automatic exchanges established there is concerned. They could certainly be a great deal better; but, still, there they are. The establishment of automatic telephones will be such a! boon to the people of Australia generally that we  should  not cavil at, or raise any objection to, their extension to the whole of the States. I not only support the Minister's proposal to establish this exchange in Victoria, but I strongly urge him to bring forward proposals to put in hand the erection of similar exchanges, in South Australia and Tasmania as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. Surely the commercial community of Hobart are not going to stand still and be satisfied with obsolete methods of telephonic communication. They must desire the installation of a more up-to-date system in their city.  The progress of commercial activities in recent years, not only in Hobart, but in the rest of Tasmania, has been most remarkable. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter if it is the best on the old system or not. The automatic system is more up to date, and will give more efficiency in working to the commercial community. The people of Tasmania ought to be urging very strongly the establishment of automatic exchanges in their districts. Honorable members representing South Australian electorates ought also to be putting in a claim for  their cities. Even members of the Cabinet who come from South Australia make no move towards the establishment of this up-to-date means of telephonic communication in that State. If they are not alive to their responsibilities, honorable members who represent divisions in the State should rise to theirs, and urge on the Government the desirability of an extension of the system. Business communities cannot stand still, but must move with the times if they are to hold their own in the commercial activities of the present day. It should not be left to the representatives of other States to agitate the claims of  South  Australia and Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but wireless telephony is only in its experimental stages, and the people of Tasmania will have to wait a long time if they are to be without improved communication until that system is perfected. This, I am sure, the people of Tasmania, with their spirit of progress, are not prepared to do. We should not restrict automatic exchanges to Melbourne and Sydney and suburbs, but provide them in all the capitals and suburbs of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- There is a great future for telephony in the country; where automatic exchanges would,' indeed, be a boom to settlers. One of the greatest drawbacks to country life is the fact that the telephone system in existence now can be used only during restricted hours, owing to the fact that the physical and mental fatigue entailed on the attendants by long hours necessitates the exchanges being closed at intervals. As "a result of this, the country people are denied the conveniences and facilities that are enjoyed in the cities. All country representatives should take advantage of this opportunity to put in a plea for the establishment of automatic exchanges throughout the country districts of the Commonwealth. The advantages of such an extension must be apparent to all. With automatic exchanges, settlers, could get into communication one with the other at all hours of the day or night, with no restrictions imposed by holidays or lack of attendants or other reasons. I trust that the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> will take note of what has been said this afternoon, and will consult with his officers with a view to immediate steps being taken to install the automatic system wherever possible. Representatives of Tasmania and South Australia, and also representatives of country districts generally, should take care this afternoon to give the Minister the benefit of their knowledge and experience of the disabilities that are suffered under present conditions. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the proposal of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> because I regard it as one which will pay if carried into effect. I should like to know, however, whether the Department has considered the advisability of erecting these exchanges of concrete instead of bricks, in view of the high cost of the latter. It would be advisable, I think, to have experiments made to see whether concrete is ' not really the cheaper material for this purpose. In New South Wales, concrete cottages are being erected at about half the cost of brick cottages, and the Public Works Committee ought not to be hampered in any recommendations they may desire to make. </para>

                        <para>- Another question is whether it is advisable to install expensive automatic machinery, in view of the demonstration we had the other week in the Queen's Hall of the possibilities of wireless telephony. On that occasion, the audience heard quite plainly the voice of a lady singing at Brighton, although it was a night of storm and electrical disturbance. If wireless telephony is going to make the great advance that is expected, inquiries ought to be made before incurring great expense in the provision of automatic exchanges.  Wireless telephony is making gigantic strides all over the world, particularly in America; and if we proceed now to erect buildings under the old system, we may not be able to take advantage of the wireless system when it is perfected. Has the Postmaster-General made any inquiries into the possibilities of wireless telephony ? </para>

Many complaints have been made about the Sydney telephone system. Dozens of people in my electorate have paid deposits for telephones as far back as nine months ago, but have not yet been connected with any exchange. I think it is the better policy to complete one exchange before setting up a number of new exchanges all over the place, none of which can at present be completed. </para>

                    <para>..- While I raise no objection to the provision of telephonic facilities anywhere in the Commonwealth, I object to the partiality which has been displayed by the Post and Telegraph Department towards certain portions of Australia. There is no part of Australia which has made greater progress during the last few years than Newcastle, both in the expenditure of private capital and in increase of population. But while suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney can get all the advantages derived from the establishment of automatic telephones, it is a most difficult matter for new works or new mercantile establishments in the Newcastle district even to get connected with an exchange. ' A national view ought to be taken in this regard, and service should be given where it is most needed, whether in country districts or elsewhere. No doubt our future telephone exchanges will be automatic, but I must protest against further expenditure in this direction in cities until a wider view is taken of the development of the scheme. The present position of the Post and Telegraph Department is due to the fact that during the war period it was unnecessarily starved. If any saving had to be effected, it was the first to suffer. The consequence is that equipment which could have been purchased at a reasonable cost during that period of starvation can only be obtained now that it is wanted at three times its former cost. 'I hope the Postmaster-General will recognise that there are other places to be served besides Sydney and Melbourne, and will look further abroad - to districts where the real development of Australia is taking place. </para>

The reply given by the Department to any person who makes an application for a telephone is that, although it is anxious to meet the wishes of the would-he subscriber, it, is unable to do so because certain material is not available. People in outlying country districts are pining for the want of telephonic communication between homesteads and the different townships, yet cities, which are already well provided with telephonic facilities, can be given new exchanges. </para>

                        <para>- I can give an instance where an exchange could be established in the western district of Queensland. Augathella is the centre of one of the richest pastoral districts in the Commonwealth. The people of that place want a continuous telephone exchange, but in order to get it they will be required to pay hundreds of pounds every year. As the Government install automatic exchanges in suburbs of the big cities, the instruments taken out could be well used in the country, and the money of the settlers saved. The Government will spend thousands of pounds to improve city communications, but will not spend 5s. to give country people better facilities. The residents of Augathella applied to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Brisbane for a continuous exchange, but the amount required by that official was appalling. I know it is of no use for me to appeal to the Government to give the people outback better facilities, but I intend to " plug on." Instead of erecting exchanges in the big centres, where the people have already ample accommodation, why should not the Government confer on country folk some few of the benefits enjoyed by city residents? We are willing to pay for them. Any charges that may be made will be met; but we want something more than promises, such as we have had to put up with in the past. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I will say that for the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise).He</inline> has restored many of the mail deliveries which had been stopped, and he has brought joy to the hearts of lots of good people. There are constituents of mine who would be willing to pay for the installation of wireless telephony. One of these gentlemen told me he would be willing to pay " a couple of thousand " to secure that system of communication with the outside world ; he is isolated near the South Australian border. I recently obtained some information from the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> regarding wireless sets; and I may say that some of the people in the interior of Queensland are now making use of wireless. They get into communication with the Townsville station, from which place their telegrams are sent out to various sources. But why should private enterprise have to do all this? Telephony and telegraphy are Government monopolies throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the motion whatever, because, without doubt, telephone communications, both in the cities and in the country, are lamentably deficient. I hope to see an extension of our systems at the most rapid pace possible, in all directions. During the past year or two we have been continually told of the impossibility of making various country connexions on account of lack of material, particularly of telephone instruments. With the alterations being carried out in metropolitan services, thousands of old telephone instruments should be made available for use in the country for part-time services. These ought to provide immediate relief in many places where the people have had to be content for years with nothing but promises. Even if the dismantled city instruments are obsolete they would be a great deal better than nothing in the country. Meanwhile, we can only look forward to that happy day when there will be automatic exchanges throughout the land, or wireless sets installed everywhere. Meanwhile, the people outback will be very pleased to have these old city instruments installed. With regard to wireless telephony, during the past two  weeks I have been trying to get from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> some  i  consideration of a comprehensive power-scheme for the whole of Australia, which would enable wireless telephony to become a commonplace throughout the length and breadth of the land. Time after time definite replies from Ministers have been deferred by references to State Governments. If there is one thing more than another that affects the Federal Government, it is telegraphic and telephonic communication. I would like to urge, on this question alone, the necessity of establishing water power stations throughout the country between Cairns in the north, and Adelaide or Melbourne in the south. This motion should be considered from the point of view of installing adequate wireless telephonic communication. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work : - Erection of Note Printing Office, Victoria-parade,  Fitzroy,  which said work was referred to the Public Works Committee, and the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its inquiries thereon: </para>

                    <para class="block">With a. view to enabling Parliament to sanction the carrying out of public works, after due investigation had been made, a Public Works Committee Act was passed. Some time ago, I introduced a motion into the House referring the 'question of erecting a Note Printing Office upon a site in Victoriaparade, Melbourne, to the Public Works Committee. At that time the House asked that the Committee might be empowered to make a general inquiry regarding sites, and the Government consented to the proposal. The object was to enable the Committee, as a judicial body, after taking evidence and weighing all the facts, to report to the House where the building should be erected, and whether the work should be proceeded with. The question was referred to the Public Works Committee, which took evidence concerning the suitability of several sites,  and  reported to this House that it was expedient to proceed' with the erection of a building upon a site in Victoria-parade. The Committee further reported that it was a matter of urgency that this particular work should be proceeded with at once, quite apart from the locality. If. any honorable members are opposed to the site, I ask them to read the evidence, study 'the report, and to give their verdict after having done so. According to the case presented to the Committee, and to the report presented to this House, a just decision has been arrived at. First of all, I ask honorable members to consider the nature of the building which it is proposed to construct. The proposal now under, consideration is to erect a fire-resisting building of modern construction to replace, the building in the Flinders-street extension. It is proposed that the building, which is designed on the lines of the British and United States note printing offices, shall  be  of four stories  and  a half sunk basement, with brick, walls, reinforced concrete floors, floor supports,, large rooms the full width of the building, with steel and wire divisions between the various printing, machines, and a flat concrete roof. The other details are set out in the report. The estimated cost of the building is £44,200, including all engineering services - lighting, heating, and lifts. To this should be added the laying, of electric mains, £1,600, and moving and installing machinery, £2,000, making a total of £47,800. The Committee have made certain suggestions by which that amount could be slightly reduced. I ask honorable members, first of all, to consider whether the building at present in use is adequate. A portion which was used for stamp-printing purposes originally comprised one-half of the old brick King's Warehouse, which is situated some distance from all means of communication, and surrounded by gas works and railway yards. On one side, there is a Customs store, where inflammable materials are stored. </para>

                            <para>- It was selected in 1908, and later, when it was decided to undertake the printing of notes, the Note Printer was placed in the same building. The activities in this connexion developed considerably, when it became necessary to erect a temporary iron structure. The position now is that the Note Printer is accommodated in a building absolutely inadequate for the purpose,  and of such a character that he cannot do his work efficiently. In addition, the work is being carried, on under conditions which have been reported as dangerous. </para>

                        <para>I recognise' the necessity for the note issue being in a place where there is very little risk of fire. To my mind, the chosen site is an ideal one from that stand-point. The adjoining risk is practically nil, and there is no likelihood of that risk ever increasing, because the site is surrounded by residential properties. The fire risk in connexion with the old' building is a very considerable one - I am speaking now of the internal risk. The departmental officials have shown me some rough plans of the proposed new building, and from these I have formed the opinion that the structure will be one of the finest specimens of fire-resisting construction to be found in Australia. ... In case of an outbreak of fire in the present Commonwealth Note Printing Office, there is very grave danger to the girls who are employed there.

                    <para>He stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> had pointed out to him the danger from fire, and he further emphasized the unsuitability of the building for various reasons. In the first place, it is in a moist locality, and the dampness is detrimental to the work done there. The building is invaded by the noxious sulphur fumes from the gasworks, and those have an injurious effect upon the more delicate processes. Furthermore, dust is continually being blown into the building, and is causing rapid deterioration of some of the plant, including the working plates, to the extent of 50 per -cent. If honorable members would only visit the works and see some of  the delicate mechanism installed there, they would realize the absolute unsuitability of the locality for work of this kind. There cannot be the slightest doubt as to the necessity for removing from that site, because of the grave fire risks and the unsuitable environment, which injuriously affects both the operations and the plant. Moreover, the works are most inconvenient of access. They are a long way from the railways and the trams, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> informed me 'that his girls are resigning at the rate of one per day, and that it is most difficult for him to retain the staff. As it is clear that the establishment must be shifted, the next point to consider is the most suitable position to which the works can bc transferred. The debate that took place in this House raised, in a purely impartial spirit, the question as to whether or not the note-printing works should be transferred to Canberra; incidentally, the claims of Sydney were also mentioned. The Public Works Committee took evidence upon this matter, and its report is clear and emphatic. </para>

                            <para>- The members who served on the Committee when this matter was being investigated were Senators Henderson, Needham, and Newland, and Messrs. Gregory,  Mathews,  ' Sampson, Laird Smith, and Sinclair. The motion in favour of the Victoria-parade site was adopted by the Committee by seven votes to one, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair</inline> being the dissentient. The Committee reported against removing the factory to Canberra, and gave several reasons for that recommendation. First of all, even if it be assumed that Canberra is the ultimate site to which the note-printing works should be removed, the present position is so urgent that works must be established in Melbourne for the time being. Therefore, the ultimate situation is not relevant to the question of an immediate site. We are advised that it is absolutely essential that  the works shall be transferred at once to the site in Victoria-parade. * Inquiries were made in Melbourne with a view to discovering any State Government building, Commonwealth building, or private building, in which the works could be temporarily housed; but the Committee found, as the result of investigations made by officers of the Home and Territories Department, that no suitable building could, be found. Sydney was dismissed from mind for the same reason. 'The Committee visited that city, and could discover no building that would adequately house the note-printing works for a temporary occupation. Therefore, the erection of a new building on the site recommended is a matter of urgency. Should the proposed buildings be erected on the Victoria-parade site, there need be no fear that the Commonwealth may not get adequate value for them in the future, in the event of having to realize. Merely as a temporary arrangement it would be cheaper to carry out the proposed work than to go to Canberra forthwith. That, apparently, is the view taken by the Public Works Committee. The reasons why the Note Printing Office cannot be removed to Canberra immediately are very strong, and, in the face of them, honorable members must ask themselves whether they would take the responsibility of voting for the change to Canberra at the present time. In the first place, to make such a change would dislocate the work of the printing operations. The existing plant would have to be dismantled, and about 2,000 tons of material would have to be removed to Canberra, where, in addition to special buildings for its reception, you would have to erect homes for those employed in the Stamp Printing Office. </para>

                            <para>- If the- Note Printing Office were immediately removed to Canberra, it would mean, as I have said, dislocation of the work of note printing, and would take the Note Printing Office away from immediate touch with the Treasury, which is regarded as important. At the present time a staff of some 270 persons is employed in the office; and, were the office to be removed to Canberra, arrangements would have to be made for housing those persons there. This is included in the estimate of £186,000. According to a Treasury estimate that has been given to me, the cost of administration would be increased by from £6,000 to £7,000 a- year were the office removed to Canberra, because adults would have to be employed in place of juniors, particularly among the female employees. </para>

                        <para>It was patent to the Committee that, in  the  best interests of the Commonwealth, the establishment should be removed from its present quarters with as little delay as possible. The premises constitute  a  very grave fire risk by reason of the fact that several of the buildings are of  a  temporary character, and are not only in danger of fire on account of the nature of the. materials used in the process of note printing, but are contiguous to  the  Customs shed, where inflammable materials are stored, and where smoking is indulged in.. Id the event of a fire occurring, there is  a  possibility of serious loss of lue, especially amongst the female employees, on account of the limited, opportunities for escape from the building, added to which the destruction of certain machines which are obtainable only from abroad would seriously interfere with the output of the establishment. The damp atmosphere of the neighbourhood is said to be a disadvantage to the work earned out, while the fumes from the near-by gasworks not only have the effect of tarnishing and so shortening the life of what is claimed to be the finest machinery of its kind in the world, but also have  a  damaging effect on certain of the colours used in the printing of the note issue. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Committee point out that economies would1 be effected by the immediate transfer of the note printing establishment to another site. The Customs- Department has notified the Treasury Department that it needs for the purposes of a bonded warehouse the building, now occupied by the Note Printing Office, and expects to make at least £2,000 a year out of it, that being a conservative estimate. There will also be a saving, according to the Committee/- of £622 in connexion with the sorting of notes, which, together with the £2,000 to be earned by the Customs capitalized at 6 per cent., would amount to £43,700, or nearly the sum proposed to be spent on the erection of buildings at Victoria-parade. </para>

The Public Works Committee report that the removal of the Stamp Printing Office from its present site is urgently necessary, and give grave reasons for that statement ; among others, deterioration of plant and material, and the loss of efficiency under the conditions under which the note printing is done at present. In these circumstances, we have to decide where the office should be transferred to. In neither Sydney nor Melbourne are there buildings available for temporary occupation. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to answer the question, and I do not think it material, because you must continue printing the notes, and cannot afford to have the work interrupted. I have shown that to transfer the office to Canberra at the present time would mean a considerable interruption, and would not  be  economical. Should the occupancy of the Victoria-parade site be only temporary, the arrangement would still be financially sound. </para>

                        <para>.- It is amusing to listen to the arguments advanced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> in submitting this motion. He has declared that the work is urgent, and that it would be impossible to erect the Note Printing Office at Canberra. He tells us that this is not an opportune time for the establishment of such, an office at the Federal Capital, and that it would be impracticable to do so. I would remind the House that the very same arguments were advanced by the honorable gentleman twelve months ago. He told us then that the time was not opportune to establish this office at Canberra; that the cost of erecting the building there would be altogether too great, and that when something had been done towards establishing the Capital we might very well take action to set up Commonwealth activities there. This House must definitely make uy&gt; its mind whether it is going to honour the compact in regard to the establishment of the Seat of Government at Canberra. There can be no escape from that position. Honorable members must be either ' for or against the proposal. There has been much camouflage in regard to the difficulty of housing employees at Canberra. What the Minister has said to-day, he said twelve months ago in this Hou6e, and, if the matter were deferred for ten years, he would then, no&gt; doubt, repeat the statement. I believe that the great majority of honorable members are determined that the compact shall be honoured, and will refuse to listen to the cry as to the time not being ripe for the erection of the Note Printing Office at the Federal Capital. The Minister has referred to the report of the Public Works Committee. Let me give the House, from that report, a quotation which the honorable gentleman failed to read. It is stated on page 9 that - </para>

                            <para>- Far more so. Witness after witness gave evidence before the Committee that no difficulty would be experienced in establishing the Note Printing Office at Canberra. We were told that there was an abundant supply of building material and ample opportunities for the comfortable housing of the employees there. Arrangements could be made almost immediately to house them at Queanbeyan, which is adjacent to the site. We were also told that there was ample labour available in the Territory for employment by the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>I invite honorable members to analyze the estimate put before the Committee as to the cost of transferring the Note Printing Office to Canberra. It is loaded up in every conceivable way with the object of damning the proposal to erect the building there. The first item in the estimate is " 100 brick houses, £60,009." 0n tae face of it, that estimate is ridiculous. It is also absurd to charge against the building of the Note Printing Office at Canberra the cost of erecting those cottages. If we intend to build the Capital, work- men's cottages must be erected, and to charge the cost of their erection against one particular Commonwealth activity is utterly unreasonable. Thus, this first item in the list is unfair. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member, as  chairman  of the Committee, knows that I was stricken down with influenza when this matter was under its consideration, and that it was not possible for me to attend its meetings at the time. Honorable members generally .are aware that I was seriously ill - that I went close 0 passing away - on that occasion, and it is therefore grossly unfair that I should be charged with discourtesy to the Committee in failing to attend. The honorable member knows full well that I was quite unable to attend when the Committee was considering its report, and that I am never wilfully discourteous to any one. To return to this estimate, we next have an item of £2,000 for furniture and equipment, and an item of £1,600 for the  erection of a school. All these are to b* charged against the Note Printing Office. Then we have an item of £1,800 for a hall. </para>

The fact is that I am fairly besieged by returned soldiers who are constantly demanding that I should use my influence to enable them to obtain cash for their bonds. In common with quite a number of other people, they appear to think that a member of Parliament has the power to make water run up bill. Not one half of the soldiers who come to me regarding this matter are my own constituents, but they are nevertheless most insistent in their demand that their gratuity bonds should be made negotiable. Seeing that the last Peace Loan was over-subscribed, and that by the middle of next year a certain amount of money will be coming into the Treasury in the form of repayments by soldiers for war service homes, and for the farms upon which they have been settled- </para>

                            <para>- We told the Government that in 1916. But, seeing that our soldiers have been promised cash for their bonds in 1923, is there not a possibility of an arrangement being made under which those bonds may be redeemed to the extent of about . £8,000,000 annually ? A good sum has already been paid in redemption of bonds. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, some of them might be worth, perhaps, £98. Furniture dealers have been roundly condemned for their action in accepting gratuity bonds as payment for furniture purchased by soldiers, but we must not forget that they have had to make arrangements with their banks. Those soldiers who effected insurances upon their lives in order to obtain a certain amount of cash for their bonds will most likely allow their insurance policies to lapse. In these circumstances, and seeing that the Treasurer has already obtained some £25,000,000 or £26,000,000 for repatriation purposes- </para>

                            <para>- I have in my mind the case of a man who before going to the Front was employed in certain glass works here. Upon his return he was unable to resume his former avocation. He has a wife and three or four children, and his health is very bad - so bad that he has frequently to relinquish his work. This man wants cash for his bond, but he cannot obtain it. Although a number of the officials at the Victoria Barracks are returned soldiers they are not nearly so considerate to their erstwhile comrades as they might be. Whenever I approach the Defence Department in regard to any matter, I get nothing but courtesy from the officials there. But courtesy is of no use to me. </para>

                            <para>- I try to believe that the courtesy extended to me is a mark of personal affection, although I know that it is not. At one time it was the practice of the Defence Department to appoint officers to whom members of Parliament were required to go if they desired to ventilate any grievance, instead of to the Minister. This system worked very well, but members would rather go to the Minister. There is a grievance officer for soldiers, and so on, but the trouble I find over my way is that I want a grievance officer every day for my electorate and the electorate of Fawkner, which abuts on mine, and where I really live. I cannot get for those who come to me the attention that I could wish. The things I hear are positively getting on to my nerves. I hear crying cases every day of my life. People come to me and actually cry. There are three or four cases of that kind every morning and evening, and they all expect me to do something. As a matter of fact, I am told dozens of times, " You promised us cash, and are not giving us cash." Will the Treasurer say whether there is a possibility of obtaining any more money for this purpose? He states that the Treasury now pays cash in the most necessitous cases. I shall impose upon him by bringing five or six cases of my own to him. There are a number who are just on the bare line, and the cash would do them good. If it could possibly be done, I believe that two or three million pounds would meet the situation. The Treasurer knows as well as I do the demands and entreaties that are made to members. Is it not possible for him to do something to make the  conditions somewhat easier, and for cases outside of those where the Treasurer says he is already paying cash, to be considered on their merits ? </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to condemn the officials who have the management of the sugar question under the Government, because I know that their duties are heavy, and that it is very hard to please the general public. I try myself and fail, so that I know it is not possible for officials to do it, although I confess that they might be a little more considerate of the general public than they are in their methods of dealing with them. I believe there is no real shortage of sugar. We are to-day landing in Australia, and growing in Australia, as much sugar per head as ever we did, but many reasons have made an apparent shortage. One is the increased demand for sugar to turn the produce of the small fruit-grower into jam. The jam factories complained, when the price of sugar was raised, that they had to compete, at a disadvantage, in the world's markets with other countries. As a matter of fact, they were getting sugar over 100 per cent, cheaper than any other country in the world, and they had not to meet the troubles, that they said they had. Their demand for sugar for the manufacture of jam for export purposes was, however, greater than ever, and this increased the quantity used in Australia per head of the population. T was in the country last week, and was given some brown sugar. I know that those people must have had it in stock for at least seven or eight months, because brown sugar has not been issued by the company for that period. People have told me that they have obtained bags of sugar. One man on the tramway line said that he had three bags. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is no doubt that people have gone in for hoarding sugar. I do not think the shop-keepers have done so to any great extent, although, unfortunately, some shop-keepers, through special circumstances, are obtaining more per customer than others. There is no doubt that sugar has been made scarcer by hoarding, with the result that some people are going short, and some tradesmen are not getting their fair share. It would relieve the situation considerably if the Government could assure the public that this rush for sugar and hoarding of sugar are unnecessary, that it will not become any scarcer than it is now, and that there will soon be a better supply. They ought to be able to give the people that assurance. We have been told that the position in the West Indies as regards sugar will make the situation very much easier, and cause a drop in price. I do not know whether that is actually so, but it will not be the first time that it has happened. I well remember three occasions, once in my very early youth, when heavy production in the West Indies caused a fall in prices and a slump generally. I trust that the Government will see their way to take the public into their confidence. If 6d. a lb. is not enough, and if plenty of sugar could be made available at 7d., why not say so? It would be better for the general public if they had to pay 7d., and could thereby get sugar, than it is to-day. I do not know if it is essential to charge 7d. per lb., but I am aware that the Government were charging the public 6d. per lb. for sugar that cost them ls. A Dutch ship arrived here from the Dutch West Indies with sugar. 'The people on it would not use their own sugar, because they could go ashore and buy the local article at 6d. a lb., while their own was worth lOd. or Hd. a lb. We ought to know by this time exactly what the Queensland crop will be. Surely Ministers have that information, and the public ought to know what the Government are doing. We are paying Australian sugar-growers £30 6s. 8d. per ton. If there is a shortage we ought to do something. I do not say that we ought to stop the supply of sugar to the jam factories, which buy the fruit from the small growers, because that would prevent them exporting their jam. I believe that jam on the table is more essential than sugar in tea. It would not hurt me to go without sugar in my tea as much as it would hurt children to go without jam. If we are going to use- a great deal of our sugar for export, and there is a shortage, there will he trouble. We cannot tell the small growers that they must not have sugar for their fruit. If it is necessary to charge* more for sugar it will be better to do so, because not only are people short of it, but the present state of things is driving many grocers into the lunatic asylum. If the shortage of sugar goes on any longer, the health of a large percentage of the men in the grocery trade will be so impaired that they will not be able to carry on business. I know -many of them well, and during the last twelve months I have been wondering what has happened to them. Their health has gone, and their nerves are completely broken up, because their money is invested and the situation offers them no security. They know that competitors not far away have plenty of (sugar, while they have to go without. I made an attempt here one day to expose the unfairness of what was going on, and was supposed to have been beaten by the Minister on the question; but I still maintain that the statement I made then, that some traders can get sugar while others cannot, is correct. I do not think it is necessary to raise the price, but it would be" better to do so if that would insure a plentiful supply to traders and the public. In any case, the Government ought to assure the public that there will be no scarcity for the next seven or eight months, and thus stop the hoarding that is going on, enabling every trader and housekeeper to obtain a fair share. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope an opportunity will soon bo taken to review the repatriation regulation which prevents the issue of tools to returned men who are seeking to employ themselves if their application has not been made within six months of their return to Australia. I know of several very hard cases, and the unfortunate fact is that the rigid* enforcement of the regulation hurts some of the most deserving men in the Australian Imperial Force. Those are men who, when they returned to Australia, decided to depend on their own resources, and seek no assistance from the Repatriation Department. They made an effort to re-establish themselves in civil life, but, later on, when they found that a little assistance would be of value to them, it was refused merely because they had been back in Australia for more than six months before they put in an application. If the Minister will look into these special cases, and see the character and quality of the men, and the justice df their claim, I am sure that some way will be found to meet them. When a soldier returns to Australia, if he applies immediately, he can obtain an advance up to £10 to purchase tools of trade, or if he proposes to follow his occupation as a master he can get that assistance towards, the purchase of tools. If, however, on his return he ignores the Department and obtains a job for himself, and then finds after a year or two that he can improve himself by returning to his original business, or is unable, for other reasons, to retain his employment, and wants to make a fresh start, he is met with this regulation. He is told that he cannot successfully make an application, as more than six. months have expired since his return. In every case of that kind that has come under my notice the men are of a very good type. They have tried to do their best without assistance from the Government, and are very reluctant to ask for it even when they find it would be of great advantage to them. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> mentioned the question of sugar. A greater effort should be made to secure sugar for housewives who want to meet the high cost of living by preserving fruits and making jams, and in other ways providing cheaper food for their children. During the control of sugar by the Government, constant complaints have reached me from the cooperative societies that they are unable to get the same treatment as other businesses. If there is one section of business that might have been selected for more favorable treatment it is the cooperative societies, which  really  represent the homemakers and housekeepers of the country. Their claims could be met with perfect safety. They do not need to do any hoarding. All the sugar that went to them would go into households for  every-day use. The controller of sugar should see that their requirements are met to the- fullest extent before he' allows sugar to be used for purposes of export. Then, generally, the supply of the smaller shopkeepers should be secured, so that housewives in these times, when strict economy has to- be exercised in every home, may be able, when- fruit is cheap to- provide for the days when fresh fruit is not available. No better food than fruits preserved in this; way can be provided for the people. The Government, before they encourage people to make a profit by using cheap sugar in exported goods in competition with others who are paying more for their sugar, should! see that Australian families are supplied with sufficient to enable advantage to be taken of the cheap fruit that is so abundant here iri some seasons of the year. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer some matters connected with invalid and old-age pensions. According to the Act, as it stands to-day, a workman in New South Wales who happens to become permanently incapacitated, is paid so much under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and when he applies for an invalid pension, the amount he receives as compensation is taken into account in determining what the pension shall be. Prior to- the passing of the Workmen's Compensation Act, a permanently incapacitated man received so much from the Millers' Accident Relief Fund, and that amount was not considered in the computation of the invalid pension. The present conditions cause a great deal of hardship amongst miners ; quite a number of them are permanently incapacitated. One case, typical of many, is disclosed in the following letter: - </para>

I met with an accident in the Aberdare Shaft, Cessnock, from the result of which I lost the sight of both my eyes, and, as I am only receiving £2 per week compensation, in the hope of trying to get something to try and keep my wife and three children, I applied for the invalid pension, and those people, in their wisdom, were so kind as to allow me the large sum of 5s. per week. Why they didn't give me the full amount I don't know, as  Ave  are terrible bad in need of it, but I sincerely hope that you will be so kind as to do what you can towards getting me the full amount. </para>

No permanently incapacitated man can support his wife and family on <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a week. I know that what is done by the authorities is in accordance with the Act, and that the pensions officer, however sympathetic, is compelled to adjust the pension as described in the letter I read.

                        <para>The supply of sugar is not yet satisfactory. I admit that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> is doing his level best to get the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to make better arrangements for distribution. I have brought several cases under the notice of the honorable gentleman, and I am pleased to be able to say that he has adjusted them. There should, however, be no need for such adjustments. There should be ample sugar now, and it is claimed that there is ample for the needs of the Commonwealth for the year. There is no necessity for any increased price, because if there b6 a shortage, I understand that abundant supplies can be obtained from Java at a cheap rate. By this means, it ought to be possible to decrease the price, even if there is a shortage in our own production. Irrespective of price, however, the sugar supply should be put on a more satisfactory footing. Co-operative stores, and especially the wholesale stores, have the greatest difficulty in this regard; and this is strange in the 'case of a society which represents the people directly, without the intervention of any middlemen. When supplies are refused to such an institution, the whole of the shareholders are denied their right to sugar, while in many cases private stores are given an abundance. Whether this discrimination is deliberate or not I do not know, but certainly the whole of the business requires to be put on a better basis. </para>

                            <para>.- On the motion for the adjournment last night, I asked for some information regarding an Ordinance in force in German New Guinea, prohibiting all dealings in real property, whether by sale or mortgage or anything in the nature of a rn.ortga.ge, and pointed out that the Ordinance operated against dealings in real properly between British subjects, quite apart from property owned by Germans, or transfers supposed to be made by Germans. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was to-day good enough to furnish me with some information in» .regard to the Ordinance, which he suggested had to do only with the placing of restriction on the transfer or mortgage of real property owned by Germans. Perhaps the Minister at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> would give an assurance that, so far as British subjects are concerned, the operation of the Ordinance should be such that British subjects will be able to deal <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> in transactions in which there can be no suspicion or suggestion of any attempt to dispose of German property. The reply of the Treasurer suggested that the Ordinance has only to do with Germans, and I cannot see what possible reason there can be for having it so operated as to prevent  dealings  between British subjects. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so; but I think it would be better to make the bonds absolutely negotiable than to continue the present system, which causes endless trouble to those who wish to cash them. I am sure that honorable members have had brought to their notice almost daily the great dissatisfaction that exists in this respect, and the great necessity there is for making these bonds negotiable, or making it certain that the soldiers can cash them if they can get face value for them. </para>

In fact, it will take the form I adopted when moving an amendment to the War Gratuity Bill. I am glad to note that some of my honorable friends opposite have changed their news as expressed in this 'cb amber, or as indicated by the votes they cast when that Bill was under consideration. Perhaps the experience they have gained of the working of the Act has shown that it is desirable that some less rigid provision should be brought into operation. I propose to move - </para>

                                <para>.- I hope there will be no opposition to this amendment, which I have very much pleasure in seconding. A great mistake was made when we passed the War Gratuity Bill by declaring who should get cash for their bonds. The result has been that men who have married since their return from the Front have been able to get cash, and some of them have been well-to-do, while men who left their wives and families behind them to live on their separation allowances, find themselves just now in an extremely difficult position, in which their war gratuity bonds afford them no relief. </para>

                                <para>- Never mind that. The provision was made, and it has created many injustices. Many men who left their families behind have not been able to work except intermittently since their return, and they feel their position very keenly when they see young "chaps" getting married, and having their bonds cashed immediately. In the absence of the opportunity to amend the Act, the amendment which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has just moved will afford some relief, and although it will not be much of a concession to the soldiers it would certainly do away with a good deal of red tape. I have just received a letter from a returned soldier stating that a month ago he wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mulvaney,</inline> who is in charge of this branch of the Treasury work, asking to be supplied with transfer forms which he wished to fill in and send to the Department for approval or otherwise, and has not received any reply. I have not heard of a case in which permission to transfer has been refused; but this young man, who has found some person who is ready to give him face value with accrued interest for his bond, cannot get the necessary papers from the Department to enable him to effect the transfer. If the bonds were made negotiable, as the amendment suggests, there would be no need to make application for the right to transfer. Necessity to write to the Department and fill in application forms would be avoided, and there would be no occasion for delay. </para>

                                <para>- I am game enough to say that they have not done so in many cases, particularly in this instance. Australia is the only country which has paid its soldiers a gratuity in bonds. The United States of America gave their soldiers a dollar a day in cash, and New Zealand paid 2s. 6d. a clay in cash. Australia, I repeat, is the only country that has handed out to the soldiers pieces of paper, which are valueless to them to-day. One case that has come under my notice is that of a soldier in receipt of a pension of £1 per week who cannot get his bond cashed. He was in hospital for weeks, but he has now been turned out, although he is unfit to do any work. He certainly drank a good deal, but for six months he has not touched intoxicating liquors. He is trying to steady himself. Every time I go to Ballarat he appeals to me to try to do something for him. I filled in his application forms, but the replies from the Board are that nothing can be done for him. </para>

                                <para>- That it was not a necessitous case. Practically every day I receive complaints from soldiers who say that, owing to the red-tape in the Department, considerable delay takes place when soldiers apply- as in the case I have mentioned - for application forms to enable them to transfer their bonds to persons who are willing to cash them for them. Soldiers feel that when they write to the Department they ought to receive a reply in a day or so. As a matter of fact, I think they ought not to be obliged to write to the Department for these transfer forms. I have overcome the difficulty by keeping a supply of them at my home, and if a soldier comes along they can be filled in at once and forwarded to the Treasury. A supply of these forms ought to be available at every post-office. I agree with the amendment, which stipulates that the bonds may be placed on the open market. There is no guarantee to-day that the soldier who is permitted to transfer his bond receives full face value for it. There is merely a verbal guarantee to that effect. I know men who have bought four or five bonds. A man will sign anything when he wants money. These returned soldiers need cash for their bonds, and they will sign a document to the effect that they are getting their £100 plus accrued interest. But I am not satisfied that in every case they are receiving their dues. In fact, I know of some instances where they have not got all they have been entitled to. The Treasury Department will sanction any application for permission to transfer. There is considerable delay in obtaining that sanction, and that causes trouble; but it does not affect the fact that every application is granted, provided that the proposed transfer is nob to be made to a moneylender or to a publican. However, the Treasury officials are not present to watch the actual transaction, and cannot be expected to safeguard a soldier's interests at the transfer. They simply have to take his word, and that of the purchaser, that the full amount due has been paid. </para>

                                <para>- The Government's war loan bonds, due in 1923, are selling at about £96 10s. Why should gratuity bonds be worth so much less ? I do not know any valid argument against the amendment. If its terms are put into practice the work of the Treasury will be considerably reduced, because applications and negotiations for transfer involve the despatch of thousands of letters. The Treasurer should remember that the effect of the amendment will not be to permit any more bonds to be cashed than can be cashed to-day.  I  repeat that practically every application for transfer is sanctioned. </para>

                                <para>- It would not go on if the soldier had the cash instead of a bond with which to negotiate. The whole position in regard to the cashing of bonds to-day is unfair, and bears the most unfairly on the man most in need of money. A returned soldier working in either the Federal or a State Service, who is in a constant job and has no fear of unemployment, can get cash for his bond. A man outside, who may be working only four days a week, and during about ten months in the year, and who is badly pressed for cash in these hard times, cannot sell his bond. He has something which is worth £100, but he cannot get ls. credit on it. A married man goes to the Front leaving a wife and a large family behind, and he can only give them a few shillings a day to support them. Upon his return he finds his family heavily pressed by debt. He gets his bond, but he cannot cash it to clear off the debt. In other cases, young, single men have been away, and have been able to accumulate their pay. I have known instances of young fellows worth £10,000, who have been married since their return, and have got cash for their bonds. The whole position is not only absurd, but terribly unfair. </para>

                            <para>.- The amendment is a good one; and I frankly acknowledge that, if by my support of. it I am changing the views which I expressed or indicated by my vote at the time of considering the "War Gratuity Bill, I then made a mistake.- I now wish, in strongly supporting the amendment, to rectify my error. This Parliament made a mistake when it placed restrictions upon the cashing of bonds, but I quite understand why those restrictions were imposed. I recall the words of the Prime </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister, who made the outlook quite plain. No one could doubt the motive behind the imposition of restrictions. The Prime Minister emphasized that they were in the best interests of our returned men, and that their purpose was to keep them out of the hands of the Shylocks. However, having gained experience, and looking upon the whole subject in its broadest light, we should be ready to acknowledge that it would have been better had the bonds been made negotiable. Then, when a man desired to sell his bond, he would have no difficulty, and would have been assured of getting its proper market value. Seeing that the bonds are free of income tax obligations, they would be all the more readily negotiable, and one could be reasonably certain that the market value would not fall below a fair margin. I do not see how the acceptance of the principle underlying the amendment could possibly have any bearing upon future loans, for, after all, the money involved in the. gratuity bonds is already tantamount to* a loan,, and has already become a national', liability. It is of no use our trying to doan impossible thing by means of an Act. of Parliament. I do not know how other soldier-members on this side may feel,  but the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has made his views quite clear. The amendment, I repeat, is a good one, and, if accepted, will prove to, have been in the best interests of our returned men. </para>

The amendment asks for far less, in effect, than was involved in the promise of all three parties in this House at the time of the last elections.

                                <para>- I am not saying that it was as far as the banks are concerned; but the Treasurer seems surprised when I remind him of the promise of the Prime Minister. I am not concerned whether he went back on it or not, and I am not so much concerned with what the Prime Minister said at various times as with the fact that a promise of payment in cash was virtually made by all three parties during the election campaign. Certainly, it was definitely made by this party. If the amendment-is agreed to, therefore, it will pledge the Government to something which is not nearly so far-reaching as would have been the case had the promises of all the three political parties been adhered to. </para>

                                <para>- He gave as his reason, which was an excellent one for supporting the amendment, that, having had the opportunity of seeing the Government's scheme in operation, he is now converted. That is a reasonable attitude to adopt; and any honorable member who has had anything to do with the hopeless tangle into which this work seems to have fallen will have come to the same conclusion. I know of scores of cases in my own electorate where applicants have proved that they were in necessitous circumstances, but they have merely been told that their requests cannot be acceded to. As mentioned by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> it is usually those who are in poor circumstances who are unable to receive cash, while those who are comfortably situated have not had any difficulty at all. There are many business men and others who are willing to cash bonds. Instances have been mentioned in this House where business people were prepared to give cash for bonds if the bondholder was willing to spend a certain amount on the purchase of goods. That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed. </para>

                                <para>- It is very ungrateful of the Minister to make such a suggestion when we remember that these men have rendered such a great service to Australia. It is not for us to say in which way they shall spend their money, because it is theirs as a right. If we deny it to the great bulk of the returned soldiers, because, as the Minister suggests, some will spend it in hotels, we are adopting a very unfair attitude. </para>

                                <para>- I know of scores who have apparently proved their cases to be necessitous, but who, owing to the time taken by the Department in considering their applications, are in very serious circumstances. I know of an instance in which a female dependant of a deceased soldier - a Western Australia case - after communicating with the District Finance Officer for four months, was informed that, as she had not supplied the regimental number of the deceased soldier, the case could not be considered. The letter was referred tome, and the woman also sent  me a communication she had received from the Department some months before showing that they had full particulars, including the regimental number. The Department seems to be in a hopeless state, and after months of trouble in supplying information, applicants are informed that the circumstances do not justify a cash payment. There are numbers of men unable to carry on, to whom cash would be a god-send, and yet they seem to be unable to prove to the satisfaction of the Department that their cases are really necessitous. This amendment does not ask that the Government should pay the cash, but merely that business men and others who are willing should be allowed to give cash equal to the face value of the bonds, including interest. This is really less than the Prime Minister and the members of different parties promised during the election campaign. </para>

                                <para>- This paper money would go on the market. That is the plain English of it, and that is the very thing we should try to avoid, as the market has plenty of it to-day. Honorable members need only to look at the price of our stocks to realize what is going on. The very last thing we should tlo is to inflate the credit of Australia any more than we can possibly help. Of course, honorable members opposite do not care two straws about it. Every day they are denouncing profiteers and high prices, but are propounding schemes for sending prices up more and more. That is what this proposal means, if it means anything at all. It means the further inflation of the national credit; and any one who knows anything about this question realizes that prices increase in the same ratio as our general credit is inflated. That is an inevitable economic law, and it cannot be avoided. In spite of that fact, honorable members opposite are every day denouncing soaring prices, and at the same time submitting proposals for sending prices still higher. It was well understood at the elections that we could not afford to inflate the credit of the Commonwealth any more than by the means of ordinary loans. The obligations to float loans are maturing the whole time. Money is required for land settlement, homes have to be built, and repatriation money generally has still to be found. All that means raising more and more money, and the Government are already committed to £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 in connexion with the soldiers alone. </para>

                                <para>- That is not the point. As we are doing substantial justice to the soldiers in giving them bonds carrying interest at 5¼ per cent., free of income tax, we are giving them a special concession. This would provide a fine investment for those who would  not subscribe to our war loans, as many would be ready to 'buy these bonds in any quantity, because iu doing so t'hey would be securing a gilt-edged security free of .tax. I am totally opposed to a proposition of this character, and I am  amazed  that the honorable member for West Sydney (Mt. Ryan) submitted it. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is now proposing to sweat down the soldier; that is another friendly act to him. Not a suggestion has been made that does not mean that the soldier will be hit in the neck. All that we are doing is to try to protect him, and see that his bond is worth to him the value that Parliament intended that it should have. There are many abuses. Money lenders take these bonds from the soldier, and actually give him receipts showing that a greater amount of cash has passed than has been actually given. That is happening now. </para>

Later on the soldier himself would be the first to regret that he had been allowed to become the victim of practices of that kind. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. But it would not have been good for the soldier if we had. When honorable members talk about what is being done in other countries, I ask them to bear in mind the whole of the facts in regard to the soldiers here and elsewhere. Do they know that Canada, with double our population, and with a greater number of soldiers than was sent from Australia, is only spending £6,000,000 per annum in war pensions, whereas the Commonwealth is spending £7,250,000. Honorable members should acquaint themselves with all the facts as to what is being done in other countries, and they would find that our soldiers are being treated far better than are the soldiers of any other country. </para>

                                <para>- If we have a greater number of invalid and disabled soldiers we have a greater obligation, and that might be regarded as a motive for cheese-paring. But our policy is the contrary of that. Notwithstanding that we have a greater burden, we are treating our soldiers individually infinitely better than soldiers elsewhere are being treated. If honorable members intend to talk about what other countries are doing in regard to the gratuities, let them state the whole of the facts in regard to the soldiers. May I remind them that New Zealand, during the war, taxed her people much more heavily than did the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- It is higher than ours; but above the exemption the tax rises very sharply, whereas the Commonwealth incline of increase is nearly flat. A New Zealand man earning from £400 to £600 per annum pays twice as much income tax as does the man with a similar income in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- And despite that fact New Zealand collects from income taxation more than half as much as we do, although it has only a quarter of our population. Honorable members had better leave New Zealand out of the count in regard to these matters. The result of this policy is that the Dominion accumulated surpluses during the war, and carried them forward until they aggregated £6,000,000. If the Commonwealth had had a surplus of £16,000,000 we could have paid the gratuity in cash quite easily. </para>

                        <para>Having regard to the commitments of the country it would be a calamity to place more paper money on the market. Our credit is already sufficiently inflated, and it must be inflated much more by the ordinary loans we shall require to raise in order to meet our obligations to the soldiers. Honorable members who would continue floating paper money on the market would be doing wrong to themselves and to the country. It is of no use to screech about high prices, if honorable members will persist in causing them to rise higher by the arbitrary inflation of credit. </para>

                                <para>- But it is a fact. The honorable member proposed to pay cash at the railway sidings for the farmers' wheat. £30,000,000 worth of paper money would have gone in that way. Now he proposes the cashing of £30,000,000 worth of gratuities. That means the issue of more paper money. The honorable member is actually proposing to put £60,000,000 more of paper money on the market - to further inflate our credit by that amount. We can finance in a much better way than that, and in a way that will tend to moderate prices to the consumers rather than increase and inflate them, as honorable members opposite are trying to do every day. </para>

The cashing of bonds is proceeding apace, and any soldier who wants his bonds cashed can get the money if he can show that his is a necessitous case. What was the nature of the case quoted by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> ? He said that one man in his electorate, who has six children, claimed that as his brother's bond had been cashed, he, too, should get cash.  His  is not necessarily a necessitous case. </para>

The proper cure for these troubles would be to make all the bonds non-negotiable ; and I believe it would be infinitely better for the soldiers in the long run, and would lead to a great deal more contentment if no bonds at all had been cashed. </para>

                                <para>- I was never simpleton enough to believe that a people or a country can be made rich by means of the printing press. The war has shown the fallacy of many old-time notions, perhaps more quickly than anything else could have done. Why do members opposite wish to go on using the printing press to manufacture paper money when they know that the causes which are operating all over the world to increase prices must operate in the same way here? To pay in the manner proposed £30,000,000 in war gratuities and another <inline font-style="italic">£30,000,000</inline> for wheat would tremendously inflate the credit of the country, and thus bring about an increase in the prices of the commodities used by the men whose cause members profess to champion. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think I do; but the honorable member knows himself quite well, and we know what he is after just now. Ever since he entered this Parliament he has been  ready  and willing to exploit every interest for his political ends. This afternoon we have had another instance of this. The motion requiring the payment for the wheat in cash at the railway sidings was another instance of it. When the amendment now before us has been disposed of, we shall have from him some new proposal for the restraint of the profiteer and the prevention of high prices. Perhaps to-night, after having voted for a. course which will inevitably inflate prices, he will again denounce the profiteer and the high  cost  of living. </para>

                                <para>- Any soldier in necessitous circumstances can get cash for his bonds, but he must establish the fact that he is necessitous. No doubt, there have been hard cases, but they can always be reviewed and rectified when established. I ask honorable members not to vote for the amendment, because, were it carried, our credit and our financial future generally would be seriously affected. We cannot afford at this time to flood Australia with paper money. Our bonds are sufficiently low as it is, and the more our credit is inflated, the harder will it be for those whom honorable members seek to benefit. </para>

The soldiers have been despoiled, as we said they would be. The more difficult it is to negotiate bonds, the more certain it is that the negotiations, if effected, will be to the disadvantage of the soldier, and that is what is happening. </para>

                                <para>- You had better not repeat it. I made statements in this House in support of which I produced proofs; but in one instance I mentioned the name of a firm which was not to blame, and in justice to that firm I subsequently explained my original statement. If, as the Treasurer suggests, the war gratuity bonds, if negotiable, would be sought after as attractive securities, the. soldier would be sufficiently safeguarded, because he would get face value for them.. I do not think that they would be such attractive securities, nor that if they were made negotiable they would be negotiated as extravagantly as the Treasurer suggests. It does not follow that every soldier would negotiate his bonds if he could do so, though in a majority of the cases the bonds would perhaps be negotiated. The Treasurer said that at the present time permission is given for the transfer of these bonds in certain cases, and in reply to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> he said that permission was given only for transfers to approved transferees. I am informed by the Treasury officials, however, that business firms, or practically any persons willing to accept the bonds, may get permission to have them transferred to them provided that they undertake to pay for them at their value, whether in goods or in land. Unfortunately, the full value is not always paid, and the soldiers are exploited, and that, I think, can be prevented in the future only by making the bonds generally negotiable, or paying the gratuity in cash. </para>

                <para>MrBRENNAN (Batman) [8.8].- In discussing this Bill at a somewhat late hour last night, I pointed out that one of the methods adopted by the Government, with the object of encouraging immigration, was to intimate to the white races outside our own country that if they came here and behaved themselves they might possibly qualify for the rights of citizenship after five years' residence.. No more discouraging policy could be determined upon than that of illiberalizing the naturalization laws of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para class="block">The position would not be so bad if at the end of the five years' period the granting or withholding of letters of naturalization did not depend entirely upon the whim of the Minister for the time being, stampeded as he might be by the probability of war, or by any of those national and international prejudices which move Governments, and especially jingo Governments, to visit their wrath upon people of foreign nationality who happen to be for the time being resident on their shores. The policy of this Bill, as the Government would doubtless tell us, is to tighten up our naturalization laws ; but, as I would put it, it is to give more open expression to those feelings of international bigotry which had such a baneful effect in this country during the progress of the war. When a person comes to apply for letters of naturalization under this Bill, he is to satisfy the Minister that he is a man of good character. Most of us would wish that our citizens were all guaranteed of good character; but it must be clear to honorable members that the expression is so elastic in its nature that here again full opportunity is given to the Minister to exercise complete and untrammelled discretion, and for any reason - although it be a purely personal reason - to refuse naturalization. </para>
                <para>In moving the second reading of the Bill the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> told us that he had been holding the scales of justice as fairly as possible between the Government on the one side and applicants for naturalization on the other. I was very much struck by a remark made by him, with the object of showing that he had discharged his duty conscientiously, that when a report reached him that some person, perhaps an applicant for naturalization, had made use of a disloyal expression in an hotel bar or some such place, he did not immediately act on that report, but called for further confirmation of the suggestion of disloyalty, since he recognised that very often these suggestions or allegations were made from unworthy motives. I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that upon those lines, and with these materials, he has done his best. But the statement is significant. In this matter of naturalization, as in every other affecting the rights and liberties of a person, who, whether a citizen or not, has a right to' the protection of the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, it is an utterly odious practice to act on the hearsay unexamined evidence of secret witnesses. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Under the original Act there is no such thing as a right to naturalization. There always has resided in the Government of the day a discretionary power. In the form in which it appeared in the Act of 1903, that discretionary power could be exercised adversely to the applicant only apparently for certain good reasons. But in the Act of 1917, which was passed when the war fever was raging, and when it was deemed to ' be necessary to take additional precautions because of the state of war which then existed, an absolute power was given to the Governor-General, acting through his Ministers, to refuse to grant, for any reasons which appeared to him good, letters of naturalization. This Bill, now that we are living in a time of peace, is intended or pretended to liberalize our naturalization laws, and to insure the administration of those laws upon the principles of elementary justice by providing that an applicant against whom disparaging allegations have been made shall have the right to test those allegations. But I protest against the principle which is embodied in the Bill, that the Minister may act upon the unexamined and <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements of persons who may be biased, and whose motives may be tainted. These petty investigations into the private characters of individuals, if they are to be conducted at all, ought to be conducted openly, in order that the accused person may be afforded an opportunity of testing the reasons which animate his accusers and the truth of the accusation. But that course is not to be . followed under this Bill, any more than it was followed under the measure which it is now proposed to supplant. </para>

                    <para>In this Bill, as in the English Act, and, indeed, in previous measures, there is a generous provision that a foreigner who takes out letters of naturalization here shall thereby secure all the rights, powers and privileges, and incur all the obligations, of a natural-born citizen of this country. I feel it my duty to state publicly that the undertaking which is given in the Bill, and which is similar in terms to' that which was given by the Act of 1903, and which was confirmed by the Act of. 1917, has been from time to time grossly violated, and that letters of naturalization which have been granted to certain persons, have, to the discredit of the Government, been regarded as mere " scraps of paper," to be dishonoured whenever expediency prompted the adoption of that course. This fact was strikingly exemplified during the war, not only in the case of citizens of countries with which we were at war, but also in the case of citizens of one of the allied countries. I am, in particular, referring to the Italian nationals who were deported from the Commonwealth. Not only were Italians deported who were not naturalized, as I have more than once demonstrated, in breach of the best settled traditions of British jurisprudence; but nien who had certificates of naturalization were, upon the mere recommendation or suggestion of the Consul for the time being, hounded down in this country, and unquestionably would have been deported had it not been for the whole-hearted intervention of members of the Labour party, including myself, and of other persons outside of this House. In that regard, these people owe nothing to the Government of the day, and less than nothing to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Upon that occasion we found that the names of men to whom the previous Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> had granted certificates of naturalization exempting them from deportation, appeared upon the lists of the Italian Consul and of the Minister for Defence, where they were described . as aliens, and as fit subjects for deportation. Some of these were, perhaps, deported, others we saved from that fate; but none of these people, naturalized or unnaturalized, owe anything to the present paternal Government. </para>
                    <para>It was a very common allegation during the war that Germany, as a State, had forfeited the right of her people to become naturalized in this country, by  reason of the fact that she had passed a law which secured - whether they willed it or not - their allegiance to her, even though they had become naturalized here. A good deal was said at the time about that law, which was alleged to have absolved us from any duty to protect naturalized Germans in this country, because Germany still regarded them as her own. subjects. In discussing this question, it is well to remember that that is the stand which is taken up by nearly every one of the civilized nations of the world. Until 1870, it was literally true of the Englishman that, to paraphrase the opera - </para>

                    <para class="block">So jealously did Britain insist that it was impossible for one of her sons to shed his nationality, that up to 1870 she even exercised the right to send officers upon a foreign merchantman in order to take into custody one of her citizens who had taken out letters of naturalization in another country. That position was, of course, relaxed by the naturalization Act of 1870. But the truth is that an unlimited right on. the part of a citizen of any country to shed his nationality has never been admitted by his country of origin. Certainly, a Frenchman coming here, and taking out letters of naturalization would not be held to have shed his nationality so far as France is concerned until at least he had reached an age when he was no longer liable to military service. A similar law obtains in Spain, and also in Germany. Under this Bill, an alien who has taken out letters of naturalization in the Commonwealth, will still be. regarded as a citizen of his country of origin in the event of war breaking out between the Commonwealth and that country. In such circumstances, his letters of naturalization must be revoked. That is mandatory under this measure. That is a very serious matter. If war should break out with France in ten years' time, every Frenchman who has been naturalized in this country, under the theory which I have been endeavouring to explain, must necessarily have his letters of naturalization revoked. </para>

                    <para>I intend, in Committee, to submit certain amendments to the Bill, which I recognise I have not any hope of carrying. But, at the present stage, I do not propose to say anything more. I am sorry that the measure leaves untouched the burning question of the status of women. I am sorry that, under it, an Australian girl who has never been outside of this country, may find herself, by reason of her marriage, designated as a citizen of a foreign country. It is an ancient theory, but an utterly unjust one, and one against which thinking men and women have protested. Generally speaking, the operation of the Bill will tend, upon the one hand, in the direction of professing a wide and generous invitation to foreigners, while, on the other hand, on closer examination, it makes it clear that, if they do come here, they do so at their peril. I say " at their peril " with the knowledge that I have of what happened here to both naturalized and non-naturalized persons during the war. Up to the time when the war broke out, I never had believed, and would not 'have believed, if I had not lived to see it, that men who came here in good faith, throwing off the worst traditions of the country from which they came, adopting the laws and customs of this country, and helping to make it a good free land, would have been persecuted and held up to obloquy, for no fault of their own, in the way I saw occur here. It is for that reason that one looks with some jealousy upon any naturalization law. One can only sav that, if this Bill were to be wisely and liberally administered by men of broad views, it could be a good working measure. But, with the knowledge that we have of the way in which the existing law has been used and misused, and the purposes for which regulations have been made under it, I have no very great faith that this Bill will be of much  6ervice  to the people of this country or to people outside it. </para>

                        <para>. - I went through this Bill very carefully myself, and also, with the aid of the  honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> because I wished <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be sure that there would be in it nothing that could in any way be harmful to those who have already been naturalized by us in Australia. Naturalization is not a thing that should be given too easily or too readily. The honorable member who leads the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> last night mentioned the case of the Uitlanders  in Johannesburg, which, he said, and rightly said, was one of the reasons that led up to the war with the two South African Republics. I do not think those people ever had the slightest cause for complaint so&gt; far as naturalization itself went. They were a floating mining population at that time, and the Boers, . the farmers, who were the actual owners of those- two Republics, were quite justified, I thought, and still think, in making whatever regulations they deemed right and fit as regards naturalization. That, however, was not by any means either the main or the only cause which led up to the Boer War. The right of naturalization is one of the greatest gifts that a nation can make to any one coming to live among ito own people. I am not in favour of giving it readily, or only after a short probation. The true test of the fitness of a man to receive naturalization, the true proof that he is deserving of becoming an Australian and receiving Australian citizenship, is that he himself shall be able to show that he lias acquired a genuine Australian sentiment and ideal. If he has done that, then I am willing to give him the full rights of Australian citizenship. If citizenship id made too easily acquirable, if the gift is made of too small value, then it reflects on the other side, and is perhaps not honoured to the extent that i"E should be. I am one of those who think it should not be too easily acquired, but once it is acquired, the bond should be honoured in the very fullest and highest degree. It is not my object or intention to go into the history of the last few years or to stir up ill-feeling, which I might possibly do on matters of that sort. I only want to see that those who have been naturalized get the fullest protection under this Bill, and that nothing is done, as perhaps might be done if clause 12 were left in ite present form, to endanger in any way the rights which they now hold. I, for one, so far as I am able in this House, will protect their interests in every way to the fullest extent. </para>

                    <para>Our Empire has often been compared with that of Rome. The greatest boast of a Roman was <inline font-style="italic">Civis</inline><inline font-style="italic">Romanus sum, -</inline> "I am  1a  Roman citizen." We find, perhaps, the grandest example of the value of citizenship in the Bible itself. I need not remind you, sir, or the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> or the Minister at the table <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> where the passage will be found, but in the 22nd chapter of <inline font-style="italic">Acts</inline> appears the story of the apostle St. Paul. He was about to be scourged, and 'he said quietly and calmly to one of the soldiers, "Is it lawful to scourge, without trial, a man who is a Roman <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> Immediately he said that the soldier ran and called the officer in charge of the guard, saying to him, " Be careful what you are doing. This is a Roman citizen." The captain of the guard at once, in his turn, hurried to the prisoner and asked him, " Is it true that you are a Roman?" St. Paul replied, that he was. The captain of the guard then expressed astonishment, saying, "With a great sum of money I purchased this," and St. Paul replied, " I was free born." That is a beautiful example of the value of citizenship.. It saved this man in his hour of need, ' instantaneously and without question. It proved that the captain of the guard himself, although originally not a free-born Roman, yet, once he had acquired naturalization with a great sum of money,, was able, possessing the full rights of Roman citizenship, to occupy a responsible position in charge of a large number of soldiers. Eventually St. Paul, by appealing to  Caesar,   was sent, on what was then a long voyage, to Rome. When he appealed to Caesar, so great was the  prestige  of Roman citizenship that the Governor himself, although he wished to dismiss him, would no longer handle the case, but sent him straight to the Emperor. I quote that little story to show how we, too, once we give naturalization to any one who comes here, should respect and honour it in the fullest degree. This is mainly a Committee Bill. Where we can alter it fairly, I shall attempt _ to do so. I have every faith in the fairness, common sense, and sympathy of the Minister in charge of it. I' have found him in every way sympathetic and fair in the matters I have brought before him. I hope he will still show himself so during the passage of the Bill, and especially towards any little amendments that we may think it desirable to propose. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very pleased, indeed, that the Bill has been brought down, because I think it will be the means of acting justly towards a number of men whom we ourselves asked to come here. Although we may not have had the most friendly feelings towards the people of their nation of late years, we cannot get over the fact that, at the time I was in- the Queensland Parliament, we. tried to get immigrants from all parts of the Empire, and, failing to secure sufficient to fill up some of the enormous blank spaces in that State, were then- compelled to turn to the Continent, and sent men from Queensland to Germany to go among the farmers there, and besought them to come out and become citizens of the Commonwealth. We even went further by reserving certain tracts of land for them, so that when they came out they woul'd not have to go about the country to find1 land- to settle on. It was al] ready for them to take possession of. There are many hundreds and thousands of them in Queensland, to whom no charge of disloyalty was ever traced during the whole period of the late war. It is, therefore, right that- we should not allow out prejudices to overcome our sense of justice. We  should,   at least;, act justly and fairly towards those whom we sought out in order to bring them here, so. that they might become' our fellow citizens.. They took up- the land in the foll belief that they would have, the privileges of Commonwealth' subjects. This Bill will, allow them to become naturalized,, because " there is not one of those men or women' who has not been in Australia, foa- at least five years.. That five years' residence will entitle them to be  naturalized,   if there is nothing against them.. There were a large number of Germans in Australia who were not loyal during the war, but they did not come out here, as these men did, to make Australia their home. When they were found to be disloyal they were dealt with, but we have not found the slightest disloyalty among those to whom I and my friend the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> have referred. I hope that both the honor able member and myself are as loyal as any people in Australia, and I think we have shown it in every way possible. We hope also that we have been, and will always be, just. The administration of this Bill, when it is carried, will be in the hands, we believe, of a just Minister, because, like that of the honorable member for Moreton, my experience, in the many matters that I have brought before him, has been that he has meted out fair treatment.- We also find that there has been a wonderful change of late in the Department of the Attorney-General. I have had no- difficulty of late in getting for constituents of mine naturalization papers, and also the right to purchase land within my own electorate. These are all men against whose loyalty, as in the case of those I have spoken of, nothing has ever been said. I have many proofs of their loyalty during the war. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member asks a very pertinent question. Persons naturalized under this BiU will be naturalized for the whole, of the- Empire, and that is certainly a great improvement on being, naturalized, for one State, and one State only, of the Commonwealth.. Then,, under this Bill, if naturalized persons move from New South Wales or Victoria into Queensland they will find themselves naturalized in the latter State without any further trouble, and they are also naturalized, as I say, in any part of the Empire. There is another improvement, in that, if aman' has been resident ih any other part of the Empire for at least five years,, he may become a citizen of Australia without further' delay. When a man settles on .the land1 he often desires to borrow in order to extend his holding, or obtain 'his deeds, and wants to be able to do so without being harassed with- a number of objections: He has cast his lot for all time here, and' he looks for that treatment he expected when he- first came. 1 am pleased1 to note that the Bill extends the advantages of  naturalization,  and I do not think that under existing circumstances Ave shall have much reason to complain of the administration of tie measure. </para>

                            <para>- I shall quote from the Bill in order to prove my assertion  - a  course which the honorable member himself did not take. It is interesting to hear the honorable member's expressions of appreciation of the estimable qualities of a number of citizens who were enticed out to this country from a part of Europe. They were brought here to settle in Queensland on lands which, up to that time, had been barren wastes. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I shall call them unused areas. The honorable member told us that as a result of this immigration those waste places have been put to practical use. The honorable member's professions of friendship for those people are rather belated. Some of them, who have done much for Queensland and other parts of the Commonwealth, have been treated during the last four years in a manner which reflects not credit, but the greatest discredit, on this Government. The honorable member  has  told us that he knew a great number of those people who were thoroughly loyal and good citizens; and he must admit that, while they were being robbed of their- citizen rights, he never, in this House, or, so far as I know, elsewhere, raised his voice in protest ; on the contrary, he supported the Government which perpetrated the iniquities. Now, when the whole thing is over, and the injury has been done, the honorable member, with, I suppose, his eye on the next election and their votes, endeavours to " make good " with them. </para>

                            <para>- However, I shall leave those people to speak for themselves, and I have no doubt they will do so. The injustice inflicted on them will remain in their memory for long, and they are not likely to forgive those who deserted them. My experience of the loyalty of those people is precisely the same as that of the honorable member. No one will defend those who were proved to be disloyalists, but we all know that not only those referred to by the honorable member as having been brought out in order to set an example to others who were not prepared to take up land, but a number of Australian-born citizens, even of the second generation, were deprived of their citizen rights. It is because such things were possible, and were done, that we are somewhat suspicious when dealing with a measure of this kind introduced by the present Government. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> challenged me to point out in the Bill provisions which restrict instead of extending opportunities for naturalization. In the first place, the original Act provides for a qualification of two years' residence, while the Bill makes the period five years. Is that extending or widening the opportunities for naturalization? I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will agree with me that that is a limitation; and it is one for which I can see no justification. </para>

                            <para>- No matter how the honorable gentleman may endeavour to twist my words, he cannot show any analogy between one year and five years. If I desired the period to be one year, I cannot see how a statement of that fact would answer my argument that the proposal in the Bill is a restriction, and not an extension. Then, again, the Act provides that an applicant shall satisfy the Minister that he is able to read and write English , but the Bill proposes that an applicant must have an " adequate knowledge of the English language." </para>

                            <para>- Many of these old people have proved themselves good citizens; but a number of them - I have their cases now before the Department - are deprived of pensions because they are not able to write their names, and, therefore, cannot be naturalized. They can write in a sort of way. In any case, even amongst people born and bred in this country, we find those who do not write very legibly. Personally, I receive letters from the Departments which I have much difficulty in reading. </para>

                            <para>- The signatures are not. However, when the honorable gentleman asks me whether I am in favour of doing away with the education test, I can only say that I do not attach much importance to it. A man may prove himself a desirable citizen, and do his share in the development of the country, and yet not be much of a scholar. Although he might be capable of doing useful work in this country, the fact that he is not able to write his name will deprive him of naturalization, and, consequently, of pension rights if he should strike evil days and require a pension. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> referred to clause 12, which I had marked as another illustration of the restrictions proposed in this Bill, as compared with anything contained in the principal Act. I cannot see where the greater latitude that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> said was to be given by this Bill comes in. It is provided in sub-clause 2 that the Governor-General shall revoke a certificate of naturalization granted by him in any case in which he is satisfied that the person to whom the certificate was granted - has, within five years of the date of the grant of the certificate, been sentenced by any Court in  His  Majesty's Dominions to imprisonment for a term of not less than twelve months, or to a term of penal servitude, or to a fine of not less than £1 00. </para>
                    <para class="block">A fine of £100 may be imposed for a comparatively trivial offence. A few days ago we were considering a Bill which imposed a penalty of £100 upon any person convicted of attempting to leave Australia without a passport. </para>

As I was saying, we were considering the other day the case of a lad sixteen years of age who, on attempting to leave this country without a passport, would, under this Bill, be liable to a fine of £100, and to have his certificate of naturalization revoked. </para>

He even went so far as to say that they had taught the Australian farmers how to till their land to a greater degree of perfection and profit for themselves. But, notwithstanding all this, and although these people had been naturalized for years, and had settled down in their adopted land, they and their children were deprived of citizen rights in a most shameful manner, and, in many cases, as the result of trumped-up charges of the flimsiest character put forward by police or secret service men employed during the war, were deported without a trial. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- When they were deprived of their votes, and had no voice in sending the honorable member to this House, he did not have very much to say for them, but now that there is a prospect of their getting their votes back again, he has a good word to say for them. At two referendums they and their children were deprived of their votes, but I did not hear the honorable member say a word on their behalf. One becomes suspicious that all is not as it should be. The wrong done to a loyal section of the people, who were deprived of citizen rights on trumped-up accusations, and who were interned, although no charge was ever proved against them, is all bad enough. We should not pursue the vendetta, but, to employ the words of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> we should let bygones be bygones. With those words ringing in our ears, honorable members expected something more liberal and generous than can be found in this measure. I cannot understand why it is proposed to extend the qualification period from two years to five. </para>

                            <para>- I perceive that much, but it does not do away with the fact that this extension will restrict naturalization opportunities, whereas we had been told, and had expected, that there would be a widening. My first impression of the Bill was that it did appear to represent a desire to make up something to loyal people who had, suffered because they had ancestors whose nationality was decided for them before they were born. Instead of there being any adjustment of wrongs, however, the measure now seems to me to suggest that we are not going to allow these people to forget what happened to them. </para>

The honorable member for Grampians, I understand, expressed the hope that the bigger estates would not be interfered with on the ground that it would harm the merino wool industry, and he said representations should be made to the New South  Wales Government to provide for the settlement of soldiers in the Riverina. </para><interjection>

The Government are not only driving returned soldiers from settlement upon the land, but they propose to give no greater inducement in the way of liberalizing our naturalization laws than is contained in this measure. </para>

                        <para>.- With respect to the naturalization of aliens coming into Australia, I cannot understand that honorable members should complain of the responsible Minister having power to determine whether or not a person should be naturalized. Nobody wishes every individual, good and bad, to be free to come into Australia and be naturalized. We do not want to import bad characters. The responsible Minister always has had, and should continue to have, the power which is carried on under this measure.. There has been a suggestion that, instead of making the residential period five years, a1 shorter term would be better, but I know of no great objection; and, seeing that the five-year period brings us into line 'with the Imperial legislation, it would be as well for us to incorporate it. A careful watch should be set in the matter of power to revoke certificates. </para>

                            <para>- If we include this special power of revocation, it will give the Commonwealth authority to revoke naturalization granted at any time in Australia, and, therefore, care has to be taken that before naturalization can be revoked the person concerned shall be fully protected. It will be seen in clause 12 of the Bill that if a person who is to be denaturalized makes application, it shall be compulsory to hear his case before a Judge of the High Court or a Supreme Court Judge of aState. In such cases the Judge hearing the application shall have all the powers of a Royal Commission to inquire into the circumstances, and to report. In the event of the disloyalty of any person being in question, the Minister must refer this to a Judge for investigation; and I think it will be generally admitted that if any person has proved himself disloyal he should not have a single supporter in this Chamber or anywhere in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>In another portion of the Bill it is provided that a person who has been in prison for twelve months, or who has been fined £100, shall not have the right to an inquiry. Although there may be some justification for siich an exemption in connexion with a person who has been in prison for twelve months, it is quite possible that a person may have been fined £100 for an offence that was not really serious. If a person is to be denaturalized without an inquiry before a Judge simply because he was fined £100, it seems rather hard; but that is a question that can be fully discussed when the measure is in Committee. I agree with honorable members who have said that many charges were laid against citizens, particularly when our nerves were upset with the tragedies of war, and it is quite possible that many were improperly punished. It is quite likely that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> made certain mistakes in interning people, and I. know of quite a number who were interned at their own request during the war period because of the high feeling that existed and of the indignation expressed because of their nationality. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that certain amendments can be made in clause S without destroying the Bill. That particular provision is of great importance, as we need to be very careful before naturalization is granted, because after that is done naturalized persons should be regarded as desirable citizens of the Commonwealth. When we give them the privilege of citizenship, we should be true to our promise, and carry it out in its entirety. It should be our endeavour to treat them fairly, and it is only when they have shown that they are unworthy of the trust reposed in them that their naturalization should be revoked. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have listened attentively, and with interest, to the speeches delivered by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and other honorable members, and I was sorry to hear the Minister say that he did not desire the measure to be amended. He gave as his reason that it was desirable to have reciprocal legislation with other parts of the Empire, and said that if we made this Bill dissimilar to the British Act of 1914-18 it might tend to hinder reciprocity. I am particularly glad to notice that provision has been made so that, a person naturalized in one part of the Empire will be recognised as a British citizen in other portions of .the Empire. In this respect the Bill is a decided advance on other measures we have previously had before us. </para>

On previous occasions I have stood in this Chamber, and have been treated in a hostile manner by practically every honorable member opposite because I have sup- , ported the interests of the GermanAustralian, section in our community. I believe that before long there will be other honorable members opposite who will yet be ashamed of their action and the action of the Government they are supporting. </para>

I hope that in the future we are not merely  to have "words' but action, if action is necessary. I am looking forward to the day when not political advantage or the fear of being unpopular will hold sway, but when honorable members will stand for British justice, as has been done in other parts of the Empire. </para>

                    <para>I notice that many of the provisions in this measure that are beneficial are not the product of the Hughes Government, but of the British Government. In the years behind us the British Government has not been so fanatical as this Government has been, because I can recall the occasion when an attempt was made to remove from the Privy Council two men who possessed German names, and' were of German blood. But those gentlemen are still members of the Privy Council. I am glad the honorable member for Moreton, by his mention of St. Paul and his Roman citizenship, has been the means of fanning a breeze into this Chamber that is refreshing, invigorating, and cleansing, and which is necessary to instil in the minds of men a New Testament truth which cannot be disregarded. We can still refer to the ' Old Book for many things, and find in it healing for the nations and a balm for this world's ills. It is pleasing to know that we have had presented to us Roman citizenship as it is mentioned in .that Book, and when I think what Roman citizenship stood for, and what naturalization has meant to some people in Australia, I stand aghast. I look over the years that have passed, and realize that in spite of our veneer of civilization we have much to learn from that old Roman Empire. The more I reflect the more I believe that there are some people in our midst who will yet realize that their actions in the past have been very much at fault. I am glad that an illustration of Roman citizenship has been brought before the members of this House and of this Government. </para>
                    <para>It has been mentioned by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that it is necessary for us to watch the powers of revocation, and he said that in the past the Minister had no power over naturalization that may have been made under State laws. In the last few years we have had revocation, irrespective of all naturalization laws, and those who not only came from abroad, but those who were born in this country, have been de-naturalized. Reference has been made to the revocation of the rights of a person who is born here and whose right to vote was taken away. The right to vote is the only protection a man has over his property, and that has been taken away from  Australian-born  citizens. I agree with the honorable member for Dampier that we shall have to watch the provisions of this measure very closely. A provision which I am glad has been copied from the Imperial Act, is that which allows a person threatened with the revocation of his certificate to appear before a Court. I think that is very necessary. If I read the clause aright, the Governor-General shall - and I hope I understand the meaning of that " shall " - send a notification to the last place or residence of the person concerned, and that person shall have the right of having his case heard before a Court. I wish that that power had existed in the past in regard to many things that were done. </para>

                    <para>The Minister stated, by interjection, last night that great care was now being taken of foreigners by our party. Why should we not take care of people who come to settle in Australia? One of my names is Moses, and I make bold to prophesy that the day will come when we shall thank God for every white man in our midst, irrespective of the race to which he belongs. When the day comes when Australians arc challenged as a white people, we shall be grateful for the presence of every white man amongst US, and will not ask any questions as to the country whence his parents came. We have a duty to consider the foreigners who have come here. In reading an American newspaper last night, I saw the account of a lift accident, and the names of the twenty injured persons suggested that they or their ancestors had gone to America from many different European countries. </para>
                    <para class="block">Proud as I am of my English blood and of the British race, I yet believe that the intermingling of the blood of other white people with our own is good for us, and must help to build up a stronger and better nation. Another reason why I support the immigration of white people,  irrespective  of their country of origin, is that I believe that the class to which I belong should beware of the distinctions in respect of nationality that are made by the jingoistic sections of the community. The great need of my class is to know that the working classes of the world must stand together for their own protection, and to realize that the most powerful weapons used against them in the past have been differences in religion and nationality. I am prepared to do anything within my power to remove those weapons from the hands of the class that is opposed to us. If we make it possible for decent foreigners to become assimilated with people of our own blood, and if we remove distinctions of nationality, we shall do much for the betterment of the working classes, and much more than any League of Nations will ever do, to terminate international warfare. Therefore, I was glad to hear the Minister's statement that this party is taking good care of foreigners, and to know that -that is the policy of the party to which I belong. </para>

                    <para>There is another provision, that a person who desires to become naturalized shall advertise his intention in the press, and any person may then make a statutory declaration of reasons why, in his opinion, the application for naturalization should not be granted. That statutory declaration is not to be seen by the person most concerned, except with the consent of the person who made it. Knowing what took place in regard to the internment of Australian-born and naturalized Australian citizens during the war, I am afraid of this provision. I have heard of persons having been interned on account of mis-statements concerning them made by their personal enemies. I fear that the same thing may occur in connexion with naturalization. An alien who is in business may advertise his intention to apply for a certificate of naturalization. A business rival of British origin, actuated by business reasons, may make a statutory declaration in opposition to the application. </para>

                            <para>- I did not mean the remark to be offensive, but I have no time for that narrow vision and excessive pride of race which leads some persons to believe that there are no virtues in any nationality except their own. I have known Britishers who were as unscrupulous as men of any other race, and I have known Britishers as good as the best of other races. It will be possible under this provision in the Bill for one of the contemptible class to which I am referring to make a statutory declaration which includes false charges against an alien who is applying for naturalization. The alien will have no chance of defending himself, or knowing what has been stated in the declaration, without the consent of the person who made it, except in a case of perjury. How is perjury to be charged against the person making; a declaration unless the person affected by the declaration has an opportunity of reading the statements that have been made against him ? Having regard to past experience in connexion with internment, that provision seems to be unfair, and if an amendment is possible, it should be made. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Minister for that explanation. There is another point in respect of which I desire to be clear. Does the right to apply for naturalization, after a residence of five years in Australia, or another British Possession, apply to all aliens, or is the present system of differentiation to continue. Today, a person of German origin cannot become naturalized unless he has been continuously resident in Australia for twenty years, and is fifty years of age. When I have been fighting the cases of Germans, I have been told that the young men are dangerous. In my own electorate are a number of men who have been resident in Australia for from ten to forty years, and who thought that they were naturalized by virtue of the naturalization of their parents. They find that that is not so, and that they can become naturalized only if they have been resident here for twenty years, without any black marks, such as internment, in their records, and if they are at least fifty years of age. I hope the Minister will assure us that all aliens will be treated alike whether they are of German, French, Austrian, Danish, or other origin. The war is over* and we should put all nationalities on the same footing. Only by treating all alike shall we be able to remove the bitterness that must be wiped out before the Australians can become one united people. Recently I have been accused of stirring up race hatred in Queensland; but I declare to-night that until justice is done to the people of ex-enemy origin in our midst, and they are placed on the same footing as other citizens, I shall not be prepared to ask them to forget the wrongs that have been done them in the past. </para>

                        <para>. -  The more I study the matter ©f naturalization the more farcical it appears, because under any naturalization law a person may have a dual or treble nationality. As an instance of how foolish naturalization is, a man may become naturalized in Australia, and later become denaturalized. That has been done; in fact the German nation reserved to its citizens the right to become denaturalized. The Bill makes provision that a person becoming naturalized may, by registering the names of his children, naturalize them also. That is bad in law, because no man can sell the birthright of his children. That fact was proved in the law Courts when I was a youngster. An Englishman went to America where he became naturalized, and he claimed that his son was an American citizen.- The son returned to Britain and claimed the nationality of the land in which his father was born, and the Courts held that he was a British subject. Similarly, no man can, by his own naturalization, make his son a Britisher. The son of a naturalized person may, on reaching manhood, claim the nationality of the land in which his father was born, and what is the use of trying to naturalize him as a British subject against his will ? I know that this provision was inserted with a good intention, viz., to meet the circumstances of a lot of persons who thought that their naturalization followed automatically on the naturalization of their fathers. </para>

Therefore, a Chinese woman from Hong kong might board a vessel lying off the island, and have a child on board whose nationality would be British, although his parents were Chinese, and he might go to America, and there acquire American citizenship. </para>

In my opinion, the provision to which I have just alluded infringes the White Australia principle. We have had enough trouble already with Hong kong Chinamen; but, so far as I can see, there is nothing to prevent Chinese or Japanese born on" British ships from claiming British nationality. I think that if a man lives in this country, and abides by its laws, that should, entitle him. to become an Australian citizen. </para>

                            <para>- The clause says " any person." My view is that any one who comes here, lives in the country, and abides by its laws, should become an Australian subject without the formality of naturalization provided for in the Bill. There is one thing I should like to ask the Minister. When de Valera has become  President  of an Irish Republic, what will be the position of the children of Irish parents bom in Australia? </para>

                    <para>Mr.RYAN (West Sydney)  [10.6].-  I wish to say a word or two in protest against the claim of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> and honorable members of his party who have supported the Bill, that it is a measure for enlarging the rights of foreigners in respect of naturalization. The Minister told me that the Bill is the most liberal measure ever introduced into any Parliament, and the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> and the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> gave it their blessing. I have never known a measure to be introduced by an anti-Labour Government without a similar statement by the Minister in charge of it, indorsed by those who supported him. When a measure to curtail the franchise, and to deprive nomadic workers of their votes, was introduced, we were told that the object was to purify the rolls, to extend the franchise, and to facilitate the enrolment of electors, although the object was to strike off names from the rolls. When the rate of exemptions from income taxation was reduced, we were told that the object was to broaden the basis of taxation. All measures of this kind are spoken of as broad measures, although framed and intended to restrict, rather than to enlarge, the rights of the citizens. </para>

                        <para>- I take that to be an admission, but an admission is binding only on the person who makes it. The Minister's admission is binding on his Government, but not on me. Besides. I did not say that all Ministers do it; I said that anti-Labour Governments do it. Was there any measure passed, or anything done by the Government during the war, which was not claimed to be for the enlargement of our liberties, although intended to restrict those liberties ? When they passed the War-time Elections Act, which practically tore up the naturalization certificates of many persons in the Commonwealth, did they not claim to be enlarging the liberties of the people? This measure increases the term during which a person who wishes to apply for a certificate of naturalization must reside in Australia from two to five years. Is that a liberalization of the law? The Minister and the honorable member for Moreton say that it is. </para>

                    <para>I have given an example of what will happen to a citizen of France who comes here. The position will be the same with regard to an American citizen. I agree with what the honorable member for Moreton has said with respect to the right of citizenship.- Citizenship is a great right, and it cannot be shown that under our naturalization laws up to the present time people have been improperly naturalized. What is the objection, then, to continuing as we were before? Why should not a French citizen become entitled to naturalization in Australia, at all events, by a residence of two years? Why should not an American citizen be entitled to be naturalized for Australia after two years' residence here? If the Government desire to confer some wider naturalization by all means ' let them do so, but do not let us curtail the right already existing for a foreigner to become naturalized after residing here for two years. In one of the earl'ier clauses of this Bill it is proposed to repeal the existing naturalization law. I put it to the Minister that the right to become naturalized in Australia should continue as at present, and that if the Government wish to extend that right to the Empire it can be so extended, if it becomes necessary, by the further residence for which this measure provides. The fact remains that the Bill will curtail and restrict the right of foreigners, who have been our Allies, to become naturalized. After all, a Frenchman is, technically, a foreigner - .an American is also - and their rights to citizenship in this country will be curtailed by the passing of this Bill. Yet the honorable member for Wide Bay, and the honorable member for Moreton seriously contend that this measure proposes to confer some advantage that is not conferred by the existing law. Such a sentiment, it seems to . me, comes strangely from the honorable member for Wide Bay, because he was a member of this Parliament when the Government passed a measure which disfranchised, not only naturalized citizens of Australia, but their descendants. That was done by means of the Electoral (War-time) Act. That Act is about to be repealed. Notice was given this afternoon of a motion for leave to introduce a Bill to repeal that Act, and now, when these citizens are about to have restored to them the right to vote, we have honorable members like the honorable member for Wide Bay rising in their places, and claiming that this is going to confer some advantage upon these persons whose votes they expect to secure. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the Act should ever have been passed. I was always' opposed to it, and consider it should be repealed at the earliest moment. The honorable gentleman, however, misunderstands me. I am pointing out that, on the eve of the repeal of the Electoral (War-time) Act- on the eve of these Australian citizens again being given the right to vote - we have honorable members who stood for the passing of that measure claiming that they are going to confer some advantage on these citizens, although they were a party to depriving them of their right of citizenship. When you take away a man's right to citizenship you practically take away everything from him. The6e people had reserved to them the privilege of paying taxes, but nothing more. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to refer briefly to the power of revocation. When a person becomes naturalized he thus has conferred upon him certain rights, including the right to hold property. An examination of the clause in this Bill  which gives the Minister power to revoke a certificate of naturalization will show that be may take that action if he thinks fit on certain . conditions, and one of those conditions is that the person concerned has been fined £100. When a person has paid a fine of £100, surely he has expiated his offence. That is the punishment provided by the law, but it is proposed in this Bill that in the case of a naturalized citizen of the Commonwealth, not only shall he have to bear that particular punishment, but, in addition, the Minister mav take from him the right to hold property. The Minister will have the right of spoliation. </para>

                            <para>- Then I have but one comment to offer, and that is that in Great Britain, as the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> has said, the administration of the naturalization laws during the war was far more reasonable than it was in Australia. There is no doubt as to that. The Government in Australia acted most capriciously. Persons were interned here simply because of representations made in regard to them, very often by political opponents. No one should know that better than the honorable member for Moreton. </para>

If those inquiries are to be conducted upon similar lines to those which were adopted under theWar Precautions Act, they will be worse than worthless. In the case to which I was referring, the Inspector of Police ascertained, upon inquiry, that the accused person was of good character, and was reputable and loyal. That was the report of the officer at Toowoomba. But what was the result? The accused person was interned. I might refer to many other instances of a similar character. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I hope that the Minister does not wish to reflect upon any of his predecessors. As a matter of fact,' the Department under which this so-called inquiry was conducted was the Defence Department. It may be that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is not as fair-minded as is the Minister for Home and Territories. However, I shall suspend judgment upon that matter, and, moreover, the latter has no lease of the office which he holds. For these reasons, I submit that the Bill, instead of extending the privileges enjoyed by citizens who have become naturalized in Australia will curtail those privileges. It will impose a distinct limitation upon persons who may come to this country hereafter, and become naturalized. In Committee, some amendments will require to be made to remove these blemishes, and to enable those persons who desire to become naturalized here to do so under similar conditions to those which obtained under the old Act. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a matter within your province, sir, which I should like to mention. During the last Parliament, the files which were previously supplied to honorable members, and in which they were accustomed to keep copies of Bills coming before this Chamber, were taken away from them upon the plea of economy. Personally, I find that I am now using about two dozen Bills, where formerly one was sufficient. I think you will find, sir, upon inquiry, that the so-called economy which has been imposed upon us is rather expensive. If you can restore the old practice, it will be a convenience to honorable members. </para>
