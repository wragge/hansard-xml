Last night Superintendent Weston was advised from Gould's Country that a light, believed to be a rocket, was observed between that town and the coast, 10 miles distant. </para>

                        <para>- Everything possible will be done to find the missing men. If, in view of the information that has just come to hand from Launceston, it is thought advisable to direct that the <inline font-style="italic">Swordsman</inline> shall make a search along the east coast of Tasmania, that will be done. The <inline font-style="italic">Swordsman,</inline> I am advised, is returning, not to Melbourne, but to Launceston, in order to obtain a fresh supply of provisions, and it will be an easy matter to direct that she shall continue the search along the Tasmanian coast.

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member was in the chamber last week when the Works and Building Estimates, which included a proposed vote for water supply for the College, were passed. That does not suggest that the institution is to be closed, and I have not given any consideration to the closing of it. The number of students entering the College, however, wall have to be restricted, since, if we continue to train as many men as we have been doing, we shall not be able to find appointments for them in the Australian N aval Forces. It is well worth considering whether it would not be practicable to train at the Naval College, not only naval students, but men for the merchant service. </para>

                            <para>- The matter is still under consideration, and, so far as I can see at present, the decision must be in the negative. The question to be determined is as to whether the Commonwealth should make a definite contribution to public health, a responsibility which belongs to the State. There is the further question as to whether, if we so contributed, we should not share the responsibility and privileges of the control of the health organization to which we contribute, on the well-known principle that taxation should carry the right of  representation. The other question to be determined is whether a moiety of the payment now made to the pensioner should be deducted and paid to the hospital. </para>

His  amendment relates to one of the difficulties affecting the position of firemen and trimmers, and it is one that Parliament should decide definitely at the earliest possible moment. It should not be difficult to make the necessary provision in a new clause, although if the schedule in the Act were before the Committee the position would be much clearer. </para>

I stated then that I could not see my way clear to agree to making the time unlimited, but that I would be prepared to consider a further extension of the period set down in the clause, provided it could be safeguarded in some way. Having considered the matter in the meanwhile, I am now agreeable to extend the period to three months. Accordingly, I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I am pleased that the Minister has reconsidered this point during the time the clause has been postponed. It was demonstrated here that  the  limitation of the time to one month would likely work a good deal of injury to seamen,  and  this view has recently been confirmed by the case of one of the Commonwealth steamers, whose seamen could not get to their home port until at least three or four months after having been shipwrecked. However, the Minister has attempted to meet us. I do not anticipate that there will be many cases which will not be covered by the extended period. </para>

                    <para>.- The British Government, in a despatch, recently brought under notice certain provisions of the Aliens Restriction Act passed by the Imperial Parliament last year, referring to the employment of aliens on British registered ships. The Secretary of State for the Colonies intimated that the British authorities would be glad of the co-operation of the Commonwealth Government, with a view to giving effect to such a provision, as the Imperial measure was not drawn to apply to Australasia. This, it was pointed out, made it necessary for corresponding restrictions to be imposed in Australia, so as to give the force of the law to the operation of the British Act. </para>

                <para class="block">This is one of the amendments to which I agreed recently in consultation with the Seamen's Union. Section 50 of the Act, which this new clause amends, relates to running agreements for voyages to and  fro between stated ports, or for a specified period which must not in any case exceed six months. The section as it stands provides that every such agreement shall remain in force until the ship's arrival at the port of destination, and, in the case of foreign-going ships, until the discharge of the cargo consequent on that arrival. The seamen consider it a great hardship that, after having arrived after a long voyage overseas, they should be obliged to stand by the ship until the whole of the cargo is discharged, though they may have little or nothing to do with that discharge, and simply because the ship may have to be moved a short distance or something of that sort. This very often prevents seamen from spending time at their homes, of which they see too little in any circumstances. The clause is intended to enable seamen to be discharged immediately on the arrival of the vessel in. port. </para>

According to the Act, these discharges must be in the master's possession. Recently the case occurred of a crew arriving in Australia, where they were due for discharge, but, through the carelessness of the master, or somebody connected with the ship, it was found that the discharges had been left in London. As the Act now reads, we could not impose any penalty on the master because the discharges were not in his possession.

                    <para>.- This is another of the amendments for which the seamen asked and to which I agreed. It seemed to me that one-half of the wages was not nearly sufficient to maintain a seaman's wife and family in Australia, and the clause will have the further advantage of taking temptation out of his way to spend money which ought to be devoted to his home. </para>

                    <para>.- The original section provides that the wages shall be paid to every seaman. The new clause substitutes the words " the wages due to the crew." The seaman, like every other workman, is entitled to the wages due to him personally. If I were working on a ship, I would have no concern as to whether or not the other seamen got their pay, so long as I received what was due to me. </para>

                <para class="block">The Senate 'has agreed to the Bill subject to two amendments. . On looking into the matter, I find it is clear that the Senate has constitutional power to make amendments in  a  Bill of this character; that is to say,  charges  for services rendered are not taxation in the technical sense. The first amendment is in clause 5, which provides that the postage on newspaper shall be lid. per 20 ozs. on the aggregate weight of newspapers posted by any one person at any one time, " provided that the minimum amount of postage payable on the aggregate weight of newspapers so posted shall be' ls." The Senate has struck out that proviso, and the effect of the amendment will be to give a great deal of relief to country newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but it does not affect them very much. The Government have no abjection to the amendment. The proviso was inserted only because it would save a little clerical labour in the office. The second amendment is in clause 8, and means that the minimum charge for Inter-State telegrams shall be ls. 4d. instead of ls. 3d. As Treasurer, I cannot afford to look a gift horse in the mouth; indeed, I am very much obliged to the Senate for this little evidence of consideration. The amendment will give the Department a little more revenue, and will simplify the calculation of telegram charges by the sender. 'The new charge is an even penny per word, with a minimum of ls. 4d.

                    <para>.- It is pleasing to have the Treasurer's assurance that he has looked into the constitutional aspect of these amendments, because this Chamber cannot permit the Senate to interfere with finance Bills in excess of its constitutional rights. I am in agreement with the Treasurer in regard to giving relief to country newspapers. It is very difficult for many of them to carry on their operations at the present time, especially on account of the very high cost of paper. Many of them have had to close down. I offer no objection to the first amendment. In re'gard to the second amendment, I see nothing in the Treasurer's argument that the process of calculation is simplified. It is as easy to send sixteen words for ls. 3d. as for ls. 4d. I can understand that the Treasurer embraces the opportunity of getting a little more revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot support the proposed, alteration of the basis of payment for telegrams. The arguments used in sup-! port of the Senate's amendment are ludicrous. The minimum charge for sixteen words was originally ls. 3d. The vast' proportion of telegrams sent every day. contain either sixteen words or less; and,, to begin with, the sum of ls. 3d. is a much more convenient amount to pay than ls., 4d., if the matter is to be studied from that angle. If .a telegram contains more: than sixteen words, say sixty, one is simply required to calculate at the rate of Id. per word over and above the sixteen, and ; then to pay Id. short. Why should those' who are in the habit of sending telegrams of not more than sixteen words be penalised by this proposed extra payment of Id.? </para>

I do not intend to oppose it, however, although I would do so now and at any time if it appeared that the Senate was seeking to interfere with our rights, and to encroach upon our privileges. I accept the statement of the Treasurer that there is nothing of that nature involved here, and am satisfied, therefore, to let the matter go. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposed new section covers one of those matters which were discussed with the delegates of the Seamen's Union. The same problem also received the attention of the ship-owners. I was perfectly frank with both parties in the endeavour to get them together so that we might ascertain just what would suit all concerned. "With respect to sh'ips trading on the Australian coast, it was generally agreed that there was no necessity for the provision of refrigerating chambers as indicated in the section. Requirements are already met, to a very large extent, on nearly every boat. In cases where a refrigeration chamber is not provided, the voyages undertaken are so short, and the ports of call so comparatively near to each other, that the equipment of an ordinary ice-chest, in which goods can be carried from place to place in fresh condition, is ample. With respect to the matter of tonnage, it was agreed that the limit of 3,000 tons would cover practically every foreign-going vessel concerned, for the reason that small boats do not pay on long voyages. </para>

                    <para class="block">It not infrequently happens that Parliament, in the production of new Acts, deals with some matter already covered to greater or less extent by previous legislation. As honorable members are aware, the principle in such cases is that where there is any conflict in the provisions of these two Acts, the later legislation prevails. Overlapping of this sort has occurred in connexion with one of the sections of the Navigation Act. Section 397 provides, among other things, that summary proceedings in regard to offences against the Act must be instituted, except under certain specified circumstances, within six months of the breach of the law. The majority of the offences created by the Act in regard to acts or defaults of masters, owners, agents, and others, are punishable on summary conviction, as distinct from indictable offences, which are required to be dealt with by a Judge and jury. Another Commonwealth Act, passed by Parliament two years after the Navigation Act, namely, the Crimes Act 1914, deals fully with offences against Commonwealth Acts, and their punishment. Section 21 of this Act provides, among other things, that prosecutions for offences against Commonwealth Acts or Regulations may be commenced as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>.- It  is  my intention to move for the insertion  of  a new clause 99 (a). In section 100  of  the Act, certain offences against discipline and penalties are specified. It is felt  by  the Seamen's Union - and I understand that its delegates have discussed the point with the Minister - that the penalties are too high. My desire is that the penalties shall be brought into conformity with the wishes of the Seamen's Union. Section 100 of the principal Act provides  that the punishment for desertion shall be " Forfeiture of all accrued wages not exceeding £20, or a penalty of £20." The Seamen's Union suggests that the penalty should he forfeiture of all accrued wages not exceeding £5, or a penalty of £5. For the offence of "failure or refusal without reasonable  cause  to join the ship or proceed to sea in- the ship," the section provides for- a penalty of £10. The Seamen's Union proposes that that penalty shall be reduced to £1. Under the Act as it stands,  absence without leave from duty without reasonable cause, " such absence not amounting to desertion or not treated as such 'by the master," is punishable by forfeiture of two days' wages, with an additional forfeiture of two days' wages for every twenty-four hours of absence, or a penalty of £20. It has been suggested by the Seamen's Union that the punishment should be forfeiture of wages during the actual time of absence. Then, again, under section 100, insubordination at .sea, or wilful disobedience to any lawful command at sea, is punishable by one month's imprisonment or forfeiture of ten days' wages. The Seamen's Union recommends that the punishment should be forfeiture of two days' wages. For the offence of insubordination or wilful disobedience to any lawful command, the section provides  for  forfeiture of two "days' wages or a penalty of £10. I pro"pose that, as recommended by the Seamen's Union, the punishment should be forfeiture of one day's wages. For " continued wilful disobedience to lawful commands or continued wilful failure in duty," the section provides for forfeiture of two days' wages for each day during which the offence continues. The Seamen's Union recommends that the punishment should be forfeiture of wages for the actual time during which the offence continues. The next offence with which section 100 deals is that of " conspiring with any other of the crew to disobey lawful commands at sea, neglecting duty at sea, or impeding the "navigation of the ship or progress of the voyage." For this offence a punishment of six months' imprisonment is provided. The Seamen's Union recommends that the punishment should be reduced to one month's imprisonment. For "wilfully damaging the ship,'' the section provides for a punishment of twelve months' imprisonment or a penalty equal in amount to the loss sustained. In lieu of this punishment, the Seamen's Union recommends that we should provide for three months' imprisonment. </para>

                <para>The .Act was passed in 1912, and, as many honorable members are aware, it occupied our attention for a very considerable time. Section 100, which deals with these penalties, was copied from the Merchant Service  Act of  1894. </para>

                        <para>- When I made the statement that these punishments had been copied from the Imperial Act, I was guided only by the marginal notes. I do not- think any useful purpose can be served by continuing these high penalties. They tend only- to embitter the relations between employers and employees. The Seamen's Union is perfectly frank. It recognises that some punishment is .necessary in respect of these offences, and it has agreed to those which I have embodied in the new clause that I propose to move. The proposed new clause is in keeping with the tendency of the age. Public feeling nowadays is opposed to the infliction of such heavy punishments as those for which section 100 provides. The men who go down to the sea in ships to-day, whether they be employed as seamen or firemen, are of a better type than were those who were so employed some years ago. In making that statement, I have no desire to reflect upon those who, in the days gone by, followed a seafaring life. As a matter of fact, for over 100 years my family  have been connected with the sea. I believe, however, that by reducing these penalties we shall create a better feeling: I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. -  Representatives of the Seamen's Union and of the employees have conferred with the Minister in regard to this matter. I think that the honorable gentleman is to be commended for his action, which has greatly assisted in creating a better feeling than has previously existed between the ship-owners and the seamen. The seamen demand that they shall be regarded as human beings, and treated in the same way as men who work on shore. In days gone by they were not so treated. The captain of a ship had power to inflict on his crew punishments that no employer on shore dare attempt to impose on his men. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I am simply pointing out that the position of seamen to-day is different from what it was in the years gone by. Until quite recently, they were dealt with in a way that the workers on shore would not tolerate. No doubt the fact that they were separated from the rest of their fellow-men encouraged the old system, and there still seems to be in the minds of some people the idea that they should be treated differently from ordinary human beings. The seamen say, however, that the time has arrived when they will, if necessary, force upon the community the recognition of their right to treatment such as is meted out to workers on the land. No workman on shore who refused to work could be punished in the way for which section  100  of the Act provides. I shall, doubtless, be told that offences at sea are calculated to create more difficulties and trouble than would similar offences on land. That may be so, but those who earn their living as seamen or firemen do not enjoy the privileges and advantages of those who work on shore, and they deserve special consideration at our hands'. The Act provides punishment for refusing to work. Every day in the week men engaged in various industries on short tell the "bosses" to go to Hades, and there; upon cease work. They are not punished, They simply draw their wages, and look elsewhere for employment. The Seamen's Union admits that refusal to work at sea is deserving of punishment and recommends that the punishment should be forfeiture of pay  in  respect of the time so lost If concerted action is taken and seamen leave their work, which, of course, is regarded as mutiny, the punishment suggested is heavier. The men have conferred with the Minister upon this matter, but he cannot see his way to go as far as they have requested. On many occasions I have spoken to seamen about the work they perform, but sailors do not care to talk much about their experiences at sea, just as soldiers will not speak freely about what occurs on the battlefield. There is a lot of sentiment and romance about a sailor's life, but an air of romance does not carry with it comfort, good pay, or good working conditions. The sailors would rather have the same matter-of-fact treatment that men on shore enjoy. I am certain that their treatment will be better in the future th'an it has been in the past. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has already referred to the fact that the seamen and firemen of to-day are a different class from those who followed the calling in the past, and this is due to the fact that bv organization they have been able to secure better treatment. We cannot expect refinement from a man who is subjected to brutal handling. It is not long since any request for improved accommodation and better food for sailors was ridiculed, but organization has brought about improvements in such matters, and the seamen claim now that the punishments imposed for crimes committed by them, which' on shore would, not be regarded as" crimes, should be reduced. Whether it is possible to secure any concession for them from this Committee I do not know, but although I have no desire to raise a crisis at this stage upon this particular issue, nor any desire to utter a threat, I can assure the Government and their supporters that if certain forms of punishment are sought to be inflicted upon the seamen engaged on our coast the men will demand, by other methods than by legislation, the removal 'of all these penalties which they consider unjust, as applied to them. They claim now that legislation should place them on the same footing as men on shore, and treat them as human beings, and they submit that the penalties they suggest are quite sufficient. </para>

                    <para>.- The punishments set out in the Act are not fines in the ordinary legal meaning of the term, but are actual forfeitures of pay to the master of the ship. If honorable members had encountered some of the cases with which I have come into contact in respect to seamen engaged on overseas vessels - and while we are discussing legislation of this kind it is well to keep such matters in mind - they would realize that it is not always the seaman who is to blame, but that very often the skipper of a vessel has deliberately attempted to rob his crew of their wages. An American consul has given me an instance of where this has been done. A number of seamen came to him and asked him for assistance. They had been before him on the previous day and been paid off with £2 each, which was all they swore they had to draw after, I believe, a nine months' voyage. But, apparently, they did this in order to get away from the ship, because when they came before him on the second day and he had cross-examined them, he ascertained their reason for accepting <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> each as their wages. They told him that during the latter period of the voyage the chief mate had evidently laid himself out to drive them out of the ship, and made matters so extremely warm for them that they were compelled to approach the captain and. ask for their discharge immediately on reaching port. They offered to leave without drawing any pay, but the master told them he would not leave them without any money, and offered to pay them <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> each. This offer they accepted, and accordingly they swore before the consul that <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> each represented all the money due to them. The skipper of this vessel, who had probably put the mate  up  to this course of action, netted £300 in this way out of his crew. We may not have skippers on the Australian coastal trade who would do anything like that, but we ought not to make such conduct possible, and should provide that seamen must be treated on the same footing as workers on shore. I do not object to the exercise of a fair amount of discipline in order to prevent a ship from being lost or damaged, but no one can recall any case of a ship having been lost through the men standing up for their rights on board as they would have done if they had been working on shore. Has any honorable member been in a police Court when a sailor has been charged with disobedience of orders to see what chance the seaman has? When sailors,  after reaching port, meet a few friends, and do not return to their vessel, they are taken to Court and carefully put into gaol until their ship is about to leave again. They are maintained at the expense of the Government, and as their wages are deducted while they are thus incarcerated there is so much saving to the ship. It is a  very  heavy penalty to impose fines of £20 or £10 for comparatively minor offences, and it is certainly a greater punishment than is imposed upon shore workers. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> that the sooner we treat sailors as human beings, and improve their conditions as far as we possibly can, even makin? them better than those of shore workers, because of the long periods for which they are away from their homes, and because of the dangers they run which other people are not called upon to endure, the better it will be for shipowners and the community generally. I hope that the Minister will agree to the new clause and to the principle of  imposing penalties on seamen which are much more reasonable than the drastic punishments provided in the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I was just about to point out that the punishments set out in the Act are the maximum penalties that may be imposed. Usually, on the hea'ring of a charge, all the circumstances in regard to an alleged offence are taken into account and the punishment is made to fit the crime, but my experience is that the tendency is for Courts to take a lenient view of offences of sailors unless they are of a very serious character indeed. I have had a good deal of experience in regard to law breakers - I have had to defend them - and, in addressing the Bench, have frequently had occasion to deal with the matter of punishments. I have had a fair opportunity of noticing the effect that a punishment, has on a law-breaker. My experience has led me to conclude that it does not matter much whether the punishment is six months or twelve months so far as its efficiency to act as a deterrent is concerned. I do not care much whether the Minister reduces the maximum or not in regard to certain of the offences set out in the Act, but I am astonished that the honorable member, for Yarra should suggest a maximum penalty of one month's imprisonment for the offence of " conspiring with any other of the crew to disobey lawful commands at sea, neglect duty at sea, or impede the navigation of the ship or progress of the voyage." </para>

In the case of sea employment, the failure of the individual may result in much "greater damage than would be the case in land employment. If two or three men absent themselves from ordinary work on shore, the business may go on pretty well as usual. </para>

                        <para>- In the great majority of cases no material difference is felt ; but if an equal number of seamen desert from a ship, their absence may result in much delay and serious loss. There is nothing more essential on board ship than strict discipline, within certain limits. The honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> gave an instance which he said ought to be an object lesson as to what may happen under the law; but such an instance could not occur under the Australian Navigation Act. The case cited was that of an American ship, and it was dealt with under American law, and what happened there could not happen in Australia under our law. Another honorable member asserted that the fines inflicted for offences go into the owners' pockets. That is not so, for all fines and forfeitures are paid into the public revenue. </para>

                        <para>- When the Navigation Act is in operation, these moneys will go into the Federal revenue. Honorable members must keep in mind the fact that these are maximum penalties, and that the occasions on which such offences are brought before the Court are very few. Desertion on the Australian coast is practically unknown, for the simple reason that under the agreement which the seamen have entered into with the owners, a man may leave at any time on giving twenty-four hours' notice. The Seamen's Union does all it possibly can to discourage desertion. The members who do desert are in most cases undesirables, and the Union is prepared to go to the length of expelling a man from membership who is guilty of such an offence. It is only fair to the Union that this should be known. The penalties can only be imposed by the Court, which has to decide as to the degree of guilt and the degree of punishment. In many cases the maximum penalty is not inflicted, but one considerably lighter. Some of these amendments go far beyond what is a fair thing. For instance, all that is suggested for insubordination at sea and wilful disobedience is the forfeiture of two days' wages, yet such an offence is a most serious one. However, under the Bill the Court may fine a man only ls. if it likes; there is no necessity to impose the maximum penalty. Then, again, it is proposed that for insubordination or wilful disobedience to any lawful command the punishment shall be the forfeiture of one day's wages. That, of course, might be too little in some circumstances, and too much in others. For continued wilful disobedience to lawful command, or continued wilful failure in duty, the punishment suggested is merely that the man shall not be paid for the time he does not work. No one can deny that there are circumstances under which such continued disobedience or failure in duty might cause the gravest danger to other members of the crew, and yet this minor punishment is provided, although the ship-owner has to continue to feed the offender all the time. The punishments proposed do not "fit the crime." Then for the offence of conspiring to disobey lawful commands, and so forth - an offence which might possibly mean the loss of the ship itself - imprisonment for one month is proposed; and three months' imprisonment is suggested as sufficient for wilfully damaging a ship, though in some cases this has amounted to actually setting the ship on fire and burning it to the water's edge in harbor. Such punishments show no regard for the fitness of things. After talking over the matter with the representatives of the Seamen's Union, we felt that nothing had been advanced sufficient to justify us in asking Parliament to make the maximum penalties less than those proposed - penalties which, so far as we know, are milder than those provided by the legislation of any other maritime nation. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret the Minister does not see his way to accept my proposal. It is said that the penalties provided in the Bill are lighter than those provided in the legislation of any other maritime nation. I am informed, however, that in the United States of America, for refusal without reasonable cause to join a ship or proceed to. sea, the penalty is the forfeiture of wages to the extent of no more than two days' pay and the payment of expenses properly incurred in hiring a substitute. The penalty provided in our Act is regarded by the seamen as outrageous, and certainly it is a penalty which no one would think of imposing on similar offenders in land employment. </para>

In the past, however, these seafaring offenders have not been properly defended, and have very often been kept in gaol until the time came for the departure of the ship. </para>

                        <para>- The policy of placing one man in charge, and making him practically the sole law-giver in regard to shipping is apt to lead to tyranny. That is why the seamen feel that they are entitled to some consideration in regard to penalties. The admission of the Minister that the seamen had met him fairly, and had in some cases dismissed men from the union for having deserted or not arrived at the ship in time, is an argument in favour of treating them leniently. The United States Seamen's Act stipulates that if a seaman refuses to proceed to sea, or is absent without leave, or is absent without cause, he shall forfeit from his wages a sum of not more than two days' pay, or sufficient to defray any expenses which may have been incurred in hiring a substitute. That provision would meet the seamen's desire. I very much regret that the Minister has not seen his way to accede to the wishes of the seamen in this regard. In the past the penalties have been altogether too high. The Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, and other laws of the kind, have treated the seamen as uncivilized beings, who were not entitled to the same consideration as were landsmen. I would like the Minister to accept the proposed new clause, or, at any rate, some modification of it. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment does not ask for too much. The man at the wheel is on duty in all weathers for two hours at a stretch without any protection. The seamen say that very few Australian ships have a wheelhouse for the protection of the man at the wheel, although he is exposed to all winds, rain, and, in a heavy sea, spray. In cold weather, he cannot walk about to keep himself warm as can the officer of the watch, and, in any case, the officer can shelter himself behind the canvas screens erected for his protection. Nearly all American ships provide a wheel-house for the protection of the man at the wheel, because the ship-owners recognise that they get better steering by reason of such accommodation.It may be argued that we are trying to coddle the seamen too much, but honorable members will admit that the man at the wheel should not be required to remain exposed to the elements for two hours at a stretch without any protection. The provision of a wheelhouse or some shelter would not be very expensive. On big vessels the officer of the watch is sheltered completely from the weather, and on nearly all ships he has some protection against the elements, but the man at the wheel has none. I remember that, on one occasion, when I was rounding Papua in the old <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England,</inline> the weather was so dirty that all passengers had to keep below decks, but the man at the wheel had to remain at his post fully exposed to wind, rain, and spray. As a young man, I was at sea in a barque, and the man at the wheel was subjected to weather conditions that no man should be asked to endure, especially when protection could be easily provided. Surely a ship-owner must get better steering from a man who is protected than from a man who is not. Unfortunately, the ship-owners still cling to the old idea that seamen are not human beings, and the concessions which have been obtained from them in recent years have been yielded grudgingly. I hope the Minister will accept the proposed new clause. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a matter to which I have already given consideration. My first inclination, following on the representations made to me, was to agree to the insertion of a new clause, covering this same matter; but, upon further cogitation, it appeared to me to be unwise to adopt such a course, because the outcome might lead to conditions which - however worthy the intention - would imperil the safety of a ship. The Director of Navigation has informed me that, as a matter of actual practice to-day, in heavy weather the man at the wheel is, in almost every instance, provided with some shelter. I have before me a memo, prepared upon this point, in which the Director of Navigation says - </para>

                    <para>The inclusion of the clause appears to me to be unnecessary, as I consider that the practice is so generally adopted in modern ships that the wisdom of interfering with the control of the master in these matters is doubtful. </para>
                    <para>While it is a fact that for a long time masters of deep-water sailing vessels could not bring themselves to believe that an officer could keep his watch behind a dodger in shelter from the wind, nowadays very few remain who still hold with the idea that an officer must be marching the weather side of the poop in a gale of wind to be awake. </para>
                    <para>The real objection that will be raised to the clause is that when a vessel is in narrow waters or in a fog, the helmsman must necessarily be on the flying bridge of the vessel. Here the erection of a canvas screen or dodger round the standard compass would certainly interfere with the navigation of the vessel in certain cases. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision. It is asking very little to provide protection for the man at the wheel who, in his exposed position, has highly responsible duties to perform. It has been my lot to see more than one helmsman overwhelmed by seas at the wheel. He has been torn from his post, and his ship has only narrowly escaped destruction owing to the loss of control. The whole history of shipping is a long series of disasters, owing to vessels being pooped by big seas. From the humanitarian view-point, the Government should not hesitate to compel the provision of necessary shelter. I have walked away from the wheel on many an occasion having no feeling at all in my legs below the knees. I had to stand for hour upon hour in sleet and snow when, if the water dashing about me had been fresh, it would have frozen. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot see the force of the Minister's contention. I understand that he will be content to set forth in the Act that that which is at present generally provided shall be considered sufficient. But that would not meet the views of the seamen. It is all very well to place a canvas screen out in front of the wheel, some ten feet distant, but overhead protection is not thus afforded. Why should seamen be compelled to undergo exposure from the weather when the smallest amount of trouble and expense would be involved in providing protection ? Market gardeners, as they bring their produce into the city and return, may be seen comfortably ensconced in little canvas shelters upon their vehicles, in the wettest and heaviest weather. Surely something, affording both overhead and side protection, could be safely, easily, and cheaply provided for the man at the wheel. </para>

Where there was any suggestion of danger, these canvas curtains could be drawn aside, so that the man at the wheel would have an unobstructed view. I think it would meet our purpose if the Minister would agree to provide that this shelter shall be erected in all cases where practicable.

                    <para>.- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is prepared to make some concession, but the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> thinks that he should go further. I have been on as many navigating bridges as has the average landsman, and I know that the captain and officers, while on duty, have a house in which to seek protection from the weather. But between the wheel and the compass there is a space of about 2 feet, and also a clear space on the other side for the officer on duty; so that a  canvas  screen, 4 feet,  6  feet, or 8 feet in front of the man at the wheel does not prevent him from being drenched by every wave that comes aboard. Our desire is that the man at the wheel should be afforded reasonable protection from the weather, and the screen which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports thinks should be erected could be readily removed when a  vessel  was coming into port. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the representatives of the Union have assured me that they are anxious to secure it. The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> who has an intimate knowledge of seafaring life, will recognise that the man at the wheel, who is exposed to all weathers, is entitled to some consideration. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> who has also followed a seafaring life, supports our proposal, which, in my opinion, would add to the safety of a vessel. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who has already spoken twice to this question and therefore cannot again address himself to it, suggests to me that the position might be met by agreeing to the proposed new clause submitted by the Minister on the understanding that a regulation dealing with the whole matter shall be framed. </para>

                <para class="block">There has been a lot of discussion, and much heart-burning, in regard to this matter on the part of both seamen and ship-owners. Ship-owners, who are naturally " after the profits," have tried to confine as much as possible the space allotted for the accommodation of seamen on ship-board. From time to time, that space, however, has been increased, and better conditions have been secured. I would draw special attention to the fact that the proposed new clause provides that in the case of all ships of 1,500 tons gross and over " built after the commencement of this Act," this additional accommodation shall be provided for seamen and apprentices. That meets the old argument that it would be impossible, in the case of many vessels, to make the structural alterations necessary to permit of this increased space being allotted to the men. If we agree to this clause, those who build ships after the commencement of the Act will know what, in this regard, is expected of them. Australian shipowners will not be able to claim that they have to compete with ship-owners in other countries who are not called upon to conform to such conditions, since seamen all over the world are demanding better conditions. We have been told to-day that ship-building in Australia is as cheap as anywhere else, and there is no reason why our ship-owners should not be called upon to allot this increased accommodation to their men. The men themselves say, "We think the space allotted for seamen as their berthing quarters is far too small, and as a seaman has to spend the greater portion of his life on board ship he ought to be entitled to at least the same space as a passenger." I know that there are people who will laugh at such a claim, but it really does not ask too much. Does anybody who goes to sea, even as a passenger, ever consider that he is given enough space for comfort? And yet the passenger accommodation is infinitely superior to that provided for the seamen. I admit that there are economic difficulties, but they can. and ought to be surmounted if we are a civilized people. We are told by the Seamen's Union - </para>

In the Merchant Shipping Act of as far back as the year 1355, the passenger regulations (schedule 10, section 3, Merchant Shipping Act 1906) says, "That if the height between the lower passenger deck and the deck immediately above it is less than 7 feet, no greater number of passengers shall be carried on such deck than in the proportion of one statute adult to every twenty-five clear superficial feet thereof." </para>

Further, it must be remembered that thu seaman has to make his home on board ship, and the passenger is only there for a short period. </para>

                <para class="block">Certainly seamen are now given considerable advantages as compared with the past, but .all they have obtained they have had to fight for. During the last few months they have had to resort to' direct action*, which many seafaring men prefer; and though I am of opinion that their demands ought to be met in ,a peaceful way, direct action should be held in reserve to be used when necessary. I believe in the old method when men cannot get a fair deal by other means. I have known a Minister of the Crown take a foot-rule and measure out on the floor the space which would be required if the men's demands were granted; but my reply to that is that those demands represent only about one-sixth of the space which a man would be' given on shore. In a number of houses in my electorate the rooms are not large, but they are bigger than the accommodation provided on board ship and yet, if as many men were  put  into one of them as are asked to berth together at sea, the Board of Health would interfere. "We ought to remember that the better conditions the better the class of men who will enter the calling. No doubt their treatment in the past brutalized men, and this largely accounts for the allegations that if proper lavatory and bathing accommodation is provided, the men allow it to get into a filthy condition. For that, I say, their environment is largely responsible, bringing out, as it does, their worst qualities. "With better conditions, a man is encouraged to look after himself, and to prefer cleanliness. Australian seamen, like all Australians, are a bit proud, and desire cleanliness  and civilized surroundings. They now claim the same air space that is demanded for the people ashore,' and the demand is reasonable. Possibly the Minister will tell us that my proposal is not feasible; but ship-owners, both private and State, will have to realize the fact that the old days of the " boss " who insisted on running his business " in his own way " are gone, it being realized that those employed have as much interest in it as the employer. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Minister will accept the proposed new clause, for if ever compulsion was needed it is in relation to the accommodation provided for seamen. On the 5th May, 1900, there was a debate on shipping matters in the House of Commons. At that time, Lord Salisbury was Premier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ritchie President</inline> of the Board of Trade. The Peninsular and Oriental Company then allowed only 36 cubic feet for their men, and in justification pleaded, when entering English ports, that they were under the Indian law. This 36 cubic feet meant something like 2 feet wide by 6 feet long, or the dimensions of a double-size coffin. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ritchie</inline> pointed out that it was not due to lack of continual warning that the Peninsular and Oriental Company could plead ignorance as to what its duty was, and although one of his colleagues was a director of the company, he said that the time might come when it would have to be prosecuted criminally. The motion on which this debate took place was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> a member for one of the English sea-port towns; and ultimately every vessel of the Peninsular and Oriental Company that left the port of London was deprived by the authorities of space for cargo to the extent of the difference between the 36 cubic feet provided and the 120 cubic feet demanded by English law. I may point out that had it not been for the compulsory four-hours duty on deck, the death rate amongst sailormen  would have shown their calling to be the most dangerous known in Britain. It was this enforced duty on deck that preserved their health, and saved them from having to remain  under  infernal- conditions in their quarters, generally below water line, with no means of ventilation. I came to Australia no  less than five times as doctor on board passenger ships, and on not one occasion did I observe that proper accommodation was provided for the sailormen. There has been a continual fight between sailors and owners - a fight marked .at times with absolute murder. The Plimsoll mark is disappearing, and many ships are sailing without it under the British flag. The time was when a merchant could say that his best market was under the sea, provided the ships and goods were properly insured. </para>

As a youngster I wondered, and asked my boss what was meant. I was informed that the merchant preferred that "mar: ket" even if it involved the loss of ship and crew, and when I suggested that that was murder, my boss smiled grimly and agreed with me. Honorable members may not be aware that architects of the present day are allowing a greater number of cubic feet than ever before in factories, because it is realized that workers must have ample light and fresh lair. Even the picture theatres of this city are setting an example to some of the churches in this connexion. Only within the last ten years has the sailorman been winning a decent position in life. The accommodation for which we are asking would mean merely a space  3  feet by  6  feet by  10  feet. 'Surely that is little enough. </para>

                        <para>-  I have previously mentioned to the House the scandalous way in which the seamen and others were treated on board one- of the Orient steamers. I boarded the vessel at Fremantle, and General Lassetter and two nurses called my .attention to the disgraceful accommodation provided for the crew. I accompanied General Lassetter on a visit oi inspection to the mien's quarters, and I found that the owners had tried to crowd  100  men into the apace provided for  80.  When the seamen struck in port, and would not sail under those conditions, the vessel put to sea, and it was then found that eight additional men had been crowded into each compartment designed to accommodate forty. There was no accommodation for the men to sit- down to meals; they had to eat in the alleys. Yet on that great steamer the cost of a first class saloon passage to Australia was  £120.  As members of Parliament, we must get out of our minds the idea that the owners will ever go out of their way to provide proper accommodation for the seamen. I remember Professor Scott, of Melbourne University, calling my attention to a report which was published in the weekly edition of <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> in  1900,  in which a British Admiral, who was a member of the House of Commons, said that the Peninsular and Oriental Company employed more lascars than any other company, and was partly responsible for the under-manning of British men-of-war, because, said he, " England's battles cannot be fought with lascars and foreigners." The debate on that occasion led to the passing of legislation controlling the employment of lascars on board ship. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a. very important amendment, and it commends itself to me. I am surprised that we have not previously stipulated that an adequate space shall be allowed to each seaman. An area of  6  by  6  by  5  feet is little enough for anybody. I do not wonder that there is difficulty in getting men for the shipping service, if the accommodation provided for them is not in conformity with that provided in other occupations. I understand that one of the vessels being built by the Commonwealth at the present time includes the provision for which the -proposed new clause stipulates. We should make such provision general. Prom a health point of view, it is necessary to provide proper breathing space. As a -passenger on board ship I have always found the space too limited; but the seamen, who work on the vessels day after day, and mon,th after month, have not nearly as much space as have the passengers. We have far too much regard for the owners' point of view. The ship-owner, like every other employer, is constantly urging his side of the -case, and he cannot be blamed for so doing; but Parliament should be able to decide what is reasonable accommodation in the interests of all concerned. We should effect some improvements on the conditions which existed, say, thirty or forty years ago. </para>

                <para>Mr.CHARLTON.- I do not know how seamen who are 6 feet in height manage to squeeze into the accommodation that is provided. I am not a very big man, but if I had to crowd into the space which is allowed to a seaman, I would be touching each end of the bunk. I urge the Minister to give this question more careful consideration. He has been endeavouring to meet the desires of different honorable members as far as possible, especially of those members who are closely identified with the shipping industry. By accepting this amendment, he will render a good service not only to the seamen, but to the community generally, because there will be an additional inducement to men to engage in seafaring life. </para>

                        <para>- They are very necessary. We are not asking for a cubic space of 276 feet per man. Twenty-six feet of deck or floor space means merely an area 6 feet by 4½ feet, of which the bunk will occupy 3 feet by 6 feet. The seamen have not only to sleep in that space, it is also their living and dining room. In any modern factory the cubic space per employee is infinitely greater than is provided for in this amendment; and that space is only for working, not for living and eating. We ask the Minister to agree to stipulate the accommodation mentioned in the new clause, and to provide that all new ships built by the Commonwealth shall be in strict accordance with the Act, providing the space mentioned as a minimum, and, if possible, giving the same accommodation as on the American steamer <inline font-style="italic">Liberty.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  All that is asked for is space per man amounting to 6 feet by 6 feet by 5 feet. Surely that is not too much air space. Commonwealth ships hitherto constructed did not conform to the provision of 6 feet by 3 feet space, and some structural alteration has been required. That fact indicates how little either the general public or the actual ship designers know of what is really necessary in the health of seamen. How long would  honorable members care to be boxed up, four of them together, in a  four-berth  cabin? Seamen have to live in such conditions day after day and month after month. </para>

                    <para>.- This is one of the questions which I discussed with the seamen themselves. After giving the whole of the points grave consideration, I came to the conclusion that I could not ask Parliament to consent at present to an alteration of this vital provision in the Act. In the first place, our navigation laws are much more liberal than those of any other country in the world. I will furnish figures to indicate to what extent the requirements of our Act exceed those in existence elsewhere. The Australian Navigation Act provides for 140 cubic feet capacity and 18 super, feet by way of floor area. There is also separate mess room, sanitary, bath and hospital accommodation. In Great Britain the cubic capacity is 120 feet, and the floor area 15 super, feet. The space occupied by  messroom  and washing place, if provided, may be deducted from accommodation space, provided that the latter be not reduced below a minimum of 72 cubic feet and 12 super, feet. The last-mentioned measurements are all that are required in vessels up to 3,00 tons net. Under the New Zealand Act, the cubic capacity is 72 feet, and the floor area 15 super, feet; the general provisions are the same as those existing under the British Act. In Canada, the provision is for 72 cubic feet and 12 super, feet, but there is no provision for  messroom,  bathrooms, &amp;c. In the United States the provision is 120 cubic feet, and 16 super, feet. Washing places are provided, but there is no provision for mess room. In Germany the provisions are 123^ cubic feet, and 16 super, feet. There, mess accommodation is provided for half the crew, and there is a bathroom as well as facilities for washing clothes. In France the same figures rule as in respect of Germany, and washing-places are provided. In Norway the provision is 120 cubic feet, and 17.2 super, feet. Twenty-five per cent, of the space occupied by separate mess rooms, if provided, may be deducted from the space allowed for sleeping quarters.- There are no bathrooms, &amp;c. In Japan there are, as yet, no legal requirements, and conditions are regulated by custom. I emphasize that, in connexion with the space provided under the Australian Act, it is space for sleeping quarters only. It must not be forgotten that the apace available in a ship is that which determines its earning capacity. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, that is not so in respect of some- vessels ; but others, " again, are being built in which special provision has been made to fulfil the requirements of the Act. Space governs the earning capacity of a vessel; and, while one may have every desire to meet the requirements of the seamen, it must not be forgotten that, if the mark is over-stepped, the public must ultimately pay by way of increased charges. Thus, the burden will return upon the producers and the general public. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so- if our present provisions are inadequate. Seeing that the provisions of our legislation are, so  far as we know, in advance of those in any other Act in the world, I stress that we should give them a trial. let us ascertain what the furnishing of this increased space will mean in added charges to the public; for it must not be overlooked that such space as is already provided for will involve increased' freight costs. Subsequently, if it is found in practice that amendments of the Act are desirable, the matters involved will be for Parliament to deal with. </para>

Commonwealth public servants naturally claim that such positions should be allotted to them.The State Service is not open to Commonwealth officers, and, that being so, Commonwealth officers should have the first claim to vacancies in the Service. Officers of the Department have already protested, but have obtained no satisfaction. I hope that the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> will take this matter into immediate consideration. I desire now to draw the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to the fact that in this week's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> there appears an advertisement inviting applications from persons outside the Service for the position of Investigation Officer in the Commonwealth Taxation Department. As honorable members know, more skilled officers have retired from that branch of the Service than from any other, in order to enter upon outside business pursuits. </para>

                            <para>- I have not heard of that. There are in the Taxation Department, and other branches of the Service, a great number of officers who have spent years of study and large sums of money in qualifying in accountancy and business principles. These men are now to be overlooked, and are told that some one from outside is to fill this position. For years this investigation work, I am advised, has been satisfactorily performed by qualified men already in the Service. Officers in the Department ask that the advertisement be withdrawn, and that applications should first of all be invited  from those within the Service. If no applications are received from members of the Commonwealth Public Service who are qualified for the position, the ordinary routine of inviting applications from outside may then be followed. Having regard to the fact that many officers are leaving the Service, it is unwise for the Taxation Department to confine this position to outsiders; and it is certainly unwise that the Defence Department should go to the State Service for an officer to fill a position for which many men already in the Department are admirably qualified. </para>

As to the complaint made by the  Leader  of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> I know nothing of the advertisement to which he refers ;but we certainly require a lot of competent men in the Taxation Department. I may tell the honorable member that I gave authority the other day for something like thirty appointments. The investigation work to which he refers is not being done, and, because of that,  We  are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds. I shall be glad to look into the case to which the honorable member refers. He knows, however, that the Act makes the Commissioner of Taxation in all matters of administration independent of the Ministerial head of his Department. </para>
