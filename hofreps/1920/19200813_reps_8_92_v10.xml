                        <para>- Obviously, this is a question of which notice should be given; but I would remind the honorable member that the Prime Minister of Great Britain is said to' doubt the accuracy of the report, which purports to be a statement of French intentions, and one can only hope that he is right. It would be a calamity if, at the present moment, any one nation took upon itself the responsibility of interfering in the tangled affairs of Europe. This is not a time for playing a lone hand there, and many of the troubles occurring to-day illustrate the danger of divided councils within as well as without the State. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member having brought the matter under my notice, I at once rang up the Commodore of the Fleet, and I have since been informed that the trouble has been remedied. If further complaints are made, I hope that the honorable member will forward them. Our Fleet should not be a nuisance in any harbor ; indeed, those in control of it should set an example to private ship-owners. That is the view of the Naval Board and the Commodore as well. </para>

                        <para>- A large number of serious accidents have happened in Australia in connexion with aviation. Before a man is allowed to drive a motor car, he must obtain a certificate of competency; but I understand that there is no law - Commonwealth or State - to compel the man who wishes to pilot an aeroplane to prove his ability to do so. Is this matter within the domain of Commonwealth legislation, or is it for the States to take action? </para>

                        <para>If a Minister desires to interfere in a dispute he can proceed by calling  a  compulsory conference before an organization has bad time to take any steps in regard to the matter. If that conference fails to agree in regard to the whole dispute, the Minister has power to refer the matter immediately to a Special Tribunal which may make an award. The Minister may thus oust the Arbitration Court. The only exception to that procedure is when a plaint is pending in the Arbitration Court, and proceedings have actually commenced. If it is not the intention of the Prime Minister to deprive any organization of the right to approach the Arbitration Court, the provision for a compulsory conference should be struck out of the Bill. The organizations would then have the right to go to the Arbitration Court or to have their dispute dealt with by a Special Tribunal. </para>

                    <para>. - I  thought this provision for a compulsory conference would be regarded as one of the most valuable parts of the Bill. It is admitted that the Arbitration Court has done much good work by exercising its power to compel the parties to meet. I said last night, in reply to the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> that the most valuable part of this measure is the fact that it brings the parties together at  a  conference table. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this clause is to enable a tribunal to deal with a dispute, which has been referred to a compulsory conference without a settlement having been reached, thus giving the tribunal the same jurisdiction as the Court has in relation to such disputes. If that provision is taken away this Bill will at once assume a menacing rather than a conciliatory form. It will say, in effect, " There shall be no attempt at conciliation; we shall at once bring you before the bar of justice and make you do a certain thing." The honorable member has suggested that this provision takes away the right of the union to go to the Arbitration Court, but I hope he will not think that such is the intention. This measure will not touch any union that wishes to approach the Court ; it will only be used where unions will not go to that Tribunal. It will have nothing to do with those who will go to it. We must have some remedy where unions will not go to the Court, and the first remedy to which we propose to have recourse is that of conciliation through a compulsory conference. Power is given to bring the parties together and leave them to endeavour to reconcile their differences. I hope that the honorable member will not take objection to the powers given to a Special Tribunal under paragraphb. </para>

                <para class="block">This practically limits the prohibition, as one may call it, against interference by a Special Tribunal to a comparatively small number of industrial disputes out of the total number which are under consideration by the Arbitration Court. Not all disputes come before that Court by means of plaints. In practice we find that a great majority of them do not originate in that way, but come to the Court following upon compulsory conferences. ' Furthermore, the Conciliation and Arbitration. Act stipulates quite a number of ways in which disputes may come before the Court other than by the method of plaint, the various ways being set out in section 19 of the Act, which reads as follows: - </para>

Any number of disputes may be pending before the Court, and the Bill will give a Special Tribunal the power to "butt in" upon the consideration of them if only the limitation contained in the proviso to clause 15 is retained. Apparently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> desires that the powers of Special Tribunals shall be exercised collaterally and on parallel lines with the work of the Arbitration Court, and from the fact that this proviso has been inserted in clause 15, I should suppose that he does not intend that a case actually in course of being dealt with by that Court shall be interfered with by any Special Tribunal against the will of the Court it may be, and even, apparently, against the wish of the parties. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with what the right honorable gentleman has said, but it does not cure the difficulty I have raised ; on the other hand, it rather bears out what I have been saying. Where a case has been brought before the Court by means of a plaint, it may not be considered by a Special Tribunal while it is pending before the Court. It may not be a case in which the Court has failed; the Court may be proceeding quite satisfactorily with the hearing of the case, and the parties may be quite satisfied to remain under its jurisdiction. In such circumstances, so long as the case has originated by means of a plaint, the Special Tribunal cannot interfere with it, but if a compulsory conference has been held under the powers given by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the  President  of the Court has referred the matter into Court, as he may do, without the necessity of proceeding by way of a plaint, and the parties are quite satisfied to go before the Court, being so referred to it, the proviso to clause 15 will not prevent a Special Tribunal from interfering in such a case. I have already quoted section 19 of the Act to show that there are a great many other cases in which disputes may be brought before the Arbitration Court, and the Special Tribunal may interfere with them. So long as the Court is functioning apparently in a satisfactory way, surely the Prime Minister does not desire that Special Tribunals shall be invited to interfere with it. </para>

                        <para>-  Under the Act cases may originate in several different ways, and we only prevent the Special Tribunal from . interfering with those which have originated by means of a plaint. The honorable member's contention is that in all cases where a hearing has been commenced, irrespective of the way in which they have originated and irrespective of whether the Court has gone on with them, the Special Tribunal should not interfere. </para>

                        <para>- It will. There is a curious phrase in the last line of the proviso, which says that no dispute as to which a plaint is pending in the Court and a hearing has commenced " shall be referred" to a Special Tribunal. Many matters may come before a Special Tribunal which are not referred to it. It may really grip disputes where it likes under clause 19, which gives the power to convene a compulsory conference. "It is misleading to say that no dispute shall be referred to it. Under clause 19 a Special Tribunal or the  chairman  or the Minister, or any person thereto authorized in writing by the Minister, may summon any person to attend at a conference. The number of disputes actually referred to a Special Tribunal may be comparatively small. It may be merely a matter of verbiage, but it seems to me that the phrasing of clause 19 leaves it open to the Special Tribunal itself to seize upon a dispute that is already before the Court. If it is made clear that that cannot be done I shall be satisfied. Will the Prime Minister consider my suggestion ? </para>

Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause  15  declares that a Special Tribunal shall have cognizance of any industrial dispute referred to it by the persons or associations parties thereto. That is an exceedingly broad provision. It appears to me that under it it would be possible for an association of employers or employees to request a Special Tribunal appointed for a specific purpose and relating possibly to an entirely different trade to deal with a dispute existing in their industry. </para>

The point might be raised that the Tribunal, having been specifically appointed for the coal trade, had no power to deal with the wharf labourers' dispute, but the answer would be made that under clause  15  a Special Tribunal has power to take " cognizance of any dispute referred to it by the persons or associations parties thereto." Is there anything to prevent that being done? </para>

                <para class="block">Let us take a concrete illustration of the honorable member's point. We have at the present time a Shipbuilding Tribunal, and the honorable member suggests that one of the parties to an industrial dispute in some other industry, being very pleased with its work, might think it advantageous to have its case dealt with by it. That Special Tribunal, however, could not deal with their case, because its charter - the terms of its appointment - sets out that it is to deal with such-and-such a matter. A Special Tribunal will be limited by its charter. We might, for instance, appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into matters A, B, and Cj but it could not inquire into matters D, E, and F, even if they were closely associated with those specifically referred to -it. That is my answer to the honorable member, and I think that, with the proviso as I propose to amend it, the position will he made quite clear. We shall make it clear that these Special Tribunals will be confined to the object of the Bill as stated by me, namely, to deal with cases that cannot -be, or are not, dealt with by the Arbitration Court, and are. a menace to the community. Speaking for the Government, let me say that these Tribunals will not be appointed as an ordinary means of deal-  ing with industrial troubles. They will be a reserve power to conserve the welfare of the community, and to preserve it from the consequences of industrial unrest. </para>

                <para>I have already placed clearly before the Committee the reasons that actuate me in proposing this amendment; and,( since I  desire to help the Government to pass the Bill through its remaining stages before we rise to-day, I shall not take up much time in dealing with it. It may be argued that my amendment would come into conflict with the Constitution, but I do not see that that is so. Decisions have been given by the High Court in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth. For instance, in the McKay case, which is the only case having any direct bearing, it decided that the Arbitration Court had not the power to fix prices. I am not asking that prices should be fixed, but that in connexion with the coal industry, for instance, the Tribunal should have the right to inquire into every phase, so that, in the interests of the employees and the general public, it may !be ascertained whether there is any justification for increasing the price of the commodity in order to give increased wages. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, but the trouble is that the powers of the Arbitration Court do not quite provide for what I desire. The Arbitration Court has power to do certain things, but up to the present it has not been able to go beyond the dispute before the Court. Payment by results is a method generally accepted by the honorable members opposite; and if on those results depends the selling price of the commodity, it is fair to the men that there should be some means of ascertaining whether the selling price is commensurate with what they are paid. To-day there is a declared price for coal, but no one knows whether or not it is the price obtained. The men, however, are paid only on the declared price; and to give satisfaction in the coal industry, in which I am deeply interested, the men claim that they ought to be able to inquire into every phase of it. </para>

                    <para>.- When speaking on the second reading, and at subsequent Committee stages, I pointed out the limits of our power in regard to prices and profits. I said that once we established the fact that the evidence sought to be obtained is relevant to the dispute, I personally do not see that there -are any limits, because the Tribunal is created to prevent and settle disputes. The jurisdiction having been clearly established, the only question is whether the evidence desired is relevant to the dispute. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has taken a concrete case, and, after ali, we are dealing with concrete, and not hypothetical, cases. 'The honorable member says that there are men on piece-work, paid so much a ton for hewing coal, and that when the declared price is 17s. 9d. the hewing rate is so much. The men also say that nothing is more calculated to cause industrial unrest, and breed discontent, than a feeling that they are not getting a fair deal - that somebody is " having" them. It is said that a man will be more content, and less likely to create industrial unrest, if he is getting 3s., with the knowledge that he is being fairly dealt with, than if he is getting 3s. 6d., feeling that he is being "had" at the latter rate. That is quite true; and the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> contends that all the evidence bearing on that phase should be brought out. I appreciate the necessity for such evidence where it is for the purposes of the dispute, and not for other purposes. I pointed out to the honorable member the other day that, recently, there have been made public statements by certain officials of the Coal Miners Federation for which the men are not necessarily responsible. These officials have said that the miners wish to own the mines; but that is not relevant to the present dispute. It is an aspiration of a section, an aspiration which may be good or bad, but the miners as a whole are not necessarily to be held responsible for it. Every man in the Coal Miners Federation has a perfect right to hold opinions on the point; one man may say that he believes in the mines for the miners; another that he believes in the mines for the people of New South Wales; a third, that they should belong to the people of all Australia; while another may say he believes in the present system. All these opinions are perfectly compatible with membership of the union. If a certain section propose to use such evidence "for the purpose of furthering their political purposes, to obtain information which may, perhaps, do us harm in our foreign trade with our foreign competitors, it will not do at all. Therefore, it must be clearly understood that the only evidence that will be permitted will be evidence relating to the dispute, and for the purpose of dealing with the dispute, which, of course, is a matter relating to the wages and conditions of labour. That being so, we have to ask ourselves how far the amendment is acceptable from the Government's point of view of the desire that is at the back of it, and how far it is constitutional. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say it does. There are two points I should like to mention to the honorable member. A great deal of industrial unrest arises through a suspicion in the minds of the coal miners that there is much leakage between the shovel and the grate. It is not material whether that suspicion is true or not - the fact is the men believe it. The miners say one thing and the mine-owners another; and if the whole facts were brought out, the Tribunal would consider them, and give a decision fair to the community, in the matter of price - because it would have relation to price - and fair to the men. But it will not help the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> if we insert an amendment that the High Court will say is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires;</inline> and, therefore, in order to make it perfectly clear what questions may be asked, I suggest that we strike out the words "pertaining to the industry," and provide that the Tribunal have power to inquire into all matters "relating to the dispute, from the point of production to the final disposal of the commodity." I have never been one to whittle down the powers of the Commonwealth, but have always upheld them. Once you establish the fact that the matter is relevant to the dispute, we have, in my opinion, the right to ask the questions, and, with the alteration I have suggested, the honorable member's amendment will be constitutional, and quite acceptable to me. There is one other point at which I wish the honorable member to look. He adds the proviso - </para>

                        <para>- I can tell you a story on that point. In the times when files were cut by hand the. process was regarded as a trade mystery - a secret - and was usually carried on in some <inline font-style="italic">cul-de-sac</inline> in Sheffield. The business brought great profit to the employers; but one day a donkey wandered into a <inline font-style="italic">cul-de-sac,</inline> saw through the window of a house a mau cutting files, and then came out into a Sheffield street and "hee-hawed." Thus the secret was " given away." What, I think, the proprietors have a right to expect is that their business shall not be disclosed either to their rivals in this country or their competitors in others, and therefore we ought to strike out the words " relating to any trade secret." Section  85  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides - </para>

                    <para>.- I am prepared to meet' the right honorable member. My only object is to make clear in the Bill what is needed. The Prime Minister and others declare that what I wish to have done is already provided for, but the people outside say that it is not provided for, and at a critical moment like the present it is important to make the provision clear. I agree to the insertion of so much of section 85 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as hag been read by the Prime Minister, with the substitution of the word " Tribunal " for the word " Court ". </para>

Thus the right of these Special Tribunals to take particular evidence might be challenged, and the evidence disallowed on other than constitutional grounds. </para>

                        <para>-  In the coal industry, the hewing rate depends on the declared selling price of coal, which the miners contend means the real selling price. If in a dispute the miners said that they were not getting a fair; deal, evidence as to whether the declared selling price was the same thing as the actual selling price would be relevant, because it would embody the subject-matter of the dispute. </para>

The admissibility of evidence raises one of the greatest difficulties in law, and a new trial is frequently ordered, either because a Judge has wrongfully admitted, or because he has wrongfully rejected, evidence. We should prevent this Tribunal from being hamstrung by appeals to a superior Court on the ground that the evidence taken was not relevant. </para>

                        <para>- That is not exactly my point. The right honorable gentleman knows how these appeals arise. Some coal magnate will be placed in the witness box and asked a question bearing on the profits made between the production of the coal and its purchase by the consumer, which he will refuse to answer. You will then have to take proceedings to compel him to answer, as was done in connexion with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He may then say that the question is not relevant to the dispute, and the point will go on appeal to a higher Court. The High Court might hold that the question was not relevant, although the asking of it was not beyond the constitutional powers of the Tribunal. </para>

                    <para>.- I said on the second reading that I am opposed to penalties being included in a measure of this nature, the success of which must depend on the good-will of both sides. But the Committee will agree that the clause with which we are now dealing is in a different category. If a member of a Tribunal has not the decency to keep secret information that comes into his possession as a member of the Tribunal, we should not have any hesitation in imposing a penalty upon him.. I ask the Prime Minister whether some penalty should not be provided for in connexion with this clause as amended. </para>

                    <para>. - I entirely agree with the honorable member. There must be some penalty for the disclosure of information that is given under a pledge of secrecy. I refer honorable members to the words in clause 16, that " any act or omission on the part of any person which would, if the hearing or inquiry were the hearing of an industrial dispute before the Court, be an offence against the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1S, shall be an offence against this Act." I am inclined to think that those words meet the point raised <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the honorable member for Flinders. ' Whatever we think of penalties in general we cannot allow the financial position or trade secrets of companies or persons to be disclosed to the Tribunal under cover of secrecy and then given to the public. </para>

                    <para>. - The effect of including section 85 is that a member of a Tribunal who discloses secrets is liable to a penalty of £500, or three months' imprisonment, but I am anxious to see provision made that any person summoned to appear before a Tribunal who refuses to give information in regard to his profits, or any secretary of a union who fails to disclose the membership of his organization, shall be subject to the same penalties. Furthermore, in my opinion, the two offences should be included in the one clause. </para>

The man who, after hearing evidence in secret, discloses it, does that which cannot be recalled. The consequences of his action cannot be overtaken. His is a very serious offence, which may have very serious consequences to the parties concerned. On the other hand, a man who is summoned to appear before the Court and does not attend can. be punished and still summoned and compelled to give evidence, or the man who refuses to answer questions can be punished and still be obliged to answer questions. </para>

                    <para>.- I ask the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Hughes)</inline> to look at section 21aa of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which deals with an application to the High Court for a declaration of the existence of a dispute. Apparently a Special Tribunal is not to enjoy the benefit of that provision. As the clause stands it will have power to hear and determine any industrial dispute of which it has cognisance, and " any industrial dispute " means one which is in fact a two-State dispute. A slight amendment of the clause which I am prepared to suggest would give the Tribunal the benefit of section 21aa of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to point out that the curious thing about the Local Boards is that, apparently, they are intended to operate in respect of purely local disputes and within certain well-defined areas. But the Government must be aware that the Federal Legislature has no power to legislate in respect of local disputes. I cannot understand why the Local Boards should be invested with the very wide and general powers proposed - on the same lines, indeed, as the powers to be given to a Special Tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- I do not profess to know just what that may mean. It is not a Local Board appointed by a Special Tribunal; and it appears that, once a Local Board is set up, there are no limitations to its powers, because we shall have gathered up in the Local Boards all the powers which are given to a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration under the Act itself. If any honorable member cares to take the trouble to examine the Act to determine exactly what my point implies he will realize how tremendous are the powers to be vested with this purely Local Board. The Government will see that the amendments they have promised in regard to Special Tribunals are no doubt given also in the case of Local Boards; that is, so far as concerns the determination of what a dispute is before the matter is heard by a Local Board. First, there may be a Local Board appointed " in relation to a Special Tribunal," and this Board, under the Arbitration Act, may appoint Boards of reference. So, there will be a Special Tribunal, which will have a Local Tribunal appointed in relation to it; which, in turn, can appoint a Board of reference under the Arbitration Act. Where the powers of these Local Tribunals will end - if ever they do - I am at a loss to imagine. I opposed the Bill at its second-reading stage as undermining the Arbitration Act; and, although I have made some honest attempts in Committee to improve it, I cannot understand the position of these Local Boards. Their status should be more clearly defined, as being subordinate in their control to the Special Tribunals in relation to which they have been appointed. In the first place, if these Boards operate at all, they will operate in regard to disputes over which this Legislature has no jurisdiction, and, if they have jurisdiction, the Boards will be merely duplicating and repeating the work of another' body. </para>

                    <para>.- I would like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to closely examine this clause. In view of the fact that the Committee has left out clause 17, the clause now under consideration has quite a different bearing. Under clause 17 there was power to appeal to a Special Tribunal under abnormal conditions, but now that clause has been eliminated appeals cannot be made to a Special Tribunal, and there may be difficulties in getting to the Court. Industrial organizations may experience difficulty in getting to the Court to vary an award. </para>

The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has in his mind a reference to a Local Tribunal of matters that should be referred to a Special Tribunal; but that is not the position, as the questions referred to a Local Tribunal would be subsidiary questions relating to comparatively trivial matters.

                        <para>-  There .is a distinct difference between a forced determination and an agreement which is accepted. In the event of a forced decision, a Special Tribunal has power to review it, but I am inclined to think that an agreement arrived at before a Local Board would be regarded as final, and could not be reviewed. I know of no reason why an agreement between the parties should not be reviewed by a Local Board under abnormal circumstances. There must be finality somewhere, and if the parties agree, the arrangement should stand. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will negative this clause. Regulations of which the House knows nothing may be prescribed by the Governor-General in Council, and for any violation of them this penalty would apply. I object altogether to the provision of penalties in connexion with this Bill. This is really a conciliation measure, and it should not provide, therefore, for the imposition of penalties. It would be far better to depend upon the honour and good sense of the parties to whom the Bill will relate. Throughout the arbitration legislation of both the Commonwealth and the States various penalties have been provided. If my recollection serves me rightly, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> was Premier of New South Wales, penalties amounting to no less than £5,000 were imposed under the State Act on various organizations and individuals, but not one penny was collected-. That being so, these penalties go for nought. It would be more acceptable to the people if we relied upon them to honour any compact entered into by virtue of this measure. Let us take care that the Bill is in every respect conciliatory. We have provided at the end of the Bill that whatever penalties are necessary may be prescribed. </para>

                        <para>- Then we should introduce a further clause to overcome that difficulty. In justification of my attitude I point out that when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> during the war, appointed a Special Tribunal to deal with industrial troubles in relation to the coal mining industry they came to a certain agreement under the operation of the War Precautions Act. There were no penalties attached to a breach of that agreement, but they loyally abided by it, and it expires in October, about two months hence. The men gave their word of honour, and if that is regarded as sufficient in connexion with proceedings under this Bill, the measure will be made more acceptable to the people generally. </para>

We have to get evidence, and if people will not come to the Court how can we get it? It may be necessary to put certain questions. We may wish to examine a man as to his selling price. We may desire to say. " You state that the fair price is 17s. 9d. ; but now, as a matter of fact, how much is it?" He may know what we desire to ask, and may refuse to appear. I suppose that, if he were at liberty to do so without consequences, he would not appear in the circumstances, if he had any sense. </para>

                        <para>-  May I make a suggestion to meet the point the right honorable member is arguing? I am quite prepared to prescribe a penalty for any person who refuses to obey a summons. For instance, in sub-clause 3 of clause 19 provision is made that any person summoned shall attend a conference and continue his attendance as directed by the person or tribunal summoning the conference. I should be satisfied to add to that a provision for a penalty upon any one disobeying the summons. But clause  28  is a drag-net provision, covering penalties in all sorts of cases, and for breaches of regulations of which we have no knowledge. </para>

                        <para>-I am afraid that we cannot overcome the difficulty in that way. I shall refer, not to a strike, but to a lock-out. We know that a lock-out is a monstrous and abominable crime, whilst a strike is that resolute indication of the onward march of the people towards the goal of eternal liberty. What the honorable member proposes is that for the crime of a lock-out there should be no penalty. Shame! Shame! Where are the banner-bearers of Bolshevism when such things are said? They are tied to the chariot-wheels of Capital. They are proposing to allow Capital to do with impunity just what it pleases. No, we must have penalties. How do Lenin and Trotsky deal with these matters? They say, " Work. If you won't work,-- ." </para>

I quite understand what the honorable member for Hunter has in view, and I am prepared to meet him this far: He says that we do not know what the regulations under this Bill will provide for. I admit that, and I am, therefore, prepared, in regard to the imposition of penalties, to adopt the regulations of the Arbitration Court. They have been in force for years, and honorable members know what they are. They would not hurt anybody. The honorable member has himself said that under them fines to the extent of £5,000 were imposed, and that npt a penny of that money was collected. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> knows very  well  that, under the two final clauses of this Bill, penalties might be imposed for many offences. If each clause were completed by a penal provision attaching to a breach of it, we could understand it. The Prime Minister knows that these penal provisions might 'be used against  the  officials of unions, not because they would not give evidence, but because they would not appear when their unions instructed them not to do so. He knows, also, that whilst the employer can pay a fine, the labour official cannot do so. If the intention were to treat both alike, there would ,be provision, not for a fine, but for imprisonment only. Again, it is not fair to imprison the individual employer or labour official in these cases. The employer, in the case of a business corporation, will represent the shareholders, and the labour official the members of his organization. In those circumstances, to he just, if punishment is inflicted it should be imposed upon every shareholder of a business corporation or every member of a union, and we should gaol the whole lot. </para>

These penal provisions must be deleted from the Bill if it is to be acceptable to the workers of the community. </para>

These -are the anthems of Bolshevism, and, modified and watered down, they are the foundation of the pillars of the temple of civilization.  We  say, "Keep the law; love God; honour the King; be faithful to your wife - because if you don't something may happen." Now the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> says that unless this law is left without penalties it is going to be useless. I ask honorable members to look at the Ten Commandments, and to look at the Crimes Act. The Crimes Act is a living, breathing, testimony to the fact that mankind is not always amenable tq reason, and to the still small voice of right crying in the wilderness. Justice comes to us and says, " My friend, let us reason together," and, keeping one hand behind the back, continues, " and if you won't reason together" - and then the hand with the weapon is produced - " we must see what can be done." The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to the workers in such a way that any one would think they would be in certain danger under this Bill.  We  have been discussing the measure for some time, and I think I have made almost every amendment that I have been asked to make. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose it does, but that was not for the honorable member to say, but for us. If I have erred, I have done so because I have endeavoured to treat this as a non-party measure, and have listened to the counsel of both sides of the House. Counsel from the opposite side has been more vociferous, or, shall I say, more articulate, than counsel on this side. Without penalties the measure is absolutely worthless. There is the League of Nations. What value has the League of Nations unless there is behind it some force? Do honorable members realize that the greatest war in history took place under the shadow of The Hague Tribunal? In The Hague Tribunal, compassed about by 10,000 bayonets, the Angel of Peace was securely guarded. - so securely guarded, in fact, that she never got out for five years. I am prepared to strike out the words "or of the regulations," and leave the clause to provide that, if there is any contravention of the Bill for which no penalty is provided, it will be punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding £100, or both. I move - That the words " or of the regulations " be left out. </para>

                    <para>.- Personally I am rather inclined to share the view that Acts of Parliament must be backed up by, or based on, penalties as the last resort; but I suggest to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that it cannot be sufficient to adopt the penalties provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. For instance, there is nothing in that Act or rules relating to the Commonwealth Council, District Councils, or the non-appearance of witnesses. I suggest that, before the Bill comes back to us, he should intimate the penalties he proposes in respect of every offence or potential offence under the Bill not provided for in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? Then, I ask him also to remember that to myself, and, I think, to every honorable member on this side, it is repugnant that severe penalties should be provided for, and the imposition of them left to regulations which we do not see. </para>

                        <para>.- I think it will be admitted that the members on this side of the House have kept their promise respecting the measure. We said at the outset that we had no intention of obstructing it, but that we objected to the application of the guillotine to its discussion, because that might shut out the consideration of important amendments. I am pleased that we have been able practically to get through the Bill before the guillotine was applied. The Bill has emerged from Committee a much better measure than it was. Many improvements have been made in it. As I said on the second reading, the establishment of Local Boards capable of dealing promptly with disputes as they occur, is a step in advance in our industrial legislation, and I think something that the community is looking for. My regret is that the Government did not comply more fully with the wishes of the Opposition for the amendment of the Bill. Had it accepted the amendment of which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> gave notice, recognising the trade unions and industrial organizations of the country as those which should be represented on the Tribunals appointed, and had the penalty clauses been omitted, the Opposition could have accepted the measure, and recommended it to the workers outside. We showed that the amendment was vital to the success of the Bill, and did our best to impress the Government with the need for it. I repeat what I have said in this connexion. In passing industrial legislation, we are dealing with the existing organizations, not with organizations that may spring into existence at a time of industrial trouble. From the beginning, it is the industrial unions that have been recognised in connexion with the settlement of disputes. That being so, I do not know why objection was taken to their recognition under the Bill. The industrial organizations are the parliaments of the workers. The members of the Trades and Labour Councils, and the officials of the unions, are the representatives of Labour, just as we here are the representatives of our constituents. They have won their position by their abilities, and it is their duty to look after the industrial interests of their fellow men. Why then should we refuse to recognise them when we are trying to secure industrial peace? It is for the organized workers that we are passing this measure. The Committee made a fatal mistake in negativing the amendment, and I must vote against the third reading of the Bill because of that action, and because of the penalty clauses. Nevertheless, I believe that this measure, when passed, will provide machinery which should be used to prevent the industrial crisis that appears to be brewing. The men who desire a Special Tribunal to settle their troubles quickly now have an opportunity to get such a Tribunal. The leaders of the men are often maligned, it being made to appear that they provoke strikes; but we have now provided a Tribunal for the settlement of disputes which will be constituted of representatives of the workers, representatives of the employers, and an independent  chairman,  and it can deal with the trouble promptly. I hope and believe that this machinery will be availed of by the miners. The big, strong, militant organizations, such as that of the miners, are not injured by the refusal to give them the recognition in the Bill which we have contended they should have, but the smaller organizations are injured; and the Prime Minister will do well to have inserted in the Senate a provision recognising the Trades Han Councils and the industrial unions in making appointments to the Tribunals provided for by the Bill. If he does that, and eliminates the penalty clauses, the measure will be, in my opinion, the best that has yet been passed by an,y Australian Parliament, Commonwealth or State. The concession for which we asked was a small one, and it has been demanded by trade organizations in all parts of Australia. It is only such organizations that will come under the Bill. Why, then, should we create the suspicion that the measure is providing for unknown circumstances, and the representation of non-unionists, men who in times of peace do nothing to help their fellows, but when industrial trouble arises, do their best to injure them. </para>

                        <para>. - I have supported this measure because it encourages the idea of conciliation and the round-table conference which is very essential at the present time. That is a valuable feature of the Bill which I hope will be exercised. I have also been influenced to do so by the  urgent assurances of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that some of the provisions were essential to deal with the present grave coal crisis. I, however, express my great disappointment that Part IV. has not been made an adjunct of the Arbitration Court. The Bill seems to set up competing authorities, and I fear that the result will he endless confusion and chaos. If it could have been arranged, as it easily could, that Part IV. should be worked under the regis of the Arbitration Court, some very valuable results might have followed, and there would be no risk of the tribunals running counter to the Arbitration Act. I am relieved to some extent, however, to learn that the Government idea is that this should be only a temporary measure, and that they propose to later introduce a comprehensive measure which will coordinate all the leading features of the present arbitration law, and the principles embodied in the Bill. If that is done, and the measure is an outcome of co-operation on the part of employers and employees, we may look for some real benefits. I hope that a big effort will be made to that end. We have also the assurance of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that this Bill will be exercised only as an emergency measure. If that policy is followed, some of the disadvantages I fear may be minimized. </para>

                        <para>.- The many amendments made in Committee are in themselves evidence that the measure was ill-digested and ill-considered before its introduction. Those amendments have improved the measure to some extent. I regret that I was detained in Sydney by causes beyond my control, and was thus prevented from being in the House during the earlier stages of the measure. The Bill will duplicate the authorities set up to deal with the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and will thus probably lead to great confusion. I regret that during the second-reading debate the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> saw fit to make an attack upon the  President  of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. He made misstatements of facts, and I think it is our duty to say that we dissent from them. It is somewhat remarkable that in a measure providing for the creation of four different tribunals, we should provide that the principal tribunal shall inquire into matters that are well within our knowledge. We all know the main cause of industrial unrest. The present Government was largely responsible for it, owing to their failure to deal with profiteering and their arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act. If the Government would exercise their powers under the Constitution with regard to profiteering, and would also cease to operate the War Precautions Act, they would do much to remove the causes of industrial unrest. I cannot view with equanimity, or as sincere and <inline font-style="italic">bonafide,</inline> any measure which emanates from a Government who refused to take those steps to remove the main causes of industrial unrest. We are told that they seek to do that by means of this Bill. When the Commonwealth Parliament proposes to legislate, we must have close regard to the powers contained in section  51  of the Constitution. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> with regard to what he considers the two blemishes in this Bill, I say that this measure is at fault, inasmuch as it is not based upon all the powers that the Commonwealth Parliament possesses. On the contrary, clause  2  sets out that the measure shall apply " to industrial matters in relation to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and. settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any' one State." Why do the Government confine the basis of the Bill to such an extent? Why is not the Bill based on all the powers that this Parliament possesses. They have based it upon one power only, and when it is interpreted, the Courts will . hold that Parliament itself has expressed its intention to exercise only one power, and that it was not its intention that the provisions of the Bill should be supported by any of the other powers conferred by the Constitution. This limitation satisfies me that the Government intend that the measure shall, from a constitutional standpoint prove futile. Almost any award that  may be made by a tribunal under the Bill may be attacked as being unconstitutional, because it may be shown that the dispute did not extend beyond the limits of any one State; whereas, if the Bill were an exercise of all the Commonwealth powers in regard to taxation and other things, many of its provisions could be supported that cannot be upheld on the limited ground upon which it is based. Cases will be taken to the Courts of Appeal, which will say that the provisions of the Bill are unconstitutional; and then the Prime Minister will go to the people and say, " I told you so." We know, however, that the foundation has not been laid as widely as it should have been. Take, for example, the amendment moved by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in regard to the coal-mining industry. He desired that power should be given to investigate that industry from the point of production to the point of consumption, whether in Australia or overseas. To that, the Prime Minister threw out a suggestion that such an investigation would be held to be unconstitutional. If the inquiry were made in exercise of the taxation power, and no one can deny that the ascertaining of the profits of a company would be an exercise of the taxation power, the investigation would be held to be absolutely valid. Is there any inquiry from the point of production to the point of consumption that would not be an exercise of the taxation power? But the Bill itself declares that it is intended to be only an exercise of the Commonwealth power in regard to conciliation and arbitration. I ask the Prime Minister, as a proof of the <inline font-style="italic">iona fides</inline> of the Government, to see that amendments ar&lt;&gt; made in another place to set out that the measure is intended as an exercise of all our powers under the Constitution. If he does that and removes from the first part of the Bill the limitation of its scope to only one power he will be going far towards making this a constitutional 'measure, but if he leaves the measure in its present form I am satisfied that clause 2 will be regarded as an invitation to the Court to find that its provisions are invalid. </para>

                    <para class="block">Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> I should like to quote a passage from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> Ord, Chief  Inspector of Factories in Victoria. It is as follows - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">Minimum Wage in all Factories. </para>
                        <para>This modest provision simply requires that* every employee in a " factory or workroom " should receive not less than 2s. (id. per week or 2.5 farthings an hour. It will hardly be credited that some of the largest dressmaking and millinery firms in the colonies will resort to all kinds of subterfuges to avoid this payment. A girl is taken on as an " apprentice," so it is said. She is not an apprentice in the remotest sense of the word, except that she is required to pay a premium. She can be sent away or can leave at a moment's notice. But, as she is " apprentice," the officers are calmly informed she is charged a premium of exactly 2s. Gd. a week. The kind employer will then say that, instead of insisting on the money down, he allows her to return to him on Monday the 2s. 6d. he pays her on Saturday. He explains it is out of consideration for the poverty of the poor girl's parents. He allows her to pay his premium in this way. It is doubted if the above statement would be credited but for the fact that the system has become public through prosecution for the very offence described above. If one thing is more offensive than another, it seems to be the practice of such deeds as the above under cover of " kindness " to the poverty of a poor girl's parents or the poor girl herself. Others charge a premium monthly. That is, the girl " hoards up," as a magistrate once described her action, her 2s. 6d. per week, and returns it at the end of a month. Others insist, " it looks a little better," on getting 10s. in advance, which is returned to the girl at the rate of 2s. Gd. a week. .Another plan is to really obtain a premium from the girl's parents, and pay it back at the rate of 2s. 6d. per week. In the latter case there is really the appearance of apprenticeship, and it. is possible that the girl will have a chance of learning her trade. I know of cases in which it is the practice to keep the girl till she wants something more than 2s. 6d. a week, when she is promptly dismissed, and another " apprentice " taken on. The whole practice seems to me contemptible in the highest degree. </para>
                        <para>The average wage in the dressmaking and millinery trade is about 10s. lod. per week, and that includes the pay of highly-paid forewomen. In 1897 the average wage for 4,164 workers was 8s. 8d. Imagine making a girl serve at her trade for a year for nothing, when the average wage for over <inline font-style="italic">4,000</inline> persons is 8s. 8d. I would strongly urge that the law should be amended so that premiums under any circumstances for females should be made illegal, or if premiums are allowed, it should only be on condition that the girls are legally bound, and are really taught their trade. Premiums are not exacted in any other trade to any extent, and it is hard to understand why it should obtain in the worst-paid trade of any size in the colony. In 1896 it was absolutely the lowest, in 1897 it was the lowest but one, namely, corset manufacture, and in that trade only thirty persons were returned for the wages- statistics. At the close of 1898 there were 4,554 females working in dressmaking, millinery, &amp;c., at an average cost of 10s.9d. per week, and 3,813 of these at an average wage of 8s. 7d. </para>

                        <para class="block">In some cases I have found that the 2s.6d. per week is not paid at all, but is kept back for value received; in others the girls receive the 2s.6d. and hand it back at once. Again, others are allowed to consider it their own from Saturday to Monday. Some employers take it on the time-payment system of 10s. per month, while the luminaries of the dressmaking profession demand that it be paid down in a lump sum varying from £6 10s. to. £10. If these girls employed in the trade were able, when they had completed a period of some years to earn anything like a living wage, it would not be so bad, but the dressmaking statistics for the year 1807 show that the average wage paid in the trade for that year was 10s.10d, and as the large salaries paid to the heads of departments were included in these returns, it will be seen that the wages of the " rank and file " of dressmakers must be very low indeed. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister may give us an exhibition of temper if he chooses, but I am here as a member of this House, representing a constituency in Australia, and before I agree to any motion I want to know exactly what it is. It is not the first time I have said this and I hope it will be the last occasion on which I may have to refer to it, , and that the practice which the right honorable gentleman . is now pursuing will be discontinued. Notice of such a motion should be given, and, when it is submitted to the House, the mover should advance reasons why it should be agreed to. The House is entitled to disagree to any motion submitted, and unless a motion' shows on the face of it that it should be accepted, I shall not be prepared to agree to it until I am given sufficient reasons for so doing. Any motion may be amended. I may desire to move an amendment to this motion, in order to broaden the purpose of the Bill to be introduced and this is the stage at which it should be done. The Prime Minister may chatter away to himself, and become as annoyed as much as he chooses, but his doing so will not deflect me from my intention to take steps to get away from the practice of rising at the last minute and submitting motions without any explanation whatever. I insist brr my' rights as an individual member of this House. </para>

                        <para>- That is very cheap. The attitude which I am now adopting is one which I took up from the moment when I first came into this Cnamber, because I noted a certain procedure calculated to render it impossible, at a specific stage to broaden an order of leave. We are now at a point where honorable members can broaden the order of leave in order to move amendments subsequently. I understand that this Bill has to do with mandates. That is a very important subject which honorable members should be able to discuss at every stage, and they should be informed of what the Government proposes to do at every step. Some time ago a Bill was passed having to do with an agreement in respect of Nauru Island. In the course of his remarks at the second reading stage the Prime Minister stated that the House would be given an opportunity of judeing whether or not the amount to be paid in connexion with the whole matter was sufficient. The House was never given that opportunity and, as a matter of fact, the money was paid over, I believe, without the authority of Parliament, either upon the Estimates or in the Act itself. It was actually paid over before the British Bill was ratified by the House of Commons and. the House of Lords. I do not wish to be found in the ridiculous position of having the public say to me, as a member of this Parliament, that the Commonwealth Government are paying money over without authority and without honorable members knowing anything about it. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but the Governments which paid first secured the authority of their Parliaments. The New Zealand Government received the authorization of the Dominion Parliament before making payment. This Government, however, can apparently pay over without reference to the Legislature, and, because I rise to object to that procedure, I am insulted by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- It has often occurred. In 1913, I recall that advantage was taken, when leave was sought to introduce a Bill, to ask for certain particulars from the Minister concerned. This same point  vij  ago by the honorable member for West Sydney, who then remarked that in future he would insist upon the "reservation of his rights. This is not a question for the attention of the  Opposition  solely. Honorable members supporting the Government may some day find themselves in Opposition, and  they  will then require information upon various matters introduced by a Labour Minister. What will be their attitude <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I want to know what form these mandates are to take. There will be a lot of money expended. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister spoke in that strain, and if he had treated the House in a less cavalier manner he might have been able to have had his way. Honorable members of this Chamber are npt prepared to allow the Prime Minister to treat them in such a manner. It is easy for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to say that, if we had waited until the Bill was introduced, we would have known all about it. That does not meet the position at all. The Prime Minister could easily allow this motion to stand over until next week, but if there is any necessity for extreme haste the reasons should be given. The Government are seeking leave to bring in a Bill for certain purposes, and as the honorable member for West Sydney has stated, we may desire to widen the order of leave. It is quite competent for an honorable member to extend the order of leave to enable certain amendments to be moved at a later stage. </para>

                <para>Mp. PARKER MOLONEY.- Our constituents naturally expect us to exercise our rights. If the Treasurer had been in the Prime Minister's place we might have allowed the motion to pass. The Treasurer now says that he admits we have rights, but he does not want us to exercise them ; but the Prime Minister made a cheap kind of imputation against other honorable members, and gave the impression that we did not possess rights. The Prime Minister referred in a sneering manner to the absence of the honorable member for West Sydney, who has been indisposed, but the Prime Minister should remember that he has absented, himself on various occasions. Quite recently he visited Bendigo, and later Ballarat before the recent <inline font-style="italic">debacle,</inline> from his party's point of view, in that electorate. </para>

                <para class="block">As a new member of this House, I have been surprised to observe the way in which the right of honorable members to discuss measures at their various stages has been abrogated as the result of the slipshod methods adopted by the Government. I can well understand the attempt of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to " shanghai " motions through the House in this way in view of his reputation for un business-like methods. Our experience of the way in which he dealt with the sale of Australian produce overseas has taught us that he delays matters until the last moment, and then expects Parliament to accept his assurance that " everything r\ all right." He has had no business training, and therefore does not take ordinary business precautions. I support the stand taken by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> in regard to Nauru. Although the Government have paid over £1,500,000, we are in much the same position as a man who buys a block of ground without ascertaining whether the vendor has a good title to it. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Government will not again attempt to spring new business on the House in this way. Had they given us reasonable notice of their intention to submit this motion, we should have avoided the unedifying scene to which the Prime Minister has treated us this afternoon. No one- can complain of the treatment that the Opposition extend to the Government when we receive at their hands the ordinary courtesies to which we are entitled. Our constituents  look to us to preserve their rights, and I submit my amendment because of the tendency, during recent years, to introduce into the islands surrounding Australia large numbers of Japanese, Hindoos, Malays, and crossbreds of every description. We -want to avoid what has occurred in New Zealand, where there have been what are known in the United States of America as race riots, because of the introduction of coloured aliens into the Dominion. A few years ago, no one would have dreamt that New Zealand would occupy the position she does today, which has been brought about by a Government of which we have had for the last few years a replica in Australia. During the last five years, the Government have exercised under the War Precautions Act autocratic powers such as were enjoyed only by Governments in the Dark Ages, and these they seek to continue, although the war is over. Just as a tiger, having tasted blood, desires more, so the Government, having exercised these autocratic powers, are loth to part with them. Now that we desire to get back to pre-war methods of government, we find that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is not disposed to be amenable to reason. In accordance with his usual unmannerly style, he has levelled all sorts of charges at those who seek to safeguard the rights of the Parliament. </para>

                <para>We need to provide that the civil government of these territories shall be in accordance with the White Australia policy, because it is impossible to trust the Prime Minister to administer the mandate intrusted to us in accordance with the desires of the Australian people. The history of the administration of the occupied territories during the war is in some respects not to the credit of the Government, and we have no desire that the same sort of thing shall happen in the administration of the territories now coming under our control, and for which we shall be directly responsible to not only the people of Australia, but the League of Nations. I am reminded by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> that during the last few days the newspapers have been full of statements showing that our White Australia policy is likely to be challenged within the next twelve months. It is quite possible that our neighbours, the Japanese, may endeavour to make their presence felt in these territories if any loophole is left for their introduction into these islands, as freely as they have entered New Caledonia. We do not desire that Australian money shall be expended in these territories merely to bolster up and support a large body of coloured aliens whose operations may at any time seriously  menace the welfare of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>I trust that in future the Government will give adequate notice of their intention to introduce new business, and that we shall have fewer exhibitions of " bluff " on the part of the Prime Minister than has recently been our experience. The failure of his "bluff" this afternoon will, I hope, lead to his taking up a different attitude. </para>

                        <para>-  The Minister has not apologized for his latest offence. I rise to point out that what I now take exception to is his grossly offensive remark that I have been influenced, and improperly influenced, by the honorable member for West Sydney or any one else in regard to the course of action I am taking. I ask that that gross reflection be withdrawn. </para>

                    <para>- I regret very much that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> should have moved the closure in my case. If there is any honorable member who has endeavoured to conduct himself as he should, without trespassing on the time of the House, it is myself. I resent the fact that the honorable gentleman should have submitted the motion he did. </para>
