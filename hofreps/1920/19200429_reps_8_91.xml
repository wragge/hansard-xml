            <para>- The Government is calling for applications from persons willing to fill positions in the South Australian branch of the War Service Homes Department, and an expenditure of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;6,000 is contemplated. As in that State there is already efficient and cheap provision for the- build-&#39; ing of soldiers&#39; homes, I ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter with a view of preventing the waste of public money by the creation of a new and unnecessary Department. </para>

            <para>- I do not know of any action that is within the ambit of the Commonwealth authority. Increases of rent <inline font-style="italic">per se</inline> are beyond the power of any Legislature to prevent, they being due to the depreciation of money, the appreciation of goods, the increase of costs  of  production, and other economic causes with which the honorable gentleman, in common with every other citizen, must be familiar. The increasing of rents is a phase of the phenomenon of high prices which confronts the whole world. There are, however, increases which do not come within that category, and are unjust; and I regret that I know of nothing that the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> Commonwealth can do to prevent them. </para>

            <para>- I assume that the honorable member&#39;s question arises out of the remarks made by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page),</inline> when I moved last week for the appointment of certain members to the Committee. The matter is a difficult one to deal with, because regard must be had to the representation from the Senate. 1 understand that in previous Parliaments the Ministerial and the Labour party have each had three representatives from this House, and that the Ministerial party has had two representatives from the Senate, while the Labour party has been represented by one senator. Last week, it was stated on behalf of the Labour party that, as its strength in this House was increased at the elections by two, its representation on the Accounts Committee should not be decreased, a contention that I quite appreciate. I would remind the honorable member, however, that if the parties in Parliament are to be represented on the Committee in proportion to their numerical strength, there must be a representative to every eleven or twelve members. The Country party would thus be entitled to one representative on the Committee, the Ministerial party to three representatives, because its membership numbers thirty-eight, and the Labour party , to two representatives. If the membership of the Committee were increased to ten, seven members being drawn from this House and three from the Senate, there would be the possibility of a deadlock. </para>

            <para>.- Honor* able members will agree that the retention of returned soldiers&#39; in employment, particularly in Government institutions, is preferable to the retention of civilians who were only temporarily employed during the war, and some of whose appointments are of quite recent date. A number of returned soldiers at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, have been dismissed, but within, the last couple of weeks at least fifty others have been notified that their services will be dispensed with from the end of the present month. The permanent area sergeant-majors have been brought in to take the places of the dismissed men. That is quite in accordance with the instructions issued by the Min_ister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator Pearce)</inline> ; but&#39; girls are still employed to keep the ledgers up to date; and, if it is the desire of the Department to close up the branch in which these men have been engaged, their services could be transferred to the Pay Branch, which is an outstanding instance of the injustice being done to the returned soldiers. The officer in charge has not seen active service, and of all the officers employed only one has been to the Front. These officers have endeavoured to weed out returned soldiers from time to time, until to-day very few are employed in the Pay Branch, which is staffed by civilians and girls. I think about 400 persons are employed, of whom very few are returned soldiers. Recently the case of a man named Woodrow was brought under my notice. He is :a married man with three children, and was employed as a clerk at &#163;3 4s. per week. When he asked to be paid a living wage, the officer in charge insulted him by saying that he was better dressed than was the officer controlling his section. No officer has &#62;a right to speak to any man in that way. Woodrow&#39;s life was made unbearable in that section, and he was transferred to another branch, but there the persecution continued, until he was compelled to sever his connexion with the Department. Returned soldiers have been dealt with in a most unjust manner, and it is time that effect was given to the instructions issued by the Minister for Defence. Only last Friday the Minister repeated the instruction, over his own signature, that, all other things being equal, returned soldiers should receive preference in employment. The Department is flouting that instruction. </para>

The honorable member admits that the instructions given by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> are in keeping with the accepted policy in regard to returned soldiers, . namely, that where there is temporary employment which they can satisfactorily carry out, they shall be employed in preference to temporary employees who have not been soldiers.

              <para>- In my opinion, the work of the staff in the pay office in Sydney will compare favorably with the work of any pay staff in the Commonwealth Service. However, I shall make it my business to see that inquiry  i3  made as to why the instructions of the Minister have not been carried out, if it is fact that they have been ignored. It must be understood that all returned soldiers are not fit to go into a pay office and take up the duties of temporary clerks who have been years at the work. The pay office is a very important branch of the Service, and experts are necessary in dealing with the pay-sheets and so forth. It would be ridiculous to employ men in such positions simply because they are returned soldiers. </para>

            <para>.- I  hope that returned soldiers will not continue to be employed whether there is work for them to do or not. In my opinion, it is time the staff at the Victoria Barracks was greatly reduced. No doubt, it is a hardship to men to he discharged, but this class of work must gradually diminish as time goes on. I quite agree that where there is work to be done returned men should have preference, but it would be going too far to take away employment from widows and other dependants of soldiers. </para>

            <para>..- It has never been claimed by the returned men that they should he retained in employment when there is not plenty of work for them to do. They desire positions in which they can do useful work for the public and make a living for themselves. I must say, however, that some of the returned soldiers are finding positions, which they are quite capable of filling, occupied&#39; by men who did not go to the Front; this applies, not only to the Pay Office in Sydney, but very widely throughout the Department. Good men have been pushed out into inferior outlying billets that they do not desire, while other men, who returned early or stayed at home altogether, enjoy the plums of the Service. This is what is hurting the feelings of  the soldiers. I do not say that all men. in the best military positions, or all the men who stayed at home, are not worthy to fill them; but we do know of good men being pushed out to make room for others with less forcible claims. No doubt, much the same thing is occurring in other Departments in New South Wales. No one doubts the good intentions of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> but we know that the administration of the Department is not so thorough as we would like it. I am glad to hear from the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> that inquiry will be made. As a  returned man himself, he knows what the soldiers are, and he will not see them injured in favour of other&#39;s who stayed at home, in some cases, simply to obtain the billets left open. There is no desire that good men who stayed at home for special reasons should be turned out of their places, but returned men who are thoroughly qualified should not be made ito stand down for others who did not &#34; take the job on &#34; at the Front. </para>

            <para>.- I am glad that this question has been raised, because it is time the public knew how our returned soldiers are being treated. My experience in Melbourne is that, not only returned soldiers, but their dependants, and the dependants of fallen men, are not getting a square deal. I do not say that this treatment is wilful, but it must have come under the notice of other honorable members that, for example, pensions are snipped down and living allowances taken away. I am confident that this is not what the public desire, nor that women who lost their breadwinners at the Front should be deprived of their chances for work. The Government and the people &#39; of Australia are pledged to preference to returned soldiers, but no one can say that the higher-paid posts are offered to them. The arrangements for filling these posts are, most of them, &#34; cut and dried.&#34; Even in the profession which I have left for seven years some returned men are not given the fair show that they should have. Brief as have been the days in this Chamber of the Assistant Minister as such, he has already impressed honorable members as a man of honest convictions, who will give the soldier a square deal. I think the honorable member responsible for this motion may feel assured that his desires will be given effect to. </para>

I fear that the promises made to our men when they enlisted have not been fulfilled in many directions. Some of those who gave their word are faithfully abiding thereby, and that applies more generally to the commercial community, I think, than to the various Government Departments. I propose to read a letter, which describes a grievous injustice to a returned soldier who, before his enlistment, served in the Railway Department of Western Australia. He has written on several occasions to the authorities; and the letter before me is a copy of a. communication to the Prime Minister - </para>

            <para>I joined the staff of the Accounts Branch, Department of Home Affairs, Kalgoorlie, on the 7th April, 1915, as a temporary clerk at 14s. per day, which was subsequently increased* to &#163;270 per annum, under &#34;G3&#34; regulations of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway Act,  as  from 1st July, 1016. Having enlisted for service in the A.I.F.. I applied for, and  was  granted, leave of absence for this purpose as from 17th November, 1916. I returned to Australia in November, 1918, after having served in France with the ! 6th Battalion, and being twice wounded; and during April, 1919, I reported to the  Clerk  in Charge, Accounts Branch, Department of Works and Railways, Perth, submitting an application for reinstatement in the service. The intervening period between November, 191S, and April, 1919, was spent in No. S A.G-. Hospital, Fremantle. </para>
            <para>In June, 1919, I was asked if I were willing to accept the ruling rate for temporary clerks, viz., 12s. 6d. per day. This I agreed to accept, at the same time pointing out my position as compared with that of two other clerks who, with myself, were engaged with the Accounts Branch, Kalgoorlie, at similar rates of pay. These two officers (owing to some physical disability they were unable to enlist in the A.I.F.) were, on the completion of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway, taken over by the Commonwealth Railways at their existing rates of pay, and, to all intents and purposes, are now permanent officers of the Railway Department, whilst I, on return from active service, am engaged as a temporary clerk at 12s. 6d. per day, which was reduced to 12s. per day as from 1st January, 1920. </para>

            <para>.- I do not propose to give unqualified support to the object which the mover of this motion has in view. I support the general principle that full consideration should be given to the just claims of returned soldiers; but, from two points of view, this motion is open to criticism. In the first place, I sincerely hope there will be a gradual - and not too gradual - reduction in the staffs of the various barracks connected with our military services&#39;. I trust there will be .such substantial reductions in expenditure upon military affairs, and at a very early date, as will indicate a real intention on the part of the Government to give effect to the stated ideals of those distinguished gentlemen who sat around the table at the Peace Conference. But in any case there are some words employed in the motion which make me wonder, rather, whether the age of chivalry has not passed away. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> is complaining, apparently, that girls are occupying positions in Victoria Barracks which, in his view, should be held by returned soldiers. I cannot support a proposal to have young women turned out of employment for returned soldiers or any other persons. </para>

              <para>- No. Many of these women are themselves the dependants of returned soldiers. They were invited, and, indeed, in many cases pressed, to take on this work during the currency of the war, and they, no doubt, have their own serious responsibilities and duties to perform in regard to the maintenance of tha families of which they are units. Already there is a disposition to regard as intruders women who have qualified for positions and have been doing their work (well, when some mere man wants the position which they are filling. </para>

              <para>- So far as I understand it, I do not admit it, at all events. T. cannot join in any request for preference to returned soldiers, or to any one alse, as against women who are doing their work well. They should get, at least, equal consideration with any other section of the community. Short of that, of course, I would be very sorry to think that any person should be discharged from his or her position, and that any returned soldier, in particular, should be unjustly treated. I merely rise for the purpose of uttering a general protest against putting into practice the simple scheme which some people appear to have in their minds, namely, of repatriating returned men by thrusting somebody else out of a situation.&#39; Our responsibilities in regard to repatriation should be quite different. There are any number of avenues of employment. Some of our patriotic employers might very easily open up some of those avenues which they closed when their employees went to the war. There might be an examination of conscience as to whether they have kept faith with the promises they made with such unction and eloquence that their employees would find their positions open for them on their return ; and when we are busy holding public inquiries and commissions we might also institute an inquiry as to how many of these employers have and have not kept faith with the men who went away from their establishments. Many instances have come under my notice in which the promise has not been kept. Moreover, generally, on the declaration that we ought to dismiss girls in order to make room for returned soldiers, I do not think that the latter, as a rule, would welcome employment on such&#39; ignoble terms. </para>

            <para>. -  If this is the only way in which honorable members can discover a means of repatriating our soldiers, it shows that there is a great poverty of ideas among them. I have heard very little from honorable members opposite, especially the returned men among them, in the shape of an attack upon the Government for not proceeding with a proper scheme of repatriation. I am not permitted to discuss that phase ofthe question upon this motion, but there are avenues of employment which they should insist upon having opened up. </para>

          <para>In the earlier portion of the war applications were received from thirty or forty clerks in the Victoria Barracks, who were anxious to go to the Front, tout were not allowed to do so. One of those men worried me for two years and three months to get him permission to go. I appealed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when he was Assistant Minister for Defence, and when the facts were put beforehim, he said, &#34;I think we ought to let him go.&#34; However,the Department declared that they could not spare him. He was in some special line, although he told me that any clerk could do the work he was performing. Eventually he got away, and was unfortunate enough to be killed after having been in the trenches for eleven days. Dozens of the clerks left the Service and got away to the Front; others were not allowed to go because they were permanent men. Later on, in  1918,  when there was an outcry against men holding positions at the Victoria Barracks who were not returned soldiers, these men had to defend themselves by pointing out that they were notallowed to go when they wished to do so, and that if they had been allowed to go, they could have secured commissions, whereas at this time they would be required to enlist as privates. They said, &#34;We were kept back for our country&#39;s good, now we shall stay here for our country&#39;s good.&#34; These men were harassed. One man was so worried that he left the Barracks, and it was fortunate for him that he did, because he is now earning a salary of  &#163;500  a year. </para>
          <para>I deny the correctness of the statement made by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> that the returned soldier is more likely to understand the requirements and difficulties of his comrades and deal with them. As a matter of fact, the returned soldiers employed in the various Government Departments do not treat their comrades and the dependants of soldiers as well as do those who did not go to the Front. I have heard that complaint voiced by hundreds of returned soldiers. I have been at the Defence Department, and seen mothers and returned men waiting to be attended to, but the returned men behind the counters have not taken the slightest notice of them. On one occasionI had to wait for three-quarters of an hour until I secured the attention of the man who was behind the counter. When he asked me to tell him what my business was, I said, &#34; Will you please tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-So</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathews</inline> wishes to see him ? &#34; He said at once, &#34; I am sorry to have kept you waiting. I did not know it was you.&#34; The point is that this man had no right to keep any one waiting. But the men in these positions know that they cannot be removed from them, and they do not care how they treat their comrades or the dependants of their fellow soldiers. </para>

              <para>- I took the honorable member&#39;s remarks to mean that the returned soldier understood how to deal with his fellows better than others did, and if that is the case, judging by the way in which the average returned soldier in a Government Department treats his fellows, it is anything but fair treatment that he metes out to them. The men employed in the various barracks at the outbreak of war, especially those in Sydney, endeavoured to get away, and I will not be one to say now that they ought to be discharged to find places for returned soldiers. It is the duty of the Government to see that soldiers are placed in positions where they can earn a decent living, and instead of coming forward with a petty case, involving the dismissal of girls in order to provide such employment, honorable members opposite who are returned,  men should insist on the Government discharging their duty. </para>

            <para>.- There is considerable disorganization throughout the community in the matter of dealing with returned soldiers and unemployment generally, and unless the Federal and State Governments devise some scheme whereby unemployment will diminish, we shall always have trouble. On all sides there is the lack of organization, and grievances are multiplying without any redress. In spite of the very gallant utterances of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> I cannot agree with him. On one occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> O&#39;Shanassy,  an old Victorian politician, had made out a very good case of what he was going to do with the young men of the country, and some one had pertinently interjected, &#34;What about the young women ?&#34; he said, &#34; I would marry them to the young men.&#34; Upon the issue as to whether a man or a woman should get a position, I believe that the man who will be the bread-winner of some future family should be given the opportunity of securing it. The Federal Government, the State Governments, and private employers are employing women to-day because they are cheaper, and returned soldiers and others have to wait for positions. </para>

              <para>- The party on this side stands for equal pay for the sexes for equal work. If that rule were enforced in Government Departments and private employment, there would be more male employees than female. I do not wish to be regarded as ungallant, but I have very strong feelings upon this subject. Any morning one can see armies of young women coming into the streets of Melbourne, not only to work in factories, hut also to take their places in all the commercial nouses. I do not wish to deny them the opportunity of getting a living, but as long as women are employed to such an extent, there will always be a large number of men out of employment. </para>

              <para>- A lot of them find it too expensive to marry. However, I have no desire to enter into a domestic discus sion at this stage. I am not here to deprive womenfolk of employment, but if we expect our young men, including many of our returned soldiers, to take upon themselves the responsibility of the head of a home, we must find employment for them. That being so, although it may seem unchivalrous, I shall be prepared, in order to bring about that desirable state of affairs, to vote every time for the man when the question at issue is whether a returned soldier, instead of a young woman, shall be employed. </para>

I have in mind a case which occurred here, and which may be similar to cases that&#39; have arisen in Sydney. A man who was in business here during the early part of the war was asked by a Defence officer to give up his business in order to take charge of the inspection of coach work and of coaches and the waggons in the Department. He did so, but has been told that his services are to be dispensed with to-morrow. He is over fifty-nine years of age, and was for years in the engineers corps. He tried twice to enlist, but was rejected because of his age. Two of his sons went to the Front; one has returned crippled, and the other, after going right through the war, has also returned. This man has to stand down. </para>

Where the Department refused to permit an employee to enlist on the ground that his services here were* indispensable, the responsibility for his failure to enlist must rest upon the Department itself. I am glad that this question has been raised, so as to let it be known that the returned soldiers are out for a fair thing, and do not ask that employees of the Department who were not eligible because of their age shall be displaced by returned men. </para>

            <para>.- I am in hearty accord with the object which the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has in view in submitting this motion to the House. We cannot do too much for our returned boys. During the election campaign I promised, other things being equal - and I intend to uphold that promise if possible in this House - to support the dismissal of all temporary employees in Commonwealth Departments who were eligible, and did not enlist, where returned men are available to take their places. There are scores of eligibles occupying Government positions - &#34; cold footers,&#34; you may term them if you please - who should give way to men who fought and bled for the country. Our boys have done their share in defending the Empire, and it remains now for the Government of the Commonwealth, and also for the State Governments, to do their part. I feel convinced that a searching inquiry throughout the various Commonwealth Departments would lead to employment being found for quite a number of returned soldiers who are justifiably entitled to preference as against those who did not enlist. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the question of unemployment to which reference has been made by honorable members of the Labour party, I would point out that there is plenty of employment for the &#34; cold footers &#34; or eligibles if they are prepared to go into the rural districts. It is at present almost impossible to obtain a man to work on a farm. It is not the question of wages so much as the easier conditions, shorter hours, and lighter work of city billets that stands in theway. All things being equal, I hold that preference of employment should be given to the returned boys, and I shall at all times vote in that direction. I hope that the Government will be guided largely by the wisdom of the views that have been expressed during this debate. If they neglect the advice that has been so ably tendered to them, they must expect further trouble. If we see to it that, other things being equal, our returned boys are given preference of employment in all the Government Departments, we shall only be carrying out the promise that most of us made during the election campaign. </para>

            <para>.- There are only one or two points raised during the debate to which I desire to refer.I would not for one moment be in favour of clearing out of the Government Departments, irrespective of his qualifications, every man who had not been to the war, in order to find employment for returned soldiers. Every one knows that some of the women employed in Government Departments are largely dependent upon their income for the maintenance of their homes, and we do not want to sweep them out with a rough broom. We do not wish to turn them all out of the Service. Whilst it is admitted by honorable members that a reduction in the present staff of the Defence Department is absolutely necessary, I hold that those who have not been to the war should bethe first to be dismissed. In the Sydney office, almost without exception, however, it is the returned soldier who is put off, while men who did not volunteer, and girls, are retained. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> it would appear from his remarks, is more or less in favour of the employment of women. While I consider that every man and woman has the right to live, and should have an opportunity to earn a livelihood, I hold that a large Department like that of Defence, which has been built up by the war, should, other things being equal, employ soldiers instead of civilians to do its work. I shall not press the matter further, but, seeing these men have been advised that they are to cease duty to-morrow, I would ask the Minister to stay their dismissal pending an inquiry. </para>

            <para>Soldiers returned under sentences awarded before 18th July, 1919, for purely military offences, have the whole of the unexpired portion of their sentences remitted on disembarkation in their Military District in Australia. Cases of sentences awarded after that date are reviewed by a Sentences Revisory Committee, and many remissions have been granted, including a number of remissions of the whole of the unexpired portion. A very large number of sentences are remitted on embarkation in England. It is not proposed to grant further leniency. Every case where the sentence is not wholly remitted receives very careful individual consideration. </para>

            <para>It is not possible, at this stage, to estimate the sum which it will be necessary to appropriate. The officer appointed to organize the tour of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has been granted funds to meet initial requirements, and to cover the cost of those entertainments approved by the Government. The Government intend that all that is fitting will be done towards the reception and entertainment of His Royal Highness. It is not intended, however, to permit any extravagance. The Government are relying upon the loyalty and enthusiasm of the people to make the reception and welcome to His Royal Highness al&#93; that it should be. </para>

            <para>- On the l5th April, the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> asked me a question relating, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> to the treatment of officers of the Commonwealth Bank in the matter of payment of part salary in addition to military pay whilst on active service as compared with the treatment of Commonwealth public servants who enlisted for active service. I then promised to have inquiries made in the matter. I, have now ascertained that half bank salary, in addition to military pay, was granted to those officers who were in the service of the Commonwealth Bank at the outbreak of war, and who enlisted after August, 1914, and that part bank salary to a lesser degree was paid to those who joined the bank after the outbreak of war and proceeded on active service. At a Conference between the Commonwealth and State Governments in 1914, it was decided that officers of the Public Service who were members of the Australian Imperial Force should be granted military pay only. I would point out that officers of the Commonwealth Bank, not being members of the Public Service, were outside the scope of the decision arrived at by the Conference. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I wish to add a few words to my remarks upon the motion of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who asks that a Convention be appointed to consider the need for and the substance and the form of an  amendment of section 51 of the Constitu tion. I do not know what hope there is of getting that provision amended, but I am prepared to vote for the calling together of a Convention, because, undoubtedly, Australia is too large to remain divided into only six States. Its area is greater than that of England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal put together. If all those countries were superimposed upon this continent there would be a considerable area unoccupied. My feeling is that if the Convention would assist me, and those who, like me, favour the making of a new State in the middle of Queensland, we should be glad to have it, though I fear that at the present time our public is so much distracted by industrial troubles, the high price of goods, and the general disturbances consequent upon the war, that it is doubtful that there will be the interest taken in the proposed Convention that it should provoke, and it would be unfortunate if there should be a lack of interest in the work the Convention might do, and that must be done at some time, though it may be at a remote period. The honorable member asks for the amendment of section 51, which sets out the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. We have repeatedly appealed to &#39; the electors to agree to an amendment of that section so that this Parliament may have more power to deal with matters affecting trade and commerce. foreign combinations, and conciliation and arbitration. We proposed to increase the industrial power of the Commonwealth by giving it authority to deal with disputes on railways, and also to get power to legislate in regard to Trusts and Combines and the nationalization of monopolies.  We  appealed&#39; to the people in 1911 and in 1913, and the appeal that was to have been made in 1915 was postponed until 1919. On each occasion those proposals were rejected by the people, though in different States and in different numbers, and such is the peculiarity of public opinion that people who are prepared in one year to vote in favour of a certain alteration will in the following year vote against it. Therefore,  I  see very little hope of a majority of people in a majority of the States voting to give the Commonwealth the additional powers that are being sought. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I ask honorable members who ar&#169; proposing that a Convention shall invite lie people to give the Commonwealth Parliament plenary powers how they expect to get a majority of the people in the majority of the States to give their consent when the people have, on so many occasions, refused to give this Parliament only portion of the powers that are to be asked for.- </para>
          <para>I shall support the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> in his endeavour to have summoned a Convention composed of ten delegates from each State. I favour the proposal made by the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Earle Page)</inline> to secure representation on the basis of community of interest as far as possible. I am not in favour of the suggestion made by the Acting Premier of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fihelly)</inline> that the delegates to the Convention shall be elected on a population basis. If that were done, it would mean that the States of New South Wales and&#39; Victoria would have the overwhelming preponderance of power in the Convention, and the result of the deliberations of a body thus composed would almost certainly be rejected bv the people. On the other hand, if we can arrive at some method whereby the integrity of the States can be protected, giving ten representatives to each State, and so dividing the States as to insure that the people m the country will be given their due power and influence in the Convention, there will be more likelihood of the Bill evolved by the Convention being accepted by the people. But I do not propose to wait until the people have adopted such a Bill. I shall join with the &#39;honorable member for Cowper- in an endeavour to have a new State created in the northern part of New South Wales. This Parliament already has power to take such action with the consent of the State concerned. Chapter VI. of the Constitution deals with new States, and section 121 provides that this Parliament &#34; mav admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States.&#34; I assume the section&#39; to mean that if the residents of the Northern Rivers District of New South Wales, for instance, could induce the &#39; State Parliament to give them authority to create a new State, this Parliament could grant them representation. But section 124 says - </para>

          <para class="block">As has been said by the honorable member for &#39;Cowper, certain States still have non-elective Houses of Parliament. It is not certain how the Legislative Council in Queensland would vote on the  ques-tion  of the creation of new States in Queensland - one in the north, another in the centre, and the south to remain under the present Legislature. Although the Queensland Parliament has power to divide the State into new provinces, and although a number of men in that Parliament are pledged to the creation of new States, yet it is a singular fact that many of  them  when they get into power, became apathetic in regard to that matter.. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston</inline> was such a one. I have no wish to say anything derogatory to the deceased gentleman, because he was a splendid parliamentarian. Unhappily, we never say that a politician is a statesman until he is dead. But the deceased gentleman was a statesman, and much of the legislation he introduced into Queensland has proved very beneficial. He, when a private member, was in favour of the creation of a separate State in Central Queensland, but when he became Premier, he appeared not to like the prospect of being shorn of some of his importance by the division of the State, and during his term of office nothing was done to further the movement that was started for that purpose. .The movement was very active in Queensland in 1892; indeed, a Bill was actually introduced- into the Legislative Assembly by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir_ Samuel</inline> Griffith &#34;. to provide for the division of the Colony of Queensland into provinces, aud for the better government of the Colony, as so &#39;divided.&#34; The preamble read-&#39;   </para>
          <para>Whereas it would be &#39; for the general benefit of .&#39;the people of Queensland that the local affairs &#34;of the southern, .central, and northern divisions there.of should be .administered by the people.- of those, divisions respectively, that the &#39;general.- affairs of the . whole colony should continue to be governed and administered by a general Parliament and a general Government : And whereas for that purpose it is desirable that the colony should be divided into provinces, and that provision should be made for the future constitution of other provinces to form part of the said colony : Be it therefore enacted by the Queen&#39;s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Queeusland in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : - </para>
          <para>This Bill provided for the creation of a Senate by the cutting up of Queensland into three provinces. The measure was brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith on the 23rd June, 1892, and it is most interesting to note the striking resemblance between its clauses and the sections of the Federal Constitution. The powers of the proposed General Assembly of Queensland, as set forth in Part V. of the Bill, bear a remarkable resemblance to those contained in section 51 of our Constitution, providing evidence of the very important part played by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith as a member of the Federal Convention. Indeed, paragraphs were apparently taken from the Queensland Bill and embodied whole and without alteration in section 51 of the Constitution. For example, the Bill refers to the &#34; Regulation of Trade and Commerce with other countries, and among the several provinces.&#34; Practically the only  difference between it and the corresponding paragraph of section 51 is the substitution of &#34;States&#34; for &#34;Provinces.&#34; </para>
          <para> The paragraphs in section 51 relating to quarantine, sea fisheries, census and statistics, currency, coinage and legal  tender, banking and the issue of paper money, weights and measures, bills of exchange and promissory notes, insolvency, copyrights and patents of inventions, designs and trade marks, naturalization and aliens, following one another in that order, were apparently taken bodily from the Bill and placed in section 51 of the Constitution. </para>
          <para>Some honorable members are anxious to acquire for the Commonwealth the whole of the powers now possessed by the States, with a view to re-issuing some of them to provincial legislatures or councils. One honorable member has suggested, by interjection, that control of education ought to be taken from -the States. Honorable members may be interested to know that the powers which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith and his Government proposed in- 1892 should be retained by the provinces of Queens land included : &#39; &#39; The management and sale of the public lands within the province, and of all minerals therein; the registration of titles to lands; education ; the establishment, maintenance, and management of public and reformatory prisons; the establishment, maintenance, and management of hospitals, asylums, charities, and eleemosynary institutions; local works and undertakings, including the construction and management of railways; municipal institutions;  licences for trading and  other  purposes in order to raise revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes; the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance, and organization of provincial courts,, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure of civil matters in those courts; the imposition of punishment by fine, penalty, or imprisonment for enforcing any law of the province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes &#39;of subjects within the powers of the Legislature of the province ; and the appropriation of the provincial revenue to any purpose whatsoever.&#34; The provincial Legislatures were to be allowed to raise money &#34; by any mode or system of taxation except customs or excise.&#34; </para>
          <para>I shall help the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> and the Government to have a Convention appointed, believing that the discussion of matters which are to some extent influencing the public mind at the present time, and which will, no doubt, influence it -to a greater extent later on, when the troubles which have arisen in consequence of the war have been settled, will assist the honorable member for Cowper and myself in our endeavour to get new States created in Queensland, and at least one new State in New South Wales. </para>

It may take us fifty years to reach that stage of public opinion, at which some honorable members aim, when the States will consent&#39;, to the Federal Parliament taking the map and cutting the Commonwealth into thirty-one or more provinces, as suggested&#39; by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony).</inline> .; </para>

Britishers, and the descendants of Britishers, in trying to settle and develop that enormous area, have undertaken! a stupendous task. In Queensland is is amazing to see men going out into the northern parts, away from all the comforts of civilization that we enjoy in these southern cities. </para>

              <para>- That is so; and it is curious that men who were born in the tropical or sub-tropical parts of Australia have no desire to live in a place like Melbourne. In the northern parts some declare they enjoy better health and work better, and they even go so far as to say that they prefer the summer months there to those of the winter. It would, in my opinion, be a dangerous experiment to introduce coloured labour. It would be better for us to continue on our present lines, even If we have to leave the Northern Territory empty. </para>

              <para>- An alternative may be suggested by the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden).</inline> It might be shown what could be done by better housing in the northern parts, by a better knowledge of hygiene and of the proper foods for such a climate. Reforms in these directions would make a great difference to the health and comfort of the people there; but I do not see anything inviting in the idea of cutting Australia by a line from east to west, just below the hotter portions of the continent. I am, however, quite in favour of giving to those people in Australia who consider that they are in a position to govern themselves an opportunity of establishing new States, with their own Parliaments, and the powers that are now possessed under existing Constitutions. When some of my friends insist that the Commonwealth Parliament ought to have what we might term domestic powers, I point out that in Queensland at present there are large majorities in the Legislative Assembly, and also in the nominee Legislative Council, representing the Labour party. That Parliament is now endeavouring to cope with the problem which is causing people in the south so much trouble - the problem of profiteering. The Queensland Parliament has passed an AntiProfiteering Act, and, as it is now being administered, we shall soon know what success it may have. </para>

          <para>May I point out, in support of the contention of the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and myself in favour of new States, that there is now a continual process of centralization because of the presence of Parliaments in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. This may be seen from &#38; glance at the census figures. According to the census of 1901, there were 110,580 people in the northern division of Queensland, and, in 1911, these had increased to only 119,279. In Central Queensland, where I would like to see a new State, there were 64,192 people in 1901, and only 72,543 in 1911. In South Queensland, in 1901, there were 328,120 people, and, in 1911, 412,221. Out of a total increase of 100,000people in the ten years, no fewer than 85,000 are accounted for by Southern Queensland. </para>

              <para>- Tasmania, with an area of 26,215 square miles, has had a local Parliament for fifty -three years, at the beginning of which period the population was 75,000. Queensland received separation from New South Wales on the 10th December, 1859, when the population of the State was 28,000. These figures ought to weigh with honorable members, who may be afraid that the 72,000 people in Central Queensland may not have the intelligence or experience to govern themselves. The educational record of Central Queensland - the successes of the Queensland students at the Universities in Queensland, Victoria, and other States - show that mentally and physically- </para>

              <para>- It might not, for the reason that the programme outlined by the honorable member himself the other day is of such a far-reaching character, that the people of Australia may not be inclined to include it in any proposed alteration of the Constitution. It might be the means of wasting years of our labour, when we could be doing good work in the creation of new States with the powers we already possess. We are, as I say, occupied in the discussion of State domestic questions when we ought to be considering national questions arising out of the war. What is to be our position in the world? What opinions have we on foreign relations?, What is our position with regard to Treaties with other nations? Are we permitted to make our own Treaties? No; London has too much influence. However, I shall not go into these questions, but merely say that we ought not to be so keen about getting domestic powers for this Parliament as about availing ourselves of the power we have, under section 51 of the Constitution, to create new States. We should indicate by a resolution of both Houses of this Parliament that we are prepared, if the States are, to agree to the creation of new States within their territories in order that important areas concerned may be developed and the whole of Australia correspondingly benefited. </para>

              <para>- I have not suggested that a Convention should be elected. At present we have six States, all jealous of their own State rights; and they are exercising those rights to the detriment of Australia. The six State Governments are the members of the Federation which adopted the original Constitution. One of the sections of the Constitution sets  out, in effect, that all the States are to have equal rights. There were to be no hindrances in the matter of trade across the boundaries; there was to be free  trade between the States. We find that that section has been interpreted very much according to the desires of certain  States. Within three months of the out break of the war New South Wales, which had a surplus supply of wheat,  prohibited export to the neighbouring States which were urgently in need. When, about six months later,. Queensland was experiencing somewhat of a drought, and owners desired to send their stock into New South Wales for agist ment, the Queensland State authorities insisted upon the payment of a tax of 10s. per head, by way of guarantee that those cattle would be returned into Queensland. The inspection duties on fruit sent to Western Australia are equivalent to a very high import duty. Instances such as these show that we have not free trade across the boundaries; and such a state of affairs is not for the good of Australia. By altering the Constitution so as to givethe Commonwealth Government supreme power, State boundaries would be virtually done away with. The Australian Government then would speak with one voice, and would legislate on national affairs instead of having to participate, as at present, in domestic arrangements. </para>

          <para>I am very much in favour of the scheme suggested by the Australian Labour party. At present, we find in the six States that there is a great tendency to centralization, which is one of the severest curses afflicting this young country. It is only by cutting up the huge States into a number of smaller States, and by giving each section control of its own domestic arrangements, that we can hope to overcome the evils of the present process of centralization. The populations of all the capital cities are rapidly increasing, while rural populations are decreasing. This is simply due to the fact that a majority of the people have congregated in the cities, and have exercised the preponderance of power in the management of States, and, inso doing, have legislated for the benefit of the cities as against the country. The effect of splitting up the States, on the principle proposed by the Australian Labour party, would be to make each unit self-centred. We would then find - using the illustration of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> - that a port such as Portland would be put to the use for which nature intended it, and that the people of that neighbourhood would no longer be compelled to deal with Port Melbourne in the matter of the export of their produce. </para>
          <para>All honorable members must admit the urgent necessity for amending the Constitution, and it is undoubtedly better that that amendment should be made by evolution rather than by revolution. When the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> employed that phrase, in the course of debate upon this motion last week, the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> queried the soundness of the expression; and when reference was made to the condition of affairs in Northern Europe, the honorable member was inclined to scoff. If he had had a little recent personal experience such as must have been calculated to bring under his notice the horrors of the war - let alone those of civil warfare - the honorable member for Barrier would now be much more inclined to favour the alteration of our Constitution by evolution rather than by revolution. An honorable member stated last week that the Commonwealth Government should accept the responsibility of passing legislation to adopt various necessary amendments to the Constitution, but this point was evidently overlooked, namely, that, in the first place, the consent of the State Parliaments must be secured. Those Parliaments are already very jealous of their rights. </para>

          <para>My purpose is that the circumstances appertaining to the mining industry, as carried on at Broken Hill, may be thoroughly investigated, not only in the terms of the motion - that is, in respect to wagesand conditions of employment - but more particularly as regards the health of employees, and the causes which are undermining health. This latter factor is directly responsible for the great industrial upheaval which has established a record in the history of Australian industry, and which is now in its twelfth month. Broken Hill miners have been forced into their present position owing to the conditions under which they have had to work, owing to the poisoning of their systems by the lead which they are mining, to the phthisis from which their occupation makes them suffer, and to the terrible death-rate among the infant children of those who are engaged in the industry, as borne out by the statistics I brought under the notice of honorable members on the last occasion on which I referred . to this subject. The Commonwealth Statistician has shown that Broken Hill has the largest infantile death-rate in the Commonwealth, and his figures are only in harmony with the findings of such an eminent authority on industrial or  occupational diseases as is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Oliver. I have the evidence of at least eight medical gentlemen in Broken Hill, culled from the report of the proceedings of a Royal Commission held in 1914, and also opinions given by them at a later date, proving absolutely that they speak with no uncertain voice in favour of the contention of the men as to the effect of their occupation upon them. The strike is now in its twelfth month, and the men of Broken Hill and their wives and children have put up one of the hardest battles ever fought in industrial warfare in Australia, for the sole object of protecting their lives from the exactions of the mining companies, all of whose actions go to show that their only care is to pile up dividends without any thought of the effects of the industry upon the health of those employed by them-.

          <para class="block">These claims were placed before the mining companies, and after the strike had proceeded for a few months, the miners&#39; delegates met the representatives of the employers in conference in Melbourne from the 23rd September to the 26th September, 1919. The manifesto of the Coal and Shale Miners Federation shows that the result of the conference was as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Theminers&#39; representatives at the Melbourne Conference told the directors that they believed the industry could well afford to concede the conditions demanded and that they, the directors, had not given the matter of health honest consideration in accordance with their fabulous profits. Further, due to the complications of the industry, the Arbitration Court was not competent enough to deal with the matter; also that it was too limited in its scope to inquire into the profits, rebates, and sales, &#38;c, of the companies&#39; operations to see if their mines could financially stand the burden of the log requested by the miners, and if not the whole, log, how much of it, in accordance with their profits. </para>
            <para>The miners&#39; representatives then asked the mining directors to co-operate with them in approaching the Federal Government with a view of getting them to appoint aRoyal Commission of Inquiry into the Mining Industry at Broken Hill, such inquiry to be representative of the mining companies, Miners Union and the public, and to make a full and comprehensive inquiry into all aspects of the industry, such as the companies&#39; profits, rebates, sales, and allowances, &#38;c, also the health of the miners and the conditions of work in the mines, the inquiry, as a result of its investigation, to have power to fix wages, hours and conditions in accordance with its finding. The Commission to have all such powers as the Supreme Court of New South Wales for conducting the inquiry, and to be open to the general public and the press. </para>
            <para>The mining directors point-blank refused to co-operate as desired. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Courtney</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L. Baillieu admitted that the Federal Arbitration Court, due to the limitations of its powers and scope, could not inquire into the health of the miners, the conditions of work, or into the companies&#39; profits. </para>
            <para>When the conference was discussing the possibility of a tentative agreement, with a view of an immediate resumption of work at Broken Hill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis,</inline> general secretary, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> whether, in the event of the miners at Broken Hill resuming work under the existing conditions and agreeing to refer the matter of a tentative agreement to the Federal Arbitration Court,the mining companies would agree to co-operate with the miners&#39; representatives in approaching the Federal Government to appoint aRoyal Commission of Inquiry into the companies&#39; operations and profits as suggested, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> replied, &#34;No,&#34; and further said on no account would they agree to an investigation into their profits and affairs on the lines mentioned. </para>

          <para>I have put forward the claims submitted by the men to the companies, and shown the attitude of the companies towards the men&#39;s request. I shall now proceed to quote the testimony of medical men in Broken Hill with regard to the claims the men put forward. I quote first from the Barrier <inline font-style="italic">Daily Truth,</inline> which reports an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burnell,</inline> acting medical superintendent of the Broken Hill and District Hospital, as follows: - &#34; My mission, doctor,&#34; said <inline font-style="italic">Truth&#39;s</inline> representative, &#34; is to secure your views on the important public matter of occupational disease. Firstly, as to the prevalence and dangers of lead poison.&#34; &#34;Well,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burnell,</inline> &#34;I have had a good deal to do with that question, and must say emphatically that lead poisoning follows mining work in Broken Hill. So far as my knowledge goes, there is a difference in the lead poisoning of recent years compared with such disease in years past. Acute leading was prevalent to a large degree in the early days, but chronic leading was rare. To-day the position is reversed. There are but few cases of acute lead poisoning here now. Practically the whole of the cases now are of a chronic nature; that is to say, they are cases from which there is less hope of recovery.&#34; </para>
          <para>How is that accounted for, doctor? &#34; The reason is that in the early days of carbonate-ore mining the disease used to attack <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> very suddenly, and would cripple them up, thereby compelling them to seek treatment before the disease had time to become chronic, before it would generate diseases of the kidneys, for instance, which are undoubtedly very prevalent in Broken Hill. Then, again, those men in many instances left the mines and were restored to health. At the present time the disease develops more slowly, and the kidneys and heart are already affected so badly that when men become laid up, lead poisoning is not the only malady.&#34; </para>
          <para>You agree there with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Sir Thomas</inline> Oliver, who pointed out in his work on occupational diseases that lead poisoning produces a multiplicity of complications, particularly in the kidneys? &#34; Yes,&#34; replied <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burnell,</inline> &#34; and those conclusions arrived at by the authority you quote have been supported by practical demonstration. I have found here that in nearly all cases of lead poisoning that I have come in contact with the kidneys have also been affected. I offer that as a possible explanation of the abnormal prevalence of kidney diseases in Broken Hill. Lead also affects the blood vessels, and through them the heart.&#34; </para>
          <para>To what extent does the disease exist? &#34; That I am not in a position to say,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burnell</inline> replied, &#34; as I have only to deal with the cases which actually come before me, and their condition generally leaves no room for doubt. To give an idea of the prevalence &#39; of the disease, I would need to examine the thousands of men I have never seen. As I said before, the men I do examine are generally chronically poisoned. To what extent others may be affected I do&#39; not know. I am right up to the hilt, though - as a result of the cases I know of- with those whose arguments are on the side of the contention that lead poisoning is prevalent and disastrous. &#34; But,&#34; continued the doctor, &#34; there is the disease of pneumonia that I regard, too, with particular importance in Broken Hill.&#34; </para>
          <para>You connect that with the mining industry, doctor ? &#34; Certainly I must. Take, for instance, the number of cases we have had of pneumonia in the hospital when the mines were working, and you will find that the miners, proportionately, overwhelmingly outnumbered the others. Then, again, the death-rate of those affected falls heavily upon miners, while amongst the others - I mean those working in the town, or women - it is much lighter. These facts are sufficient in themselves. If a town-worker gets pneumonia, his chance of recovery is good, but it goes hard indeed with a miner, and too often he succumbs because he is not in a fit condition to resist it. That is my reason for being emphatic on the point of pneumonia in Broken Hill being very largely an occupational disease.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">That medical gentleman traces diseases of the heart and kidneys and lead poisoning directly to the fact that the men are  working in lead mines. Further than that, he says that pneumonia is an industrial disease in Broken Hill, and that it is more fatal to the men working on the mines, hy reason of their occupation, than it is to any other section of the public. The Barrier <inline font-style="italic">Daily Truth</inline> also reports an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Birks,</inline> surgeon superintendent of the Broken Hill and District Hospital, as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In reply to a question by a representative of Barrier <inline font-style="italic">Daily Truth,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Birks,</inline> surgeon superintendent of the hospital, stated: <inline font-style="italic">&#34;I</inline> could not say how many of the Broken Hill miners are afflicted with lead poisoning, but there is a large proportion. Many of the men who come in through accidents have been found to be suffering from lead.&#34; </para>
            <para>How long do you think a man could work in Broken Hill with a fair chance of escaping? </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Birks</inline>: &#34; I think not more than four years, -without a year or so spell away. No man is safe for long in the lead mines - that is, the average work-place in Broken Hill, the sulphide stopes, which are much slower in poisoning men than in the carbonates, which are quick.&#34; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If lead poisoning is so &#34;slow&#34; that it will take four years to bring about death, honorable members can appreciate what the condition of the men must have been when carbonates were being freely mined in Broken Hill.  &#34;A great many people,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Birks,</inline> &#34; are more afraid of dust than lead in these mines. But I hold the opinion that lead poisoning is, the thing to be feared here. No man who becomes affected with lead is the same again - that is, he will always be more liable to be again poisoned. The best thing that such  a  man can do, is to leave the mines altogether.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">I shall now quote the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven,</inline> as set out in the company-owned paper, which interviewed him, asking him his views with regard to a statement made by the  chairman  of the Broken Hill mining companies&#39; representatives at the September conference where his investigations were &#34; pooh-poohed &#34; - in effect, it was said that they were absolutely foolish and silly. The <inline font-style="italic">Barrier Miner</inline> reports an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven,</inline> as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To-day a <inline font-style="italic">Miner</inline> reporter sought an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven,</inline> who conducted the examinations referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Emery,</inline> and asked him whether he considered the men examined by him were typical of the miners of Broken Hill. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven</inline>replied, &#34;I cannot say that. How could I say whether they were typical of Broken Hill? I can  say,  &#39;however,  that  I found the condition of the men examined very bad.&#34; </para>
            <para>Could you  say  that the cases of the men examined were typical cases?- &#34;I cannot  say that,&#34;  replied <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven.</inline> &#34;I can  say that I found all the cases very similar, but whether they were typical of Broken Hill is another matter. From my experience here I would say that of the miners who have worked in the Broken Hill mines from 15 to 20 years, a very large percentage of them are suffering from lung deterioration; and a very much larger percentage of them suffer from plumbism than the mining companies are prepared to admit. My examination of the miners at the A.M.A. office some time ago showed that 78 per cent. of those examined were suffering from slight lung consolidation to advanced phthisis. From ray experience of other miners I should say that approximately 70 per cent. of the miners who have worked for 15 years underground in Broken Hill will undoubtedly show lung deterioration. I am prepared to state that before any tribunal, and can prove it by taking miners haphazardly. I think from the size of my practice I am in a fair position to judge of the condition of health of the miners. We cannot minimize it, and it is just as well to face it first as last. I could bring men&#34; here in dozens, and if any one guessed at their ages they would make them ten years older than they are. My percentages of the miners affected have been borne out by the fact that no man whom I reported as suffering from lead has &#39;been rejected by the medical referees appointed under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. That is a fair criterion as to the correctness of my diagnoses.&#34; </para>
            <para>You state that from your experience you would say that of the miners who have worked in the Broken Hill mines for from 15 to 20 years, a much larger percentage of them suffer from plumbism than the mining companies are prepared to admit. Can you give (a) the percentage suffering from lung deterioration; (b) the percentage suffering from plumbism? -&#34;I say that 70 per cent. are suffering from lung deterioration and 25 per cent. from plumbism.&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">I do not propose to read the whole of this interview, since it is a lengthy one, but in answer to a question that some may be inclined to put, as to whether the health of the men had been impaired whilst working elsewhere, I shall read that part of it which covers the point: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Did you ascertain in the course of your examination whether the men examined had worked elsewhere than at Broken Hill, and, if so, do you know the condition of their lungs when they began to work underground here? - &#34; Very few indeed of the 178 men examined had worked elsewhere than &#34;Broken Hill.&#34; </para>
            <para>When you say that you can bring dozens of men who have prematurely aged ten years, can you give any idea howlong, they have worked here, and how long elsewhere, and at what occupation?&#34; I makea practice of asking every man whom I consider to be below par how longhe has worked in the mines here, andIin variablytakeanoteofitifIfindhehas workedelsewhere.Theanswertothatques- tionisgiveninmyanswertotheprevious question.&#34; </para>
            <para>Can you say from your general experience what percentage of the men in Broken Hill have worked here for from 12 to 20 years? - &#34;I could not say.&#34; </para>
            <para>Can you say what is the average time worked here by the bulk of the miners? - &#34; The average could be worked out by reference to my certificates. At the time I made a note of the time worked in the Broken Hill mines by every man examined.&#34; </para>
            <para>Do the periods shown in your certificates represent the time worked in Broken Hill, or do they include time worked elsewhere? - &#34;The periods shown in my certificates represent the time each man examined worked in the Broken Hill mines, and do not include time worked by the men elsewhere.&#34; </para>
            <para>There are cases among the certificates where the period worked is set down as eighteen months, three, four, five, six, and seven years. Do you know whether the condition in which you found such men was due to industrial diseases contracted at work on the mines of Broken Hill? - &#34; I have every reason to believe that the condition of those men was caused directly from working in the mines of Broken Hill.&#34; </para>
            <para>In conclusion <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Steven</inline> said: - &#34;I very much regret the necessity of giving this interview. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Courtney,</inline> the  chairman  of the conference held in Melbourne recently between representatives of the mining companies and the A.M.A., said that my reports were unbelievable, I simply must defend myself. I am prepared to back any statement I have made up to the hilt. I hold no brief for either the miners or the mine-owners, but I certainly think it is quite time that all parties should realize the serious condition of the health of the miners in Broken Hill. The manager of the <inline font-style="italic">Miner,</inline> in a letter to me, says he is only desirous of obtaining this information for the public benefit, and not for the purpose of helping one side or the other. I have willingly given this interview for the same purpose.&#34; </para>

          <para class="block">That is the kind of thing that the widows and children of miners whose health has been destroyed have had to face. Is it to be wondered at that there has been a strike at Broken Hill which has lasted for twelve&#39; months, and that the wives have stuck nobly to their husbands, notwithstanding the hardships that that has involved? In 1914 a Royal Commission was appointed in New South Wales to investigate the condition of things at Broken Hill, and the following figures, taken from Exhibit 78 attached to its report, show the risks of accident which the miners have to run, apart from the risk of diseases such as phthisis, pneumonia, lead-poisoning, and other occupational diseases :  - </para>

          <para class="block">No man could draw accident pay unless he had been so seriously injured as to be at least three days incapacitated. For the first six months of 1914 the average. membership was 7,402 ; the number of accidents, 505; and the number of fatal accidents, 7. In the last speech that I made on this subject, I pointed out that since 1893, when the New South Wales Government began to tabulate statistics regarding accidents and fatalities in mines, the Broken Hill companies had killed 400 men straight out, and the figures I have given above <inline font-style="italic">show</inline> that thousands of accidents have occurred, requiring union members to pay out of their own pockets many thousands of pounds for the support of the injured. God knows how many have been killed by lead-poisoning, miners&#39; phthisis, and disguised lead-poisoning in the shape of kidney disease and other kindred diseases. The other side of the picture can be seen by a glance at the share-list of Messrs. Joseph Palmer and Sons. </para>

              <para>- It is a Commonwealth matter. According to the share-list to which I have referred the dividends which have been paid by the Broken Hill mining companies are these : - Amalgamated Zinc, &#163;882,500 ; British Broken Hill, &#163;826,000; Broken Hill Proprietary, &#163;10,945,750; Broken Hill Block 10, &#163;1,585,000; Broken Hill Block 14, &#163;606,500; Broken Hill Junction, &#163;81,750; Junction <inline font-style="italic">&#34;North</inline> Broken Hill, &#163;162,700; Broken Hill South, &#163;2,535,000; North Broken Hill Mining Company, &#163;1,912,940; Sulphide Corporation, &#163;2,937,245; Zinc Corporation, &#163;1,566,650 ; or a total of &#163;24,042,035. The total value of the properties owned by these companies is, on the present value of their shares, &#163;16,607,000. Besides what has been paid away in dividends, profits have been made and concealed by taking up shares in other companies. The Broken Hill Proprietary had paid- in dividends up to the 31st May, 1913, &#163;9,232,000; in bonuses, &#163;1,120,000; and in shares of other companies, &#163;1,744,000; a total of &#34;&#163;.12,096,000. That was be fore that company floated the steel works at Newcastle, which have brought in further profits, and in regard to which there has been a further concealment of profits. The mining companies have shares in the Associated Smelters at Port Pirie. No account is given of the profits from that concern. They have also shares in the Electrolytic Zinc Works, at Risdon, in Tasmania. The directors of &#39;these companies are persons, who, while piling up millions in dividends, have treated their employees in the way I have described. Their dividends have been made at the expense of the health of the employees, and they refuse, even in the event of the men returning to work, to consent to any investigation into their profits, or earnings, or the manner of the distribution of those profits. Between 1914 and June, 1918, the North Broken Hill Company paid &#163;750,000 in dividends. It has kept the mine development well ahead, has paid for new plant, and has accumulated surplus liquid assets amounting to &#163;426,982. I get that information from the <inline font-style="italic">Timberman and Ironmaster</inline> of 30th September, 1918. According to the issue of that journal of the 29th October, 1918, the profits of the Broken Hill South Mining Company have been for 1914, &#163;241,838; for 1915, &#163;300,160; for 1916, &#163;466,458; for 1917, &#163;418,877; and for the first six months of 1918, &#163;165,291. The dividends in that period have totalled &#163;860.000; &#163;138,677 has been written off; and the reserves are now &#163;781,470. By no stretch of the imagination can it be claimed for these companies that they are unable to meet the demands of the men for better working conditions. The dividends, I might truthfully say, have been wrung out of the corpses of the miners and of their children..  To-day the  companies rely for success on a publicity campaign. By the interlocking of directorates, the directors of the mining companies are connected with most of the big interests of Australia, including the press. They are attempting to turn public opinion against the miners of Broken Hill, in order that they may be allowed a free hand to continue the murderous exploitation of those whom they employ. The men have asked for a six-hours day, for a week of five, days; and for the abolition of the night shift. The offer made by the companies, at a recent conference, was a week of  forty-six hours for tradesmen employed on the surface, and of forty-four hours for the continuous process workers in the mills and the miners on day shift. That is, the miners on day shift are offered the same hours they are working at present. The company say that very few men work on night shift, and, therefore, the concession to those who are so employed amounts, on their own showing, to very little. They say thatthose on night shift will be employed only in driving, rising, and winze sinking or development work, while the breaking of ore and stoping will be discontinued on night shift. The contract system is to be retained. The men are still to be at the mercy of the underground foreman, who fixes the price at so much per ton on the ground. If they do not like the foreman&#39;s price they can go up the shaft and look for work elsewhere; or, if they are forced to accept that price, in order to earn bread for their wives and children, they have to skimp the protecting devices underground in order to make a living. While the contract system continues, it is impossible for the men to safeguard themselves in regard to the ground overhead, as they have to test it with long bars in order to assure themselves that it is safe before they commence work. Every minute they lose in testing the ground overhead means so much out of their fortnightly pay envelope. The claims of the men have not been, met in any way. This motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the conditions at present prevailing at Broken Hill accords with the requestof the men from the very commencement of the dispute. They desire appointed a tribunal which will bo capable of inquiring into every phase of the employment in the mines, with full power to investigate in open Court and let the public know the conditions actually existing in, those mines. We are satisfied that when the people know the exact state of affairs in Broken Hill they will insist upon giving the miners what they are justly entitled to, and will not consent to them and their wives and children being sacrificed any longer on the altar of dividends. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable member for Melbourne say &#34;Hear, hear!&#34; Evidently he is acquainted with the work done by the State Royal Commission, and is well satisfied that the inquiry was full, and that all necessary evidence was obtained.  His  remark and the speech of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> have demonstrated that the appointment of another Royal Commission is quite unnecessary. What good will be done by holding another inquiry? What fresh evidence would it produce? </para>

My opinion is that its purpose is to lift the responsibility off the shoulders of the New South Wales Government. Why should this House be saddled with the responsibility for an inquiry when a Labour Government is in office m New South Wales, and Has power to act in this matter? We would be charged with usurping the powers of the New South Wales .Parliament, and rightly so. Let the State Government do their duty. As a layman, I contend that it is the duty of the State Government to deal with this matter. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Barrier had any faith in the New South Wales Government, he would have withdrawn the notice of motion, or he could have postponed it. I think the honorable member would argue that the Government now in power in New South Wales would be more sympathetic towards him than would the Federal Government, and that, they would be likely to do more for the miners. If he is of that opinion, why does he not give them the opportunity ? We should wait, and watch the attitude of the State Government, who are in office with a majority. </para>

            <para>. -  I support the motion. The health of the workers, not only of Broken Hill, but throughout Australia, is of paramount importance, especially when it is shown that the infantile mortality at the. Barrier is so very great. This latter fact is a serious menace to the future of Australia. If the Government are actuated by a desire to better the conditions of the workers, and give the infants of the Barrier a chance for life, I trust they will do their utmost to meet the circumstances, and not adopt tactics to prevent a vote being taken on the motion. </para>

            <para>.- I intimated that I desired to say a few words on this motion, and I promise not to occupy much time. As one who has necessarily had to give a certain amount of attention, even to matters outside my own State, I cannot help remembering that, during the whole time I have been in this House, and for a considerably longer period, Broken Hill has been a kind of chronic open sore in many regards. It has been the centre &#39; of a great deal of political disturbance and unrest. We have had so many different statements regarding this condition of affairs, that I for one would like to have an inquiry that will get to the bottom of it. We have had, time and again, in this district serious strikes, and industrial troubles of a character even more serious than strikes - troubles which have been hushed up, but which I  have reason to believe were of a somewhat grave nature. There is a condition of things in that locality which indicates something abnormal. Whether it is that the capitalist is the cruel ruthless tyrant so often portrayed, or whether there are influences at work that merely make the capitalist the stalking horse of their designs, I know not. But I am anxious, indeed, to have the situation investigated, and I believe that there are many people of the same mind as myself. We desire to know what is the matter with Broken Hill. If it is the case that the men are working there under conditions that are seriously detrimental to life and human happiness, nothing should be left undone to remedy the state of affairs. It has been suggested that the record of infantile mortality is sufficient to condemn Broken Hill in an industrial sense. It occurs to me, that in that arid part of Australia, infantile mortality may be due to conditions that have nothing to do with the mines - that the food of the children may be unsuitable, on account of the difficulty of obtaining supplies. </para>

              <para>- There may be other causes, and I am merely suggesting a possibility. I understand that while it is admitted that there is a considerable amount of disease following occupation in those mines, having regard to the fairly high percentage of miners affected, the management has done a great deal - indeed, it is claimed that they have done all in their power - to bring about the healthiest conditions under which the work can be carried on. There have been several inquiries into the question, and several undoubtedly earnest attempts made to improve the industrial conditions; but products of the mines are more necessary than ever to the industries of the world, and I do not think we can afford to create conditions that will mean the practical closing down of the work. It will be seen that there are difficulties in dealing with a question of this kind, difficulties that require a certain amount of discretion and common &#39; sense. To me, therefore, the question is one which resolves itself into what authority would best carry out an investigation of the kind proposed - would have the widest scope, and the most definite power to deal with the issues raised. The Commonwealth is not in such a position. Commonwealth powers, in regard to an inquiry such as I suggest, is practically limited, whereas the State Government and Parliament have practically unlimited power. The Labour Government in New South Wales, surely, might be expected to do all in its power to present the industrial side of the question. </para>

              <para>- But I did not know the motion was coming up for consideration to-day. I have been taking a little interest in the question lately, and have prepared some material of which I should have liked to make use, but, under the circumstances, it is not available. However, I listened with very great interest to a speech delivered some time ago by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> when he dealt principally with the health of the miners of BrokenHill. It seems to me that that is the principal phase we have to consider in discussing this question. All these other matters - hours of work, wages to be paid, and so on - in an industry of this kind very largely depend on the question of health. If the mining industry at Broken Hill is a very unheathy occupation, then, of course, the miners should work shorter hours, and be paid extra high wages. I made up my mind that I would do everything I could to assist to bring about a better state of affairs if such were possible. The question which honorable members have to determine today is whether or not it is necessary to appoint a Commission to inquire into the various matters indicated by the honorable member for Barrier. I intend to vote against the motion, not because I have not every sympathy with the men engaged in an industry of this kind, but because I think that, at the present time, such an. investigation is not necessary. Upon a visit to Broken Hill, at Easter, I became acquainted with a number of interesting things. I inquired very carefully into the subject of the health of the miners, and learned that the New South Wales Government had appointed a special technical Commission - a medical body - to inquire into this very matter. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; it has examined to date something like 1,000  miners. Its object is to subject every miner at Broken Hill to the most rigorous and exhaustive examination. Before the Commission began its labours, its members drew up a certain form for their guidance, which covered every possible aspect of investigation into the health of the miners. I would like to have shown honorable members one of those forms, which I brought back with me. It has only to be perused for one to be struck with the exhaustive nature of the inquiry. The Medical Commission is composed of men who are leaders in various branches of scientific research. </para>

              <para>- I will try to indicate them presently, but I desire to show just now the nature of the examination made in each instance by the Commission. The family history of the miner is investigated, also his industrial history. Then a close physical examination) is undertaken, concluding with an X-ray examination of his body. A most careful account is tabulated of all that- is done. The honorable member for Barrier asks what is the object of the Commission, and what are its powers. I understand that its object is to find out not only what the state of the health of the miners is at the present time, but also to ascertain how the industry affects their health. The Commission will make a report to the State Government, I understand, and will proffer certain recommendations regarding the conduct of the mining industry from the point of view of the health of those engaged. </para>

              <para>- As for that phase of the subject, it was originally suggested that such a Commission should be appointed. The Premier of New South Wales thereupon&#39; instructed a medical man &#39; to furnish an estimate of the probable cost of the investigation. He re-&#39; ported that, in his opinion, the cost of the Commission would be something like &#163;15,000. Then, in his wisdom, the State Premier said he thought that was too much ; he was not prepared to go to that extent. Next, the mine-owners - being desirous that such an investigation should! be of the most thorough character possible^ - intimated that rather than minimize the scope of the Commission they would be prepared to bear half the expense. Their sole purpose was that it should be a thorough investigation. </para>

              <para>- I am going to  give  my reason for saying that one of the things wrong is vicious leadership. My reason for saying that, according <inline font-style="italic">to my</inline> view-point, some of the leadership in Broken Hill has been of a vicious character emanates from an opportunity of which I availed myself to attend a meeting on the Sunday evening which I spent at Broken Hill. This gathering was addressed by a master of arts from Adelaide, who was at the Barrier as the representative of the Workers Educational Association. He was there to conduct classes for the education of the miners. The burden of his address was this : He set out to prove to his audience- who were to be his pupils in the future, under the scheme which had been drafted by the Workers Educational Association - that they were abject slaves. He stressed that every wage-earner in the  community  is an abject slave - more a slave, indeed, than were the slaves under the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago. </para>

              <para>- The lecturer was laying down that statement &#39;as a proposition; he did not attempt to prove it, but was simply asserting it. He said something to this effect : &#39;* You miners  are making certain demands upon your masters. What if you get all your demands conceded to you ? What better off are you ? You are none the less slaves. Of course, if you secure your demands, good luck to you; and if you do, it will be a better jumpingoff ground for the revolution which is nearer than most of ns imagine.&#34; The one redeeming feature of the meeting was that, throughout the lecture - which extended over, perhaps, threequarters of an hour - the men did not indulge in the least applause. The significance of their attitude <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> me was that, as level-headed men, they felt that the lecturer was talking utter and absolute rot. </para>

His  lecture -is a sample of the kind of stuff that is being fed to the miners at Broken Hill. 1 yield to no man in my desire to see better conditions of labour. I should like the conditions of labour at Broken Hill to be as good as it is possible to make them; hut I come back to the point that the health of the miners is the chief consideration. We should stay our hands until the Medical Commission has completed its labours. </para>

          <para>If, as we are told, this occupation is deadly, one would expect to find the men anxious to escape from it. But what are the facts? We find that men who have left Broken Hill, and have been absorbed elsewhere - who have found work in other cities - return to the Barrier immediately there is any prospect of the strike being settled and work being available. That, to my mind, is some evidence that mining operations at the Barrier are not as deadly as we have been led to understand. </para>

              <para>- Whether they have been forced to do these things or not, the point is that they have been done. Nowadays, there is no greater force than that of public opinion to induce employers to do the right thing. Whenever any body of industrialists come forward with a demand which, on the face of it, is just, public opinion immediately ranges itself behindthat demand, and makes it absolutely irresistible. </para>

              <para>- I disagree with the honorable member. I believe that public. opinion has not been correctly informed of the facts of the case. If we were to ask any man who takes a reasonably intelligent interest in these questions, what is the real point at issue between the employers and the miners at BrokenHill we should find that he was unable to tell us. I am convinced that whenever a demand that is just and reasonable is made, public opinion will compel those concerned to concede it. One has only to look at the Mines Act of New South Wales to see that every precaution that experience and consideration for the interests of the miner can suggest has been provided for in it. </para>

              <para>- In additionto the inspectors appointed by the Government, there are inspectors appointed by the men to go through the workings, to point out to those in authority where improvements can be effected, and to see that they are carried out. In these circumstances, it is difficult, in the light of our present knowledge, to say what more can be done in the interests of the miners. It has been said during this debate that now that a Labour Government is in power in New South Wales, if it is possible to further protect the interests of the miners at Broken Hill that protection will be forthcoming. </para>

              <para>- That again is a question that hinges upon the character of the work. I should be guided by what the doctors had to say after they had made their examination of the men at the present time, as well as after they have been at work for some time. There is some force in the argument of the honorable member for Barrier that since the men have been out of the mines for nearly twelve months, their health, if there was any tendency to its impairment, might have been re-established. An examination to-day might not give as true a result of the effect of working in the mines upon the health of the men as would an examination after they had actually been at work for some time. </para>

              <para>- On the face of it, that is a common-sense argument. According to the honorable member himself, it is impossible to make a satisfactory examination of the men until they are at work again. I am not sufficiently expert as to the nature of the work or as to its effect upon the men from a medical point of view. In other circumstances, I should have felt very much inclined to support the motion for the appointment of a Royal Commission, but since a Medical Commission is now sitting </para>

Ninety-five per cent, of the press of Australia is anti-Labour, and has not on any occasion backed up the workers. Any advance made by the workers, either politically or .industrially, has been the result of their own efforts, and has been gained in spite of the press. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr. Molesworth</inline>was not invited by the unionists to lecture at Broken Hill, and went there almost in spite of them. Some honorable members h&#39;ave spoken as though union officials appointed themselves, instead of being elected, as they are, by the members of the unions. I was a financial member of a trade union at the age of seventeen. The organization was then just coming into existence, and admitted apprentices. I remained a member until the Arbitration Act prevented me from continuing in it, because I was no longer working at my trade. But I have my clearance, and it would be accepted by any branch of the Felt Hatters Union in any part of the world. It is not the officials who are to blame for industrial troubles, but very often the officials of the employers. During the recent seamen&#39;s dispute, which affected Australia so much industrially, a ballot of the men was in favour of a strike. So, again, in the case of the marine engineers&#39; strike. In the latter case the executive advised the men to accept the terms offered, but the men refused to do so. The same thing has occurred at Broken Hill, and is occurring at the present time in Victoria. </para>

          <para>Members opposite have become the apologists for the capitalists who support them, and, -therefore, oppose an inquiry into the conditions at Broken Hill. A Federal Commission is to be preferred to a State Commission, because it would have wider powers. It  i3  only a rich company like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that can defy the Federal Government. In fairness to the Broken Hill companies, I say that I think they would not hinder the making of a full and complete inquiry into the conditions that prevail. We have a right to such an inquiry. The honorable member for the Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> told us of the lives that had been lost, and, on the other hand, of the dividends that had been made at Broken Hill. He would have failed in his duty if he had not done so. When honorable members say that the Broken Hill trouble is due to extremists, who, as far as their numbers are concerned, do not count, my reply is that the honorable member would not have been elected to this Chamber if he did not represent the views of the majority. During the last Parliament he was constantly taunted with being the representative of a minority, but in December last, after the strike had been in existence for eight  months, he was elected by a majority of the people of Broken Hill, which shows that he represents the-feelings of the majority of those living there. Then, again, only three or four weeks ago, the man who topped the poll was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brookfield,</inline> while a &#34; has-been &#34; was turned down. </para>

I think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> knows a little about him. Whatever may be said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Brookfield&#39;s  politics and his disputes with the Labour executive, it must be admitted that he was the most extreme candidate who submitted himself for the representation of the district of Broken Hill in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and he topped the poll. That shows the feeling at Broken Hill. I spoke in the town once on a Saturday night, and the next day was present at a demonstration in support of the local hospital, which I visited, and the doctors&#39; admitted that the lead was a bad trouble. The Government would like this motion to be talked out, but I cannot allow the aspersions on trade unionism made by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> to pass unanswered. They desire that trade unionism shall cease to exist in Australia. </para>

              <para>- No. I have a record in regard to trade unionism which I can place against that of any man in this House.  I am not one of those who became a unionist after trade unionism had begun to succeed. I have never used trade unionism. I am glad to have had this  oppor- tunity  to state the case of the unionists, so that it may appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> alongside the statements of those who have traduced trade unionism, who would make it appear that it is the officials and not the great body of unionists who decide these matters. Time after time the &#39;Officials have smoothed over difficulties, as many honorable members opposite know. It is the rank and file who declare by ballot whether there shall &#39;be a strike. However, as there is no1 chance of finishing the debate tonight, I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. </para>

            <para>.- This Bill appears to be an attempt to deal with two altogether different funds by one measure and in the same way. In regard to the canteen funds this Parliament can do what it thinks fit, but in regard to the other fund, we should be bound by the trusts of the will which created it. There should have been two Bills to cover these two different matters, and the attempt to drag in the bequest of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey as a sort of afterthought under the wide powers of sub-clause b of clause 3 does not seem to be at all desirable. Very little objection can be taken to the provisions regarding the canteen funds except the old one that the Bill is merely a skeleton, and that many vital principles are left to regulations. It also introduces the undesirable system of referring to other Acts, in order to ascertain the meaning of words used in this Bill. For example, in the first clause one is referred to the &#34;War Pensions Acts of 1914 and 1915, in order to get the interpretation which might just as well be embodied in the Bill itself, and thus made plain for every one to read. Regulations under measures of this sort should be confined to mere matters of detail, but under this proposal they are to be so wide that the principles of the Act will be laid, down, not by the Act itself, but by the regulations made under it. For instance, there is nothing in the Bill as to the manner  of appointing State Committees. The honorable and gallant member who introduced the Bill told us that State Committees are to be appointed. But their  powers will be very small; they would be only advisory bodies. There is no power in the Bill for the original trustees to appoint any substitutes in other States. That will mean that everything done under the Act will require to be sent to Melbourne to be confirmed by the trustees before any action can be taken. There is no power to delegate authority to the different Committees in the States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are told that the canteen balances are to be distributed within about six months. It reflects great credit upon those who managed the canteens that there is such a large sum available for distribution. These canteens are not&#39;, mere drinking bars. They are general stores. At Liverpool Camp, at any rate, the establishment of canteens did away with  the very objection- able system previously in vogue under which all classes of traders, some of whom were guilty 6&#34;f very peculiar practices, were allowed into the camps. It is a matter for congratulation that the canteens not only paid their way, but repaid to the Treasury the whole of the moneys paid from time to time in order to set them going. But, judging from what was said by one honorable member, I doubt whether the advances made by some of the officers and men have been repaid. The canteen fund also provided money for the sports and recreations of the soldiers. On top of all that, there is a balance of &#163;500,000 available for distribution. The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> suggested that it might be better in the interests of those concerned if that amount were capitalized, but having regard to the fact that there may be from 30,000 to 50,000 claimants, and the average amount available for each may not be more than perhaps &#163;10 to &#163;15, it is better that the fund should be dealt with as a lump sum rather than that the payment should be spread over a number of years. The fact that the children are growing up, and in a few years will be earning their own living, seems to me to be an argument in favour of an immediate distribution of- the fund rather than of holding it in hand and distributing only the interest. No provision is made in the Bill itself that the amounts given under it shall not be taken into consideration by the Repatriation Department, or in connexion with pensions. The Minister has assured us that they will not be taken into consideration in that way, but it would have been very much preferable . to have it so stated in the Bill than to leave it to the&#34; regulations which are afterwards to be framed. </para>
          <para>When we come to the second object which the Minister tells us is intended to be covered, I find the Bill most un-. satisfactory. There seems to be no reason for dragging to Melbourne the management of the McCaughey fund, and although the Bill gives the trustees sufficient power to deal with the Canteens Fund, the McCaughey trust opens up a far larger field of discussion, and the powers given under the Bill do not seem to be sufficient, to cover the ground that needs to be covered under that devise. </para>
          <para class="block">It is very easy to criticise men; but, after all, we all take the conditions of the world as we find them, and if we leave the world, or our own small corner of it, a little better than we found it- </para>

              <para>- That is what the soldiers have done who created the Canteens Fund. I think we can also say that the man who created the other fund has left Australia better for his residence here, and for the work he did in it. According to his lights he was, I believe, a faithful steward of his wealth in his lifetime, and in his death he left, an example which we hope that many Australians will follow. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> talked about the Bulli Disaster Fund, and about the administration of that fund sealing up the fountains of generosity of the people of Australia; but I know of nothing more likely to seal up the fountains of generosity and benevolence than a speech like that to which we listened from the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> last night. The McCaughey fund consists of about &#163;450.000, which is all to be invested. It is not to be distributed as the Canteens Fund is. The objects of the trust are set out in the will, and I suppose will be adhered to. There is &#163;300.000 for pastoral, agricultural,  ad technical education of soldiers&#39; c&#39; children  ; &#163;50,000 to provide in  hospital  . beds and cots for wives and  children  of soldiers; &#163;50,000 for subsidies for ^  ilding  funds of the Australian  Imperial  Force units; and &#163;50,000 for special purposes to be&#39; determined by the executors of the will. These things are on another plane altogether from the canteen money, and the trustees appointed to administer the McCaughey fund will have to decide upon the whole policy required for carrying out the will. </para>

              <para>- That is so. It is to be drawn in by a sort of side wind by means of paragraph 6 of clause 3. None of the powers mentioned in the will are given by the Bill. The trustees whom we appoint may have to make arrangements in the States for the education of soldiers&#39; children in agri cultural or technical colleges, or on agricultural farms. They may have to originate training colleges of their own. They may have to build a wing of a hospital, instead of endowing other hospitals in different places. All these things need to be provided for. I think the clause dealing with the investment of the trust funds is not nearly wide enough, if the intention is to bring the McCaughey trust money into it. I would give the trustees power, not only to invest the money in Government securities or fixed deposits in banks, but also to invest in approved rent-producing freehold properties. I do not think any honorable member would confine himself, iri dealing with a large sum like this, merely to Government securities or banks&#39; fixed deposits. These powers ought certainly to be enlarged in order to give the trustees the right to make such investments, which, with proper supervision, will be just as safe and secure as the securities mentioned in the Bill itself, and which, moreover, will bring to the fund an increased amount of interest, and consequently place an increased annual revenue at the disposal of the trustees. I notice that there is no provision in the Bill to preserve the original trusts. Apparently, the Bill intends that the McCaughey money shall become part of the fund. Clause 3 provides that the fund shall consist of, first, the canteen moneys; and, secondly, any moneys transferred to the trustees which the Minister, by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> directs shall form part of the fund. If the McCaughey money forms part of this fund, it seems to me that it will be applicable for the purposes for which the fund is created - purposes altogether different from those which the will had in view, and which are set out in the trusts of that document. The Bill as it comes before us does not contemplate so complicated an administration as is rendered necessary by the McCaughey trust. The Government would be well advised to let it go through without paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of  clause 3, making it refer only to the Can-* teens Fund, and to bring down a separate Bill to provide for the great benefaction of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey, in order to insure that the objects for which that , money was given are adequately provided for and properly carried out. Only in that way can the bequest by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey be satisfactorily dealt with. </para>

            <para>.- Earlier in the debate upon this Bill I objected to the large number of trustees whom it is proposed to appoint for the purpose of administering the fund. There are no less than seven of them. I fail to see the necessity for such a large body, especially as its duties will not be of the same character as those which will be discharged by the State Advisory Committees. The Trust will not be called upon to do any of the detail work ; its functions will be limited to the consideration of the recommendations by the State Committees. Where, then, is the need for a Trust consisting of seven members, especially when its duties can be more efficiently performed by three or four? I am of opinion that the measure was hurriedly drafted by one man, that proper consideration was not given to it, and that it has been submitted to this Chamber in a very immature form. I have no desire to differentiate between any of the persons whose names are set out in this clause, and I shall, therefore, content myself with moving - </para>

            <para>. - I ask the Committee to allow the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Trust to remain unaltered. We must not forget that these trustees are to act in an honorary capacity. If we seek to eliminate any of them, where shall we start? Anybody with experience of honorary committees knows that three members will often attend one meeting and three different members another meeting. It frequently happens that a quorum is obtained from certain members upon one day and a quorum from different members upon another day. </para>

              <para>- I have previously pointed out that any man who is considered suitable for this particular work will be of very much more value in his own Statethan he would be on the central Trust. It is almost imperative that all the members of the Trust shall reside permanently in Melbourne. If they were living in any State other than Victoria, they would have to be travelling constantly between the different capitals in order to do their work as it should be done. In such circumstances it would be only reasonable that they should ask to be reimbursed their expenses, and we do not desire to fritter away any of this fund in that way. I do not believe that any of the trustees whom it is proposed to appoint will exhibit the slightest partiality. They will simply act on the recommendations received from the State Advisory Committees. </para>

            <para>. - I hope that the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> will not proceed with his amendment. We have already been informed that these positions are honorary, and my experience of honorary bodies is that it is sometimes very difficult to obtain a quorum. It has been asked why there are not men and women appointed from other States besides Victoria; but if trustees have to be brought from a distance to Melbourne their expenses will have to be paid. For instance, if we had a representative from each State, the expenditure of a considerable amount of money would be involved ; and we must not forget that this is not our own money, but the money of the soldiers themselves; indeed, I do not know that we have any right to dictate as to how this fund shall be spent. Many of the men whose names are mentioned are personally and deeply interested in the disposal of these funds, and, therefore, I suggest the withdrawal of the amendment. </para>

I do not object to a representative&#39; from that organization, but it seems to me that other organizations are deliberately ignored.

              <para>- No; but I can name other organizations that are just as representative. The claim is made that this is the largest organization; but the fact that it has a few more members than others does not entitle it to be the only one to send representatives to such bodies. If this were the first occasion on which this has happened we might overlook it; but I am convinced that this association is singled out because of its political activities. That is a paltry attitude on the part of the Government when the soldiers&#39; interests ought to be considered; but we find that political &#34;pull&#34; repeatedly. I know it is useless to move an amendment, so I shall satisfy myself with voicing my protest. The exercise of discrimination in the way I have indicated is due to the fact that the officers of the organization stand behind the Nationalist Government in polities. </para>

I am not new saying whether or not the persons named are the proper persons for the position; but, in view of the fact that they will have the distribution of such a large sum of money, I think there ought to be  more  of them. Of the total sum of nearly &#163;1,000,000, these trustees will control the allocation of possibly &#163;600,000. </para>

The number of trustees should be at least seven. As I have said on a previous occasion, I take no exception to the persons named, but I think it would be very advisable to have the names of two ladies added, seeing that the greater proportion of the work will be that of dealing with the claims of widows, widowed mothers, and children. </para>

            <para>.- This is a further indication of the haphazard manner in which the Bill has been treated. The clause states that the trustees shall receive and consider applications from the widows and orphans and from widowed mothers and other dependants of deceased soldiers. As a matter of fact, this work will fall upon the State Advisory Committees, which will make recommendations to the trustees for indorsement. </para>

              <para>- There are women in New South Wales who have done excellent practical work among the soldiers. I have in mind, in particular, the splendid services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Willie</inline> Chisholm, who conducted the rest camp at Kantara.  Her  activities were a godsend, not only to our soldiers, but to the &#34;Tommies&#34; as well. She was not one of those who merely visited the troops in hospital, and earned a lot of credit for having done war work in that way. Day after day, year in and year out, she did the real toil herself. I have seen her with her sleeves rolled up cooking. She and her assistants would cook thousands of eggs a day. She and one of her chief helpers, whom I recall at this moment, namely, Miss McPhillamy, spent four years of the best period of their lives, slaving like general servants in an hotel. Women of that type are deserving of all praise and every consideration. Personally, I am of opinion that the State Committees will number about five, with two women appointed to each. </para>

Most of those who will seek help from this fund will be drawn from the  Tanks  of the working classes, and it will be wise to place upon the Committees women who are in actual touch with the working people, who are in sympathy with them, and know their difficulties and conditions of life generally. </para>

            <para>.- The proposal of the Government, as now set forth, is a step in the right direction, but I am not quite sure that it goes far enough. Honorable members who come from the more remote States are rather anxious concerning the manner in which the work of the Advisory Committeesshall be done. We have had experience of the evil effects of centralization in Melbourne, not only in regard to the activities of different public administrations, but particularly concerning the work performed in connexion with our soldiers. </para>

          <para class="block">It is just possible that the trustees may take the view that they will be expected to keep a tight control of the purse. If that should be so, then, to a large extent, the work to be done under this measure will be seriously interfered with. I desire to make sure that a good deal of the actual allocation and distribution of the fund shall be intrusted to the State Committees. I do not like the name &#34; Advisory Committee.&#34; because it suggests that these bodies will merely make recommendations to the central authority. If that is to be the practice, I can see considerable trouble in the matter of red-tape entanglements. </para>

              <para>- There is undoubtedly power given the trustees to delegate their work to the Committees; but will they do so? I would like to see them give to the Committees a considerable share of the actual administrative duties in matters of detail, and merely exercise general control themselves. In Western Australia, it has been too often the case that organizations have been created with solely advisory powers. They have had to remit to Melbourne matters upon which they are really more competent to form judgment than the central authority; and thus time is wasted. He gives twice who gives quickly. In the case of many of the people to be benefited by the fund, the celerity with which assistance may be granted will constitute no small feature of the benefits themselves. </para>

            <para>.- It is evident that public opinion is turning, and that, before long, ladies will be occupying seatsin this House. If we can furnish some of these capable women with jobs outside, they may not be so anxious to get into this place, and put some honorable members out of a job. The decision of the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir GranvilleRyrie)</inline> to place women upon the controlling bodies is wise. I hope the political aspect will not be allowed to interfere with the choice of ladies upon the various Committees. I would like to see representatives chosen who will be closely identified with the &#34;digger&#34; and his dependants. With all due respect to those ladies whose names have been mentioned, and against whom I have not a word to say, I am prepared to recommend one whom I have in mind who will put her heart and soul into the work. She is closely and sympathetically identified with the soldier and his dependants, and knows their requirements. I endeavour to be just to all, but I cannot dismiss from my mind the fact that I am a representative of the  Working  classes of my constituency, and I trust that the Honorary Minister will arrange that some persons associated with trades halls or industrial unions are appointed on the State Advisory Committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mary</inline> Booth is an able woman anxious to get into the limelight, but she cannot be regarded as a representative of the industrial section. It is no use denying the fact that lady members of such Committees would act sympathetically towards the members of their  own  sex. I know what has taken place in the State I represent, and I have experienced sleepless nights because of the treatment meted out to widows in connexion with the administration of certain funds in that State. If the Government  adopt  the suggestion it will be the means of removing a good deal of discontent and bringing about harmonious conditions which are so necessary in connexion with an important work of this character. </para>

            <para>- If that is so, why has the order of business been presented  in  the form  in  which  it  appears on the notice-paper! The Judiciary Bill has appeared  in  its present position for the last two or three days, and now the Minister for &#34;Works and Railways has moved that the second reading be postponed to enable the Estimates to be considered. He has not had the courtesy to give any valid reason, but apparently the Government are not ready to go on with the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Government with their majority will doubtless be able to do as they desire, but a &#34;more satisfactory reason should be given for altering the order of business. It is true that the Prime Minister stated that certain measures were to be dealt with, but that does not necessitate this procedure. The Judiciary Bill  is  a measure on which I think an amendment should be moved to enable the House to deal with the question of profiteering, which is a most pressing problem. On a measure such as the Judiciary Bill we shall be able to confer on the High Court or some other tribunal the necessary powers to deal with profiteering, and for that reason I trust the House will insist on the present order of business being adhered to. I intend to move an amendment for the withdrawal of the Bill to enable a more comprehensive measure to be introduced at the earliest possible moment. The urgency of dealing with profiteering&#34; is of such importance that we must not lose any opportunity of doing all we can to enable the House to come to a decision. I oppose the motion, and take this opportunity of informing the Minister that when the second reading is moved it is my intention to submit an amendment. </para>

            <para>- I have no desire to go beyond the Standing Orders in debating this question. I feel, however, that to discuss it intelligently I must give the reasons why I think the order of business on the notice-paper should not be departed from. It is of the utmost urgency that this House should take steps to pass measures that will enable us to effectively deal with profiteering under the powers contained in the Constitution. It is. of the utmost urgency that we should confer upon the High Court and other Courts jurisdiction to enforce the penalties provided by those measures and to carry out the investigations necessary in relation to them. I am certain that the people of Australia agree with me that this is a matter of extreme urgency. No one could have sat in the galleries during the last few days, and have listened to the talk that has been going on without coming to the conclusion that there is some justification for referring to the Parliament as &#34; a mere talking shop.&#34; We are dealing with matters which do not affect the real interests of the people, which should be receiving our consideration. The Tariff, for instance, is before us. We know that there are complaints that locally manufactured goods are sold at prices higher than are justified by the cost of production, and we are told that this is due to the fact that a high Tariff has been introduced. By all means, then, let us exercise as soon as possible our power to call for statistics showing the cost of manufacturing goods, and confer on the Courts the jurisdiction to enforce such requirements. That is a matter of extreme urgency. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that my honorable friends of the Country party will agree with me, and I am glad to note that one of them, by interjection, has already done so. Measures of the sort to which I have referred, are of far greater urgency than the matters to which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has referred. I am prepared to agree to the House meeting not only every Tuesday as an extra sitting day, but also on Mondays, in order to have such measures passed. They are the kind of measures for which the people of Australia are looking. The people are looking to this Parliament to do something to  put down profiteering, but the Parliament is doing nothing. Not only is it doing nothing, but we have the Prime Minister telling us that we can do nothing - that the National Parliament is utterly helpless to do anything in connexion with the most important question that is affecting the minds of the people to-day. We can do something, and ought to do something. The matter is of urgency. It is within our power to do something, and surely honorable members are not going to agree to a proposal by the Ministry to alter the order of business on the notice-paper so that we may proceed with the consideration of the Estimates, in order to fill in time, when other questions of greater urgency await our attention. I for one enter my protest, and I propose to divide the House upon the question. I hope that other honorable members will take exception to the alteration of the order of business in this way. and that a majority will vote against it. </para>

            <para>- I have a distinct recollection of the honorable member dividing the House a little while ago on the very question of the urgency of the Estimates, and the necessity for this House taking control , of the finances of the country. I think the honorable member made that the ground of a vote of censure on the Government. He wanted them to discuss nothing but the Estimates. </para>

            <para>- I did not flay that the honorable member said it; I said he voted for it. He insisted that the one thing that this House must do was to restore its control over the finances of the country. He now ridicules the very idea of such a thing. The consideration of the Estimates, he says, is a waste of time. On the occasion to which I refer nothing was more urgent than the consideration of the Estimates. Now he tells us it is not urgent. A month later and it becomes of  no urgency - it is the least urgent matter on the businesspaper - and the honorable . member will have nothing whatever_to do with the consideration of the finances or the Estimates before the House. Which of these attitudes is the correct one? Either the honorable member was playing a part then or he is  playing  one now. Then it was &#39; &#39; yes &#39; &#39; for the Estimates ; now it is &#34; no &#34; for the Estimates. </para>

            <para>- If it is an honour, then he cs entitled to it. The honorable member for Wimmera is certainly one of the best friends of the Opposition. He has, of course, the rightto make whatever interjection he pleases. I merely point to the fact that the consideration of the Estimates a month ago was, in the opinion of the honorable member for West Sydney, of the greatest possible urgency, whereas to-night it is of no consequence whatever. A complete change has come over the scene. The Government are doing merely what every other Government have done since responsible government was established. They are exercising their right to control their own business, and put their measures before Parliament in the order in which they think they should be considered. </para>

        <para>Why does the honorable member propose to take this course? Does he for a moment imagine that, by anything which he may do with the Judiciary Bill, he will confer powers on this Parliament which are not in the Constitution to deal with the great question of profiteering. The honorable member knows better, in my judgment, and he is merely adopting this course as a means to upset the Government by a side wind. </para>

            <para>- Yes, we did; but the only motion of censure that has so far been moved in this Parliament was one which I had the honour of moving, and it dealt with the very matter about which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has spoken to-night, namely the failure of the Government to deal with profiteering. It dealt also with their muddling of the finances, and the way in which they controlled the wheat and other Pools. Speaking from memory, those were the three heads on which my motion of censure was based. When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> proposed that the House should go into Committee of Supply, the honorable member for West Sydney discussed, as he has done to-night, the power of the Commonwealth to deal with profiteeringunder the existing Constitution. We voted with honorable members in the Corner, as we naturally would, in order to shift the Government upon any consideration. I am perfectly frank in making that admission. The Government know it to be a fact. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for the Navy stated that when the honorable member for West Sydney was Premier of Queensland the cost of living soared in that State, but why will he not give us an opportunity to discover whether we have the power to deal with profiteering? There have been cases waiting for consideration by the High Court for months. The ex-member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has presented a petition against the continuance in this House of an honorable member who was returned by a majority of one vote. That case has been held over for months.&#39; But when the totalisator people were affected, the High Court was called together on the Monday and gave its decision on the Tuesday. </para>

            <para>- What I have said might be a little off the track, but I am very gladthat I got it in. Only recently I told the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in connexion with arbitration matters, that organizations that are content to wait the convenience of the Court are allowed to wait, and organizations that go on strike secure a decision from the Court earlier than do law-abiding citizens. The Estimates are always useful to mark time; but I am very anxious that the Government shall see what powers they have to prevent profiteering. Under the War Precautions Act they had complete powers, and if they are sincere in their professed desire to reduce the high cost of living, which is affecting the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, they should at least try how far their existing powers will permit them to go in the prevention of profiteering. If they are held up by the Court, they may learn that their powers are not as extensive as they thought they were. </para>

It is for the Government to show that they are in earnest in preventing the people from being robbed by the profits levied by the number of persons who now handle the goods that are consumed.

In reply to the interjection of the Minister for the Navy, I say that the money that we are spending on repatriation is benefiting the profiteer. Last week, I was present at the opening of some war service homes. The timber, bricks, and other material in those buildings had cost hundreds of pounds more than they should have cost, because of the exactions of the profiteer. </para>

            <para>- We shall assist the soldiers&#39; if we prevent the profiteer from fleecing them. At present, they are paying 50 per cent, more for their homes than similar buildings would have cost before the war, and that notwitstanding the fact that we produce our own bricks and grow our own timber. It is for this reason that we desire that the power shall be given to the High Court, or some other authority, to deal with the profiteer. I am pleased that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has called the attention of the country to the fact that the Government is neglecting its duty by allowing the profiteer to continue in existence. Almost every item of foodstuffs and clothing has increased in price by nearly 50 per cent, since this Government was returned to power, and Ministers have done nothing to prevent it. </para>

          <para>. - I rise to create a few more laughs on the Government benches by opposing the proposal of the Government to transfer to a lower position on the business-sheet an important measure like the Judiciary Bill by an amendment of which we might be able to deal with the question of&#39; profiteering which has been agitating the public mind almost -since the commencement of the war. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has repeated the argument used by other members on the Government side that this Parliament has no power to do what is proposed. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">The Judiciary. Bill provides an opportunity of getting the power. It is upon this very question of profiteering, and not upon the delay in dealing with the Estimates, that the party on this side made a motion of censure upon the Government. If at election time it was necessary to deal with profiteering, it is much more necessary to do so now. Every day the prices of commodities are rising. As the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> has pointed, out, we have, in connexion with the Repatriation scheme, made provision for erecting soldiers&#39; homes, and each day that we delay dealing with the profiteer must mean the expenditure of more money for this purpose, because of the capitalistic interests continually raising the prices of building material. Perhaps the Government realize that by a specific amendment to the Judiciary Bill we could test whether Ministerialists were earnest in their assertions that they wished to deal with the profiteer. If the Government wish to prevent the masses of the people being pushed lower and lower down the economic scale on to and even below the bread line until something very serious happens, they must take some measures to cope with this problem. &#39; Here is their opportunity. We have heard speeches in regard to industrial unrest and the seething discontent in the rank and file of the Labour organizations. What but profiteering and the resultant high cost of living is responsible? Each day the wages of the workers diminish in purchasing power. As men sink lower in their economic status the discontent becomes greater, and unless conditions are improved this country must expect serious trouble. Even one of the lower animals will fight when it is hungry; will man do less? Honorable members on this side would be unfaithful to their election pledges, to the trust which the people reposed in them, and to the dictates of humanity and common justice if they did not make a protest against the action of the Government in cavalierly pushing into the background a measure that would enable them to do some of the things which they told the people they would do. I admit it would be impossible to provide in the Bill for the shooting of the profiteer, but it would be possible to embody in the measure sufficient power to check his depredations. </para>

          <para>.- It must be at once apparent to any honorable member that the only purpose that the Government desire to serve in changing the order of business is the wasting of time. Having been caught with no business ready to be proceeded with they are adopting the tactics often resorted to by Governments in the past of throwing on the table old Estimates, the votes in which have been almost exhausted. They ask honorable members to discuss the Estimates, not one line of which can be altered, because the money is already . spent. The thing is a sheer piece of humbug and sham, and it is about time the country realized what a humbugging sham and make-believe the present Government are. They came into power with a great flourish of trumpets. They were going to kill the profiteer. They were going to wipe out all those things that were oppressing the people, and make Australia safe for Democracy. Now comes the humbugging sham of it all, that they ask us to discuss Estimates  when  the money has all been spent, and propose to take away from us the opportunity of discussing the Judiciary Bill, under which we could give power to the High Court, by reinforcing it and  extending  its operations, to go into various businesses, investigate them thoroughly, make those conducting them produce their figures, and show their profits, and what it cost them to produce an article, what they are selling it to the consumer for, and what huge bank balances and profits they are building up for themselves. The Government make no attempt to do this, or to carry out their election pledges, or the platform which they asked  the  people of this country to give them a mandate to put into effect. They ask us to postpone the very measure under, which they might get the power to do the things which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said the Government  would do. It is about time his sham and hypocrisy was exposed to the people. We should show the people that the Government have no intention to deal with profiteering except to bolster up and make more safe and secure the position of the robber and profiteer in Australia. The members of this House should not be caught with that humbug and sham on the part of the Government. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw them in deference to your instruction, sir. The only other way by which I can express my feelings towards the Government is to say that they are sitting on the Treasury bench under false pretences. They obtained a majority in the House by telling the people that they were going to deal with profiteering, and lift the great burden that was pressing the people down. We find them to-day neglecting to do this, and postponing the very measure that might give them power to do it. I hope the opportunity will be taken almost immediately of having a vote on this question, so that the people may know where the members of the House stand on it. I strongly support the view put forward by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline></para>

I am also surprised that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> who did all he could only a few months ago to prevent this Parliament having the power to deal with profiteering, should be so concerned about the matter now. </para>

            <para>- It is a good old gag, and a true old gag. But for the efforts of the honorable member for West Sydney and others of the Labour party who associated themselves with him in opposition to the referenda proposals, they would have been carried, and this Parliament would have had the power to deal with the profiteer without question. But because the proposals came from this side of the House they did their utmost to prevent this Parliament having the power which they now say it ought to &#39; have. They did mot do this because they believed that the proposals were ineffective to deal with profiteering, for many of them had already made every effort to secure the adoption of those amendments on previous occasions; but they turned their backs upon what they had done then, and on the last occasion they opposed those proposals which before they had declared to be necessary to give this Parliament power to do the things which they now say ought to be done. </para>

The time to have taken exception to those measures was then; but I did not hear any objection at the time. It has been suddenly discovered that the chance of having a full-dress debate upon the pet subject of the honorable member for West Sydney has been missed. I hope we shall be able to get on with the Estimates. I can still hear the protests of honorable members opposite that the Estimates come to us too late. I am also a little surprised at some of the members in the Ministerial corner, who scorn to consider so small a proposition as onesixth of the Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

            <para>- One can take witha grain of salt the protestations of thehonorable member. Despite his past record we now see him at the head of theenemy, leading the profiteers. Of course, I recognise that the Government occupy a very unhappy position. I can quite appreciate their uneasiness. Since the opening of this Parliament they havebeen defeated no less than four or five times, and they would have been beaten even more frequently but for the action of certain members of the Country party. I can readily understand, therefore, thai Ministers have very little time to devoteto the preparation of Bills. They are too busy. Only last week notice was given of their intention to deal with noless than seven measures. Mention was: made of an amendment of the Arbitration Act - a long-looked-for measure. Then, a Bill has been promised to finalize thesecret negotiations for dealing with: </para>

          <para class="block">Papuan oil. I will not discuss the merits of that question at this juncture. Another promised measure is an Indemnity Bill, which is not yet ready, and which has probably not even been drafted. There is also a Bill to authorize the creation of a Bureau of Science and Industry, which has been held over for the past two years. There is the much-mutilated Repatriation Bill, which has been forwarded from the Senate with the compliments of that branch of the Legislature. Perhaps the Government, after a whip of their party, do not feel that they are in a position to do very much. They may be anxious to avoid&#39; the consideration of any measure of a contentious character. Certainly they have done surprisingly little to give effect to the many pledges which they recently made to the people. Although the members of the Country party have saved the Government on many occasions, I have not the slightest doubt that the time will come - and probably before some honorable members expect it - when their small majority will disappear, and they will go out of office. It is because of their uneasiness that they are not ready to proceed with business, and that they now wish to put before us Estimates for the financial year which lias almost expired, much as a person throws a bone to a dog in order to keep its attention off something else. </para>

          <para>.- There are two questions of paramount importance which should have engaged the attention of this House long ere this. These concern industrial unrest, and an amendment in the Arbitration Act, and profiteering, and the promised measure to deal with it. We doubted the sincerity of the Government when the appeal was made to the electors in December last, and that doubt has been justified by the attitude of the Government towards profiteering, especially since the elections. We find that they are prepared to place the promised measure lower down on the businesspaper, although it is a measure that would doubtless have some control over the present unjustifiable inflation of price&#39;s. I represent a constituency composed almost entirely of members of the working community, and I can say that they are beginning to despair, owing to the circumstances of their life at the present time. They recognise that the present Government can offer them no hope for the future - that no attempt is being made to deal with those individuals who are reducing the life of the country to a dull, sordid, soulless existence. It is about time that <inline font-style="italic">we,</inline> as the custodians of the welfare of the people, recognised where our duty lies to those people who are suffering so much at the present time; but profiteering goes on, and the toll exacted by the barons of industry from the unprotected people is represented by big dividends. The interests of the great working community ought to be protected, and we on this side of the House, without any desire to embarrass the Government, are endeavouring to impress on them the necessity there is to deal with those people who are making such inroads on the welfare of the public. </para>

The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> generously offered to the Government to draft a Bill which would be within the existing powers under the Constitution, and enable them to deal with the profiteers, who are the greatest traitors any country could have. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in a speech made at a National Federation meeting in the Atheneum Hall, Melbourne, stated that the problem of the profiteer was a baffling one,; but no attempt has been made by the Government to solve the problem. On the contrary, there seems to be a systematic desire on the part of the Government to protect profiteers in their successful efforts at exploitation. </para>

            <para>- Under our economic circumstances, that is the wonder. I represent a working constituency, and as one who has worked at the bench, I have been subject to such hardships as are now being suffered by the people at large. It ill-becomes any honorable member to . do anything that will defer the day when something can be done to remove the disabilities created by the profiteer. The protest made by the honorable member for West Sydney and others is well justified. The Government will have tobe taught their duty; and we on this side would fail as representatives ifwe did notcall the attention of the country at large to the fact that little or nothing has been done to remove the conditions which allow the great commercial and financial interests to extract further profits from the community. I hope that honorable members opposite will see the necessity for immediate action, and will be able to say, when they are called upon to give an account of their stewardship, that they did all in their power to relieve the present situation as it affects the masses of the population. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> may argue that he has no power to deal with profiteering ; but the honorable member for West Sydney states that, to his knowledge, the difficulty can be overcome; and there is no reason why his assistance should not be accepted. There is no reasonable excuse for allowing this matter to remain in abeyance, and we ought to ascertain at once how far we can render the necessary assistance. </para>

            <para>-I am putting my own interpretation on his speech. The honorable member for Illawarra, like the Minister, was at one time on this side of the House. We were lod to believe that they parted with the Labour party over the conscription issue; but it appears now that they have gone over to the other side on other questions as well, for we now find the honorable member for Illawarra apologizing for a number of things that were once anathema to him. He and the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> have, it appears, run away from their life-long principles. However, I will leave that aspect of the matter now, for the simple reason that the honorable member for Illawarra is not in the House. As regards the Judiciary Bill, I have every sympathy with what is proposed to be done; but there should be scope to deal with many other matters, including one in which I have a particular  interest, to sec if something oau be done for many struggling  settlers  in my electorate. I desire to see jurisdiction given to the High Court in regard to the extension of the moratorium. </para>

            <para>- I submit to your ruling, sir; but with all deference repeat that if, in connexion with the Judiciary Bill, I may touch upon its relevance to the subject of profiteering I should be permitted to mention also its relation to the matter of the extension of the moratorium. I marvel every day at the fact that many unfortunate people are able to live at all. They aTe only existing. The Government say they have no power to deal with profiteering. The honorable member for West Sydney has offered to draft a Bill. Why do not the Government accept that offer? If the honorable member should fail, the Government ought to be only too glad to have given him the opportunity to demonstrate his failure. The honorable member for West Sydney not only undertakes to draft the Bill, but will guarantee its validity before the Courts. That is both a fair offer and a fair challenge. The honorable member for Illawarra remarked to-night that honorable members on this side had prevented the  taking of an affirmative vote in connexion with the last referendum, and that if a &#34;Yes&#34; vote had been recorded the Government would have done certain things by this time to stop profiteering. At a meeting of representatives of the Housewives Association, about a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister is reported to have used these words in answer to the question, &#34;&#34;What would have been done if the referendum was carried ?&#34; &#34;By this time,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> &#34; we would have had a Commission appointed in order to make these inquiries.&#34; It would appear that all the Government proposed was to add another to the list of Commissions which are merely tampering with the subject to-day. There is a body known as the Fair Prices Commission. Any one, upon reading the evidence given before it, must be convinced that it is only tinkering with profiteering and the cost of living. There is evidence every day to prove that profiteering is rampant; yet the Prime Minister said that what the Government would have done, had the people voted &#34;Yes,&#34; would have been to appoint a Commission. </para>

            <para>- I am going upon thereport of the Prime Minister&#39;s remarks. If the only outcome of the referendum was to have been the appointment of another Commission, nobody should be sorry now that the &#34; No &#34; vote succeeded. This House is to meet on Tuesday next. Why this extra day? It is a mere blind to make the people think we have something important in hand. Why should this House proceed with such a farce ? Why should honorable members be called upon to meet a day earlier, if the Government have no more important business to place before them than the consideration of Estimates, the money involved in which has been practically all spent? The opportunity to expose the Government as the friends of the profiteers has been too long allowed to pass. Of course, the Government will not deal with profiteering, for the reason that they would not have been back on the Treasury benches to-day but for the helpof the campaign funds provided by the profiteers.
