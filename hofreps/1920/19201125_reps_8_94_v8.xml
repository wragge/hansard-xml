I am informed that the third reading in the Council will be taken to-day, and that no opposition is anticipated. The Commonwealth roll will be the foundation of the joint roll, which it is proposed shall be utilized for the purposes of the State general elections, to be held, it is understood, during the earlier part of the next year. </para>

                        <para>- I wish leave to move a motion. Recently the House referred to the Public Works Committee a matter of very great urgency. The Public Works Committee Act makes it imperative that the Committee'sreports shall be presented to Parliament, but as it is impossible for the Committee to present its report on this subject before the Christmas adjournment, I desire to obtain the formal permission of the House to present it, in the first instance, to the Governor-General. It will, of course, come before Parliament directly we re-assemble. </para>

                            <para>- My attention  has  been drawn to this unfortunate occurrence. We have had the greatest difficulty in obtaining sugar from abroad, because there is a world's shortage of sugar. We have, however, endeavoured by every means in our power to obtain sugar, recognising how much an ample supply of it means to the comfort and convenience of the citizens, and remembering also that we have a great fruit-growing industry whose prosperity largely depends on the securing of adequate sugar supplies. Those from whom we have bought the sugar, however, have absolutely declined to repack it in 200-lb. bags. We had either to take the sugar in such packages as we could get it in, or not buy it at all. We have offered to the wharf labourers in South Australia every possible additional assistance for the unloading of the sugar, and are prepared to pay the extra cost of it; hut so far we have been unable to get the unions to agree to take the sugar out of the ships. </para>

                                <para>- My attitude in this matter is provincial, because I know that New South Wales is getting more than its share. I ask the Minister to make an extraordinary effort to get some of the excess supply in New South Wales for the people of Victoria. I can furnish him with the names of some men in New South Wales who have so much sugar on hand that they can afford to sell it at 5¼d. per lb. </para>

                                <para>- I have stated, on a great number of occasions, that the existing supplies of sugar in Australia are distributed <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> to every State. In addition, we are making special arrangements to purchase from outside Australia an extra supply of white- sugar in order to meet the requirements of the fruit season in all the States. A shipment of 5,000 tons of white sugar is due to arrive in Victoria at the end of this week or at the beginning of next week, and the whole of it will be made available for this State. In regard to the price at which sugar is being sold, all I can say is that we have pooled all freights, and are selling sugar at exactly the same price in every State. Of course, if a retailer in any portion of the Commonwealth chooses to sell it for less than the proclaimed price of 6d. per lb., it is his own affair. He is perfectly entitled to do so if he wishes to attract trade by that means. </para>

The Department for Works and Railways is only responsible for the work of construction in the Territory, and, of course, also for the management of a line when it is built. I hope to submit to the House a motion asking the Public Works Committee to inquire and  report  upon a specific proposal for a railway line; but, in addition to that, the Department has caused an inspection to be made of another line to the border of Queensland, and the information gathered in that way will be made available to the House.

The power to send for persons and papers was not even asked for or given to this particular Select Committee. In any case, however, no application has been made to me for permission for any officer of this House, or of any of the Joint Departments, to attend and give evidence before this Select Committee. The proper course is, not for an officer to apply personally to the  Speaker  for such permission, but for the Senate to make application to the House, as provided in the Standing Orders. The  Speaker  has not the power to give or withhold his consent to any officer giving evidence before a Select Committee appointed by either House. Neither has a Committee of either House the power to compel the attendance of a member or officer of this House without the consent or authority of the House itself. The proper procedure is laid down in standing orders 365, 366, and 374-  365. When the attendance of a Member of the Senate, or any Officer of the Senate is desired to be examined by the House or any Committee thereof (not being a Committee on a private Bill), a message shall be sent to the Senate to request that the Senate give leave to such Member or Officer to attend, in order to his being examined accordingly. </para>

He might refer his query to them, especially in view of the fact that his friends in that State are constantly protesting against the delay in this matter of the Federal Capital. I strongly suggest that the honorable member gets the whole of the New South Wales members who are sitting on his side of the House to approach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> direct, and so help us in regard to the building of the Capital. May I add, further, that I am just given to understand that a letter has already gone forward from this Government to the New South Wales authorities couched in the general terms of the honorable member's inquiry ? </para>

                            <para>- The bonus has been applied to all the lower-paid employees, although cleaners, under the award, were not entitled to a bonus. Their salaries were fixed at £182 per annum, inclusive of a previous bonus. Under the terms of the award, a bonus did not apply to the men who were receiving that wage; but, recognising the justice of representations that were made by some of the officers of the House that their wage of £182 was inadequate, I gave the additional bonus of £12. That is the position to-day. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not oppose the motion, but I take it that it means the we are to have an all-night sitting. For my own convenience, I would rather we continued our sittings over next week than sit all night on any occasion. I hope that we shall. have an opportunity to discuss the report of the Basic Wage Commission, which is one of the most important ever presented to this Parliament. It marks, I believe, a new era so far as wages are concerned. </para>

                                <para>- Unless we are given some indication of the nature of the business to be taken, I object to new business after 11 o'clock, when it is difficult sometimes to keep a quorum. I had the strongest objection to the proposal to erect the Note Printing Office in Melbourne, which was proposed a little while ago, but the motion was introduced unexpectedly, and was carried without debate, although the Government knew there was strong opposition to it. The matter referred to by the Leader of the Opposition involves an important principle. </para>

                                <para>- From the motion, it is obvious that the Government, if necessary, intend to bring forward new business after 11 o'clock, and that means sitting all night. In the light of my experience of one session in this House, and of the way in which business is conducted when we sit into the small hours, I consider that we might just as well move the closure and pass the business without debate. I am as well able, I suppose, as anybody to sit throughout the night, and I am prepared to do so if necessary, but I do not think it right, merely for the sake of getting into recess, to conduct our business during hours when men are not in a fit state of mind to give proper application to it. My suggestion is that, instead of having any all-night sittings, we should, if necessary, continue the session over next week. </para>

                            <para>. - I hope that honorable members on both sides will oppose this motion, which means that the Government, by means of an all-night sitting, will force all the business through. There is no immediate hurry, and, personally, I would prefer to sit for another fortnight rather than continue the business after 11 o'clock. These all-night sittings " take it out " of me, and other honorable members also; they may be all very well for the younger members, who regard them as fun, but they are not good for men who are getting up in years. If the Government are in any particular hurry to get into recess, I remind them that the Appropriation Bill is through, and they can, if they so desire, terminate the business at once. There are now only the carbide question and the basic wage question to consider; When the orders providing for the closure were before the House, we were told that they would have the effect of doing away with all-night sittings. </para>

                                <para>- I did not; but when it was passed I hailed it with pleasure, because I thought it would really do away with all-night sittings. It is the Government "hacks," who keep a quorum, on whom the hardship falls. When the " gag " was introduced into this. House we were told it would do away with too much talk; then there was a limitation placed on the speeches; and, finally, we adopted the "guillotine." The Government have all these powers, and if they want to use them, now is the time, rather than having all-night sittings, killing half of us. I hope the majority of members will not consent to new business after 11 o'clock, because it means a continuous sitting until we finish. </para>

                            <para>. - During my eight years' experience in this House I never remember a session when a similar motion was not adopted. Prolonged sessions are all very well for honorable members who can get to their homes every week-end ; but, for the sake of those of us who have to stay continuously in Melbourne, it is about time that a spurt was put on with the business. Last night it was almost the unanimous opinion of the House that we should proceed with the Murray Waters Bill, and put it through; and in my opinion the Government made a mistake in not taking that course. No matter what Government is in power, it is always the practice to sit longer hours at the close of the session in order to finish the business; indeed, this applies to every Parliament in the world. I am quite prepared to finish the business this week. I would much rather see new business taken after 11 o'clock, and sit on for a couple of hours. </para>

Last evening he said that the Country party in theState Legislature was going to put out the Lawson Government, but we know now that half of its members supported the Government. One of the most vital matters affecting, not only this Parliament, but also the men and women of the country, is the report of the Basic Wage Commission, which the Prime Minister has described as a revolutionary one. </para>

                                <para>- I do not wish : to discuss it; but what the Prime Minister says about it is a reason for not carrying the motion. The. report involves such fundamental changes that the full attention of the House should be given to it; but if we are to have a continuous sitting until all the business before us is disposed of, honorable members will not be in a condition to properly discuss this or any other matter. I have had a fair experience of all-night sittings. Generally 75 per cent. of the members of the House are then absent from the chamber, though within call to apply the " gag," if necessary, and Ministers and others lose their tempers because of the strain upon them. Members have neither the inclination nor the ability, under such circumstances, to discuss matters properly. There is no reason why we should be in a hurry to adjourn overChristmas. The people, especially those particularly concerned in the basic wage report, will not thank us for rushing through business to shut up Parliament for six months, if not for longer. </para>

                        <para>Mr.CONSIDINE. - I predict the future from what I know of the past. The Appropriation Bill having been passed, the Treasurer will not have to ask for Supply until the middle of July. The Prime Minister is going to London to attend the ImperialConference, and I understand that there are to be some great changes in the Cabinet. All this means a protracted recess. Therefore, while there are great problems to be settled, involving the vital interests of the community, I shall not consent to the recess, especially as conditions are getting worse and worse outside. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's contention would be perfectly sound as applying to an ordinary motion, but the obtaining of the leave of the House to move a motion cannot override the requirements of the Standing- Orders in regard to motions: for the suspension ©f the Standing, Orders.. If a motion for the suspension of any standing order or sessional order, or orders appears on the notice-paper, :t is sufficient if it is carried by a majority of voices, but in this case, as no notice of intention to move  foi  the suspension of the Standing Orders appeared on the notice-paper, the right honorable gentleman's motion could only be agreed to if supported by an absolute majority of honorable members. Leave ie not required te move a motion to suspend the Standing Orders. The requirements of the Standing Orders are that, unless notice has been given of the intention to move such a motion, it can only be carried by an absolute majority of the House. </para>

                            <para>-  I wish to make a personal explanation in reference to the regrettable incident which has just happened. I may say that I was stung into anger by what I considered was an unjust slur upon the. action  of  the Leader of the Opposition, another honorable member, and myself in voting with the Government. When the honorable member for Maranoa called us "Bats," "it was to me an offensive remark. I replied immediately that the honorable member was a liar. However, the fact, that- he was- not telling the truth did not justify my use of an unparliamentary expression. I regret what I said under the sting of anger. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a measure of considerable importance to the Commonwealth. 1 regret that, owing to the long period of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, it was only yesterday when the final signature was- placed upon the documents. We took immediate steps, however, to bring the Bill before Parliament ; and the State Parliaments, apparently, are acting with equal alacrity, if an indication may be taken from the fact that I have just received word from South Australia to the effect that the Bill which it is necessary to pass through the Legislature of that State was agreed to by the Legislative Council last night, and will be submitted to the House of Assembly to-day. Honorable members are aware that in 1914 an agreement was arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, with a view to regulating the distribution of the waters of the Murray, and for the- construction of certain works so as to secure and insure irrigation and navigation, and for the appointment of a Commission having denned powers under the agreement. The agreement was signed- on the 9th September, 1914. The Federal Act ratifying tha agreement was assented to on 15th November, 1915 j and on 31st January, 1917, the Commission was constituted and set out upon its- work.. The object of the original agreement was, among other things, to provide for the construction of certain works on the Murray. These' included the building of a large storage basin on the Upper Murray, the construction of a storage basin- at Lake- Victoria for the supply of South Australia, and for the construction of thirty-five locks and weirs. Nine of these latter are situated between Wentworth and the Murray- mouth. </para>

                            <para>- Seventeen of the locks and weirs- are situated between Echuca and Wentworth. Then there are nine other locks and weirs which were- to be erected either on the Murrumbidgee or on the Darling - the decision regarding the sites to be left to New South Wales. That State decided to put those nine looks on the Murrumbidgee. The works, altogether, were estimated to cost £4,663,000. That was an estimate made in of about 1913, and,, of course, it will not hold good- to-day. .The- agreement was that each of the States should contribute £1,221,000 and the Commonwealth £1,000,000. The liability of the Commonwealth was limited to that sum 0f £1,000,000. But if there was an excessive expenditure in connexion with the construction of the works, the burden of that excess was to fall in equal proportions upon the three contracting States. The Commission was constituted by a rep.resentative of the Commonwealth, acting as President, and of one representative from each of the.- three contracting States. The decision of the Commission upon all matters, except those which were purely formal, had to be absolutely unanimous. First of all, the contracting Governments were required to submit a general scheme of works to the Commission, and the Commission was either to approve thereof, or to suggest' amendments. The scheme of South Australia was for the construction of the nine locks and weirs apportioned to that State. The general scheme coming before the Commission from Victoria and New South Wales was for- the construction of. the locks and weirs in the respective areas to be controlled by those States. When it came to a matter of actual construction, each State, under an obligation to construct any particular work, would submit to the Commission the plans and estimates therefor. The Commission would them authorize the works, or make suggestions for- their, improvement. The scheme- would- next go back to the individual State, and the States would afterwards go ahead as the constructing authorities. The money is contributed by the various contracting parties, and the constructing authorities are paid by the Commission for the works carried out. The power of employment of all workmen has resided with the State constructing authorities, in each case. I have been President of the Commission, for some time; and I wish to  Bay  that we, as a Commission, realizing the great importance of this work, did all we could to press forward with its expedition. We achieved some considerable success - so much so that we had considered all the general schemes. We approved of and authorized the construction of the Hume reservoir, at a cost of about £1,639,000. The portion of the work upon the Victorian side of the- river was to be carried out by the Victorian  constructing authority ; and the New South Wales part, on the New South Wales side, was to be carried out by the constructing authority of that State. We accepted tentative proposals to expedite this matter, and already, I am happy to say, considerable work has been done in assembling material, organizing the plant, and making provision for the actual conduct of the work. We authorized also the Lake Victoria scheme, and considerable work upon that project has been in progress. The South Australian Government undertook some of the work themselves, and provided for the remainder to be done by contract. We authorized the Victorian Government to proceed with the Torrumbarry scheme. A good swing forward was achieved upon that task; and matters were going well when, unfortunately, labour troubles arose and interfered with progress. We, as a Commission, also authorized the construction of .locks No. 2, No. 3, and No. 9, in the lower portion of the Murray. In addition, the surveys of the river have been proceeding all the time. This work, I might say, requires the most minute and accurate care; we cannot take risks with respect to these great projects. I have to record, further, that when the work of the Commission was started, the Blanchetown weir, in South Australia, was already in progress. The South Australian constructing authority had already made considerable progress in the construction of that work, but, unhappily, for three years it was blocked owing to the conditions existing in the river. However, lock gates, and what are known as the navigable pass, have been constructed; and the South Australian Government were forging ahead with the construction of a coffer-dam to  complete the whole of the weir across the river, when, again unfortunately, industrial troubles intervened, and blocked further progress. </para>

                    <para>It will be seen by my brief review of the works put in hand, that we were making good progress; but, at the same time, the practical experience of the working of the Commission, and of its relation to the State constructing authorities, was such that the Commonwealth Government were not satisfied that we had an organization most fitted to drive alan? with these great national projects., smoothly, and without conflict of authority or outbursts of industrial troubles and consequent delays. In the first place, the method of authorizing .the works was unsatisfactory because each State had to originate its own scheme. Then that scheme would be sent along to the Commission. </para>
                    <para>At this stage, I wish to pay a tribute to the engineers who were my colleagues upon the Commission.After having worked with them, and not forgetting their obligations as representatives of the States concerned, I desire to say that there could not have been more harmonious co-operation displayed by a more disinterested party of men. They are all gentlemen of considerable ability and skill in their professions. They have readily accepted suggestions one from the other, and. have been able to furnish very sound advice to the constructing authorities. But, as I have indicated, the various plans for works had to come to us, and then, after authorization by the Commission; it was left to the States to carry out those works. There was no means by which the Commission could get a driving force into the works to expedite construction. That wa's a most serious defect. The next most serious defect was that where there is an industrial dispute with any of the State constructing authorities, there is always a hitch and subsequent difficulty in effecting a settlement and insuring further progress. The most striking instance in regard to this matter has been afforded at the Hume Reservoir. There, as I have already indicated, the work on one side of the river is being carried out by the New South Wales Government, and, on the other side, by the Victorian authorities. The conditions existing on the New South Wales side are consistent with those required by the laws of that State ; while on the Victorian side another set of conditions exists. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member should be fair. I do not think he ought to introduce comments of that nature in connexion with this measure. Besides,, it should be mentioned that the conditions existing on the two sides of the Hume job are different, and, thus, the disparity in wages is, to some extent at any rate, offset.  There has been a strike which has held up work on the Torrumbarry weir just at a time when the state of the river was most favorable for proceeding with construction. In South Australia, through Failure to settle the industrial dispute which arose, there has also been a block. It seemed. to the Commonwealth Government, therefore, that there should be, in regard to these works - seeing that tl.ey are one distinct whole - one defined control. There should be the one authority having the oversight of the whole of the industrial conditions, and all the workmen in all the areas ought to be placed on a similar footing. </para>

                            <para>- These matters came before the Government, and we decided to place the position before the different States. At the Premiers' Conference held in May last we pointed out the difficulties of the situation, and the States agreed to six resolutions, which I shall presently specify. I have been speaking, so far, only of those things which will be affected by what we propose in this measure to-day. Under the agreement, as I stated at the outset of my remarks, the Commonwealth is at present liable for £1,000,000, and for that sum only. When the agreement was made, the Commonwealth took upon itself responsibility for practically one-fourth of the expenditure. We undertook to be liable for. £1,000,000, and each of the States agreed to a liability of £1,221,000. The States, however, were able to show us that, owing to the great advance in the price of material and the increased cost of labour, the constructional work could not possibly be carried out at the rates estimated in' 1914, and that,'  there-fore,  our contribution of £1,000,000 was inadequate., _ In , reply, we said to them,  We are prepared to join with you as a fourth partner, and to bear our proportion of the increased cost of carrying out these works." That is the first variation of the original agreement. We considered that we were entitled, as one of the contributories, to ask that the work should be carried out more expeditiously, and that a more effective control should be exercised. </para>

                            <para>- Under the original agreement the intention of the contracting parties was that so far as was reasonably practicable the Lake Victoria works should be completed within four years; the Upper Murray storage works within seven years, and all the remaining works within twelve years. Owing to the delays that . have occurred, and the adverse conditions which have been encountered, that is no longer possible. The States have agreed to delegate to this Parliament power to set up a Federal tribunal to settle industrial disputes, and, as provided for in clause 6 of the agreement, the necessary legislation conferring upon us that jurisdiction will be passed by them. The works, on completion, will be handed over to the various contracting States. All the works below Wentworth will be handed over to the South Australian Government; the Murrumbidgee works will be controlled by New South Wales, and there is to be a mutual agreement between Victoria and New South Wales as to the control and operation of the "seventeen locks along their boundaries. No alteration is being made, however, "in the original agreement as to the basis of the distribution of water. </para>

                    <para>The general purpose of this new arrangement is to endow the Commission with greater authority; to assist on the financial side and to remove the obstacles that are retarding the progress of the -work so that as soon as possible this great scheme may be brought into full fruition. I had often visited various spots along the Murray River before I took charge of the Department and  became  President of the Commission, but it was not until I had to make a close study of its conditions that I realized what this great stream meant to Australia. It has enormous possibilities, and the more one studies it the more one realizes how vast are its potentialities. The river, of course, has its limitations. It cannot supply more water than its catchment area provides, but experience has shown us how much can be done by the proper utilization of that which it does supply. The whole of this scheme has been carefully worked out on a scientific basis, and when completed should lead to an immense accretion of wealth and prosperity iu the part of Australia to which it relates. </para>

                            <para>- The resolutions to which I refer were subject to the approval of the Cabinets of the various States, and, as I say, they were found to be impracticable. In the first place, we are dealing with three States with diverse systems of land tenure. In the Murray Basin, there are large settlements like Mildura, and recently the Redcliffs Estate has been purchased, and is being made available. Then there are soldier settlements,  and also that at Renmark and others, all with different systems of land tenure. It is not as though we were starting a scheme for new country in which uniform conditions could be applied to all who were to benefit. In some of the localities, such as Kerang, instead of new lands being opened, the lands already occupied are given an assured supply, with gravitation instead of pumping from the river; the benefits arising from this scheme vary in different areas. In Victoria an enormous area has been settled under irrigation schemes, this State having done splendidly in work of the kind. Another practical difficulty was that it had not been decided into what localities the surplus water that this scheme will bring into being should be distributed, or what land would be resumed; that is a matter for future survey. Those concerned would know that at the moment their lands were resumed, they would get compensation only to the extent of the value from 1st July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., and it might be years before the resumption took place; and that was a difficulty which might affect development and also improvements. For those reasons a reconsideration of the resolution led to the conclusion that it would be unwise to embody it in the agreement. After all, it is still left to the States who have control of their own lands to decide how they shall be disposed of, and the value to be placed on them. It is a land problem for the States themselves to solve.. </para>

                            <para>- They are gone altogether; they were never in the agreement, but only in the resolutions passed at the Premiers' Conference. To sum up, the Bill provides for. the increase of the Federal subsidy, the control of design and construction by the Commission, with power to settle terms and conditions for all the employees in the river basin, and the setting up of a Federal Tribunal, if need be, by delegation- from the States, in order to settle disputes. The general object of the measure is to insure expedition in the carrying out of the work, and enable Australia as speedily as possible to realize the full benefits of this great river. </para>

                        <para>. - To a great extent I welcome this Bill. To those who have followed the work already done in connexion with this great scheme it must have appeared that the best interests of this country were being thwarted by the disorganisation that has prevailed since its initiation, owing, principally, to three different States dealing with the industrial question in three different ways. For many months there has been a cessation of work on the Victorian side because the men rightly refuse to work under- prevailing unfair conditions. The men employed on the New South Wales side were receiving some 2s. a day more than is paid to the men on the Victorian side, and this, very naturally, led to discontent and trouble. However, we are assured by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> - and from the little time I have been able to devote to the consideration of the Bill it would appear - that there will be an end of difficulties of the kind. All who realize the great possibilities of this work to Australia must welcome any measure which will have that result. In my opinion a comprehensive scheme of this kind should have been in operation from the inception of the work, for if ever there was a work which could be described as national, it is this. We have only to observe what has taken .place in the case of Mildura in order to appreciate the results of extensive irrigation. There is no doubt that when the proposed work is carried out there will be many Milduras along the river Murray, and, therefore, </para>

It is well that a work of this kind should be carried out under conditions which will secure uniformity - which will prevent discontent on the part of any men employed because they are not enjoying the same terms as are men who are working under a Labour Government. This, indeed, is the only reasonable way in which a work of this character can be carried on. . It is a work that affects Australia, and, therefore, it is the duty of the whole country to see that uniform regulations with good wages are applied. </para>

                            <para>- That applies everywhere. The municipality which has written to me thinks that the principle is wrong. I am putting this matter forward on their behalf, and I take it that the reply of the Minister is that the matter is not the business of the Commission, but is being left to the respective State Governments ; and therefore this Parliament cannot deal with it-. I take it that the State Governments have the power to resume land. I know that the New South Wales Government has such power. </para>

Members would be amply repaid by a visit to the districts concerned, because they would then see the possibilities of the scheme, and what it means to the country. The Bill will, I think, assist the carrying out of the work, and for that reason I welcome it, hoping that this great enterprise will be pushed on. I know how construction has been hindered by the cessation of work, because of want of uniformity of conditions on both sides of the river. </para>

                            <para>- Not on this occasion. I am heartily in agreement with, the Minister on the general principles that he has outlined. Undoubtedly, under the old arrangement, when plans had to be sent by the State engineers for approval by the Commission, and then returned to the State Departments for the construction of the work, great delays occurred, and want of uniformity in the conditions of employment on both sides of the river also caused delay and dissatisfaction. It is to be hoped that, under the Bill, conditions will be established which will create a better feeling among the men engaged upon the construction works. The financial proposals of the Government are, I think, sound. I think that it is a good thing to provide that when over £125,000 is required in any one year the extra amount may  be  advanced by the Commonwealth. That prevents any of the States concerned making an excuse for not doing its share on the grounds of lack of finance. I am glad that the provision for the acquirement of land at its value in July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., was struck out. I understood that it was originally proposed for a term of 'five years, and, later, for a term of ten years. It was, however, a revolutionary proposal. Were effect given to it, a property valued at £5,000 in July, 1921. and worth £12,000 in July, 1926, could be resumed by the Government in the latter year at the lower figure, plus 10 per cent., even though the land were not needed for construction purposes. I do not say that it is unsound in principle to ask for some contribution from land-owners when the public money spent in a certain locality lias increased the value of property there, but inasmuch as that principle has never been applied in and about the capital cities of Australia, where there has been a huge expenditure of public money, I do not see why it should be applied in a rural district. Were the application of it universal, there might not be objection to it, but I object to its application in the first instance to country lands. </para>

                    <para>I hope that every effort will be made to expedite the construction of the Hume reservoir. Irrigation settlements are springing up all down the Murray valley, and irrigation is booming now .as it has never done before in this country. But while this is taking place, and every year a greater quantity of water is being drawn from the river for irrigation purposes, there is no more water going down the river now than there was years ago. I live within three miles of the Murray, and I saw that magnificent waterway in 1914 merely a collection of pools between sandbanks. In that year of drought it was touch-and-go with the Mildura-Nyah settlements. What little water there was left became so salt that some of the orchards there aTe still showing the effects of its use. A dam had to be put across the . river at Mildura to hold what little water there was trickling down the watercourse. Obviously, if we get another drought like that of 1914, now that the irrigation requirements of the country are so much greater, the position, will be ever so much more serious, unless something is done to conserve water. This need for conservation makes the construction of the Hume reservoir imperative. Australia suffers from droughts perhaps more regularly than any other country, and .we should try to conserve every drop of water that we can. It is over thirty years since the Chaffey Brothers, with a band of followers, settled at Mildura. They have blazed the trail in regard to irrigation, and Australia has had no better citizens. There is a great future in  irrigation, not only for fruit-growing, but also for the growing of fodder for stock. Some people talk about the possibility of there being an over-production of dried fruits, but I am not afraid of "it. I am satisfied that Australia can get rid of all it can grow with every drop of water it' has. But the completion of the Hume reservoir is an urgent necessity in the interests of the great settlements already established along the River Murray. It has been truly said that honorable members have only to visit the valley pf the Murray to be impressed with its possibilities; and I give a standing invitation to honorable members who care to make the trip to come along. I shall make all the necessary arrangements for them. </para>

                        <para>.- We ought to realize that a very vital alteration has been made in the agreement with the States, and that there is no longer any limit as to the amount of money the 'Commonwealth may be called upon to contribute in connexion with the River Murray irrigation and water conservation scheme. Under the original agreement we agreed to contribute £1,000,000 towards the completion of the necessary works, but now the amount we may be called upon to pay is indefinite. I do not think that the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> can say how much the scheme will eventually cost. </para>

                            <para>- But as each individual State is in the happy position of being able to charge rent for the land which is irrigated, it will be able to secure a revenue from the scheme, whereas the Commonwealth will get nothing directly, though it may do so indirectly. When the Commonwealth granted assistance to Tasmania to the extent of £500,000, that State was looked upon as the recipient of charity. Now the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia are to receive a present of at least £2,000,000. But I am not' objecting to that, because, if I were asked to say what national matters the Commonwealth ought to push forward, I would at once mention irrigation as one of them. I think the public of Australia ought to consider whether we are not spending too many millions of money on new railways, and not enough on irrigation. </para>

                        B. Chaffey, one of the pioneers of Mildura, pointed out recently that one of the great advantages of. irrigation settlements was the fact that the settlers have more social intercourse than is usual in country districts, and can help one another in time of trouble. This is impossible where one's- neighbours are 5, 15, or 20 miles away. I was pleased to notice the national outlook of the honorable members for Hume

                        because I am hopeful that when Queensland approaches the Commonwealth Government for a similar contribution for irrigation works and water conservation in south, central, and north Queensland, it will receive similar sympathetic consideration at the hands of the Treasurer and his colleagues. I quite agree with honorable members that there is an object lesson with which we all ought to become acquainted in the Murray Valley, and I hope to see irrigation in all parts of Australia, where it is required. At the same time, it was disconcerting to read certain remarks made by

                            <para>- Speaking of the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme, which cost the State of New South Wales over £5,000,000, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Storey</inline> said that the State had not been able to sell even half of the area already irrigated and made available, and he pointed out that when the Murray River scheme was completed there would be two huge schemes established, while apparently there were not sufficient settlers for one. It would certainly be deplorable if, after the expenditure of £8,000,000 on this new scheme, we were not able to find people to occupy the area irrigated. It is the duty of the Government of the Commonwealth to endeavour to induce settlers to go on to these lands, but where we are to get a  desirable class of settlers remains to be seen. Perhaps we shall need to have a more magnanimous outlook on the world, and not confine our search for immigrants to the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>- I agree. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Mcintosh, who was of great assistance to us on the recent trip to the Murray River, and who is a very able man, declares that he has no doubt about the matter, and that, . even allowing for a 50 per cent. reduction in the high prices at present obtainable for dried fruits, settlers engaged in this class of work on the irrigation areas will make a very good living. He has no fear that Britain will not take the whole of Australia's surplus of dried-fruit products, and he prophesies that by the time this irrigation and water conservation scheme has been carried out, even at a cost of £8,000,000, there will be at least 1,000,000 people earning a good living in the Murray Valley. Although I think there ought to be a limit in the Bill as to the amount of money the Commonwealth is to be called upon to contribute towards the cost of the work, I do not say for one moment that if the scheme costs more than £8,000,000, the extra amount which the Commonwealth would be called upon to pay as its share should be refused. What I claim is that we should have some idea from the Bill itself as to the amount of money which we shall be expected to furnish in the shape of a free gift to the States. I shall vote for the Bill; but I confess that, as a representative of a large State with a small population, I am voting for a gift to two of the most populous States of a considerable sum of money in the hope that when Queensland approaches the Commonwealth for a similar concession, it will receive the same sympathetic consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. It was one of the main reasons which induced me, originally, to enter into the scheme, and it is the reason why the other day we proposed to accelerate the work by standing in to the extent of about a quarter of the cost. It will be an immensely paying proposition for the Commonwealth, and if, at any time hereafter, the work should be rushed along by leaps and bounds, and the Commonwealth Treasury is embarrassed, the Government can always come to the House and put on the embargo suggested by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline></para>

                        <para>.- The Government are to be congratulated, both upon the original agreement and upon that which is proposed in this measure. When it is remembered that the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States concerned removed a vexed question which had almost threatened to prevent the consummation of Federation, we should not forget to offer our congratulations to the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> upon having been the means of bringing about a settlement, some five or six years ago. It was his intervention, as Prime Minister, with a promise on behalf of the Commonwealth to be responsible for the quota of £1,000,000 of expenditure, which removed the <inline font-style="italic">impasse</inline> that had existed for thirty or forty years. Whatever other titles to fame the right honorable gentleman may have, his contribution to the solution of the Murray River problem should be among the most lasting. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I take a different point of view from that of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> I regard this subject as one in which the Commonwealth, as a whole, is vitally interested. The money expended by the Commonwealth, being simply one-fourth of the total outlay, is sure to be amply repaid. The whole question of conservation of water in the Darling and Murray systems is a national matter in the truest sense of the term. I would support the appointment of a Commission to handle all the problems and projects arising out of those great water systems. Not only have there been considerable vexations and difficulties among the interested States in connexion with the control and allocation of the waters of the Murray from its source to its mouth, but there are problems arising in connexion with the Condamine and Dumaresq Rivers, on the border between New South Wales and Queensland. Because of the attitude of the New South Wales authorities during the past ten years, nothing has been achieved in the direction of securing conservation and irrigation. Settlers have agitated for it for a long while. The Queensland Government, six years ago, carried out an extensive survey which indicated that a huge reservoir could be constructed at comparatively .little cost, and provide for the irrigation of an enormous area, suitable for such purposes. However, those interested have not been able to get the New South  Wales Government to authorize a survey and an examination into the possibilities which lie on the New South Wales side of the Dumaresq. If a Commission had been appointed to enable the Commonwealth to intervene and take over all such schemes of conservation and irrigation, a great deal more would have been done in those directions. I was much impressed, when in Egypt, by reading the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Willcocks, that great engineer who carried to completion the construction of the Assouan Dam. In his book dealing with that enormous work, he remarks that it would have been well for the statesmen of Australia and South Africa if they had had the good fortune to be trained in India and Egypt, for the money which has been expended in Australia and South Africa upon railway construction would then have been' used for water conservation and irrigation projects, with the results that the railways would have been able to build themselves. </para>

                        <para>.- I also support the Bill. I have had an opportunity to inspect the irrigation schemes along the Murray, and I am convinced that the work there has been well done. Fortunately for Australia, and for the settlers themselves, there are excellent . men on the job. I do not think it would be possible to secure better officials than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hill</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcintosh,</inline> both in relation to the schemes themselves and with respect to the settlement of returned soldiers. I would like the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to bear in mind that Australia is extending its production of dried fruits 1 and citrus products to an enormous extent. I heard it remarked during the tour of inspection that the output would probably reach at least eight times the total of the pre-war figures. Supposing that the people of Australia can consume twice as much as before the war, there will still be left a huge surplus which will have to be exported. Prior to Federation, dried fruits from other parts of the world, more particularly from Greece, were coming into Australia at 2£d. per lb., and a protective duty of 3d. per lb. had to be imposed to encourage local (production. Although the cost of production overseas has risen, and the consumption of these products has increased very rapidly, I question  very much whether the world's parity will be anything approaching that which has been foreshadowed. It would be wise for the Government to try to make arrangements for preferential treatment with respect to our dried fruits imported into Great Britain. Otherwise, it may be disastrous to leave the producers to sell their output under the same conditions as prior to the war, when settlers were able to get only 2d. per lb. for their surplus products. </para>

                            <para>- There was no wine produced in the neighbourhood of the distilleries of which I speak. The surplus production of the fruit-growers was bought for 2d. per lb., and turned into a white spirit, about 70 per cent, overproof, which was subsequently sold to wholesale chemists and druggists, and winemakers, in various parts of Australia. The producers had to be content with the price offered by the distilleries, because there was no other market. There is no danger in the near future that the people who are being settled in large numbers upon these areas will be handicapped with a surplus such as is likely to render their labours unprofitable. But such a contingency could be entirely obviated if the Government were to step in. I urge them to make arrangements by which the surplus products of the returned soldier settlers shall find markets in other parts of the world at a remunerative price, even if the Commonwealth Line of Steamers has to be utilized for the carriage of the produce overseas to profitable markets. As the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has said, Queensland members support this measure. But we trust that, when we may be asking for the authorization of any similar project, which Queensland hopes to- be able to do - we long for irrigation and water conservation - the same cordial support will be given by honorable members from other States. </para>

I am afraid that there may be some debate on that motion, and that the time at our disposal for the consideration of the report of the Commission on the Basic Wage will thus be materially reduced. In the ordinary course of events, we shall not have more than eight hours in which to discuss that report, which is of greater economic importance to the workers of Australia than any other document that has ever been submitted to this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say whether or not that matter will be discussed at length, but I certainly object to any curtailment of the time at our disposal for the discussion of the question of the basic wage. It is all-important, and its consideration should be proceeded with without delay. </para>

                    <para>. - I am willing to accept an amendment of the motion relating to the prohibition of the importation of carbide of calcium, so that it will read that the importation of carbide of calcium into the Commonwealth shall be prohibited "for twelve months from date," except under licence. That will provide for the fixing of a permanent date. What I am anxious to do is to bridge over the period between now and the passing of the Tariff, when, if the House gives the necessary authority, we shall be able to deal with direct cases of dumping. </para>

                        <para>. -When speaking to the main question last Monday, I gave figures showing the value of the importations of carbide of calcium into Australia. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> then stated that in the early stages of the war there was a tremendous increase in the price. That statement does not agree with the importers' figures, as set forth in the Customs  returns.  Carbide of calcium was worth from £10 to £13 10s. per ton </para>

                            <para>- At all events, I object to any company having all its own way, particularly when it will have a monopoly. Before submitting this proposal the Government should have had an inquiry into the whole matter. In every case in which we have provided for the payment of a bounty, at least during the last ten years, we have taken steps to insure fair conditions for the employees engaged in the industry. We are giving the company concerned in this case an absolute monopoly of the business, and there is no proposal on the part of the Government to provide for the observance of fair and reasonable industrial conditions. We should impose conditions similar to those embodied in the Iron Bounty Act, the Wool Tops Bounty Bill, and other measures of the kind. I object to all save Government monopolies. </para>

I hope that the Minister, if he is entering into any agreement or contract with the company concerned in this case, will see that the employees are properly protected. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, however, was negatived by five votes to three, and the Government now ask for authority to proceed with the work. It will be necessary for me to give certain information to the House, inasmuch as conditions have changed considerably since the date of the report of the Public Works Committee. In the first place, the estimated cost of the line, instead of being as it was in 1915, £320,000, is now £750,000, but of that £94,500 is in connexion with the high-level bridge over the Katherine River, so that really the cost of the line, exclusive of that work, is £655,500. The reason for the increase in the estimated cost is furnished by the increased price of material, freights, and landing charges, railway rates and wages, the basic wage in the Northern Territory having increased by 40 per cent. It is proposed to construct the line with 60-lb. rails and wooden sleepers, on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, but constructed to carry a 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge. </para>

                <para>Extension from Mataranka to Daly Waters. </para>
                <para class="block">The line at present runs as far as the Katherine River, and this House has just now approved of an extension for 65 miles and 35 chains further south. The estimated cost of the line is £1,040,298 on a 4-ft. 8½-in. road, to be laid with a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. The estimated revenue is £27,000. The present is a proposal that the Public Works Committee shall inquire into a further extension of 95 miles, and the line, if approved, will adapt itself to any deviation that may be proposed at any time. The reports go to show that the further the line runs south the better it will pay, because it then will enter cattle and sheep country. If it be decided to connect with Queensland this extension will permit of that being done; it will also permit of the line running straight through the Territory as in the original proposal. There will be nothing to prevent connexion from either side. </para>

The line has already been carried some 200 odd miles into nowhere, and through some of the most God-forsaken country in Australia. So far as my information goes, it is now proposed to still further extend the line into the same class of country. </para>

                            <para>- I have had the advantage of many conversations with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Patterson,</inline> the contractor who constructed the telegraph line very much on the route that the proposed railway will follow, and I say that for the greater part of the distance there is practically no tableland at all. Towards the Queensland border, on what is known as the Barclay Tablelands, I believe there is some of the best pastoral country in Australia, and there is excellent country of a similar character on the other side approaching Wyndham. Following the telegraph line down, however, we go through " the Dead Heart of Australia " - practically all barren country. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member were to travel over the line from Darwin down he would see that there is not enough growth to feed half-a-dozen goats. I would heartily support a proposal to refer to the PublicWorks Committee a proposed line north from Oodnadatta towards Alice Springs, and through the Macdonnell Ranges, where there is excellent country. In the other direction, however, the conditions are exactly the reverse. The Public Works Committee will have all it possibly can do until Parliament meets again in dealing with one of the proposed lines, unless it contents itself with a perfunctory inquiry in Melbourne. I believe, of course, that the Public Works Committee will give us an excellent report, but to submit both lines to it at once is to impose an impossible task. If the line were taken from Oodnadatta north we would know we were going into country where some results could be obtained, but the proposed 95 miles of line leads to nowhere, as the Minister must admit. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed extension does not reach the point at which there is likely to be any controversy as to deviation. That question will not arise until Newcastle Waters is reached, and then I suppose there will be a battle royal as to whether the line should go towards Camooweal and Queensland, or take the direct route. Quite likely a good deal of what the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mc Williams)says</inline> is correct, but I certainly do not like the term " the Dead Heart of Australia." The term "dead heart " has been used because the interior appears to be a sandy desert. </para>

                            <para>- No, and I do not approve of the use of the term. In the northern Sahara the Arabs, by tapping subterranean sources of water supply, have turned what was an arid and sandy desert into a fruitful plain, and what can be done in any other part of the world can be done in Central Australia. There are vast subterranean supplies of water all over Australia, there being hardly any place where a supply of some kind cannot be obtained, either fresh, brackish, or salt. </para>

                            <para>- A gentleman associated with the Agricultural Department of New South Wales has a method for eliminating from bore water the so-called deleterious elements, thus making it useful, not only for domestic and stock purposes, but also for the fertilization of land. I am going to sound a warning note to South Australian and Western Australian members. The eastern and northern part of Western Australia has as much right to expect to be developed from the proposed transcontinental line as has the western portion of Queensland. Probably in time we shall have all the connexions shown on the plan, but it must not be forgotten that there are large areas in eastern and north-eastern Western Australia capable of development. At present thousands of aboriginals live there fairly comfortably. Should there ever be a proposal for departing from the north-south route, I shall be a bitter opponent of it. It is my belief that our vast underground supplies of water will make the interior fruitful. </para>

I remember that at school I was taught that the Mallee district in Victoria was desert country; but now that I am a man, I find that the finest wheat is being grown there.

                        <para>. - The railway has been made from Darwin to the Katherine River, a distance of 198 miles 54 chains, and we have approved of its extension to Mataranka,. another 65 miles. It is now proposed to ask the Public Works Committee to investigate and report on a further extension to Daly Waters, 95 miles further. From Daly Waters to Newcastle the distance is 90 miles. Our Railways Commissioner tells me that the advantage of extending the line to Daly Waters 'is that it brings it nearer to the main sources of live-stock, and to the rich lands of the Barclay Tableland, while the extension must form a part of the north-south through line or any line to be constructed through to Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- About 180 miles. It was estimated thirty years ago that the cost of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line by this route would be £1,735,000, or £5,876 a mile. Since then, however, the cost of labour has at least doubled, the price of rails and sleepers will be about three times as much, and general stores and material will probably be twice as expensive. It is proposed to construct this line so that it may be readily converted to the standard gauge. If 80-lb.  Tails  are used, the cost is estimated at £4,109,446, or £13,813 per mile, and if 60-lb. rails are used, the estimated cost will be £3,878,398, or £13,036 per mile. Numerous water-courses of considerable extent have to be crossed, and there will be 4 miles of high-level bridging. The line south from Darwin is a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line, but the earthworks and other construction are designed for easy conversion to a 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge line. The revenue is estimated at £16,000. As to the matter about which the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> asked, a preliminary inspection has been made from Maree into Queensland by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler,</inline> and the Prime Minister has promised that information regarding the territory will be obtained from practical men. </para>

                        <para>In view of the fact that the settlement of the questions in connexion with the disputed Ballaarat election was delayed for many months, and that the Ballaarat election of December, 1919, was declared ; null and void through official errors, this House is of opinion that some compensation should be made to David Charles McGrath, who,  by  reason of such official errors, was compelled to contest two elections, and, as a result of such official errors and of an additional election, was involved in much unnecessary but unavoidable expenditure for which the Government should make allowance. </para>

                            <para>. - (By <inline font-style="italic">leave)</inline> - I had intended to speak to the motion to which the House has just agreed. I quite agree that something should be done to compensate the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> for the unfortunate results of the Ballarat election in December of last year, and I rise simply bo suggest some lines upon which I think he might be compensated. There have been similar cases. The precedent of recouping candidates for the expenses involved in re-contesting elections has already been established., and both candidates at the Ballarat election have been recouped those expenses, but whereas in each other prior case the member eventually returned at the fresh election was out of the Chamber for about three months only, the present member for Ballarat was absent from this chamber for over six months. My idea is that the honorable member should be treated as the other cases have been treated up to the same period, namely, three months, but that in the circumstances it would, perhaps, be fair to pay him three months' salary, accounting for the difference between the three months' loss of salary the others had to suffer, and the six months' loss of salary he has suffered. </para>

                            <para>- They are the only people who do not suffer. I think that the case of the honorable ember for Ballarat would be substantially met if we paid him a sum of £250. That is the direction in which my mind is leading me at the present moment. </para>

                            <para>.- (By <inline font-style="italic">leave.)</inline> - It is unfortunate that the opportunity of ascertaining the sense of honorable members upon the proposal to pay the honorable member for Ballarat only three months' salary was not taken. The honorable member ought to be placed in as good a position as that of the gentleman who was declared wrongly elected in December last. He should be paid his salary right up to the time when the December election was declared void. Surely the person who ought to have been rightfully elected should draw his salary all the time. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members may recall the fact that I appealed against the election won by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn, upon which £5,000 was spent. In the little area bounded by Elizabeth-street, Bourke-street, Victoriastreet, and Spring-street, Melbourne, more postal votes were recorded than were recorded in the whole State of , Queensland at one election, or in the whole State of Western Australia in two. elections. In the High Court it was shown clearly that bribery and corruption had been used. I felt at the time that I was wronged by the sum of money paid to me' to recoup me for my expenses, and I feel certain that if the matter were left to the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby,</inline> whom I regard as a personal friend, he would say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> should have been placed in the position he would have occupied if the electors of Ballarat had been permitted to cast their votes. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath's</inline> case differs from mine. In my case bribery and corruption were rampant. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath's</inline> case the election was upset because of mistakes made by the electoral officers, which I hope will not occur again. I appeal to the Treasurer to be generous, and not to keep too tight a string upon the Treasury bag. The honorable member for Ballarat has been put to the expense of two elections, just as I was, and I do not think any honorable member or the public outside would object to his 'being paid the full six months' salary to which he would have been entitled had he been elected at the first election. I hope that the wisdom of the House will see that that is done. </para>

                <para>My reasons for desiring to introduce the measure indicated above are various. It is not that I feel that honorable members have committed a crime or done any wrong, or that they have departed from the procedure which is rightly theirs in passing the Parliamentary </para>
                <para class="block">Allowances Act. My main reason is that, since we have been elected by the people to manage the affairs of Australia, and conduct its destiny through the most troublous times in its history, following upon the greatest of all wars, we should be examples to the people. If the payment of the basic wage is to be made upon lines similar to those which we have followed in granting to ourselves increased allowances, where will Australia be? We cannot very well enjoin economy upon other sections of the community in view of our  own  actions. I believe that, for the sake of Australia, a better policy would be, instead of granting increased wages to all and -sundry, to agree, from one end of the land to the other, to accept exactly half the salary which each individual is now receiving. That would rapidly tend to lower the cost of living. The probabilities are that commodities would come down to a similar extent; and Australia would thus be left a margin with which to pay her huge obligations. If we give the lead to increases on all hands, we will be merely adding to the difficulties which are laid upon our shoulders as members of the National Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It gives me no pleasure to ask leave to introduce this Bill. I appreciate, as much as does any honorable member, the additional £400 a year, and I do not wish to represent myself as being the only member prepared to make a sacrifice. I have been receiving the additional allowance since it was passed, but, with the object which I have already stated, I am ready, if honorable members will join with me in passing this measure, to sacrifice it. The prestige of this Parliament would be greatly improved if, at a time like this, we made such a sacrifice. </para>

                        <para>- That is not correct. I gave up a larger emolument than that which I am now receiving in- order to enter this Chamber. When I came here I understood that the amount payable to honorable members was to be £600 a year. </para>

                <para>I am one of those who believe that the public are not the best judges of what a member of Parliament should receive. I think there is. some difficulty in the way of a member of Parliament, or any one else, establishing his own worth. A wise and independent tribunal, representative of all classes, should be able to recommend to the Parliament an amount that it would be reasonable for us to receive. </para>
                <para>The fact that I am submitting this motion when we are so close to the Christmas vacation is not my fault. The motion has been hung up for four or five mouths; but in the circumstances I desire to be as brief as possible. I have cast no aspersions on any honorable member, and have taken this action only because I do not consider that the Parliament acted wisely in deciding to increase the allowance. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In that way we have lost an hour and a quarter. When speaking earlier in to-day's proceedings, I expressed the hope that we should be able to devote at least four hours to the discussion of the report of the Basic Wage Commission before we adjourned at the ordinary time this evening; but, as it is, if we adjourn about 11 o'clock, as usual, we shall have been able to devote only an hour and a. half to the consideration of this, one of the most important reports that has ever been presented to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It was laid on the table of the House when the Prime Minister dealt with it on Tuesday last. I took a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington's</inline> memorandum from the table, and received a printed copy of the report from one of the messengers. In October last it was my privilege to introduce to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> one of the most representative deputations of trade unionists that has ever waited upon a Minister of the Crown in Australia. That deputation represented organizations that were prepared to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the redress of their grievances, and the Prime Minister promised that he would appoint a Commission as requested to inquire into the question of the basic wage. In support of my statement as to the representative character of the deputation, I think it only right to say who were present, and what organizations were represented by them. The carters and drivers were represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> Cheney, the engine drivers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Gibson, the Australian Workers Union miners by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Little,</inline> the tramway employees by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Jewell, the bootmakers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richards,</inline> the builders' labourers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> Smith, the brick pottery workers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair,</inline> the Commonwealth Clerical Association by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> C. Maher, the fuel and fodder employees by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> the storemen and packers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> Clarey, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barker,</inline> the clothing trades by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter,</inline> and the gas workers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Croft.</inline> There were, I believe, other organizations' representatives, and every one of them was of a Commonwealth character, and they represented over a quarter of a million trades unionists. The gentlemen whose names I have mentioned are the general secretaries of the organizations who have conducted many cases in the Arbitration Court, and their request to the Prime Minister was that such a Commission should be appointed. On the 30th October last year the Prime Minister delivered his policy speech at Bendigo, and a portion of that speech is quoted in the report of the Commission as follows : - </para>

                        <para>Tho intention of appointing this Commission was first announced by the Prime Minister, the Sight Hon. W. M. Hughes, P.O., in delivering the policy speech of the Government at Bendigo on the 30th October, 1919, for the general election of that year. The announcement was thus reported: - " If we are to have industrial peace we must be prepared to pay the price, and that price is justice to the worker. Nothing less will serve. We have long ago adopted in Australia the principles of compulsory arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes and of the minimum wage. The cause of much of the industrial unrest, which is like fuel to the fires of Bolshevism and direct action, arises with the real wage of the worker - that  i3  to say, the things he can buy with the money he receives. This real wage decreases with an increase in the cost of living. Now, once it is admitted that it is in the interests of the community that such a wage should be paid as will enable a man to marry and bring up children in decent, wholesome conditions - and that point has been settled long ago- it seems obvious that we must devise bettor machinery for insuring thu payment of such a wage than at present exists. Means must bo found which will insure that the. minimum wage shall be adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with the cost of living, so that within the limits of the minimum wage at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of the necessaries of life. The Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war; also how the basie wage may be adjusted to the present purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, . when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. The Government will, at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. Labour is entitled to a fair share of the wealth it produces. The fundamental question of the basic wage having been thus satisfactorily - because permanently - settled, there remain other causes of industrial  unrest  which must be dealt with if we are to have industrial peace. . ." </para>

I agree with the Prime Minister when he says that this question must be settled, and I leave it to the Government to honour the definite pledge given to the people of Australia that they would at the earliest possible date create effective machinery to give effect to the principles they profess. The report of the Commission is now in the hands of the Government, and I ask them to give effect to their recommendations - it is for the Government to decide. Was this only an election promise, like many ethers, made for the purpose of fooling the electors into voting for Government nominees? If that is the fact, let the Government say so, and the people will know exactly where they stand. Will they say, as the Prime Minister is alleged to have said - i - </para>

It was on Tuesday last that the Prime Minister told us that he could do nothing,  and he referred to the refusal of the increased industrial powers for which the Government asked. In his policy speech at Bendigo the Prime Minister did not base his attitude on that fact - he did not say that this basic wage would be given if the vote was in the affirmative. I see that <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> which is owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes, and is au alleged humorist paper, states that the </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members can please themselves. The members of the Commission were not consulted, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> says, the matter was outside the terms of their commission. Compare the Prime Minister's procedure on this occasion with his procedure in 1918, when he received a report on meat from the Inter-State Commission. Deputations waited on him at that time, not 'of consumers, but of selling agents, and, as a result of the protest made by the latter, the Prime Minister had no fewer than two other reports prepared before Parliament ever saw the original report. The right honorable gentleman did that because, in his opinion, the report was an unwise one. On the present occasion he did not ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> to call the Basic Wage Commission together and supply the information which was desired. The Commission was composed of seven gentlemen, three representing the workers, and three the employers. The employers' representatives were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> M. Allard, representing the Chamber of Commerce of Australia; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Harper, of Adelaide, representing the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> E. Keep, on the nomination of the Central Council of the Employers of Australia. The first two gentlemen resigned their position, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keep</inline> retained his till the finish. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Allard's  place was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morley,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper's</inline> place by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilfillan.</inline> The  President,  as I say, did not call the Commission together, but I can tell honorable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilfillan</inline> was in the lobbies of this House on Monday evening at the time the Prime Minister was asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> to give him further information. As honorable members know, my room is next to that of the Prime Minister, and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilfillan</inline> was in the lobby. Why were not the members of the Commission called together to give the ' Prime Minister the information he required? Six of the seven members of the Commission were in Melbourne. I know that Messrs. Cheney, Gibson, and Maher, the Labour members of the Commission, were here. I am informed that the Commission met yesterday morning, after they had furnished their report, but they were not called together to he asked their opinions on the subjects upon  which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> was asked to give his opinion. He was asked for a memorandum on the following matters : - </para>

The Prime Minister stated that the history of this matter goes back to 1907, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in what is known as the Harvester case, laid down a basic wage. In 1906 Parliament passed an. Act to provide that employers who were afforded protection by the Tariff should give fair and reasonable conditions to their employees, and should sell their manufactures at a fair price. It was alleged that McKay, of the Sunshine harvester factory, did not do that. The honorable member for Ballarat will bear me out in the statement that McKay shifted his factory from Ballarat to Braybrook to evade the Factories Act, as Braybrook was then in a shire. McKay was willing to take all the Protection he could get, but he would not give fair and reasonable conditions to his men. I have said that on the platform when McKay was present. I have said it at Richmond, Collingwood, Ballarat, and in this House. On an appeal to the Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins raised the wage of men to whom McKay was paying 5s. 6d. a  day to 7s.  a  day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins confined his figures to rent, groceries, bread, meat, milk, fuel, vegetables, and fruit, and the average of the list of nine house-keeping women came  to £1 12s. 5d. That expenditure did not cover " light, clothes, boots, furniture, utensils, rates, life insurance, savings, accident or benefit societies, loss of employment, union pay, books and newspapers, tram and train fare. sewing machine, mangle, school requisites, amusements and holidays, intoxicating liquors, tobacco, sickness and death, domestic help, or any expenditure for unusual contingencies, religion, or charity." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins allowed 9s. 7d. for clothing and the miscellaneous requirements just enumerated. Will any honorable member say that those items could be purchased for 9s. 7d. per week? According to the Commission- </para><quote>

It would seem to be a fair inference that the rent of 7s. included in the Harvester wage was that of a four roomed house in Sunshine in 1907.  . In 1914 the Commonwealth Statistician found that rent and food together constituted (speaking approximately) 60 per  Cent,  of the ordinary expenditure of a household, leaving 40 per cent, for clothing and miscellaneous.....

The  Deputy President  of that Court refused to re-open the matter upon the ground, amongst others, that it would involve his departing from the practice of the Court since its inception, and  His  Honour suggested that the representative of the' union should offer himself as a witness '' when the Commission or Board is appointed to make the much needed inquiry into the cost of living." </para>

                            <para>- Because there is no work to be done; the closing is not due to any industrial trouble. The Prime Minister has said that the industries of Australia cannot pay this living wage; but I say that no industry has a right to exist in the Commonwealth or anywhere else that cannot pay a living wage to the men engaged in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> in his memorandum, says of the conjugal conditions of the people that, of the total male wage-earners, 438,735 have never married; 90,617 have families the children of which are grown up; 69,174 are married but childless; 78,288 are married, with one child; 77,752 are married, with two children; the balance of husbands and children being 220,400. In any attempt at averaging, regard should be had to the fact that a man cannot keep himself and, a wife for what a single man could live on, and so much is required for each child. The basic wage that has been recommended does not allow for the saving of a great deal of money for the complete furnishing of a house. The Commission speaks of it as the amount required to keep a man, his wife, and three children in reasonable comfort. Will members say that our industries cannot afford to pay it? In Melbourne and in Sydney at the present time the building trade is brisk, and carpenters, plumbers, stonemasons, and bricklayers are all getting more than £1 a day. Of course, they are not employed every day in the year. </para>

Not in residential suburbs such as Toorak, South Yarra, Hawthorn, and Kew; but in the working-class suburbs like Richmond, Brunswick, Collingwood, and Footscray.

                            <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington's</inline> memorandum was made hurriedly. He himself said so. I maintain that there are more than the . 90 children which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> says should be allotted to every employee in Australia. But when we consider the enormous profits made by the manufacturers in comparison with the decrease in the purchasing power of the wages paid to the employees, no one will contend that the industries of Australia cannot pay higher wages than they are paying today. I. have taken the trouble to ascertain the output of the factories in Australia according to the latest statistical returns available, and compared them with the wages paid. The following table is most illuminating: - </para>

                    </continue><para class="block">

                    </para><para class="block">From 1913 to 1918 the wages have increased by £4,773,181, while the value of the output of the factories has increased by £64,192,858. These figures are supplied by the manufacturers themselves to the Statistician, and are not prepared at the Trades Hall, or by any representative of a trade union. The manufacturer may make misstatements about his income in order to avoid the payment of income tax, but he is not likely to underestimate the amount of the wages he pays or overstate the amount of production in his factory. He knows all the time that the Income Tax Commissioner may challenge his figures. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing,</inline> the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation, told the Taxation Commission the other day that he had secured information from every available source. Now let me take the other side of the question from the employers' own figures, as set out in the following equally interesting table : - </para><para class="block">The share which has gone to the manufacturer is quite apart from whatever he. draws in the way of remuneration for his services, as the wages of working proprietors are always included in the wages returns. While the _ wages of the workers have increased from 1913 to 1918 by £4,773,181, the share which the manufacturer has drawn has increased from £31-,547,199 to £41,192,477 in the same period. How, therefore, can it be said that the industries of Australia, cannot pay more wages? In this House we asked the Treasurer to supply information compiled from income tax returns to show how some people in Australia are building up enormous profits. We did not ask for the names. We suggested that the taxpayers might be designated by numbers, as had already been done in a return placed before the Victorian State Parliament. However, as we were told that the information could not be furnished, I have been compelled to fall back upon the figures which Six Alexander Peacock quoted in the Victorian Parliament in 1916, showing the profits made from year to year  by <inline font-style="italic">265</inline> taxpayers. I quote a few of these cases in the following table : - </para><para>Can any one tell me that these people cannot pay a living wage to the workers, that the workers have no right to live in decency and comfort, that this Parliament should adjourn without dealing with this matter, or that we are to tell the organizations which trust -the Arbitration Court for the redress of their grievances that we are prepared to shut up shop or look at a picture show, and not attend in the House for the purpose of dealing with a question so all-important to them? As a matter of fact, if it is found necessary, we  tough  to sit here every day right up to Christmas in an endeavour to give justice to the workers. </para><interjection>

I would like to see the employers fighting this case in the Courts; they certainly should pay that which has been decided to be a fair basic living wage. Though I am as strong a Protectionist as is any other member of this House, if the manufacturers in the Yarra district chose to fight this case in the Courts, I would vote to give them a dose of Free Trade rather than afford them Protection solely for the purpose of enabling them to sweat their employees. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that each workman's child under fourteen would be registered, and as the employer would be taxed so much for each employee, it would make no difference to him whether his workmen were married or single. My complaint is that this particular matter should have been re-submitted to the whole Basic Wage Commission, and not to the  Chairman  only. It was unfair to place on him the onus of answering in a few hours all these questions which are so important. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of the public servants, but of such organizations as the employees in the clothing trade, engine-drivers, gas workers, the amalgamated engineers, the builders' labourers. The other day I introduced a deputation of the last-mentioned to the Prime Minister. Their spokesman said they had been waiting for about four years since they had last secured an award from the Arbitration Court, and now they wanted a more speedy method of obtaining justice. They desired to come within the scope of the Industrial Peace Act, so that they might obtain a direct conference with the employers. As for the public servants, the Prime Minister said some days ago that he was going to make their wage £4 4s. per week. That is a matter for the Government to decide; but the conditions under which the public servants are working to-day are such as to have created seething discontent. The way in which the best of our public servants are dropping out and seeking better prospects in private spheres of activity constitutes a matter of grave concern. When we see employees in the Public Service dissatisfied, as they are to-day with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke's award, and claiming that under it they will be in a worse position than they were eighteen months ago, we must be impressed with the feeling that it is high time the Government considered the whole grave subject. </para>

                            <para>- And the Treasurer will say, I suppose, that that will ruin the country. When, during the discussion of the first Commonwealth Public Service Bill, I moved for the insertion of a clause to provide a minimum wage, the then Treasurer, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, said my proposal would ruin the country. This is a country which seems to stand an awful lot of ruin without being any the worse off for it. I now ask for consideration for those who have been waiting for years to secure justice through the Arbitration Court. Is it any wonder that the workers should become more and more restless, and be determined to obtain justice for themselves, when they learn how their toil is piling up enormous profits for the employers, while their share - owing to the ever -receding value of the sovereign - is getting less and less? In the annual report of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry for 1920, there is a return showing total issues authorized in respect of new and existing companies from 26th January, 1916, to 31st December, 1919, together with the purposes for which the issues were authorized. Honorable members will recall that during that period no company could increase its capital, and no new company could be formed without official sanction. During the period in question, the total issue of new capital was more than £111,000,000. Of that, nearly £63,000,000 was subscribed in cash; £12,500,000 was subscribed by the transfer to capital of reserves and undivided profits; while more than £36,000,000 was subscribed by the transfer of assets other than cash. Honorable members know full well that that last mentioned total largely represents goodwill. In other words, the £36,000,000 was water, and the workers of Australia had to make profits to provide dividends upon that capital, which really had no existence. Now the Government are trying to rush this House into recess without giving justice to the workers. I, at any rate, shall not permit that course without vigorous protest. I have quoted from the figures of the employers themselves. Let me now turn to the findings of a Nationalist Commission appointed by the late Holman Government in New South Wales to inquire into the enormous profits made by the coal companies of that State. The <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> from which I shall quote, has turned its attention to three typical cases, and the statistics are so interesting that I quote them in full, as follow: - </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> to the conditions under which the letter-carriers work in the Sydney Post Office. I was in the office the other day when 200 letter-carriers were working shoulder to shoulder in a room which has neither ventilation nor natural light. On the same floor there is a large room called the old despatch room, 110 feet by 40 feet, with a second floor, the third of that size., which has been standing idle for the past, five years. Surely there must be some gross mismanagement when men are herded together under such unhealthy conditions while there is so much space available. If those rooms were let they would, in such a situation as Martin-place, command a rental of at least £100 a week, and yet they are permitted to remain unused for years. </para>
