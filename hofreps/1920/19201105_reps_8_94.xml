              <para>and 2. No. The object of the War Service Homes Act is to provide returnedsoldiers and their dependants with the means whereby they may acquire their own homes. If successful applicants could apply at any later period for further assistance there would be no end to the activities of the Commission, and this point is closely related to the question of finance which, as the honorable member is aware, is very acute. However, the suggestion to make additional help available to those who have already been assisted to acquire a home will be reviewed when the applications already submitted by returned soldiers and others who have not yet been granted assistance have been satisfied. </para>

      <para>I promised that the information would be obtained, and the Acting Public Service Commissioner has now furnished me with the following information: -  1. (a) Upon  re-appointment  to the Public Service certain of the officers referred to have been classified in the Clerical Division.. The duties of these officers are not considered to be of a Professional Division character. Positions of an allied character in other sections of the Postmaster ^General&#39;s Department are classified in the Clerical Division, and no good reason now exists for difference in divisional classification. Where the duties are of a professional character, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> engineers, the officers have  been  classified in the Professional Division, (b) Increments due from 1st July lost accruing up  to  date of transfer have been paid, except in cases where it is the practice to hold payment until the passing of the Estimates. The officers  claims to these increments were not overlooked when assessing their salaries as officers of the Public Service, (c) While, owing to difference in system of classification in the Navy Department and in the Public Service, amounts paid as salary will in nine cases be less, there will be no reduction in actual remuneration; on the contrary, there has been a general increase. It must be noted that the Navy scale of salary covered all services rendered by officers on Sundays, on holidays, and for overtime, which, under Public Service practice, are compensated by payment in addition to salary. Furthermore, any reduction in salary has also been met by placing the Radio staff under similar conditions to those of the general body of officers in the grant of allowances to meet present conditions of living. Each unmarried officer will receive &#163;30, and each married officer &#163;45, in addition to salary, and remuneration for Sunday and holiday work should amount to at least an additional thirty days&#39; pay. Exclusive of Sunday and holiday pay, the officers of theRadio staff willbe paid during the current financial year a sum of &#163;4,250 above what they would have received had they remained under the Department of the Navy, and received increments from 1st July, 1920. </para>

          <para>.- The participation of Australia in the great European war justifies the intervention of this Parliament in other matters of international importance. &#34;We fought for &#34; the liberty of small nations and to make the world safe for Democracy&#34;; at least, so we were assured during the continuance of the war. That being so, we are entitled to show concern for small nations other than Belgium and Poland whose liberty is impaired and in which Democracy is not safe. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Our intervention in this conflict, which, by the way, evoked much eulogy from persons who have since proved neither friends to one small nation nor to Democracy, establishes our right to a voice in international matters, and cancels any objection which might otherwise be raised to this motion. </para>
        <para>The people of Australia - putting aside a noisy but negligible faction - having taken part in the war, and having thus shown their desire for the liberty of small nations and for the triumph of Democracy, must be taken as cordially favouring removal of&#39; the grievances of Ireland. We may, therefore, assume that they reprobate and reprehend the policy which has resulted in the tragic death of the Lord Mayor of Cork. That event has provoked amazement and indignation throughout the civilized world. The public conscience is shocked by a policy which leads to such tragedies. Close observers of events, here and elsewhere, fear that a continuance of this policy will lead to strained relations between Australia and Britain. This fear is shared by some of the clearest thinkers and most eminent men, even in England. Among others let me cite Lord Denman, a former Governor-General of Australia, who knows this country intimately. Writing to the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> on 6th September last, he said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If not too late, the Lord Mayor of Cork should be released immediately. His death in prison will probably defer hope of Irish settlement for many years, </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is the part which I emphasize for the benefit of honorable members and those outside who may be inclined to object to the motion -  and will certainly have serious consequences in the self-governing Dominions. </para>
        <para class="block">I take it that Lord Denman had several reasons for writing in that strain. The first, of course, was to save the English Government from the reproach of the murder of the Lord Mayor of Cork; the second, I take it, was the hope that his  release would bring about a more speedy settlement of the Irish question. But he had a third reason. Lord Denman, knowing Australia well, is aware that our domestic problems are often complicated by appeals to sectarian rancour and anti-Irish prejudices, which invariably provoke retaliation. It is apparent that he desired to remove the cause of these outbreaks, in order that Australia might attend to her national affairs, free from such extraneous obtrusiveness. I may commend the wise words and the deliberate warning of Lord Denman to the consideration of the House and the country. </para>
        <para>In itself, and apart from other circumstances the death in a foreign prison of the Lord Mayor of an Irish city should give pause to every man who values civic liberty. Let us consider what manner of man he was, and why he met death in a convict cell. No criminal, certainly. Even the Thugs who gaoled him dare not utter that perjury. He was a man irreproachable in domestic and private life, a poet and idealist, beloved by his fellow citizens, the parliamentary representative and chief magistrate of an ancient and important city. What sort of Government is it which puts a man of this type in fetters, and condemns him to the death of a felon? </para>

There are spies; there are the <inline font-style="italic">agents provocateurs</inline> of a foreign Government; but there are no men who at any time perform purely police duties as understood in Australia. There is not a police force in Ireland in the ordinary sense of the term. I suppose the honorable member spoke out to the fullness of his ignorance of Irish matters. </para>

            <para>- I ask your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether this is a motion which should be debated in the present way. I should like to know, first of all, where the urgency of this matter is - how it becomes a matter of urgent public importance here in Australia. There is another course available in order to debate such questions as this. This question of Irish wrongs has been aebated here, as you, sir, may recollect, on more than one occasion. Such a question ought to be debated on a specific motion; it is not in the nature of a matter of urgent public importance such as to justify a motion for the adjournment of the House, and the setting aside of the ordinary business of the country. I subunit that the motion is not one within the category of the standing order, which provides clearly that an honorable member must rise in his place, and must propose to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a &#34; definite matter of urgent public importance.&#34; This is a motion which would properly find its place, if at all, on the ordinary business-paper, to be dealt with in the ordinary way. </para>

If the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will read standing order 38 he will see that the question of urgency and of the importance ,of the motion is practically determined by a certain number of members rising in their places to signify  their  acquiesence  in the view that the matter is of urgent public importance. </para>

            <para>- It has been decided by Speakers of the House of Commons that the fact that a certain number of members rise in their places is an indication that the matter is regarded by a section of the House as one of urgent public importance, and that it is not one for the  Speaker  to determine. That the onus is placed on the House seems to be clear from the fact that five members must rise in their places to signify approval and concurrence, and as an indication that they regard the question as one of urgent importance. Of course, it is for the House to deal with the matter as it thinks fit. </para>

            <para>- There is only one way to challenge the Speaker&#39;s ruling, and that is by submitting a motion of dissent in writing; the Speaker&#39;s ruling cannot be canvassed or debated except under such a motion. Honorable members will see how the business of the House would become chaotic if, when a ruling were given, it were made the subject of debate and argument with the Chair. Therefore, the Standing Orders specifically provide a means of challenging a ruling if it is thought to be wrong. </para>

Fairs and markets, an essential part of Irish trade, are prohibited; trade union meetings, even national games and pastimes, are forbidden, and musical and literary festivities of the most harmless character are regarded as conspiracies. . . . The High Court Bench is mainly political, its charges to the grand juries, and political feeling often determines its judgment. No Irish Judge condemned the Ulster rebellion of 1013-14, which was led by an eminent King&#39;s Counsel; but to-day all Irish Judges condemn Southern &#34; sedition.&#34; The contempt with which Courts are regarded is the direct reflex of the general misrule. </para>

        <para>I ask the attention of honorable members to the passage which follows : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In 1918, sixty-eight Sinn Feiners were elected by the people of Ireland. Of these we have sentenced ten to death and twenty-one to penal servitude. Thirty-seven have been arrested without charge, and imprisoned or deported without trial, and sixty-five imprisoned without charge or for political offences. Only two out of the sixty-eight have escaped the attention of our police. The normal residence of an Irish Republican member of Parliament <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a British prison. </para>
          <para>Let me remove one possible misconception. These Irish members of Parliament are elected by the machinery and methods established by the English Government in Ireland, which are practically identical with, the machinery by which are elected members of Parliament in England. Such of these members as are not in gaol could enter the House of Commons to-morrow if they choose to do so, but they decline. Is it not a shocking commentary on Britain&#39;s boasted love of freedom that the . elect of the nation find their place, not in Parliament, but in the gaols of the country ? I am confident that Australia will not stand for a policy so unrighteous, and that, if continued, it will lead to serious estrangement between the Dominions and the Imperial Government. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to quote much from the Australian press, but here is a summary of the position in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of the 15th July, which well expresses the position. We are told - </para>
          <para>The situation in Ireland is without precedent inthe history of any civilized people. No such barbarities were ever practised by the Germans in Alsace-Lorraine as have been perpetrated in Ireland within the past five years. </para>
          <para>To-day there are nearly 100,000 British troops and 11,000 armed police trying vainly to compel the Irish race to show respect for English officials, whom they loathe, and for English laws which they neither made nor sanctioned. And this criminal and tragic farce is costing the British taxpayers over &#163;14,000,000 a year. For what? </para>
          <para>Do the Irish &#39;people desire to injure Britain or the British? Are they trying to undermine the British Empire? Are they attempting to annex any British territory or to invade England? </para>
          <para>Of course, they are not attempting any of these things. Ireland&#39;s only offence is that the people demand the right to make their own laws without the intervention of foreign bullies and foreign bayonets. </para>
          <para>An objection was made a few moments ago to the propriety of referring to the British Government in Ireland as a foreign Government. I repeat that any administration which does not exist by the free will and the sanction of the people over whom it functions is a foreign Government. Here, in this newspaper, I have an endorsement of that statement - </para>
          <para>And Britain, being the bigger of the two, refuses to discontinue the bullying and the bayoneting. </para>
          <para>Present writer, who is neither Irish nor Roman Catholic, is aware that there are a small number of people in Ireland who want to be governed from Downing-street, London. For the most part, they are either religious fanatics or capitalistic reactionaries, who see &#34; Rome &#34; or &#34; Bolsh &#34; in red letters whichever way they turn. </para>
          <para>We have quite a number of the same kidney in the Commonwealth, but we do not allow them to run the country as they do in Ireland, with the aid of British machine guns, tanks, and troops. </para>
          <para>What is there about Ireland which makes it so attractive to John Bull that he is content to incur the contempt of the whole civilized world rather than leave the place alone? What does Britain gain by keeping Ireland as a thorn in her flesh? </para>
          <para>Would it not be immeasurably wiser policy to have Ireland as a contented, happy and prosperous neighbour? </para>

          <para>. - I must confess to a feeling of surprise that, under the Standing Orders, such a matter as this can be treated as one of urgency. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahon)</inline> can hardly expect us to believe that he has . submitted this motion in order to do some good thing for Australia. If he would have us believe, as wereadily can, that he &#39;has moved this motion to do some evil to Britain and the Empire, then it does seem most amazing that it should he possible for him to do so with impunity under the . Standing Orders and procedure of this House, which recognise Australia as an integral part of the British Empire, and, in so many words, declare emphatically that the King of Britain is the King of this country. The honorable member has chosen as a peg upon which to hang his diatribe against England the death of Alderman MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork. In this matter every man speaks for himself. I am not going into the merits of the offence of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, or the manner in which he was treated. I would not like any one to think that I had no admiration for a man who died for a cause; but if I am asked whether this man died for a just cause, I join issue with the honorable member and say that he did not. He died for a cause in which he believed. If I am asked to bow my head as a token of respect for that man I do so, but it must not be understood that in doing that I am blaming Britain. The honorable member introduces this matter in a way that suggests that he thinks all the merits are on the one side. He has invited us to censure Britain. We cannot do that. </para>

        <para>I repeat that the honorable member would have us believe that all the merits of this matter are entirely with Ireland - that the Irish are always in the right, and that England is always in the wrong. I am not going to defend English rule in Ireland. Let the English defend it. But any man who in this House asks Australia to censure England on the ground that one man after a fast of over seventy days, has died, in order to show that he believes in Sinn Fein, and then expects- us not only to justify but to laud Sinn Fein in the face of its record of crimes and outrages, the like of which neither the honorable member nor I has seen equalled in his lifetime, must have a curious view of public opinion in Australia. I have before me last night&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> and this morning&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> In the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> it is stated that in Ireland within the last forty-eight hours two policemen have been killed and two wounded ; that one soldier has been killed and two wounded, two civilians killed and two wounded, and two &#34; black and tans &#34;  killed. In the morning paper there appears a cablegram headed &#34; Sein Fern murders.&#34; &#34;Seventeen constables killed.&#34; &#34; Public will not help police.&#34; The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has said that he did not know of any policeman in Ireland who had been shot in the back. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, they</inline> shot an Irish Roman Catholic policeman while he was before the altar. The honorable member would have us believe that the police of Ireland are Protestants and Englishmen. They are mostly Irish Roman Catholics. This man was shot before the altar - a foul, sacrilegious crime. They shot another man on his way home from mass. . They waited for him, and as he left the church they shot him. The cablegram to which I have just referred states thai - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The outrages have been spread over a wide area, and have been of a most cold-blooded character. Constable Maxwell, who went to a public-house with a friend, was followed by four masked men and shot dead. Seven other men were present, hut none raised a hand to defend the constable. Constable McCarthy, of Bruff, went for a cycle ride.  His  body was found in a drain practically naked. Serjeant Fulton was killed in the streets of Ballymote.  He was surrounded by a dozen men, who fired a number of shots at short range, and then escaped by mingling with the crowd in the street. </para>
          <para>It is believed that the Irish people sympathize with the murder campaign, which is so  embittering  the constabulary and soldiery to increasing reprisals. Though the murderers must be known to scores of people, none will assist  the  police to track the murderers or Ave warning of Hanger. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The honorable member says that we should condone all these offences. It is nothing to shoot a man before the altar, because, although he is a Roman Catholic and an Irishman, he is a policeman. Because he is a policeman he i&#39;s outside the pale, and may be murdered with impunity anywhere and at any time. </para>
        <para>We cannot agree to this motion. The cause of Sinn Fein, for which Alderman  MacSwiney  has died, is a cause which cannot succeed, because it rests on force and is stained by bloody murder. Those priests in Ireland who have had the courage to tell the  people  what is right, have condemned it, but the honorable member did not quote them. I deplore all these outrages and murders. I deplore the state of things in Ireland. Long before this latest development I have attempted to secure some sort of settlement of Irish affairs. That, however, is beyond the powers of any one man. The trouble is embedded in tlie racial hatred or habits of mind. of the two peoples. It&#39; is beyond the power of this Parliament, the British Parliament, or any other Legislature to deal with. I do not justify anything that hae been done; but if I am asked when a policeman is shot that the Government should do nothing, that his comrades should stand idly by, that licence to commit murder wholesale should be given to one section of the Irish people, while the opportunity for. justice is denied to others, I will not have it. If I am asked on whose side I am in this campaign, then I declare unhesitatingly that I am on the British side. There the matter stands. It is not that I am attempting to justify the manner in which the English have governed Ireland - I do not believe that the English can ever govern Ireland properly. The English do not understand the Celts, and I have never hesitated to tell them that, but I shall not stand, quiet while certain people seek to establish a republic within gun fire of the English coast, and thus aim a blow at the very heart of the Empire. The Irish problem is one for Britain to deal with. &#39;We have nothing whatever to do with it. But as the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahon)</inline> insists that we must express our opinion, I have expressed mine quite clearly ; I am opposed to the honorable member&#39;s view.  I do not regard Britain as a foreign country; if it were a foreign country, very few honorable members opposite would have a right to be here at all, because they would not then be naturalized. When they speak of Britain as a foreign country, they do not seem to recognise that everything they have they owe to Britain&#39;s might and power. They are very ready to avail themselves of British protection. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie quoted a statement from Lord Denman that there would be trouble in Australia; are we to understand that if we do not pass this motion the honorable member will attempt to recreate in Australia the state of affairs that exists in Ireland ? Let him try it ; he will then find that the Australians are of a temperament altogether different from that of the English. </para>

          <para>.- The Prime Minister said that honorable members on this side are not naturalized, and, therefore, have no rights in Australia. I was born in this country, and I have as much right to be here as has any other citizen born of Welsh parents. Unfortunately) I was not in the Chamber when the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahon)</inline> raised this question; had I been here I would have supported him in drawing attention to this matter. . I have heard honorable members opposite praise Arthur Henderson, the present Leader of the Labour party in Great Britain. He i3 a good Nonconformist like myself, but they omit to mention the fact that his attitude on the Irish question is the same as our3.  I do not say that all the fault is on one side. We have heard of a suggestion that &#39;a battalion of the Australian Imperial Force should be sent to France, and apparently it is right for one side to say what it thinks on this matter, but the other side must say nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> who I presume is a non-Catholic, speaking in the House of Commons a fortnight ago on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> Henderson demanding an inquiry into the position in Ireland, said - there was <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence that the police and military were going far beyond the limits of self-defence and had carried out reprisals which were a crime and an outrage against unoffending innocent people. </para>

Such remarks, I think, should not be made, if so intended, as their effect is to place the  Speaker  in a very undesirable position. The decision which I gave on the point of order raised was in accordance with decisions given by previous Speakers of this House, and is supported by rulings given in the House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Denison, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Brand, as follows: - </para>

        <para>An honorable member who seeks to move the adjournment of the House is bound to state to the House the definite matter of urgent pub-, lie importance which he desires to bring on. It is not for the  Speaker  to say whether the matter is of urgent public importance. The honorable member states this upon his own responsibility. </para>
        <para>A member desiring to move the adjournment of the House must produce a written notice setting forth the matter of urgent public im- portance to which he alludes. It is for the House to judge of the urgency and public importance of the matter by forty members rising in support. </para>

      <para>My decision, therefore, was&#39; in accordance with our own practice, and the practice laid down, by Speakers of the House of Commons. It is also to. be remembered that it is the duty of the Chair to preserve the rights of honorable members, no matter on what side of the House they may sit. If it is desired to alter the practice of the House in connexion with special adjournment  motions.  the proper, course is to amend the Standing Orders. As matters stand, however, the onus is upon the House - and the fact that at least five other members must rise to signify their opinion that the matter proposed to be discussed is one of &#34;urgent public importance&#34; is in itself <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence that the  Speaker  is not expected to be the judge of that point. Were it otherwise it is certain that the  Speaker  might on every occasion of a special adjournment being moved find himself involved in conflict with members on either side of the House. It was to avoid this that provision was made in the&#39; Standing Orders for a certain number of members to signify approval before such a motion could be moved. </para>

            <para>.- As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> knows, I have interviewed him on several occasions in connexion with the recent Ballarat election. First of all I approached him in regard to the payment of the legal expenses incurred by both parties to the appeal case heard by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, and subsequently the Minister placed on the Estimates a sum of &#163;800 to cover those expenses, both candidates having, I understand, agreed upon a certain amount which would cover their costs. This step I regard as only fair, in view of the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs that the election must be declared void on account of errors made by the officials of the Electoral Department, but if it was right for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby,</inline> who was only elected by a majority of one vote, to draw his salary from the date of the first election until the election was declared void, I contend that the present honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> should also receive payment for the period between the first election and the upsetting of that election. I hope the Minister will give consideration to the matter. </para>

            <para>.- There are two matters in connexion with the Electoral Office to which I should like to draw brief attention. The first is the question of obtaining uniform rolls in State and Commonwealth elections. Recent events have revealed most extraordinary discrepancies between the rolls on which Commonwealth elections are held, and those upon which State elections are held. In reply to a question put by me the other day to the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> I ascertained that the officers of his Department are doing their best to bring about a system of uniform rolls. . </para>

          <para>Every one desires that the electoral rolls should be as nearly as possible correct, so that every person entitled to vote should be enrolled, and that no name should be on more than one roll. Recent investigations, however, have disclosed a certain amount of duplication. I do not think that any elector desires to have his name on two rolls; but duplication gives opportunity for personation. </para>

            <para>. - The Electoral Department still follows the silly practice of hanging electoral rolls outside public offices in townships, and asking the people to consult them to ascertain whether they are enrolled. In many cases electors do this and find that they are properly enrolled, only to discover on election day that some one has subsequently had their names taken off the roll. I understand that the rolls are printed every month, and I think that new rolls should be exhibited every month. </para>

          <para>Once a person is enrolled for a  Federal  division, it is almost impossible for his name to get off the roll. In the old days, the trouble was to get a name on the roll. In the Queensland bush there was always a bunch of magistrates, composed mostly of squatters, who needed only an excuse to take a name off a roll. The elector might get it on again, but, in the meantime, he might be prevented from voting at an election. When a man applies for Federal enrolment, he has to state on what roll his name already appears, and if he declares that he is not enrolled, he is asked where he came from. Then a search is made in the head office of the State from which he said he came, to ascertain whether he is enrolled for any division in that State, and until the matter is satisfactorily settled, his name is not put on the roll for the division to which he has moved. He retains, however, the right to vote in any division for which he may have been previously enrolled. The electoral administration of the Commonwealth is almost .perfect, and reflects great credit on the officers of the Department, and particularly on the Central Branch. It seems to me that, with a view to lessening public expenditure, the Commonwealth and the States could come to an arrangement for the uniform compilation of electoral rolls. Tasmania set a good example by combining her State rolls with the Commonwealth roll* years ago, and a similar arrangement should suit the other States. I think that were the matter pushed &#39;a little by the Commonwealth the States would accept uniformity. The Minister has said that he is sending the Chief Electoral Officer to the various States to try to bring about uniformity. </para>

              <para>- Only last week there was a conference in Adelaide, and I understand &#39;from the Chief Electoral Officer that practically every point in dispute was settled so far as South Australia is concerned, so that there should be a combined Federal and State roll for use at the forthcoming State election. I intend to send the Chief Electoral Officer to all the States. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> has objected that the franchise should be the same in all the States, but uniformity  in the compilation of the rolls can be secured even though there may be differences between Commonwealth and State franchises. The printing of &#34; S &#34; or &#34; F &#34; after a name on a roll would show whether the enrolment were for the State or for the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- One of the staffs will have to go, and I can scarcely fancy it will be the Commonwealth staff. We are told by the Minister, however, that he has found no insurmountable difficulties, and that being so, some definite steps should be taken iu the direction I have suggested. This is highly desirable, if only on the ground of economy, for some hundreds of thousands of pounds could, no doubt, be saved in the three years. In passing, I desire to compliment the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> on the assurance given him by the sub-Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> that he will occupy his position next year ; that ought to be very welcome information, and, in any case, comes as a suitable, sort of Christmas box. </para>

          <para>I must say a word or two about the Ballarat election, and the expense to which each of the candidates was put in subsequent proceedings. In the first case of the kind we had, when it was a matter between the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn, the whole of the expense was borne by the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- We must not forget, as the Minister has suggested, that there are other expenses besides legal expenses, and, since the investigations were rendered necessary through the fault of officials, both candidates ought to be recompensed. The honorable member  for  Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> is in a much more unfavorable position than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby,</inline> considering that the latter was drawing the parliamentary allowance all the time, while the present representative of the seat, without any salary, was strenuously engaged in seeking justice.

In view of what was done some years ago in the case of the Melbourne seat, I think the least the Government can do k to pay the expenses of the Ballarat candidates. </para>

            <para>.- I support the view taken by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> and the honorable member for -Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page).</inline> I am pleased to note that Tasmania is the first State to adopt the Federal roll. Last year the Taamanian Government paid the Federal Government &#163;1,277 as her share of the electoral administration, whereas, in 1915 - the nearest year for which I canfind any figures - the cost of electoral administration to the State was &#163;3,519- This snows a direct saving of practically 50 per cent, in the cost of administration. In 1918-19 South Australia spent &#163;4,801 on 1 electoral administration, exclusive of &#163;9,051 for contingencies;, the latter I take to mean the election expenses.. In Queensland the expenses of administration were &#163;2,541, and in Victoria &#163;15,161, but there are no details given of the latter figures. We have, therefore, to make an estimate as to the, proportion that the administrative expenses bear to the election expenses. Iia. regard to Western Australia there is- no information given, the amounts being shown under the Estimates for the Crown Law Department, with, no details. If we assume that the Electoral Departments of the various States spend &#163;30,000 a year in administration, that does not seem excessive, and, further, assuming: that Tasmania by her recent arrangement is saving 50 per cent., we may take it that &#163;15,000 per annum would be1 saved by the co-ordination of the Departments.  However, more important than even this saving is an assurance that  every man and woman entitled to the franchise shall be on the roll. In the case of the Commonwealth!, with compulsory enrolment, any failure must be entirely the fault of the elector concerned, if that elector has failed to send in a card. In the recent State elections in. Victoria thousands of people were disfranchised through the inefficiency of the Electoral Department; but I cannot say whether that inefficiency was on the part of the police or on the part of the departmental officials. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposal for one electoral roll naturally gives rise to the question of electoral divisions. In Tasmania all the State divisions are the same as the Federal divisions; and we have the HareClarke system of proportional voting, which is the most equitable in operation in Australia to-day. </para>

              <para>- It gets you&#39; there, every time. The point I wish to make- is that the States which have single electorates are going to have some little difficulty, because many of the Federal divisions overlap the State divisions. In order to bring about a thoroughly sane and effective system, it will be necessary to re-adjust the divisions for the State Parliament. I hope that this will soon be done. </para>

              <para>- I regard the general expenditure of the Meteorological Department as being very necessary. Having regard to our extensive coastline, the warnings issued from time to time by the Department probably avert much loss of shipping, and so save the Commonwealth thousands of pounds. We have on these Estimates a total proposed expenditure of &#163;93,000 for rental of buildings used by the various Departments. Is there no possibility of centralizing many of these offices? At the present time they are scattered all over the city, and it seems to me that not only would the convenience of the public be studied, but a saving anight be effected by renting large premises in which these offices could be centralized . </para>

          <para>Another item to which I desire to draw attention relates to the administration of the Northern Territory, for which we have a proposed vote of &#163;104,440. I do not object to expenditure provided some return can be obtained for it, and if it is impossible to reduce the cost of administering the Territory, we should at least make some effort to increase production, and so to increase the revenue. This item : is a growing and most unsatisfactory one. The Territory&#34;, however, is a very valuable asset,I regard it as the key to our White Australia policy, and if we are to keep Australia white we must develop it. </para>

              <para>- I can give the honorable member a few items which more than account for the difference. For instance, there is an item of &#163;52,000 representing payments made to the Postmaster- General&#39;s Department for the transmission of meteorological telegrams. That is a mere transfer from one Department to another. Provision is also made for an expenditure of &#163;150,000 on the census. That item did not appear in last year&#39;s Estimates. There is also an item of &#163;100,000 for immigration, although immigration matters will be dealt with by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. It will thus be seen that the expenditure for which we provide is actually below that of last year. </para>

I merely suggest that it would be of great assistance to honorable members if, instead of the whole vote for a Department being put without any explanation, the Minister in each case would adopt the practice of moving the total vote and explaining the difference between the estimated expenditure for the current year and the actual expenditure for last year. </para>

              <para>- Such an alteration as I suggest in the practice adopted by Ministers would do away with a good deal of misapprehension and give honorable members a clearer view before we entered upon the discussion. The &#39;Minister, indeed, might furnish us with information which a mere examination of the figures would not disclose. The honorable gentleman, I think, will admit that it is impossible to say from the figures that are before us exactly where an increase or a decrease takes place. So much for the question of practice. </para>

Shortly put, we want to have it made easy to get on the rolls and difficult to get off.

I wish to know why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> has been sent away to carry on the propaganda work to which I have referred. I have been reading the newspapers, and I notice that there is a frank admission that he is going to carry on some sort of propaganda which certainly will not be in favour of this party, nor one that will commend itself to the great body of unionists in Australia. It is very important that the Government should be impartial, and have regard to what are the aspirations and desires of the workers of this country in making such an appointment. They have made an appointment which does not . commend itself to the workers, and particularly to the unionists, and I hope that they will take some steps to minimize the party propaganda which this gentleman has been sent away to carry out. </para>

            <para>.- The Ballarat election dispute differed entirely from other election disputes in quite a number of aspects. For one thing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby</inline> lost his seat for nothing that he had done himself, but because persons who were entitled to vote were prohibited from making the necessary declarations which would have enabled them to do so, and were thus deprived of the opportunity of voting. Again, all other disputes were decided very rapidly, but the Ballarat appeal was prolonged for several months, and as a result the honorable member who eventually won the- seat lost several hundred pounds, which otherwise he might have drawn in the way of salary. Furthermore, while the appellant was quite prepared to leave his case in the hands of his secretary, the Bench decided that he must be represented by counsel, the consequence being that whatever allowance the Government may make for legal expenses incurred before the tribunal is all swallowed up in the payment of the fees of a legal practitioner. Nothing is left for the layman who prepared the case, and who, in fact, having handled it for months, was ready to take it before  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs. On all these grounds, because the second election was declared necessary owing to faults on the part of the officials of the . Electoral Office, because neither candidate indulged in any improper practices, because the hearing of the appeal was unduly prolonged, and because the layman who was prepared to handle the case for the appellant gets nothing out of the costs for which an allowance has already been made, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> might fairly give consideration to the granting of direct compensation to the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath).</inline> Particularly ought he to do this because in previous cases sums of money have been paid as compensation, quite apart from the actual legal costs incurred in the hearing of appeals. In this case the employment of counsel was forced upon the candidates against their will. So that compensation ought to be paid to them apart from the legal expenses which were incurred through no fault of their own. If the Minister cannot deal with the matter himself, I ask him to submit it to his colleagues, and see whether in the circumstances something cannot be done to accede to the request put forward by  the  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> on behalf of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath).</inline></para>

            <para>.- It is certainly time the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> on behalf of the Government, gave some indication of what is proposed to be done in connexion with the Northern Territory. We ought to know whether the present system of management is to continue, and also the present expenditure. For instance, these Estimates provide for the payment of &#163;1,250 salary, and &#163;200 allowance for an  Administrator,  &#163;1,000 for a Judge, &#163;1,000 for a Director, and &#163;700 for a Secretary. In this provision, for so many officials there seems to be a skeleton outline for the administration not of a sparsely-populated territory, but of a settled and well-populated country. There are fourteen sub-branches in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Northern Territory Administration, and it is well worth puttingon record what they are, so that honorable members may have some idea of what is being done in the Territory to-day. These fourteen subbranches are - Aborigines, Agriculture, Botanical Gardens, Police, Gaol, Charitable Institutions, Health, Law, Stock  and Brands, Education, Public Works, Lands and Surveys, Mining, and Hotels. </para>

              <para>- The Minister is adopting tactics which have been tried previously, and it is rather surprising to me that some one whose duty itv is to &#34; strafe &#34; Ministries has not already taken them to task over it.

              <para>- I think it would be a very effective coalition, but at the present moment I am not proposing such a thing. My object in calling attention to this expenditure is to point out that eventually we may run into trouble, but the best the Minister can say in reply is, &#34; What would you do? &#34; When I have concluded my remarks the Minister can demonstrate by giving the facts that a very obvious criticism is not justified, but it is no help to the Committee to merely suggest to any one who criticises the Northern  Territory  vote that everything is perfect, and ask, &#34; What could any one do?&#34; I do not think the Minister would suggest that the Northern Territory administration has been perfect. My object in rising was to get from&#34; the Minister before these Estimates drift through, some indication which will at least reassure the Committee that the expenditure is receiving his consideration, and that he proposes to work down to some definite line. </para>

              <para>- There is always hope that some one will come along with intelligence to indicate how something can be done; but when I rose for the purpose of making a few innocent remarks about the Northern Territory, and to ask whether the Minister would make any definite statement in regard to the administration there, his attitude was such as to drive me into the position of becoming a hostile critic, and almost to become more and more hostile every minute, in order to maintain my position. There was no necessity for this. The only point I am raising now is whether the Government have anything in mind as to how the Territory can be dealt with. I want to know if they have any definite scheme which they propose to put into effect. If it be recognised, as it should be, that we have the northern part of Australia to populate, and if we are to make the fullest use of that portion of the Commonwealth, it seems to me that it is the obvious duty of any Government to tell us what their scheme is. If, however, they are barren of any ideas of the sort, it is the duty of the Committee to demand from them how they propose to run the Territory, on the present lines, but with a very much decreased expenditure. To return to the point which I was endeavouring to make when the Minister interrupted, let me tell the Committee that there are 140 officers in the Northern Territory drawing over &#163;46,000 in salaries, and spending &#163;60,000 on contingencies. Apart from the cost of the Departments I have mentioned, and &#163;119,000 for interest and sinking fund, provision is made in other parts of these Estimates for further expenditure in the Northern Territory. For instance, the Trade and Customs Department at Darwin costs &#163;1,370; the Railway Department, &#163;40,000,; and the Post Office service, &#163;28,000. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It seems to me that there must be something wrong if we cannot administer this Territory in a more economical way. I recognise that in the future state of development it is quite likely that the  cost of administration might be considerable, but the present state of the Territory&#39;s development does not justify the amount we are now spending upon it. Before these Estimates are agreed to, I hope the Minister will give the Committee some idea as to the Government&#39;s proposals in this regard. </para>
          <para>With regard to the Ballarat election, it appears to me that the two candidates have been put to considerable expenditure for a reason that no one can suggest was their own fault, and I certainly think they are entitled to be reimbursed for any additional expenditure they have been put to, which is expenditure that was not cast upon other candidates at the recent general election. </para>

He told mc then that a regulation, recently passed by the Minister of Home and Territories, requires that an emigrant must know a little English before he or she embarks; not only that, but the form which he handed me (he stated) after being filled in will have to be sent to the  abovementioned  Minister for approval.

              <para>- I do not know that the Minister&#39;s interjection is a very logical reply to the complaint of this Italian who has been working here, and seeks to have his wife join him in Australia, but is precluded from doing so by  this  regulation made by the Minister. If it is desired to increase the population of the country, surely a good way of doing so is to enable persons who have come here to send for the members of their families to join them. The man to whom I have referred is apparently a lawabiding citizen, because he has resided here for several years. What objection can there be to his wife joining him, even though she may not be able to speak English ? She could learn very quickly if living in this community. </para>

          <para>By the midday mail I received from Sydney a letter in which the writer, an Englishman, and an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Force, complains in quite a number of pages of his treatment since his discharge. He is so angry about it that he has written to the Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers Federation of the United Kingdom a letter in which he gives Australia anything but a good advertisement, pointing out that a number of ex-sailors and soldiers in Sydney are having a bad time. He has sent me a copy of that letter, and in it he says - </para>

            <para>This Repatriation Department was organized to benefit returned soldiers, and to place them in a condition to work&#34;, and get them work. How they do it! They supply the ex-Australian Imperial Force men with letters to the Orient liners manager here for him to give the bearers a working passage to England, and thereby help the good work of repatriation along. Many avail themselves of the offer, glad to leave, while the Orient Line take advantage of their misfortune, and obtain their services at ls. per month, while we British seamen, with good&#39; books, are stranded. The shipping office in the port of Sydney do the same. </para>

            <para class="block">I wish to say a word or two in support of the argument, of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and other honorable members on the case of the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath).</inline> The case is, I think, unique, so far as this Parliament is concerned. It has been clearly shown that it was through the gross carelessness of some of the departmental officers that the present member for Ballarat was deprived of his seat and remuneration for a number of months. Whatever was the cause of the trouble, it lay with the departmental officers, and I think it would be only fair if the honorable member were paid the full salary as from the date of the first election. It is the rule, I think,that if any member of the public suffers any disability &#39;through carelessness or mistakes in any Department he shall be&#39; allowed compensation. The result of the second election has shown that the honorable member for Ballarat was justly entitled to the parliamentary remuneration from the beginning of the Parliament. </para>
            <para>I was pleased to hear from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> this morning that he is taking steps towards the provision of a uniform roll for the States and the Commonwealth. A Federal election costs, I believe, about &#163;80,000, and I suppose that in the same period a similar amount, or more, is spent by the different States. In my own electorate, at a recent State election, it was found that the ballotboxes of the State had become damaged, and though there were Federal ballotboxes which had been in use only a few months before in the same neighbourhood, new boxes had to be provided for the State election. Of course, the Minister cannot bring about this reform himself, because the State authorities have to be consulted, and- must be willing to adopt it. I hope, however, that sweet reasonableness will prevail, and that we will very soon have one electoral roll and one method of enrolment. We have been told to-day that in the case of Queensland there . are about 60,000 more names on the State rolls than on the Federal rolls, and the electoral officer of my own district told me the other day that the Federal roll there is much smaller than the State one, the latter having been issued later. I am quite satisfied that the State rolls of New South Wales show more .  names than do the Federal rolls, so that I was not surprised to hear of the state of affairs in Queensland. Every honorable member knows that when the names have been collected by the policemen, the people think that they are duly enrolled; butthe two systems of collecting names are different. In the case of the States the police do the collecting, and the average person does not worry much about the matter, but is convinced that he is on the roll. In one part of my electorate 300 notices were issued recently asking the electors for reasons for their names not being on the roll. I understand that if the reasons given are good, only a nominal fine of 2s. 6d. is imposed. Out of the 300 persons involved, I think that all but two stated that they thought that the collecting of their names by the police officer meant that they would be on the Federal roll. Apart from the economy of a uniform roll, much confusion would be avoided, and many people saved from worry. The average elector does not wish, to keep his name off the roll, but is confused by the varying systems adopted. Even if we do have a uniform roll, something ought to be done in the way of a uniform method of collecting the names. I hope it is true that South. Australia and Tasmania have consented to uniformity, and that the rest of the States will follow. We would then get a better expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and, altogether, conditions would be much improved for both Commonwealth and States. </para>

            <para>. - There are two points on which I desire to say a word. One is the suggestion made that a sum of money shall be placed on the Estimates as a set-off to the loss of salary which the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> &#39;would have received had he been returned at the general election. The other question is that of a uniform electoral roll. As to the first .matter my right honorable colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has already informed honorable members that it is a matter which the House itself must decide; if the House is in favour of the suggestion, the Government will approve of it, and by placing an amount on the Supplementary Estimates pay it to the honorable member. </para>

          <para>We are all agreed, I think, as to the desirability of uniform electoral rolls; there is no question of party, or difference of opinion in that matter. I would only like to say that no blame attaches to the Commonwealth for this uniformity not having been effected sooner. We have done everything in our power, and the Minister in charge of the Department <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> informs me that considerable progress has been made, more in some States than in others, towards the end in view. But I think 1 shall not be doing any one an injustice when I say that the&#34; principal cause of the delay has been the vested interests of the officials in the various State offices, who imagine, I think quite wrongly, that this is a blow aimed at their prerogatives or possibly at their pockets. I may be doing -them an injustice. If that is the case, I apologize to them. Uniform electoral rolls, however, are very desirable, and the Commonwealth,. I repeat, has made very considerable progress in the matter.  My honorable colleague informs me that he believes that in the case of one State at least the . next elections will be held on a uniform roll. </para>

              <para>- I think it is high time that this Parliament had placed before it some outline of the work contemplated over a term of years in the Northern Territory. During the war  things necessarily were allowed to drift. The Territory has been a very expensive acquisition to the Commonwealth, and yet there is every reason to belieVe that it is a very rich portion of Australia, and that under wise government, instead of being the heavy responsibility that it is to-day, it might be converted, if nob immediately, as all events at a comparatively early date, into an asset. The information that one gets in regard to the Territory indicates that we have been inclined to pursue wrong lines in its administration. We are attempting to induce people to take up small settlements, which cannot be immediately pro.fitable, whereas the policy indicated by the nature and the situation of the country is that we should, in the first place, encourage the pastoral industry, and give encouragement to prospecting, in the hope that some mining centres ar.ay be discovered, which would help to attract population, and so make the smaller industries eventually successful. </para>

A strong man is needed .as Administrator to control it. He should be given very wide powers, and should be judged by the results he produces, instead of being continually interfered with by the Central Administration, which cannot have the intimate knowledge of the conditions existing in the north that the man <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the spot, provided that he be the right man, must have. </para>

On page S9 of the General Estimates there is a small but ominous item of nearly &#163;1,000 for clearing the rifle range at Warwick of prickly pear. I imagine that an area of that sort would comprise from 300 to 500 acres. If it will cost &#163;1.000 to clear such an area, only a very easy sum need be worked to show what it will cost to clear something like 20,000,000 acres of badly infested pear country in Queensland. In that way we shall get an idea of the enormous sum of money necessary to attempt anything like eradication of the pest. </para>

But I want honorable members to realize that it is probably no exaggeration to say that onethird of the enormous area of Queensland is more or less directly threatened at the present moment. The pest will very shortly - one may say that it has already - become a menace in more than one State. The State Governments of Queensland right through have proved themselves quite unable to cope with it. </para>

              <para>- It is difficult to say what is and what is not a serious effort, but there is no royal road to clearing the country of the pest.

          <para>The present Government of Queensland - and I do not speak in any party sense - does not believe in the principle of freehold, and. that is an additional difficulty in the way of the solution of the problem. I say quite openly that so far all our Governments in Queensland have proved themselves incapable of handling the question. To put it broadly, the complete eradication of prickly pear today is no longer practicable. We can abandon all ideas of eradication or of clearing the pear-infested country. We now have simply to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the further spread of the pest. It may be said that this is not a question for the Federal Parliament, but it will be admitted that if a fire breaks out in one of a row of houses, it becomes a very important matter for the occupiers of the remaining houses that that fire should bc promptly extinguished. The Commonwealth is now the direct proprietor of a very large area .with an extensive frontage to the Queensland border. With a clear understanding of the position, I do not hesitate to say that the pear is gradually eating up a very large portion of Queensland and becoming an absolute menace to the whole of Australia. I am convinced that sooner or later it  will be forced upon us that this is a huge national danger, and we shall have to face it as a national question. I ask the Government and the Committee to realize the danger, and I invite honorable members to consider &#39;whether we ought not now to prepare our minds for dealing with the subject, realizing that the prickly pear having become a national clanger, must be treated on national lines. </para>

          <para>I should be glad if we could secure uniform rolls for State andFederal elections. In connexion with the recent State elections, it struck me as peculiar that the -Commonwealth permanent officials for the Federal electorate of Ballarat had nothing to do, although they arc trained men, while others who knew very little about electoral matters were brought in to conduct the State elections. Much greater satisfaction would be given if we had uniform rolls, and the permanent officials of the Commonwealth Department conducted both the State and Federal elections. They understand the law, and know exactly how to compile rolls, and to conduct an election. The reflections which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs cast upon electoral officials in connexion with the first Ballarat election related to men employed only for the day, who were not familiar with the Electoral Act. Certain persons whose names had been improperly removed from the rolls claimed the right to vote; but the presiding officers, in certain cases, knowing nothing of section 121 of the Act, refused to allow them to do so. That was practically responsible for the trouble which occurred. I repeat that the Electoral Department, and particularly the chief of the Department in Ballarat, did their work in connexion with the Federal election there in a splendid manner. </para>
          <para>If we desire to have a thoroughly satisfactory set of rolls, we should take care to have fewer subdivisions than at present. The State electorate of Ballarat West consists of two subdivisions. If persons remove from one side of Sturtstreet to the other, they may still be in the same electorate, but in a different subdivision. Being unaware of the fact that they are in a different subdivision, they fail to get enrolled for it, and are either prosecuted for that failure, or find, when election time comes round, that they have no vote. The Department would be well-advised if it decided to have only one division for each State electorate. </para>

              <para>- But I do not wish it to be thought that I was treating the matter in a cavalier way. Reference was made to the number of officers employed in the Territory, and I may say that I have been going very carefully into the whole question, with the object of making a reduction. Unfortunately, there are not many people in the Territory, but a number of Departments are necessary. If we did not maintain a certain number of officials there it would be necessary to drag the citizens of the Territory down to the other States for the redress of their grievances. No greater problem confronts the Minister for Home and Territories than the administration of this Territory, where, I believe, we have a wonderful asset if it is properly handled. In my opinion it can be developed, not by following the lines of closer settlement, but only by adopting the more primitive method of stocking with cattle and sheep, which has been applied successfully in other parts of Australia that are now carrying large populations. In pursuance of this policy  Ave  have been putting down a number of bores east and west from the Wave Hill district towards Camooweal, and boring should also be undertaken south towards the Macdonnell Ranges, The land is capable of growing excellent grasses and edible herbage, and produces a very fine class of stock, particularly in the central area. The doubt as to whether permanent water exists we are endeavouring to solve by means of these bores, and later on I propose to ask for the expenditure of a considerable sum of money in this direction. However, excellent results have been obtained so far. The average depth of the bores put down is 170 feet to 200 feet, and water of a very high character has been tapped. In No. 1  bore  water was struck at a depth of 247 feet, and rose 170 feet in the bore. Pumping yields 32,000 gallons per day without reducing that level. In No1. 2 bore water was struck at a depth of 180 feet, and the bore is capable of producing 32,000 gallons a day. At another bore a pumping test for twelve hours gave 29,000 gallons. On one pastoral station a number of bores have been put down, and an excellent supply of water was obtained at a very shallow depth, varying from 42 feet to a little over 60 feet. At one of these bores 500 head of cattle are watered. </para>

          <para>My idea of developing the Northern Territory is to provide railway facilities in conjunction with the policy of boring for water, not on every block, but in certain localities, in order to demonstrate that a permanent supply is obtainable. Where these facilities are provided I am satisfied a wonderful development will follow. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is not so confident as I am about this, but when we realize that we have a Territory 900 miles long by -600 miles wide we can see that it is not a little proposition capable of being administered by one or two men. The trouble is that all through, during the period of administration by the State of South Australia, and since the Commonwealth has taken over the Territory, Ave have been endeavouring to develop it from the Darwin end, which is the tropical portion &#39;of it. I do not think Ave shall succeed in any attempt to develop the Territory from the tropical end, but if it is. once bridged by a railway I am satisfied that thousands of people will settle there. The worst enemy  of the country is the man who has never seen the locality, the man  who would  develop it from Bourke-street or King William-street; but here I have the testimony of a young fellow who  went  into the Macdonnell Ranges at seventeen years of age, and  who,  although not as well equipped as other men, through having a maimed foot, has, according to a letter he has forwarded to me, made an unqualified success of his efforts to develop the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory. He commenced as a lad, earning 30s. a  week.  gaining experience on stations, and after saving about &#163;350  went  to Western Australia, hoping to make his fortune there. Eventually he returned to the Macdonnell Ranges country,  which  is so much condemned by Melbourne newspapers and other critics. He writes as follows: - </para>

After fighting the ordinary difficulties one has outback, and all the inconveniences one has to contend with in the bush, I am pleased to state that my success has been such as to enable me to invest the sum of &#163;7,000 cash in a ranch in the same district, with the ultimate prospect of being able to pay off the &#163;12,000 that represents the total cost.....

          <para class="block">This young man has the opinion that a great future awaits this portion of the Territory, but the attitude of some honorable members is like that of a man  who  takes up a property  Avith  a limited capital, and refuses to spend any money on it. If  Ave Avant  to make anything out of the Northern Territory we must spend money on it. In the meantime  Ave  cannot do better than  follow  the course of putting  down  bores, and demonstrating that permanent  water  is available. As soon as that is done young fellows, sons of pastoralists whose holdings are being cut up for closer settlement, and who are anxious to get out further back to continue their pastoral occupation, will be found going to. the Territory. There is every possibility of development on the primitive lines of settlement  which  have been so successfully applied in all the&#34; States. We shall not succeed by forcing closer settlement. </para>

            <para>.- The Committee should not too precipitately agree to the Home and Territories Estimates, because upon them&#39; the question of immigration comes up for consideration, and it is one upon which much can, and should, be said. Bound up with it is the settlement of the Northern Territory. I do not share the optimistic views of the Minister respecting the Territory, but I would not think of decrying it as a national asset, or of saying that it. is impossible to make it a productive white man&#39;s country. I agree with the Minister that it has to be populated, and from the south rather than from the north. It is idle, however, to suppose that we can populate it properly until there has been a very large increase in the population of the Commonwealth  as a whole. No part of Australia is adequately populated yet, and we cannot, by artificial processes, populate the Northern Territory, and make it productive in advance of the development of more accessible areas. </para>

              <para>- That is not so. The Minister for Repatriation is charged with the duty of looking into emigration on the other side of the world, and to that I offer no objection, because, though we differ in politics, I recognise that he holds his position as the result of the vote of the Australian people, and as a member of the Government, so that, apart from his personal qualifications, he is entitled to speak for a large section of the community. My objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> is not personal, and not even political; it is based on the fact that he has neither the qualifications&#39; nor the capacity to speak for Australia, and those whom the Labour party represent have no confidence in him.  His  public performances, utterances, and course of conduct are such that he has utterly forfeited, if he ever possessed, the confidence of that  class to which he will have to appeal in England to make his mission a success. &#39; An emigration campaign is not to be won by an appeal to the personal friends of members of the Government, or to those in high places; the appeal must be made to the bone and sinew of the country from which emigrants are to be drawn - the workers of Great Britain and Ireland, and the workers of other countries - if it is intended to prosecute our immigration policy outside the British Dominions. The class of men we want here are those who are prepared to work on the land,  and, after them, men who are prepared to work in the secondary industries. If the Government, as a reward for the political apostasy of a former member of the Labour party who has joined them, appoints <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes</inline> as their emigration agent at Home, their immigration scheme is foredoomed to failure. Nothing is more sensitive than the public mind regarding representations concerning the possibilities of a new country to which people are being invited to emigrate. When a person speaks as an emigration agent for Australia he should possess the full confidence of the people from whom he goes. This gentleman does not do that. He is in no sense an Australian, and his experience of this country has been very limited, both in time and in extent.  His  political history marks him out as a man in whom the workers of Great Britain cannot have confidence. I hope that the vote for the Department of Home and Territories will not be passed until there has been more discussion of the immigration policy of the Government and of the proposed appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes.</inline></para>

              <para>- It will afford other opportunity for protest. It is imperative that we should express the strong views that we hold regarding this appointment, and I am strongly inclined to divide the Committee regarding it by moving a reduction of the vote. It is not certain that we will deal with the Immigration Bill before Christmas. </para>

            <para>.- I think that we might report progress now. One or two members who are not here wish to say something upon these Estimates, and if the Minister allows them to go over until next week they will probably be dealt with then within halfanhour. </para>
