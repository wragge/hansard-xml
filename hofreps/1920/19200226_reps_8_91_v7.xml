                            <para>.- I rise, not to oppose the nomination of the honorable member for Lang for the office of  Speaker,  but to draw attention to one or two anomalies relating to the management -of .this House. In connexion with every industry in every State increases of wages have taken place, yet we still have throughout the Parliament attendants whose remuneration is based upon what 1 consider a very low standard of wages. T here -are attendants and others who have received very little consideration eithefrom the Government, the  Speaker,  or the  President  of the Senate. In New South Wales the basic wage is ?3 17s. pet week. That is the minimum wage, and having regard to the cost of living, it is not too much ; yet we have on the staff of this House -confidential employees discharging important duties as between members and the public who receive only about ?3 per week. Even the Victorian Railways Commissioners have increased the minimum wage of their employees to 11s. 9d. per day, and Government Departments generally have seen fit to grant increased payments. The employees of this Parliament are not under the Public Service Commissioner; they are controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  President  of the Senate, and arc not allowed- 'to appeal to the Arbitration Court. There is in this regard a serious anomaly. Why should the  President  of -the Senate have any control over .the employees of this branch of the Legislature? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should have full power and control over them. </para>

                            <para>- I shall put in a word for the right honorable gentleman. Ministers controlling great Departments, and having -to 'deal with the expenditure of millions of pounds per annum, still receive the paltry .'allowance which was granted to them twenty years ago. It is unreasonable that these men, who, one ;by one, are 'dropping off because of the heavy work cast upon them, should be expected by .the country .to be content with an inadequate allowance. </para>

                    <para>Another point to which I wish to draw attention is that, immediately after the dissolution of Parliament, a notice was posted in the rooms set apart for Federal members in the Commonwealth Bank offices, Sydney, that franked stamps must not be used by honorable members of the late Parliament. The dissolution having taken place, they had ceased to be members, and they were not to use O.S. stamps, although they still had a great volume of public correspondence to attend to in connexion with matters affecting their electorates. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that it was wrong to issue such a notice in respect of honorable members generally. It seems a paltry thing that the moment the House was dissolved the issue of stamps required by honorable members for their public correspondence should have been stopped by the order of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or the  President  of the Senate. During the election period we had still to "deal, by means of correspondence, with questions relating to old-age pensions, and many other departmental matters, and yet O.S. stamps were withheld from us. I sincerely hope that, whoever is elected as  Speaker  of this House, will insist upon having the undivided control of all administrative matters relating, to it,, without any assistance from the  President  of the Senate. The  Speaker  would then have the responsibility thrown upon, him of seeing that adequate wages are paid to the employees of. the Parliament, and. that the privilege of using stamps is not taken away from honorable members under the circumstances I have mentioned.. I must say that I have always found <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> very courteous, and, personally, I have no feeling against him at &#62;all. I hope, however, that if he be elected, he will do a fair thing towards our employees, and sec that they are assured a decent standard of living. </para>

                            <para>.- I beg to support the remarks made by the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley),</inline> more particularly in regard to the attendant in charge of the Commonwealth rooms in Sydney. I do not. say this because of the fact that it is a Sydney case, but merely because it is one which comes under the direct notice of New South Wales members. This attendant is a returned soldier, who was one of the first to enlist, and lias four years' service to his credit. He was an Anzac, and he is now given employment at the magnificent wage of ?2 17s. a week. </para>

                                <para>- It is, especially in view of the fact that the Board of Trade in New South Wales, which exhaustively investigated the cost of living, fixed the basic wage at ?3 17s. 6d. per week. I understand that when somebody found that we on this side of the House intended to take this opportunity to ventilate the case of this attendant, he was paid an, extra 5s. a week; but even that does not bring him within measurable distance of a living wage. We should not nsk our employees to work for wages which are Below those that an outside employer is allowed to pay in New South Wales. I feel quite certain that the matter  need3  only to be mentioned for the incoming  Speaker,  who, I have no doubt, will bo <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> to take  steps  to have this injustice remedied. </para>

As  Speaker  he should be the' " boss of the show " here, and. not act at the dictation of the  President  of the Senate. As I say, I feel sure it is only necessary to mention the matter to have the  .Speaker  realize that he owes a duty to himself and the employees. </para>

                        <para>There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and that is the invasion of the precincts of Parliament by the military authorities. I wish to say,, in the most kindly manner possible, that, any  Speaker  in a British Parliament who allows any outside body to enter the Parliament and interfere with its affairs, is recreant to his duty as the custodian of the rights of a British community. The principle of British government is that the people are sovereign, and that when they have elected their representatives those representatives' shall have full freedom of discussion; with nothing but their own rules to control them. Apart from all outside influence, the people's representatives should be able, in. quite an unfettered, way, to discuss and decide what should be the laws of the country. Whatever the reason, justification, .or pretext for the entry of the military authorities within the precincts of Parliament, that entry is an interference with the rights and privileges of the honorable members of the House. </para>

                                <para>- I wish honorable members to realize that I have no time for disloyalty. I am emphasizing the fact that the honorable members of the House are masters of their own destinies, and can always rule their own affairs. If an honorable member does, anything not in accordance with the rules or with the best traditions of Parliament, the House can deal with him - that is the duty of the House and not the duty of any outside body. The military authorities were allowed to come stamping into this House and interfere with, and take away, the correspondence of honorable members. A  Speaker  who allows that to be clone is recreant to his duty. Though I may seem to be speaking with some heat, I make these remark? in the most kindly spirit possible. I wish the  Speaker  to realize his responsibility and not allow any further interference by outside bodies in our business. If it be war "time and there may be danger to the Empire in certain contingencies, surely the House can protect itself? The British Parliament would sternly  resent  any interference by the military or others with its rights and privileges. The moment there is any hampering of the functioning of Parliament by interference from an outside body there is started a danger of revolution. The people under such circumstances are prone to get tired of parliamentary institutions and of doing things in a constitutional way. They begin to ask themselves, " What is the use of this Parliament and its flummery to us if, when we send men to Parliament to represent us, we find that, instead of being allowed to speak freely, their words are censored?" The people see that when members are written to the correspondence is interfered with ; and there is started in the minds of the people agitation that may lead us into revolution before we know it. The people ought to be given every opportunity through a free and open Parliament to legislate in the interests of the community, and only in this way shall we avoid revolutionary ideas. Otherwise the only course will be to take the advice of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> which <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> gave many years ago, when I sat humbly at his feet - the advice that the moment we of the Labour party found the doors of Parliament shut against us w'e should have to take some other action. The moment we allow any interference by an outside body with our rights and privileges the parliamentary institution is doomed, and the people will adopt other means of carrying out desired reforms. If we allow this interference with Parliament the day of reckoning will inevitably come, and on the heads of those who allow it will rest the responsibility. </para>

                            <para>.- I take this opportunity of referring to several matters affecting the Speakership and the forms of the House, because I know from experience the difficulty of doing so when the  Speaker  is in the Chair. The war has terminated, and we are told that we are to live in a new world. I hope that we shall show that this is a sane - Parliament, and that its members understand their responsibilities as representatives of the people. I have always objected to the  Speaker  wearing a wig and gown. Such robes are entirely out of place in a democratic Parliament. The horsehair wig is an obstruction to the Speaker's 'hearing, and, moreover, makes him look a perfect guy. It adds nothing to the dignity of the House, and the Legislatures of America, France, Switzerland, and some of the Australian States, realizing that the wig and gown are superfluous, have abolished them. To-day the  President  of the Senate wears no wig. The only Commonwealth Parliament that has been of real service to Australia was that in which the Labour party was in power, and in which the  Speaker  of this House wore no wig. During the three years nothing was" lost, but something was gained, by the conduct of business without that ornament on the Speaker's head. In wearing a wig, the  Speaker  only follows old forms and customs, and we can very well start to drop forms and customs that impede the work of Parliament. I hope the  Speaker  will discontinue the wearing of the wig, so that when he is in the Chair he will look like a sane creature. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Another custom that has troubled me for a long -time is the use of the mace. This emblem has been abolished from all sane Parliaments, and, in my opinion, it is absolutely useless, and in no way contributes to the dignity of our proceedings. It does not encourage thrift or intelligence. After all, members of Parliament are supposed to be the creme <inline font-style="italic">de la creme</inline> of the people; that is why we are elected. Those honorable members who are new to the House will discover that when the  Speaker  is in the Chair, a plaster ornament, covered with gold leaf, is placed on the table, but ,as soon as we get into Committee, in which the business is of graver importance to the community, the mace is removed from the table, and hidden. On one occasion the State Parliament lost its mace, which was discovered, a long time later, in a Chinaman's garden, where it was used for the purpose of scaring crows. The Chinaman, finding that it was a failure for that work, treated it as the Chinese in Sydney treated their joss following a long period without rain. They obtained a new joss,  and, finding that 'rain fell shortly afterwards, they chopped up the old one. Similarly the Chinese gardeners treated that stupid and uncalled-for thing called the mace. I feel sure that if the people outside were appealed to, millions would vote against the continuance of such an article in this Chamber. Honorable members are in the same position as are directors of a company; we are here as directors of the affairs of the' nation, and we do not require a mace. The only use for it that I can imagine is to hit on the head an honorable member who becomes obstreperous. Any elector who watches from .die gallery the use of the mace must conclude that a Parliament which continues such a practice is very stupid. </para>
                        <para>The late  Speaker  followed the habit of some of his predecessors in regard to motions of dissent from -rulings. Whenever such a motion was tabled, the  Speaker  next day read to the House a memorandum, to which no honorable member paid the least attention. That memorandum would be f,ull of ancient history from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> which had nothing at all to do with this Parliament. Actually the  Speaker  of this House makes his own standing orders. He is a creature of the Government in the same way as are all honorable members sitting on the Treasury bench. </para>

                                <para>- My only object is to make this a sane Parliament and provide all possible facilities for the proper conduct of business, doing away with everything that is superfluous. Honorable members ought to jealously guard against, just as much as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should, any encroachment of their privileges. On one occasion when there was a disturbance in England the Duke of Cambridge, who was in command of the Household Troops at the time, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Brand, one of the finest Speakers the British Parliament ever had, whether he would accept the assistance of the military to guard Parliament, but the  Speaker  said, "When the civil police cannot control the people, it is for the Government to step in and remove the causes." That reply should be riveted on the memory of every honorable "member of this House. It is the civil authorities who should be called upon to protect our privileges, and we cannot do better than adhere to that principle, which has been so well established in the British Parliament. I how that in this new world, after the war, members of this new Parliament will set out to make it a sane body, and proceed to do the business which is so badly needed for the people. </para>

                                <para>- I have no wish to detain honorable members, but I hope that the few pearls of wisdom I have breathed this morning will not be lost. I have nothing to gain - I presume there will be no other nomination. If I were to nominate any one I would nominate myself, on the principle that charity begins at home, but I speak now because it is the only opportunity that honorable members have of ventilating any grievances in relation to the Speakership. Once the  Speaker  is elected he has the Government behind him, and any notice of objection or dissent from his ruling is placed "at the bottom of the business paper, where it remains until Parliament dissolves. No matter how much honorable members' privileges may be invaded, no matter how  heinous the offence may be, an honorable member has not the least opportunity of having the matter discussed unless the Government give him the opportunity of doing so. I am satisfied tha.t even if my words have no effect I am voicing the opinion of people outside. As representative of the people of East Sydney, I feel that I must avail myself of this opportunity of expressing their opinion. I should not be worthy of the trust they have placed in me if I did not do so, and so long as I have breath in my body and hold my present position, any one who  attempts  to interfere with my prerogatives as a representative will find himself in " Queer Street." I hope that the silly business of having a mace will be abolished. It only requires some one with courage to draw attention to it. I have had the courage to do so, and I believe that, as a result of the step I have taken, the  Speaker  elected to-day will have fully impressed upon him how stupid it is to continue the practice of using the mace. What advantage does the House gain when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> comes to open our proceedings preceded by the Serjeant-at-Arms with a stick on his shoulder? This is not a military body, nor is it a court martial. We are supposed to be the <inline font-style="italic">creme de la creme</inline> of the people, and we are elected to do the business of the country. Let us wipe out all these uncalled for practices of the past, and start off as a sane assembly; let our presiding officer sit as an ordinary citizen, displaying, not a wig, but his own hair. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> has enough hair on his head to enable him to occupy the position of  Speaker  as did his predecessor during the years 1910-13, when so much good business was done in this House by the Democrats who had the opportunity of governing the country. There is no wig in use in the Senate, nor in the great Assemblies of the Continent of Europe, nor in the House of Representatives or the Senate of , the UnitedStates of America. The members of those Legislatures realize their responsibilities just as much as we do, and they do not require any flummery or foolish uncalled-for ceremonies to enable them to conduct the business they are called upon to do. I feel confident that to-day I am doing justice to the people, as well as to the House, in asking for the removal of the two anomalies to which I have drawn attention. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to take advantage of this opportunity to protest against the Australian Parliament being a sweating institution. Undoubtedly the attendants are sweated, and every honorable member should know it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> already knows it. The  President  of the Senate knows that these men are being sweated. </para>

There is this duty devolving upon attendants in and about this House, namely, that they must dress. I suppose that their uniforms to-day would cost not less than ?12 or ?14 each. Every day the employees must be presentable in attending upon this institution. </para>

                                <para>- Not too bad, that medal! A medal which entitles one to travel upon one's public business is totally different from those brass buttons which distinguish the messengers and attendants generally from honorable members themselves; for, I suppose, that is why those things were first introduced. Possibly it was that some of- 'the attendants might have been mistaken for members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>I trust that when the honorable member for Lang is again placed in the office of  Speaker  he will see that this is not  a  sweating institution. It- is an outrage that men should be sweated when engaged in and about .the corridors of this Parliament; that they should be paid ?2 17s.  a  week, ?2 18s. ?3 0s. 6d., and ?3 ls. It is an outrage that they should be paid such wages for doing work which, outside the precincts of Parliament, is remunerated at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">?3</inline> 18s. and per week. Here, however, it would seem that we can do nothing else but sweat the men who are attending upon us, cleaning the building, and doing (work of the like nature. </para>
                        <para>I desire now to refer to another, and more serious, matter. During the panic of 1918 it was decided by the Government that the tongues of honorable members on this side should be curbed, and that if that could not be brought about, then, at any rate, we should 'be given no publicity so far as the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were concerned. The plot was hatched and a scheme was brought down to this House. It was submitted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should 'be given power to say whether or not the speeches of honorable members should he printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> accepted the responsibility, and carried out the job as he was expected to do. This is not a personal matter so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> and myself are concerned - it is a national matter. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> nor any other person in this community should have the right to say to an honorable member of this Parliament, " That which you have spoken in the Legislature of this country shall not be printed." Certain remarks which were censored, first of all by the military authorities, and their actions indorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> comprised a criticism of the intentions of Japan and of the aspirations of the Japanese towards Australia. I spoke upon those matters outside of this chamber before my constituents, but that which I said in this chamber was cut out of the official re- cord with the consent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> About four months afterwards in London, however, exactly similar material was used by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> before the Peace Conference. </para>
                        <para>It is to be hoped that no longer will it be said that this Parliament is a sweating institution, that men are engaged in their duties here at less than a living wage - men who are being sweated. Also, I trust that never again will it be said that speeches delivered in this House have been allowed to be censored by a Speaker. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not wish to labour this discussion or to refer at length to matters which we may 'be able to deal with more or less adequately when a  Speaker  has been appointed. Neither do I intend to take this opportunity of saying those harsh and unkind things about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> which I am quite sure he expects from me. As a matter of fact, I make no complaint about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson.</inline> On several occasions he was conspicuously fair to me. He imposed certain limitations on my right to discuss  the character of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> which, I thought, were very unfortunate, because I felt that the limitations of the English language already imposed restrictions sufficient when one was dealing with the character and capacity of the right honorable gentleman who is still Prime Minister. However, all I can say is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline> is re-elected  Speaker,  I shall enter this Parliament in the confident hope and belief that we will get on excellently together. I now invite him to treat me even more fairly than he did in the last Parliament; to extend to me that, measure of friendliness and fatherly solicitude that I have a right to expect from him as an bid parliamentarian and not that he shall read the Standing Orders with a too rigorous strictness when I am endeavouring to deal with public problems. But I should remark here that it is- by no means a foregone conclusion that, the honorable member for Lang is to be elected  Speaker  on this occasion. Upon his having been nominated I do not think that we have exhausted the talent -of this House. I therefore move, by way of amendment - </para>

                                <para>- He has also- and he has given very recent evidence of it - a very graceful and ornate diction, and his pronunciation of the vowel sounds has been more than once the subject of high encomiums.  His  knowledge of the forms of the House has been amply demonstrated' to-day, as well as on other occasions. He is a distinguished member of the party to which I belong, and Labour members might well follow the example of those  of  other parties by electing to the judicial position of presiding officer a man who is likely to help his own side. If I secure the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> George Mahony to the position of  Speaker,  I shall have done what I rose to do.

                            <para>.- This seems an appropriate occasion to refer to the manner in which the names of honorable members appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, which, so far as this House is concerned, are, I understand, under the control of the  Speaker.  I have before me a volume of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record  of  last session, in which I find military titles attached to the names of some members who had served, or were then serving, in the Australian Imperial Force, although no recognition is made of the military services of other members. For instance, Lt.-Colonel Abbott and Major-General Ryrie are given their military titles, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corboy, Mr. Heitmann, Mr. McGrath, Mr. Yates, Mr. Fleming,</inline> and others who had also served or were serving are not referred to in their military capacity, apparently because they did not hold sufficiently high commissioned rank. In my view, if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> de Laune Eyrie, K.C.M.G., CB., is entitled to the publication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> week after week, of all his prefixes and suffixes, members who served in any military capacity should be given some similar recognition of their services. </para>

                                <para>- All that I contend for is that if the services of a major-general or a colonel are to be recognised, the services of those who held lower rank should be similarly recognised. The  Speaker  should not differentiate between one set of men and another. Even Captain Bruce was given no recognition during the last Parliament of his military services, although he held commissioned rank. I recommend this matter to the attention of the  Speaker,  when elected. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Darling has referred .to the lowness of the wages paid to the attendants of this Parliament. It has come to my knowledge that, although some of our waiters have just had their wages increased to ?3 6s. per week, there is deducted from that amount the sum of 9d. for each meal. I hope that whoever may be elected to the high and important position of  Speaker  will see that these men arc better paid, and will increase their wages to at least the amount of the living allowance in force in New South Wales, and will also put a stop to the deduction of 9d. per meal. No waiter in private employment has to pay such a charge when receiving' only ?3 6s. a week in wages. It must be remembered that our waiters are often in attendance for very long hours. They may be required to remain here until midnight, or even until 4 o'clock in the morning. The high cost of clothing and other necessaries makes their conditions very hard, and they are entitled to at least as much consideration as other persons. </para>

Honorable members may not be aware, yet it is a fact, that this Parliament House is owned, not by the people of Australia, but by the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives ; though if there is anything wrong it- is the fault of Parliament itself. . At one time there was here a  Clerk  of Parliaments who owned the buildings, and was in charge of the gardens, too. There were then most peculiar notions held on the subject of control. </para>

                                <para>- He has passed away, so that I shall not give his name. The House Committee is a joint body, composed of members from both Houses; but it is a farce, .because it has no control. When it meets, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the.  President  are very courteous when we wait upon them in regard to these matters, but we can get nothing more than courtesy from them. The House Committee may determine upon a certain course of action, yet be prevented from giving effect to it. Every one knows that the wages which our attendants are receiving are a disgrace. But why should we hide behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the President? The fault rests, not with them, but with Parliament itself. The  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> have no control over the public purse. They must obtain supplies from the Treasury, and if employees of the Parliament are sweated, we must blame, not the  President  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but the Parliament itself. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is in the chair the House should have power to- instruct him as to what shall be done in regard to all such matters. I want the people- to realize that they do not own the Parliament buildings. Under the present system they are owned by the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and while we continue to allow them to control them, and give them- no power over the public purse, I shall not blame them for the low wages paid to parliamentary officers. Honorable members will admit that it is practically impossible for a man with a wife and three children to live on a wage of ?3 6s. a week; yet many of our attendants receive an even lower wage. Despite our knowledge as to the* cost of living, we go on sweating officers and attendants of the House. I hope we shall talk no more about this question, but see to it that a living wage is paid to all parliamentary employees. I call upon the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to see that a living wage is paid them. The Victorian Railways Board has fixed upon lis. 9d. per day as the minimum wage that should be paid in that Department, and that, I think, is little enough. We have parliamentary officers who are receiving less. We should bring up the minimum wage to the rate prevailing in New South Wales. A man with a wife and three children cannot exist with any degree of comfort on less than ?4 a week. That should be the irreducible minimum, and it is up to us to see that the wages of our attendants are increased. If they are not, then we must blame, not the  President  or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but ourselves. </para>

                            <para>.- I rise in a spirit of fair play to make sure that new members of. the House shall not wrongly blame the honorable member for Lang for the failure to pay our attendants a reasonable wage. I know that it was not his fault, as  Speaker  in the last Parliament, that parliamentary officers received, and still receive, less than ?3 a week. When I put a question te him on the subject he unwittingly gave me an inaccurate answer, which had been supplied to him. If there be any blame in this matter - and I maintain that there is - it rests with the  President  of the Senate. I regret to have to' make such a statement, since I have been friendly with the  President  for many years; hut I certainly do not like to see him, as  President,  paying less than trade union wages. It may he news to many honorable members that on the dissolution of this House the typists attached to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were given a four-months' holiday without pay. That is unfair. When we go into recess, our allowance continues. Security of tenure is the best guarantee of good service. Everybody employed in this building should be regarded as an " officer " of Parliament, and be granted, from the highest to the lowest, the same holiday leave. The honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> will agree with me that generals unaided cannot win a war. Wars have been won by privates in an army - as, for instance, by Xenophon - after all the officers have been removed, and. sometimes men have won a battle in spite of their generals. Happily, that was not our experience in the recent war. I am sure the honorable member will agree with me that all officers of the Parliament should participate in any holiday system associated with' it. </para>

                        <para>I little thought when, at the opening of the first session of the last Parliament, I introduced this means of ventilating a grievance that it would be again resorted to. I availed myself of it on that occasion because I felt that I had been unfairly treated in connexion with the deletion of a sworn declaration from the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and desired to have it again placed on record. The declaration, which related to an incident in the House, was deleted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on the motion of the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and I seconded that motion because the right honorable member gave me an assurance that he would inquire into the incident. To his credit, be it said, he has told the honorable member concerned that he ought to apologize to me and so end the incident; but that has not been done. Those who wish to make themselves familiar with the purport of the declaration will find it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume lxxxii., page 22, of 14th June, 1917. </para>
                        <para>I am confident that if the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. Elliot Johnson)</inline> is elected as  Speaker  his position will be strengthened as a result of this debate. I think I am right in saying that when, during the war, the parliamentary buildings were invaded by military officers, acting under powers conferred on them by the War . Precautions Act, he was not in Melbourne, but that the  President  of the Senate was. If that statement is incorrect I hope I shall be corrected, because I desire to be perfectly fair, and would not, even by imputation, wrong any man. The only incident of the kind that I can recall from the pages of British history is that made by a great Englishman, who entered the House of Commons and removed the Mace. Had Cromwell been a king he would have been called a great man, hut because he rose from the ranks of the humble he was not so regarded. Another honorable member of this House and I, while in London, narrowly escaped trouble because of an accusation that we had thrown a rose on the magnificent statue of Oliver Cromwell, erected near Westminster. </para>
                        <para>We must take up a strong position as to military or any other authorities having power to enter these buildings without the permission of the presiding officers. On the occasion to which reference has been made, I was denied entrance to the building by a junior military officer, who asked me who I was, and who, when I showed him my member's badge, said he wanted something more than that - he would be content only with a card issued by his Department. I got into the House; but I resent the action of the military. The parliamentary institutions of British communities have reached their present stage by means of many a fight. England had the vilest franchise in the world previous to the war, though to-day she has a very fair one. This, however, has only been, achieved by continuous fighting. While continental countries retained the autocracy of monarchy, England cut its head off in the time of Cromwell, and every succeeding George has found' Parliament making itself more powerful. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> and I also appeal to my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahony</inline> - if by some unlikely chance the latter be elected - to, under no circumstances, permit the military to take possession of Parliament, and interfere with its rights and privileges, which are the great heirloom of the British race. </para>

I take  it  that my re-election is an  acknowledgment  on the part of those with whom I have been  associated previously of  the  manner  in which I have conducted hitherto the duties pertaining to this high office. I listened to the debate upon the motion submitted by the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> and seconded by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> and I heard a good many things which were a surprise to me. Many inaccuracies, I venture to say, were unconsciously uttered by honorable members. I very much regret that the question of the treatment of servants of the House has been imported into the debate, because it might possibly hamper the Presiding Officer in connexion with any action which he might contemplate taking in certain directions. Since it would be difficult to avoid the suspicion of action being due to political pressure, I may say at once that political pressure as far as I am concerned would not induce me to take any course which I did not approve myself. I know nothing of any officers of the House having been sweated, and, as a matter of fact, few public servants have, on the whole, as easy a time as the attendants of the Parliament. No mention of this matter has been made to me on any previous occasion; the occasions on which advances have been made to the salaries of officers have been during my occupancy of the Speakership. At no time during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of any other Speaker was this question raised. </para>

                                <para>- I know nothing about that promise. But I say that I have never heard, before any allegation of sweating. Certainly no individual case of sweating has ever been brought under my notice. So far as I have been able to judge, the attendants of the House have had little to complain of in regard to the duties which they have been asked to perform. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members know me well enough to accept my assurance that no attendant of the House would be dismissed on that ground. I deprecate the use of political influence in regard to these matters. The attendants of the House are allowed as many holidays as I can possibly give them during the year. Except during the time when Parliament is sitting, they are not asked to be in attendance for long hours, and in order to make up for any inconvenience they may have suffered in consequence of honorable members themselves sitting and working beyond the hours allotted to the. performance of duties in ordinary avocations, they have been allowed, as far as I was able to do it, increased holidays. I think they have very little to complain of in that regard. I will say no more on that subject at the present time beyond the intimation that the whole matter will shortly be considered, quite irrespective of what has just transpired. I repeat my appreciation of the honour which honorable members have done me in re-electing me to the position of  Speaker,  and I assure them that I shall endeavour to conduct the business of the House with the same care and attention as I devoted to it in the past. </para>

                        <para class="block">I am at a loss to understand why the appearance of the Mace on the table should have much the same effect upon some honorable members as a red rag is supposed to have on a bull. But I remind honorable members that the Mace which lies on the table is the symbol of the authority of the House. It is the symbol of the supreme authority of Parliament, and if honorable members would only read the Standing Orders they would find that it is placed on the table in accordance with them. While the  Speaker  is the mouth-piece of the House, the Standing Orders are the voice of the House. It is the voice of the House which says that the Mace shall be placed on the table. With reference to what honorable members have termed the " invasion " of the military in certain circumstances, the episode referred to as such occurred during my absence from the House, when I was in Sydney. Upon its being reported to me, I took certain steps to safeguard the privileges of Parliament, and on reporting my action to the House, honorable members approved of what I had done. Therefore, I had the concurrence and authority of the House for whatever steps I took on that occasion. Then, in reference to honorable members' speeches in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> it must be remembered that during the period of the war the House gave me the. instruction, as its presiding officer, to take a certain course in certain circumstances, when representations were made by the Crown Law officers regarding certain references in the speeches of honorable members. </para>

                                <para>- I take it that if the circumstances necessitated it, it would be resorted to during war time. Things which would not be tolerated in ordinary times are often necessary in war time. However, I want honorable members to understand explicitly that whatever was done on that occasion was done by the order of the House. Mention has also been made of certain functions in this House in which the military were concerned, and I take it that the reference was to the use of the steps in front of the House on occasions of military reviews, and so forth. On  such occasions the practice is for applications to be made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for permission to make use of the steps, and all the arrangements in connexion with the disposition of the space are left in the hands of the military authorities, always subject to the proviso that there is not to be the slightest interference with the free ingress and egress of honorable members. I regret to say there have been one or two cases in which that proviso has been disregarded, and honorable members have made complaints to me of interference, but in every such case I have taken prompt action to protest to the military authorities against that interference, and ask for assurances that it would not be repeated in future, which assurances I have duly received. Again, I thank honorable members for the honour they have conferred on me. I shall endeavour to carry out the duties of the office with perfect impartiality, and, I hope, in accordance with what we recognise as the best traditions of the Mother of Parliaments. </para>

It is the third Parliament in which you have occupied the highest office that the House has at its disposal. During the intervening periods you have witnessed many stirring episodes, and your life, like ours, has been a chequered one, but I think we can all say of you, what every man who occupies your position would wish his fellow members to say, that you have meted out evenhanded justice to us all. Of course, justice <inline font-style="italic">does not</inline> always appeal to those who receive it as it does to those who stand afar off and watch the flagellator at his work; but as one who has been on both sides of the House under your presidency, I may say that you have always demeaned yourself with that dignity and regard for fair play which is the very essence of parliamentary government. It is, perhaps, impossible to hope that this Parliament shall pass away without some one of those smiling gentlemen before you forgetting that very excellent advice you have just now and from time to time given them; but I venture to say that all of us, no matter what our opinions may be - and this is a House where there are many opinions - realize that you take the position fully seized of its dignity and importance, and with a high resolution to do your duty, and allow every honorable member the fullest possible liberty of  Speech  in accordance with the Standing Orders. Again  I  congratulate you on your elevation to  the  office, and the House on having once more secured your services. </para>

                            <para>. -  I also desire to congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on being re-elected.  I  think that, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder, you are the only  Speaker  who has had the honour of. presiding over a third Parliament.  I  admit that we are apt to regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> decisions according to the side of the House on which we sit, but  I  can remember the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> saying worse things about a  Speaker  than any other honorable member who has sat in Opposition has ever said.  I  remember when the then  Speaker  "saw" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Agar</inline> Wynne instead of the Prime Minister, the wrath of the latter knew no bounds, and honorable members who were in the chamber at the time were doubtful whether the Mace was to be used as a symbol or as a waddy for the purpose of drawing the attention of people outside to the alleged unfairness of the Chair.  I  realize that the  Speaker  has a most responsible position to fill, but I hope that he will view the Standing Orders leniently as they are applied to honorable members, particularly those in Opposition.  I  shall have a further opportunity to speak with regard to the Standing Orders in connexion with an election to fill another position which is to follow.  I  shall, therefore, content myself with again expressing my congratulations to you, sir, upon your re-election. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McWILLIAMS</inline> (Franklin)  [12.40].-  On behalf of the Country party,  I  desire also to congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Our parliamentary association has been a very long one, and  I  have always found you scrupulously fair. Personally, it has not been so much justice which  I  have had at times to seek at your hands, as mercy.  1  trust that the relations existing between yourself, myself, and other honorable members will' continue throughout the life of this new Parliament, and that when its activities shall have ceased, there will still be the same happy relationships as exist at the present time. </para>

                            <para class="block">Since it is the- practice for leaders of all the various parties within this Chamber to express their congratulations upon an occasion such as this, I think it only proper that I also should follow the custom - not that I see any sense in it, but because it is obviously one's duty to follow tradition. I, therefore, desire to congratulate you, sir, and to thank you for the fair play and the constant mercy which yom have shown to me, the which, I humbly appeal, shall continue to be extended to me in the future. I am very pleased that you were elected, although it was not my privilege to have voted for you. You will perceive, sir, and appreciate, that I am the same slave of party as ever - having neither will nor brain which I may call my own. It appears, however, that a certain honorable member had proposed, in opposition to yourself, the election as  Speaker  of somebody of the name of William Michael Patrick Mahony. Some such person as that was sought to be elevated to the high office of  Speaker  of this honorable House! I felt at once that there was a sinister influence behind an amendment having for its object the elevation of anybody bearing such a ' name. I repeat that I was impressed at once that my country was in dire danger. I saw the Black Hand of Sinn Fein, of the Fenian Brotherhood, of the Irish Invincibles, and of the Soviets of Russia. Nevertheless, I was shackled; I was prevented from voting for the man in whose hands were to be placed the safekeeping ' and security of those sacred principles of Protestantism which rest now, sir, in yourself. I knew, what the election of anybody meant who went by the name of Mahony. I saw there the baneful hand of the O'Ryan, and of the Mannix. The hand of Rome was mixed up in it; and, slave though I am, I realized that those sacred principles of Protestantism, which secure a man protection from poverty, from unemployment, from destitution, and bad debts, rested upon yourself. Therefore, I cannot now permit the opportunity to pass without congratulating you upon, your election to the Speakership of this honorable House. I feel that you will capably perform the duties attaching thereto. </para>
                            <para>But there are other matters. It seems that these rebels upon this side have actually dared, to raise the question of military intervention and aggression  upon these precincts. By their protests it would appear that these rebels also stand upon ceremony and privilege; but I assert that neither ceremony nor privilege shall prevail when the necessities of our country otherwise demand. Is this sacred Chamber to be the dug-out. of rebellion? No, sir ! There is only one right, and that is the right of might, sir. This is the doctrine, " You do what you can today, for I hope and expect to do the same to-morrow." This Chamber shall never grant protection to the enemies of my country : and every man who disagrees with me upon that is certainly disloyal. Why should not the military enter here? Why should not some authority - anybody - interfere with,, our correspondence, seize upon any man's letters, so long as you in your position of  Speaker,  sir, are there to maintain those principles which I have already stressed ? Are you - holding your high office - to permit me or any man upon this side to have correspondence or to hold association at all with the enemies of my country, without your taking adequate steps for the protection and salvation of this country? Every instrument available to you should be utilized to defend your country and my country and  its institutions from those who dare to disagree with you. Disagreement, as a matter of fact, is the sole test of patriotism and of loyalty to one's country. Let us stand convinced, let us rest assured, that he who robs our hen-roost to-day may, and even shall, have his hen-roost robbed to-morrow. </para>
                            <para> A question has been raised in connexion with the menials of this establishment. It is true, or I believe it to be a fact, that there is discontent abroad throughout the community, and that it has displayed itself even within the precincts of this sacred House. There is a discontent rampant throughout our land which has been generally brought about by an odious class of agitators who, in a free community, ought not to be allowed to exist. This discontent, I repeat, has spread itself even unto this establishment. For the actions which you have hitherto' taken to counter it, I, of course, do not blame you, because I feel that you would not permit - that, indeed, you would not have it in your altruistic heart - that anybody should receive less than he is getting ! I call attention to the fact that there are within these precincts officials, many of them well secured in the things of this life. What matters it to them if the price of bread is raised 3d. or 6d. a loaf? They have their ?600 per 'annum, their ?700, their ?800. Their emoluments during the period of the war have been granted by the pound sterling, while those of these petty menials have been disbursed only in shillings. And why not? It is quite true that these comfortable officials might conceivably see their way clear to recommend a decent standard of existence for the menials engaged about this building; but why should they do so seeing that every augmentation of a menial's wage might possibly mean less bonus for those higher up? Every man must look to himself! If I am on the ?600 mark, why should I go to the trouble and hazard of recommending that the men away down in the service of this Parliament, who get ?3 or ?4 a week, should receive another pound, seeing that I might get that pound myself? Some of these lowly persons have complained to certain rebels upon this side - it would appear - that they have actually to wear brass buttons. Why should they not wear brass buttons in order to show their insignificance? This is a spirit, of rebellion. But there is another thing also Apart from the discontent itself, it is equally true, I understand, that they are not permitted to join any organization, although there is a Public Service organization in existence to which one might have thought they had right of membership. It appears, however, that they have been given plainly to understand that there is no Public Service organization which can take them in. Of course, it is obnoxious to feel that they should be under the impression that they can remedy their causes of discontent by stating their ' complaints to these rebels upon this side of the chamber. As a matter of fact, the very consideration of their being in such close contact with men of attainments such as ourselves should weigh considerably with them. They ought to realize that the workers on the wharfs cannot possess the advantage of daily contact with personages like us. It is an education; it is worth money; but these menials do not regard it as any factor of value or satisfaction that they should be so closely and continuously thrown into association with ourselves. Some of them, apparently, assess their own values upon the positions which they are permitted to hold; and, with an absurd expectation of improving their conditions, 'they have actually held communication with certain of these obnoxious rebels here. Of course, they would not dare to go to you, sir, so they speak to these people upon this side, and get them to bring forward their grievances and air the alleged defects of their occupations. Upon any and every occasion when political influence is brought to bear with an idea of improving their positions, it is but right and natural that we should point out to these servants how absolutely wrong and misguided they are. </para>
                            <para>But our common safety demands that we should do something in the direction of their alleviation. We are at the mercy of these men. If this spirit of discontent is allowed to continue - and God knows what it is; I do not know whether it is Bolshevik or Sinn Fein, or the two in combination - it behoves us to have regard for our personal safety. Who knows but that one of the valets who waits upon us at table may poison our soup? In self-preservation, then, it seems that we should pay consideration to these men. I hope that you will give them what they should get, 'not because their services are worth it, but for the protection of honorable members. </para>
                            <para>Now, is there any other subject on which I should speak? I feel that this is one of the few opportunities that we shall have for the expression- of our views. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> seldom that I address myself to the Parliament; indeed, I disturb you very little, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and when I do speak I contribute to the welfare and harmony of the assembly. But the flood of volubility to which I have listened this morning has infected me with the wish to speak, much as a man may be infected with typhoid by contact with a sufferer. There is the military question. I say, do not let it disturb us. As for free speech, as the Prime Minister said, do not let it disturb us. If free speech becomes an annoyance, stop it. Do not let anything intervene against the_ interests of the country. We are about to enter upon a new session in a new Parliament. We are face to face with a great crisis in our history. We have just come through a war during which it was the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber who played the patriot, while the traitors and enemies of the country were, of course, all on this side. Do not permit us to stay here if the patriots are determined to save the country and we are in the way. The war is over, and we have entered into the paradise which has been created by the gentlemen who sit behind the Government. We are about to deal with the situation which has "been created. We have the problems of the country to consider. The Government propose to set everything right by an increase of 21/2 per cent, or so in the duty on salt and pepper and similar things. That is their way of facing the issue; that is how they are to get kudos. I do not intend to occupy much time in speaking here, because I can find other occupation which will be more pleasant to me personally and of more service to the country. This is my first speech in this Parliament, and it may for some time to come be my only speech. I welcome you gentlemen opposite to the responsibilities which now confront you. You will undoubtedly face them boldly, and, as far as men holding forty-seven different views can do so, will come to bold conclusions and to plans as definite as is possible to men who possess no definite ideas regarding the situation. I again congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on your election, and cry " God save the country!" </para>

I once more give you my assurance that I shall do my best to carry out impartially, in accordance with what I believe to be the best traditions of the Mother of Parliaments, the duties of this high office, and I hope that at the conclusion of my term of Speakership it will be admitted, even though I may not have secured the united approval of honorable members, that making allowance for the frailty of human nature and the misunderstanding that is so often created, even by the best intentioned efforts, I have given the best that was in me. When a private member, I sometimes felt that a  Speaker  had been somewhat unfair to me, but on reflection it has occurred to me, especially after personal experience in the chair, that recognition must be given to the difficulties of the position of a Presiding Officer. I hope that honorable members will give me credit for the best intentions regarding them individually and collectively. </para>

                    <para>It is with feelings of profound sadness that I submit this motion. Time has diminished members of this House who had the honour and privilege of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton's acquaintance and enjoyed the inestimable benefit of his friendship. There  are,  however, many here who knew him well ; and there is not one who knew him, either here or in any other sphere, but who entertained for him during his life the profoundest respect, and now regrets very deeply his death. For the last forty years he played a conspicuous part in the history of this country. In the State of New South Wales, which was his native State, he achieved a position of great distinction. He deliberately put aside a career in his own profession which offered him great opportunities and great emoluments, and entered public life; and both in the State of New South Wales and, subsequently, in the wider sphere of the Commonwealth, he devoted himself unselfishly to his country's interests. He was one of the men who drafted the Constitution of the Commonwealth under which we now live. He was the leader, after <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, of that great movement which resulted in Federation. In this Parliament he played the part of the Prime Minister of the first Commonwealth Government, and he showed to all who met him here, and to all our fellow-citizens outside, the rare pattern of his mind. He was a man who took the broadest outlook; nothing that was petty or mean was entertained by him for a moment. He differed from many of us on matters of public interest ; but I think I speak for all those who were in Parliament with him, both here and in the State of New South Wales, when I say that it was impossible to entertain for one of such kind and generous nature any but feelings of the highest respect, affection, and esteem. It is not necessary for me to speak of the part he played in the High Court of Australia.  His  great knowledge of constitutional law eminently fitted him to take a part in that highest tribunal of the Commonwealth, and to rank as the worthy peer of the eminent jurists who compose it. He has gone, and a great man - great in the best sense of the term - has passed away. He was a scholar, an orator, a statesman, and a Judge; but, above all, he was a patriotic, honorable, great man. It is, perhaps, those qualities which make up what we call a man, and which endear those who possess them ' to their fellow -creatures, that mark him out and endear him to us. Australia mourns one of her greatest sons. It is with very deep regret that I have to submit this motion, and ask that it be placed on record, and a copy sent to Lady Barton. </para>

                        <para>.- .-  It is with sincere regret that I second the motion. Like the Prime Minister, I am one of the few members left of those who were privileged to sit in the first Federal Parliament. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was, I believe, the last representative of the first Federal Ministry with the exception of an honorable member of this House who was an Honorary Minister in the Cabinet. I regret exceedingly that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who had rendered such great service to the Commonwealth, was called away so suddenly. On behalf of honorable members on this side, I sympathize with Lady Barton and her family in the lost they have sustained. The work done by the deceased gentleman in connexion with Federation is well known. Those who knew him in this House recognise that he was eminently fair, and although we on this side differed from him politically, we have only the kindliest recollections of him. I deeply regret that such a fine career is ended. </para>

                            <para>. - I rise to add a few words in support of the motion. All who were brought in contact with the deceased gentleman must have been struck with his ability and nobility of character; he was a true Australian and a true gentleman. No eulogy that we could pass upon him in this House would be nearly so lasting .as the monument he created in the form of the freest and best Constitution ever created for any country. The work he did in stamping indelibly on that Constitution his own personality and ability will live for many generations. The equal of that Constitution has never been enjoyed by' any people, and most of all that is best in it is owing to the personality, individuality, and ability of the gentleman whose decease we all mourn. </para>

                            <para>.- I join in the expressions of deep regret at the loss of a great Britisher - an Australian of the Australians - who did his duty as a man. A few days ago, when travelling on the East- West Railway, and while the train was at the station named after the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, a passenger asked me why the deceased gentleman was not allowed to crown a glorious career by accepting the office of Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. My answer was that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was the only man who could state the reasons why the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton had not been honoured with a law position that is unique in the world, namely, the Chief Justiceship of a continent.  His  career was great in all things - great in friendship, great in humanity, and great in the desire to do good for Australia. What a fitting end it would have been to his public life if he had had the honour of being made Chief Justice of the High Court. I regard this as the psychological moment for asking why the Chief Justice of the High Court was picked from amongst barristers who have never had one hour's judicial experience? Is it that when gentlemen are elevated to high positions on the Bench they become fossilized, and cannot improve ? ' Is there any other profession in the world in which the highest positions are filled from amongst the students? I. make my protest that that great man was passed over in favour of a man who was a mere barrister, being not even a Judge. Was it because of political influence? It may be said that the health of the deceased gentleman was not good, but we know that the late Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, who draws the biggest old-age pension paid to any man in Australia, and who, to his infamy, after drawing ?86,000 of Australian money in salary accepted a pension of. ?1,750, was ill, but could remain on the Bench. Loving the man Barton as if he were my own flesh and blood, and knowing his greatness, I resent that he was not considered fit to be made Chief Justice of the High Court. Owing to his courtesy I was enabled to present to the High Court a motion indorsed by 5,000 citizens at public meetings in Melbourne, protesting against the insult offered to a Justice of that Court on his first taking his seat, when 'all the barristers present, except one, crawled out of the Court like whipped puppies. The Judge whom they had insulted was an honour to the Bench, and succeeded greatly; and I believe that even the legal fraternity, who walked out of Court when he first took his seat, have complimented him since. Loving the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton as a man, I protest that he, in my opinion, should not have been passed over by the Government when making an appointment to the Chief Justiceship of the High Court. To the dear woman who shared his life, and to those who will bear his name in the years to come, the only solace I may offer is that those whom we have loved best in this life and lost will but add to the numbers who will welcome us when our turn comes to pass through the shadows. Those bearing the name of Barton must feel their hearts pulse with pride when they look upon his record, and know how he was held in reverence and regard by his fellow men. That knowledge will, I hope, help the dear lady and her family to bear the great loss they have sustained. </para>

                            <para>. -  I ask no pardon for saying a few words concerning my old chief. I regret the criticism offered by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> because it seems to me that this is not the occasion for introducing a discordant note of that kind. Let me say, for the information of other honorable members, that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was offered the position of first Chief Justice of Australia, but declined it. To his credit he preferred the unselfish course, and to take one of the subordinate positions on the Bench. In my opinion, he was the greatest man who ever sat in this House. I have sat at the feet of, and worked alongside, most of them, and, with due deference to the giants of today, and the present Prime Minister, who has done so much for Australia, I regard the deceased gentleman as the greatest of them all. He was not afraid to speak his mind freely and frankly to his opponents, but whilst he had many opponents, he had no enemies. When the first High Court Bench was appointed, he stood aside in deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. What happened in later years we all know.  His  health failed, and probably that fact influenced those who had to appoint a Chief Justice when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith retired. At any rate, we owe him a great debt of gratitude for his services to Australia, and it was with pleasure that I listened to the feeling remarks that fell from the lips of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> I am sure that <inline font-style="italic">all who</inline> knew the late Judge indorse those remarks and tender their most sincere sympathy to those who have been bereaved. </para>

                            <para>. -  I indorse all that has been said regarding the services of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. I think, however, it would not be right to allow the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> to be placed on record without challenge, lest it should seem that the passing over of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, in connexion with the Chief Justiceship recently, was a slight upon that distinguished jurist. I was exceedingly glad that, notwithstanding the pre-eminent position held by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, the Ministry did not offer him the Chief Justiceship. I hold strongly to the sound constitutional tradition that once a Judge is appointed to the Bench he should not be able to receive any favours from the Government of the day. I hope that tradition will never be departed from. I am glad that this valuable precedent has been created - that no matter how great the services of a Judge may have been, when the question of appointing a Chief Justice arises, Governments will not reward or punish gentlemen on the Bench for decisions they may have given. The Executive should not be able to offer any inducement to Judges to deviate in the slightest degree from the duty they owe to litigants who have claims against the Government. I am certain that, in following that sound and righteous course in connexion with the selection of the Federal Chief Justice, the Government, no more than this Parliament, wished to pass any slight upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who stood pre-eminent amongst the great judicial minds of this country. </para>

The Minister for Defence and I, indeed, the whole of the Government, realize that something should be done in this direction. The Permanent Military Forces of Australia have Tendered very great service during the great war. In fact, it was largely due to those forces that we were able to send such an efficient army overseas. </para>

I do not know whether the Central Wool Committee is running the country, as the honorable member asserts. That momentous issue has not yet come before me, and it has not occurred to me that it is doing so. However, I hope to he able to make an announcement within a few days in re gard to the wool-tops matter which the deputation brought before me a week or so ago. </para>

                    <para>We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your  Excellency  for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament." </para>

                <para>The Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General intimated that the state of war with Germany had been concluded' by the final ratification of the Peace Treaty on the 10th January. We are all most heartily pleased that that state of war has come to an end. At the same time, however, we have to consider that the war feeling has not by any means subsided. In Europe, and in other parts of the world, there is still a very unsettled state of affairs; it is obvious that it requires only the faintest breeze to fan the flames of discontent into another war. We hear of the propaganda of the Russian Bolshevik now being circulated throughout the world. We are aware of the encouragement given to that propaganda by tie lackadaisical manner in which the Peace Conference has been dealing with questions arising from the Peace Treaty, and we have noted the further encouragement provided by the delay on the part of the United States of America in respect to the ratification of the Treaty. So, although the state of war is officially at an end, we are still faced with unsettled conditions all over the world, and, consequently, we must be prepared for any eventualities. </para>
                <para>With respect to the mandates given to us over certain of the Pacific Islands, and which mandates have not yet been ratified, we know that there are, quite close to Australia, immense territories which at present are being exceptionally badly administered. The sooner the Peace Treaty is ratified - with or without the indorsement of the United States - the better it will be for the interests of Australia. Meanwhile the development of these islands is being delayed. Unfortunately, we have no authority to move in the direction of their development, and we find that trade which should be coming to Australia is being diverted. Unless we can very quickly grasp the situation, the trade of those islands will have been permanently turned aside from- the Commonwealth. The right way in which to develop the islands is by private enterprise. We do not desire , to* witness there the establishment of any socialistic enterprise that would amount, officially, to a condition' of working for the good of the State, but in which each man would be actually working for what he could make for himself. I would impress upon the Government the desirability of giving every encouragement to private enterprise in the development of these islands.  There  are, at the present time, in Australia, companies which are asking for permission to prospect and work them, and, as soon as the mandates have been officially settled, we should take every step to turn them into profitable assets of the Commonwealth. It is strongly suspected that oil deposits are to be found there. American engineers were brought out at great expense, and are now supposed to  be  at work there under the joint control of the British and Australian Governments, but they are doing nothing to develop the oil-fields. Australia will be more dependent upon oil in the future than she has been in the past, and it therefore behoves us to test and develop our oil resources to the utmost. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Government finds itself in a very serious position financially, and the money markets of the world are very tight. Immense loans are outstanding, and there are great public works which should he undertaken, and for the carrying out of which the 'Government must give financial assistance. There are great difficulties in the way of doing this, but means must be found for surmounting them. The development of Australia, and of the islands under her control, must not be kept back; and, if things are properly taken in hand and sufficient courage is shown in administration, we shall quickly be repaid the expenditure that we incur. The construction of railways is necessary to develop the central parts of this continent, where there are huge areas of undeveloped pastoral country and vast mineral wealth lying absolutely untouched. Until proper transport facilities are provided, this part of our territory will not give us the return that we should get from it. </para>
                <para>I was pleased to hear the Governor-General declare that it is proposed to invite the representatives of the States who are parties to the River Murray water agreement to confer with the Government of the Commonwealth " with  a view  to expediting that great national  work." </para>
                <para class="block">The Murray Valley, if irrigated, would support a population greater than that now inhabiting Australia. 'Courage is needed for the carrying out of the necessary conservation schemes, but their completion .and the utilization of the resources which we shall' then possess will provide the Commonwealth with immense wealth. </para>
                <para>Our present method of collecting taxation is an extremely clumsy one. The Commonwealth imposes both a land tax and an income tax, and a land and an income tas: is imposed by the laws of, I think, every one of the States. I am pleased, therefore, to hear that a Royal Commission is to he appointed to consider the whole incidence of Commonwealth taxation. "What is needed is some satisfactory arrangement between the Commonwealth and State authorities as to methods of assessment and collection and as to the distribution of the proceeds of the taxes. In place of a Commonwealth and a State Department of Taxation in each of the six States, with  a  duplication of returns from the taxpayers,  we should have but one taxing authority. This would relieve the public of a great deal of trouble and annoyance, and would undoubtedly largely diminish the cost of collecting the taxes. I am of the opinion, however, that in the past Royal Commissions have been used largely to shelve inconvenient proposals, and that little has been done with their reports beyond putting them away as records. I hope, therefore, that, not only will there be an inquiry by a Royal 'Commission into the incidence of Commonwealth taxation, but that effect will be given as soon as* possible to the recommendations of the Commission. </para>
                <para>It is a  matter  of congratulation that it is intended to bring in an amending Repatriation Bill. I have had numerous complaints from soldiers who have been compelled to apply to three or four Departments to get their cases inquired into. This is unsatisfactory to the soldiers concerned, and to the administration. I hope that the Repatriation Department will be so re-arranged that all questions of repatriation can be considered and dealt with by one body. I would like to bring prominently under the notice of the Government the fac*  that the pension rates for disabled soldiers are extremely low. Only 30s. a week is given to men who have been totally disabled, and it is impossible for a man to live on such a pension. I hope that the Government may find money somehow or other to increase the pension for total disability. Great discontent is being caused by the difficulty which returned men have in getting land on which to settle. Except for the Federal Capital Territory, the Commonwealth Government have no land which it can place at the disposal of returned men, and no two of the State authorities are in agreement on matters of land settlement. In Victoria alone there are at the present time 6,000 men waiting for land, and some of them have been waiting for as long as twelve months. This state of things does not reflect credit upon those who are responsible for it. Our returned men are the best class of settlers that could be got, but the unnecessary and tiresome delays to which they are subjected tend to make applicants for land downhearted, and many of them are losing energy because of the manner in which they have been treated. </para>
                <para>In the interest of the development of our country districts greater postal facilities must be provided for country residents. Except as to the telephone service, the inhabitants of our cities have little cause of complaint, but those who go out into the back country need much greater facilities for communication. The country postal and other services will never be a paying' concern in actual pounds, shillings, and pence; but if a liberal  policy  is pursued by the Post Office the net gain to the community at large will be greater than any book loss that may be shown by the Department. I am very pleased that there are at least twelve or thirteen returned soldiers who are members of this Parliament. They have been repatriated fairly well, and I trust will make themselves felt here as they did overseas. The new Postmaster-General has had quite a number of questions to answer to-day, and- I hope that it may be his policy to provide  greatly  improved facilities for communication throughout the country. </para>
                <para>It is gratifying to know that the Commonwealth Bank is to extend its operations. I am sure that we are all agreed as to the wisdom of that. The Bank should have full control of all banking matters, and the more it competes with private banks the better it will be for the community. </para>
                <para>A very important question is that of the defence -of the country. The position of affairs in every part of the world is very uncertain at the present time and we must be prepared to defend the rights and privileges that we possess. Consequently, our Defence Department must be ready to immediately mobilize a sufficient number of men to defend the country should it be attacked. The low pay that is given to our Army instructors has already been referred to this afternoon. The whole of our permanent staff is inadequately paid. At the beginning of the war, Australian rates of pay were greater than those of the British Army, but at the present time a staff lieutenant in the Imperial Army receives as much for his work as a staff major in the Australian Army. If we want the best men for our Defence Forces - and we must have the best obtainable - we must adequately pay them. We can have nothing but praise for the work of our Instructional Staff, both before and during the war, and I was very pleased to hear the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> state, in answer to a question this afternoon, that the question of an increase of pay to, at all events, the lower arms of the Permanent Forces was being considered, and that there was a very big possibility of an increase being granted in the near future. </para>
                <para>There is one other matter relating to Defence on which I should like to touch, and it certainly requires some consideration. I am not in favour of our present system of promotion by seniority. We have, unfortunately, a number of deadbeats in our Permanent Forces, and by getting rid of them, we should be able, no doubt, to increase the pay of those who are deserving of it without adding to the capital expenditure of the Commonwealth. A branch of the Defence Force which possibly is going to come most to the fore in the near future is that of aviation. It is hopeless to expect the Government to expend the huge sums of money necessary to maintain a fighting aerial force, but we have in Australia many private commercial companies that are about to commercialize aviation, and by the Government giving these companies assistance and advice, recommending them the right type of machines to use, and practically insisting that they shall be easily convertible into war machines - as  commercial machines can be at the present time - we shall he able to form in. Australia the nucleus of a very large aviation force. We need go no further than the work performed by our own aviators during the recent war if we want testimony as to what they wills do on any future occasion. </para>
                <para>Whilst dealing with aviation, I wish to add my praise to that already given to Captain <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ross</inline> Smith and his crew. Those men have performed a deed which will go down in history as a record, not only for themselves, but of the enterprise of Australians. I should like to see some greater recognition than has yet been given to the mechanics who accompanied <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ross</inline> Smith. The two officers of the party have been knighted, and rightly so, but so far the mechanics on whom devolved most of the hard work, and most of the mechanical work relating to the engines, have received only bars to their Air Force medals. I should like to see honorary commissions given to both men. </para>

                <para>I am pleased to learn that the Government intend to drop all Government control over trade and commerce. During the war it was undoubtedly necessary that we should have various Pools established and maintained under Government supervision, but the time has come when the Government is going to shed that responsibility. It is now the duty of the primary producer to take control of his own industry, and to work it for the benefit of not only himself, but Australia as a whole. I am convinced that our primary producers will do that. By increasing the co-operative efforts which they have already adopted, they are going to do away with much of the commission charges which were originally responsible for the rise in the price of goods, and I am hopeful that once they get properly going in. this direction, they will increase their production to such an extent as to very quickly bring down the high cost of living. </para>
                <para class="block"> Tariff revision has been talked of for a long while. I hope that the Tariff now about to be introduced1 by the Government will raise a wall sufficiently high to keep out all competition. We want to encourage not only our primary but our secondary producers, but in helping the secondary producers of Australia, we do not wish to encourage them to work six hours a day, and to secure greater returns from their toil than does the primary producer for his sixteen or twenty hours' work a day. I hope, also, that the Tariff will be strongly proEmpire, and that the bonds which have united us with the Mother Country during the last five years are going to be increased by interchange of trade, and by our working within the Empire for the good of the Empire. Our minerals, of which we are going to have large quantities for export, should go first to the Mother Country. If that be our policy, there will not be the necessity that existed evidently this afternoon for putting a question to Ministers as to munition steel being exported to foreign countries. </para>
                <para>Our industrial situation at the present time is fairly acute. We have, unfortunately, gone from one dispute to another, with the result that we find that practically the whole of our industries are in an almost chaotic state. There can- be no doubt that the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act has failed. It has not accomplished what was hoped of it, and, consequently, it is time that an amended law dealing with the prevention of disputes, so far as the Commonwealth Constitution will permit us to legislate in that direction, should be brought into force. </para>

                <para>The question of shipping is of vital consequence to the Commonwealth, and therefore the Government shipbuilding programme that is now being pushed on with should be augmented. We have had, unfortunately, during the last ten or eleven weeks, a large number of ships lying idle, and we have to endeavour to overtake the arrears. The Commonwealth line of steamers has undoubtedly done much to keep down fares to and from Australia. It has also kept down freight charges, and has consequently been the means of bringing into the country a much greater amount of wealth than would otherwise have been secured. In these circumstances, we are going to push forward with the shipping programme, and to increase it at every opportunity. </para>
                <para>We have also to consider at the present time the population of the Commonwealth. Here we have an area greater than that of the United States of America, yet we have only 5,000,000 people inhabiting it. We have to increase our population. We want assistance in shouldering our financial burdens, and we need assistance in dealing with the great Defence problems that are arising. The best way in which we can immediately increase our population is by encouraging a suitable type of immigrants to come to Australia. We have in the United Kingdom, at the present time, hundreds of thousands of discharged soldiers who are awaiting an opportunity to come to Australia, but, unfortunately, we have in London six different States with six different immigration policies, each practically working against the other. We have no coordination of effort similar to that which characterizes, the Canadian Immigration Bureau. If the Commonwealth Government would set to work to co-ordinate the efforts of the States, giving us unity of purpose, and advertising, not one part of Australia, but the whole of it, . we should secure a suitable type of immigrant - a type of which we are urgently in need - and induce such people to come here in their thousands. That would undoubtedly assist us in shouldering the burden that we must carry for years to come. </para>
                <para>The establishment of a Bureau of Science and Industry was an absolute necessity. The Bureau is already doing good work. It is undoubtedly increasing production, and has fully justified itself. </para>
                <para>There is another matter mentioned in the Speech of His Excellency, and it has also been brought up in this House this afternoon; I refer to the Federal Capital. We are all in favour of getting the Federal Parliament away from the capital cities of the Commonwealth as soon as ever the financial situation will permit of our doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I intend, when this matter is brought up again., as I understand it will be, to bring under the notice of the House the special facilities that Ballarat offers. At present I cannot see where we are going to get the financial backing that is necessary to move the capital to the Canberra site. No doubt, the removal of the capital to Canberra is a very good scheme in the sky; and if aviation develops to the extent we hope, we may probably be put in a position to go there. Until that time, however, I think I am voicing the opinion of, at any rate, quite a number of members of the House when I say we cannot improve on Melbourne as the place where we should carry on the Federal affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I greatly appreciate the compliment extended to me when I was assigned the duty of seconding the motion for the Address-in-Reply. I feel that it is more a compliment to the constituency I represent than to myself. I discharge the duty that now falls to me with the greater confidence because I know that every honorable member always listens with the greatest patience and- kindness to the maiden effort of a new member, and that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> view with lenient eye any lapse which a new member may make in relation to parliamentary procedure. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I desire at the outset to say that I esteem it a great privilege to have been selected to come here as a representative of such an important constituency as that of the capital of Queensland. I wish to assure honorable members that I shall at all times endeavour to maintain the traditions of Parliament and of the executive Government. I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion proposed by my honorable friend, the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kerby).</inline> I also desire to congratulate that honorable gentleman on the very fine speech in which he introduced himself to the Chamber. It is an effort which I should very much like to emulate if I had the capacity. I desire also to compliment the Government on the result of the recent election. I came forward as a supporter of the Government, because I felt that their policy stood for the true interests of the country. </para>
                <para>It is not my intention to deal in detail with the Governor-General's Speech. I have no desire to detain the House, and, furthermore, I know that we shall have further opportunity to express our opinions when the measures referred to in the Speech are brought before us for consideration. There are, however, one or two matters to which I should particularly like to refer. </para>
                <para>I agree with the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kerby)</inline> in what he said in reference to repatriation. I am sure that all honorable members are pleased to know that the Government intend to amend the </para>
                <para class="block">Repatriation Act so as to bring about coordination of departmental activities. We know that there have been delays, that men have unfortunately been kept waiting for many months, and have been greatly discouraged. This, no doubt, is due to difficulties which, to a great extent, will be overcome by co-ordination. Personally, I feel that the Government have not treated the returned soldiers ungenerously: but the best efforts of the Government should be devoted to help those men to positions where they can depend on their own efforts. That, I am sure, is the desire of the great majority of the men. </para>
                <para>Another matter to which I should like to refer is that of immigration. I am glad the Government intend to encourage the bringing of the right kind of people to this country, the prospects of which are unlimited. In common with all other countries, we are labouring under a great debt in consequence of the war. But Australia, also, in common with every other country, has suffered another great shortage. This shortage is not only one of money, but consists of tha* great factor which produces money - manhood. During the last five years, a great many of our young men have been lost to the country, and far too many of them are for ever lost. Their dust lies on Gallipoli, in Flanders, France, Palestine, and wherever the glory of the British Army is greatest. </para>
                <para>I trust the Government will encourage production, and I am pleased to see that they intend to amend the law in regard to water conservation. In this connexion I think some encouragement ought to be given to the people of Queensland in the way of irrigation and conservation. I feel sure that had there been legislation of the kind in force now, millions of pounds would have been saved, even during the last twelve months, in the State from which I come. </para>
                <para>I am also pleased to see that the Government intend to amend the maternity bonus, and this can be done with great benefit. There are many now who seek the bonus although they do not require it, and, in my opinion, it would be much better if that money could be given to those who really require it in the shape of an increased amount. "We are all  agreed that everything possible should be done to assist 'women through such a trying time. </para>
                <para>As I said, I do not intend to speak at any length. I thank honorable members for the patient way in which they have listened to me. I am willing to concede to every one in this House the very finest sentiments, and I only ask that they "will give me credit for a desire to carry out faithfully the duties which my constituents have sent me here to perform. </para>
