      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PARKER</inline>MOLONEY.  -  I ask the Prime Minister if. it is his intention to do anything to stop this scandalous system of deporting  people  out of this country and spiriting them away, as in the case of Father Jerger, for instance, without a fair trial ; or does he intend to give them a fair trial ? </para>

That honorable member did us a very good turn by postponing or preventing the discussion of the motion, for if ever you get the people outside imagining that Parliament, or a section of Parliament, desires to prevent free discussion, the people will give an effective answer, as they did in 1910. In that year they felt that the Labour party, to which the Prime Minister and myself then belonged, were not being given a fair deal in the House. They believed that we were being closured and prevented from putting our case before them, and they resented the fact accordingly.

            <para>- The two candidates who were supported by that  newspaper  as, being preferable to the Nationalist and Labour candidates have both lost their deposits. In respect of the Ballarat election, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> urged the electors to vote for the candidates in the following order: - Troup, 1; Callow, 2; Kerby, 3; McGrath, 4. The result shows that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has a capacity for selecting candidates in the wrong way. The first two candidates on its list have lost their deposits, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby,</inline> who was selected by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> is second on the poll. The Ballarat newspapers also opposed the Labour candidate. Labourites have not to thank the newspapers for any political or industrial gain secured by them.. Every success achieved by Labour has been in the face of bitter opposition on the part of the press. The workers have nothing for which to thank the press. The Prime Minister who, in the old days, fought in the political and industrial ranks of Labour knows that my statement is correct. Labour has had to contend against the undying hostility of the press, and when the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> stated that I was wrong in giving notice of this motion, and that the party which I lead was wrong in deciding that that action should be taken, I felt more than ever convinced that we were on the right track. </para>

It is no satisfaction to a man who has had a finger crushed in a machine to be told of some one who hai had four fingers crushed in the same way : and it is no consolation to the people who are suffering by reason of the profiteering that is going on in this country to learn that prices are increasing in other parts of the world. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The National Federation is an organization of vested city interests drawing a colossal fighting fund from the manufacturers; and Flinders-lane, and perhaps other sources.  . . . The Federation employs a secretary at £1,250, and organizers at £500 a year. It published n pamphlet telling the people that if they wanted the cost of living kept down they should elect the Nationalist candidates. </para>

        <para class="block">I have not seen a copy of the pamphlet; but, no doubt, the honorable member quoted it correctly. He went on to say - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It claimed 'that the National Government had reduced the cost of bread to 6Jd. In England bread was ls. It had arranged cheap and regular supplies of butter by forming a Butter Pool. It had given sugar at 3£d. per lb. In Europe it cost 7d.; and wheat was cheaper in Australia than in any other country. Not a word was said about cheap clothing or the thousands of articles sold by the people it stood for. That was the party which said it was going to "shoot the profiteer." Those profiteers could be shot with a short range gun from an upstairs room in Parliament House looking east, but they were nut likely to shoot the goose that laid such golden eggs. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is an opinion of the Ministerial party expressed, not by a representative of Labour, but by a representative of the Country party. The suggestion is that the Ministerial party were drawing a big fund for political purposes from Flinders-lane and the manufacturers, and they would not deal with profiteering because it was the profiteer who furnished the .money to pay their election expenses. </para>
        <para>We know that no action has been taken by the Government to deal with the profiteer. The Prime Minister will say, as he has said before, that the Government are prevented from taking action by our constitutional limitations. On that point we received, in connexion with the Commercial Activities Bill, an opinion from leading constitutional lawyers, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, to the effect that with regard to controlling the prices of wheat, sugar, flax, butter, and one other commodity which I do not recall at the present moment, the Government have the necessary power to control those prices in some cases up to the 30th September next, and, in other cases, even longer than that. So far as sugar is concerned, the Prime Minister has stated that because the Queensland Government entered into an agreement' in connexion with the control of sugar, we were able to obtain that commodity at a cheaper rate than we could otherwise have done. It has been complained that so- far as wheat, meat, and some other commodities are concerned, they have been sold more cheaply overseas than to the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- If he is, I say good luck to him. When the Prime Minister introduced the measure to provide for the erection of silos in various parts of Australia, he said that they would represent, an assurance to the people of Australia that one or two season's wheat would be kept here as a guarantee against drought. Has that been done ? We know that New South Wales is the only State in which any silos have been erected. </para>

            <para>- I am unable to say whether the honorable member's interjection is accurate or not. It was understood that by the erection of the silos, at a cost of 3/4  d. per bushel added to the price of wheat, the people of Australia would have a guarantee that there would be no shortage of the commodity in this country. But the people of New South Wales, the only State in which silos have been erected, are complaining to-day that there is an insufficient quantity of wheat on hand, or that an insufficient quantity is being brought into the silos. I was very glad to hear the statement made, in answer to a question put by an honorable member, that sufficient wheat would be in hand until the next harvest was gathered. </para>

            <para>- There might be a shortage in one State, and not in another ; and, in that case, the supply of wheat in the State in which the shortage existed becomes a national matter, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that all are supplied. That duty should not be left to a State Government. We have only four wheat-producing States in Australia, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth to look after the requirements of the whole of the people. </para>

            <para>- I never said that the growers of meat could help that. It is well known that there are four staple commodities required in every home - bread, butter, sugar, and meat. I obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician some years ago certain figures showing the quantity of each of these commodities used per head of this community. I found that during the period 1903-12 the local consumption of bread amounted to 4 lbs. per head per week. An investigation is being made of what the people use to-day, and I can give the quantity consumed by each individual, according to a tentative estimate based upon an investigation now in course of tabulation. The Statistician's Department informs me that the consumption to-day is 5 lbs. ner head per week; that means that the people are using more bread than they were in 11912. At that time, the average consumption ' of butter was half a lb. per head per week - roughly, 1,000 tons per week for the whole of the Commonwealth. The consumption to-day is only 7 ozs. per head per week. </para>

            <para>- That is true. The consumption of sugar has decreased from 2£ lbs. per head per week in 1912 to 2 lbs. per head per week. Even if the sugar contained in the immense amount of jam sent overseas were included, the consumption per head of the people of Victoria would not be more than <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> lbs. The consumption of meat has decreased from 5 lbs. per head per week to 4 lbs. per head per week. As recently as 1914 the average price of bread throughout Australia was 3.3d. per 2-lb. loaf. Today the average is over 6d. </para>

If the Creator had intended that beasts should be considered of more importance than human beings, He would not have endowed us with superior powers of thought and reason. There is an endeavour on the part of a section of the community to make land and animals' of more value than human life. My policy is the reverse of that- </para>

I shall always give first consideration to Australian industries. Unfortunately, every one of my children has had to be reared artificially, so that I appreciate the advisability of encouraging tie production of these artificial foods which are of such value to infant life ; but I do not agree that we should treat a New Zealand product better than we treat a similar article produced in Australia. Continuing my argument regarding food prices, I remind the House that sugar which in 1915 was 2f d. per lb. retail is to-day 6d. per lb. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but I did not agree with the Prime Minister in regard to the retail price. Twice I tried to get a vote of the House on the question, and twice I was blocked by Ministerial members. I held the view that if the growers and ' millers were receiving only .£30 6s. 8d. per ton, or 3£d. per lb., there was no justification for adding a further 2$d. to the price before the article reached the consumer. Out of that large margin between the price to the . producer and the price to the consumer, some persons are making a big profit. </para>

I stated in July of last year that the millers had so combined that they could charge the people any price they chose for their flour, and that they refused to supply any baker who sold bread at less than the price fixed by the millers. There was a co-operative flour mill at Wedderburn, in the electorate of Grampians, which was selling below the price fixed by the Combine, and its product was prevented from coming to the city. </para>

            <para>- And I have mentioned also the cases of the Civil Service Cooperative Bakery, which was (prevented by the " Car-gear " Committee from obtaining supplies of flour, and of customers who were not allowed to change their bakers. The master millers shut the product of the Wedderburn mill out of the market, and subsequently the mill was burnt down. Of course, I do not say that the millers were responsible for its destruction. The average wholesale price of butter in Melbourne in 1914 was 1s.01/2d;to-day it is about 2s. per lb., and the farmers are asking for 3s. per lb. I wonder why they stop at 3s. ; why do they not ask for 33s. ? </para>

            <para>- Yes. But, at any rate, the people of Australia appreciated what I did. I objected to the exporters creating an artificial shortage of butter in Australia in order to force up the price. The people of Australia consume 4 lbs. out of every 5 lbs. produced locally, and they are entitled to first consideration. They consume, too, more beef than is exported </para>

            <para>- Of course we could not ; nor could we import more cheaply than' we can produce a lot of articles which the honorable member thinks should he brought into the country duty free. The farmers say, "Give us a big duty upon products from other countries; let no potatoes come from New Zealand and no onions from America or anywhere else. Place a big duty on onions and potatoes, but let us import all our farming implements free of duty." That is the attitude taken up by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and other honorable members of his party. How absurd it is ! </para>

            <para>- I do not want to listen to any more inane interjections. I would like an opportunity to say that meat, which cost 22s. per 100 lbs. in 1914, was quoted in January- June this year at an average of 53s. 2d. per 100 lbs. Will any honorable member say that the average retail price to-day is only 6id. per lb ? The honorable member for Indi knows the position in which the unhappy consumer finds himself, and he must have some idea of the purchasing power of the sovereign to-day, compared with 1914. The people are not concerned with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> statistics, or with weighted averages, and that kind of thing. But they know how much it costs to procure a loaf of bread to-day, compared with a few years ago. When I have spoken to metropolitan audiences, and to the people at Ballarat and elsewhere, and I have set forth details of the sugar agreement, showing that the producer is getting only a penny out of the increased price, the people have naturally wanted to know what has become of the rest of it. And they have every right to know why the price should have gone up 2£d. per lb., although the sugar farmer and miller get only Id. per lb extra. </para>

I would remind the honorable member that, since interjections themselves are disorderly, he will not be in order in endeavouring, to raise a point of order for the purpose of justifying- an interjection which, in itself, was a breach of order.

            <para>- I have taken trouble to secure my information. I do not suppose that any one will say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in compiling his details, is likely to lean either to one side or to the other. He gave me these facts regarding average consumption per head per week, and I have managed, so far, to state them in relation to bread, sugar, butter, and meat. The increases are not my calculations, but are the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> and his staff, and the particulars upon which they were based were  obtained direct from retail shops by the Statistician's officers. On the basis of consumption of 5 lbs. of bread per head per week - the increase being 3d. per 2-lb. loaf - it means an average individual increase of 7£d. for bread alone in the bills of an ordinary family of five. On an average family consumption of 2 lbs. of sugar per week, the cost has gone up 6½d.  Butter has increased more than ls. per lb., and meat has increased at least Gd. per lb., so that on the 4 lbs. allowed to each individual per week there is a definite increase of 2s. per head. This means for the average family a total increase of over £1 per week on these items alone, apart altogether from house rent and clothing. Again, <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> referring to groceries and food, states that what could have been bought for 22s. lid. in 1913 costs to-day 37s. 7d. These are facts which cannot be controverted, and every honorable member will admit that <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs'</inline> figures are never over the mark. In regard to house rents, he states that a house which could have been rented for 22s. 4d. in 1913 is worth 25s. 8d. to-day, an increase of only about 15 per cent. But all honorable members know that house rents have gone up 50 per cent, in some cases, and the difficulty in many localities is in getting any house. Every honorable member who represents a metropolitan division, as I do, must be aware of the position. The Inter-State Commission inquired into this problem some time ago, and arrived at the conclusion that we were 25,000 houses short in the Eastern States. What has been done with that report? Nothing. </para>

          <para>A most .glaring instance of profiteering during the demand caused by the strike for emergency  illuminants  was exposed before the Fair Profits Commission yesterday. The instance is the more remarkable in that it embraced several transactions in the one line of goods on the one day - some within ten minutes of each other; that three middlemen as well as the importer and the retailer handled the goods before the consumer was offered them; and that between importer and consumer a difference between the landed cost (4s. 4d. each) and retail price (15s.) of 10s. 8d. had occurred. The transactions centred round a line of Windsor hurricane lamps imported from New York at invoice cost f.o.b. of 31s. 6d. per doz. (2s. 7id. each) and lauded cost of 52s. 8d. (4s. 4d. each) by the Vacuum Oil Company. Evidence regarding the subsequent transactions was given before the Commission yesterday by representatives of the various firms named, who had been summoned as witnesses, lt was deposed that S. R. O. Allen, importer, Williamstreet, bought from the Vacuum Oil Company on 14th June seventy-two dozen of the lamps at 58s. 6d. per doz. The same morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen</inline> sold ten cases to George Russell Proprietary Limited, Flinders-street, at 77s. 6d. per dozen ; also twenty cases to James McEwan and Company at 80s. per dozen ten minutes later; thirty-one cases to Brandt Brothers at 80s. ten minutes later again; and ten cases to James Walker, Little Collins-street at 80s. George Russell Proprietary Limited the same day sold four dozen to C. J. Langford, Elizabeth-street at lOSs. per dozen. C. J. Langford sold two dozen to J. and A. Boyes,  Elizabeth-street, the same afternoon at 150s. per dozen. J. and A. Boyes sold to a member of the public at the rate of 180s. per dozen (15s. each). C. J. Langford and J. A. Boyes were in the same building, and no delivery charges were involved in the transaction. Most of the purchasers took the risk of breakages. </para>

            <para>- I say that, in many cases, there are excessive handlings. It was shown before the Inter-State Commission that there are certain firms in Melbourne, known as the "Holy Seven," who absolutely control the wholesale grocery trade here. According to the evidence given, these firms refuse to supply any goods to traders who have dealings with outside firms. Many firms have tried to get into this inner ring, but have been prevented. It is preserved in the same way as the United Shoe Machinery Trust is preserved. This latter Trust controls certain machinery in Australia and other parts of the world, and will have no dealings with any firms who venture to use other machinery. For instance, if a shoe manufacturer has one of their machines for sewing welts, he must also use one of their machines for doing' the  eyeletting.  This " Holy Seven " has absolute control in the same way of the wholesale grocery business; and I have no doubt that in this regard the Inter-State Commissioners referred to the necessity for the Government taking some action. The Government did take some action in regard to meat, but the Ministry were frightened by a demonstration of the producers concerned, who chartered seven special trains to bring a deputation to town. I am pleased to say that those composing that deputation hooted my name when it was mentioned. </para>

Ladies' three-quarter all-wool half-hose, which could be bought in  1913 for ls. lid.  per pair,  to-day cost 5s. 6d. Men's suits to measure, which in 1913 cost 35s., to-day cost £4 10s. Men's Harvard shirts, which could be purchased for 2s. 9d. each, to-day cost 7s. 6d. Men's cotton tweed trousers in 1913 cost 3s. lid. per pair; to-day their purchase price is 9s. 6d. Linoleum, which in 1913 could be bought for 4s. lid. per yard, to-day cost 18s. 6d. There are hundreds of lines showing similar percentages of increase.

        <para>In regard to the question of sugar supplies, the Government have exhibited their utter incapacity. As far back as September of last year, Ministers knew, within 10,000 tons, what would be the yield of the Queensland crop. As  a  matter of fact, while I was discussing this very question, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> interjected that the Government knew to within 5,000 tons what that crop would be. If they knew that the Australian production would amount only to 186,000 tons, they must have known that we should require to import about an additional 100,000 tons. But instead of importing that quantity, they imported only 70,100 tons. Some time ago I asked  a  series of questions in this chamber, with  a  view to  Eliciting  exactly how much that sugar cost, because I say deliberately that the retail price of sugar should not be what it  is  to-day. The people are paying an unduly high price for that commodity owing to the incompetency of the Government. According to the Minister for Trade and Customs, the Government landed 60,000 tons of sugar from Java for £22 per ton f.o.b., they imported an additional 6,000 tons from there at  a  cost of £23 per ton, and a further 4,100 tons from Fiji at £25 per ton. In reply to inquiries regarding the freight which was paid upon these importations, I was informed that it was 35s. per ton from Java, and 27s. 6d. per ton from Fiji. Insurance upon the 66,000 tons of Java sugar varied from 9s. 9d. per cent, to 10s. lid. per' cent. ; say, from 2s. to 2s. 4d. per ton extra under that head. The insurance upon the Fiji shipment was at the rate of 8s. per cent. The exchange in connexion with the Java purchases was 15s. per cent, and 17s. 6d. per cent., and from Fiji, nil. The whole of the 70,100 tons of sugar imported, was landed at less than 3d. per lb. I repeat that in September last the Government knew that they would require to import at least 100,000 tons of sugar, and that they should have made their arrangements accordingly. I blame them for putting into the sugar agreement a condition which prevented the Queensland Government from increasing the capacity of the mills there. </para>

We had submitted to us a list showing the number of cases before that Court on the 23rd April last. In speaking upon that question, I pointed out that there are nine cases which for months have been awaiting a hearing before that tribunal, cases involving industries the cessation of which would paralyze the Commonwealth. The Judges have stated that certain amendments are necessary in the Arbitration Act to facilitate its better working. It is well known that when a plaint is filed before the Court, even though the cost of living has increased in the case of an average family, to the extent of £1 2s. 6d. per week upon only four articles, it is difficult to get it heard with reasonable expedition. Who knew three years ago what would be' the increase in the cost of living to-day? Who knows what it will be three years hence? </para>

            <para>- We have had droughts before in Australia, but there has never previously been such increases in prices as those with which we are confronted to-day. I gather from the June number of the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Agricultural Journal</inline> that the number of sheep in Australia to-day is 84,000,000 odd. From another Government publication - I think it was the <inline font-style="italic">New South Wales Agricultural Journal</inline> - I learn that before the war, in 1912, when there were 92,000,000 sheep in Australia, the wool clip- was worth £22,000,000. Since then, in 1916 or 1917, the number of sheep has diminished by about 18,000,000, and yet the wool clip is worth double what it was previously. I believe that I am right in saying that the value of the clip in 1912, when we had more sheep than we have to-day, was only about half that of the present clip. </para>

        <para>On Friday last the Prime Minister told us that he had had to advise the organization with which he was connected to strike because they could not get to the Arbitration Court in any other way, and we know that the seamen and the marine engineers have recently taken the same course. When they find that employers refuse to meet them in conference the organizations cannot be blamed for taking the matter into their own hands. In May last, when I was dealing with this subject of the projected conference of employers and employees, I pointed out that on the 10th April of this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers had made the following statement: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There are three complaints, at least, against the Court for which the Court is not responsible. The first is that the Judges appointed to do the work cannot keep pace with the many claims brought before them, and serious delays are sometimes caused in settling industrial disputes. Parliament can, if it thinks fit, rectify that. The second is that the Court cannot, because of section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, settle industrial disputes arising during the term of an award, however serious the dispute may be, or however much the cost of living has increased since the award was made. Parliament can, if it thinks fit, rectify that also. The third is that proceedings in the Court are expensive. The unions can rectify that by avoiding  the  expense of plaints, as is frequently done, limiting their claims to what they really intend to insist upon (if section 28 is amended), and by not calling witnesses to prove what the employers admit. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers points out in regard to two of the complaints, Parliament itself can rectify them, and, im my opinion, should do so at the earliest possible moment. I believe that the Justices of the High Court are unanimously of opinion that this Parliament has power to clothe the Arbitration Court with authority to settle an industrial dispute arising during the term of an award. Speaking on this subject in May last, I quoted the case of the gas employees, who could not have their plaint amended because they had asked for 13s. a day. They are now submitting a plaint for <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a day, thus making sure that they will have ample margin to come and go upon during the three years currency of their award.

        <para>Consideration was given by the Federal Cabinet yesterday to arbitration matters. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that the Cabinet had discussed the position that arose through the  Deputy President  of the Arbitration Court <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. justice Powers)</inline> going on leave. It was also hoped to introduce at an early date legislation to amend the Arbitration Act. </para>
        <para>When the proposal by the  president  of the Employers Federation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fairbairn)</inline> for a round-table conference on industrial matters was mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said : - " Two years ago we proposed to bring in a measure for a Grand Council of Labour, on which both sides would be represented. That idea we hope to embody in our coming legislation. </para>
        <para>But such a proposal will be useless without the hearty co-operation of both sides. We propose to call a conference. We will not put a cut-and-dried proposition in regard to the constitution of a Council of Labour, or to industrial legislation before them, but will seek to have a free discussion of matters and find out the ideas of both sides. Then we will try to formulate proposals, to secure industrial peace and harmony." </para>
        <para class="block">The sooner we know what the Government proposals are in this direction the better it will be for all concerned, but they made the promise more than two years ago, and, so far, have done absolutely nothing. It was also promised that the Prime Minister would act as Minister for Labour, but nothing has been done in that matter either. </para>
        <para>The employers have also failed in, their duty. Representatives of the tannery employees of Australia have informed me that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the employers to meet them, and I am told that in 'the hat trade the employers are offering excuse after excuse to avoid meeting their workmen in conference, although the award has expired. A strike in the hat-making industry would not affect the community as would a strike amongst transport workers or engineers: but the fact that there are two sides to a question ought to be made known. The workers in all industries have very little chance of putting their case before the people through the press. The opinion seems to be held in some quarters that if a ballot of employees is taken a proposal to strike will be turned down; but the Prime Minister knows as well as I do that, taken as a whole, the rank and file in an organization are far more militant than are the officials. The newspapers claim time after time that strikes are fomented by the latter, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are chiefly concerned in trying to do their best for their members, and will exert all their influence to avoid trouble. What has been the result of some of the ballots recently taken? In the case of the seamen the decision was to strike, and in the later cases of the marine, engineers and the engine-drivers and firemen of Victoria the result was the same. </para>

        <para>I wish now to give honorable members an illustration of the way in which war pension applications have been treated. A f  friend  of mine received towards the end of 1918 a letter in which the writer complained of " the very unjust way the Defence Department treated mothers who had raised large families and who applied for pensions in regard to sons who had been killed at the war." According to the statements contained in that letter, the man and his wife had four sons who enlisted, of whom two were killed in action, one died at sea on a transport, and one was still in the fighting line. After the first son was killed the usual papers for a pension were sent to them and the wife was called to Melbourne, and gave her replies to the questions asked of her. After some time she was informed to her surprise that she would be paid a pension of 5s. per week, which she regarded as an insult, because she knew that other mothers were getting pensions of 10s., 15s., and, in some cases, £1 per week, because of the death of their sons. She regarded the offer of the Department as " making little of her brave boy who died fighting for his country." The second son was killed in action on the 9th August, 1918, when the usual pension papers were again sent, and the wife again went to Melbourne and replied to the questions asked of her. She then received what she considered a bigger insult from the Department, because the pension was nil. It was the intention of the writer to tell his wife, when the pension papers came in respect of the lad who died at sea on a transport, to reply that as she had been so badly treated in the past, she could live without their insults. The ground for the rejection of these pensions in respect of the second lad killed was that the parents were not dependent on his earnings for the twelve months immediately prior to his enlistment. The writer points out that, although they were not dependent on their son for their living, he being then nineteen years of age, and learning a trade, a family of ten had been raised on a wage of 6s. 6d.- a day, and the lads who had been killed would have been earning £3 per week at the date on which he wrote had they not gone to the war, and would, of course, have helped their parents in their old age, a matter which the Pensions Department ought to have taken into consideration. I put the matter before the Department, and eventually got a pension of 7s. for each of the two sous, though that was not enough. The complaint has been made that widows who were getting £2 per week war pension have had their allowance reduced to £1 ls. These reductions have been made recently, and are not fair. </para>
        <para>Many complaints are being made about the restrictions on the war gratuity. The insurance offices have now been prohibited from cashing war gratuity bonds, but men have told me that if they go to certain furniture selling firms, they can get their war gratuity bonds* cashed, so long as they spend 33 per cent, of the proceeds upon furniture. </para>

Men have come to me offering me half the value of the bonds if I would cash them, but I have declined to do so, because the law says that they cannot be cashed, and I have not the money to buy these bonds, even if I desired to do so.

The public do not ask for the saving of a few shillings by the reduction of the pensions of war widows. The Government have also failed to prevent profiteering. Then two years ago they promised to establish a Council of Labour to deal with industrial unrest, a promise which they have not fulfilled. I hold, therefore, that I have justification for moving the motion. Honorable members on this side, and members of the Corner party will, no doubt, deal with those questions arising under it which I have not had time to mention.

            <para>. - In giving notice of his motion last Thursday, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> led the country to believe that lie had disclosures of such a character to make as would prove the Government unworthy of the confidence of the House. For that reason, and because by no other means can I reply to what he has said,- I think it proper to treat the motion as one of censure. The honorable member, in speaking to his motion, occupied an hour and thirty-five minutes. He 6poke, yet said nothing. I ask honorable members generally whether, if they were a jury, and the Government collectively were on its trial, and the counsel for the prosecution had presented the case as the honorable member has done, they would hesitate a moment before giving a verdict of acquittal? The honorable member has been in Ministerial office with me for many years; he has been my friend for many more. I credit him always with the best intentions, but this afternoon, although I listened attentively to his speech, and, so far as one in my position could, with an absolutely open mind, I heard no reason why the Government should be censured, or the time of the Legislature wasted in repeating at such length what he has already said on' so many occasions, and what we shall probably hear on many more if we are spared to live long enough. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This motion of censure is divided into five parts, and differs in this respect only from its predecessor, which, like all Gaul, w.as divided into three parts. Although the honorable gentleman consumed the full time allotted to him with his speech, he occupied nearly the whole period with irrelevant observations. I propose, as briefly and clearly as I can, to show why the House should not agree to the motion, First of all the honorable member says that the Government is deserving of censure for its failure to prevent the inordinate rise in the cost of living. "What are the facts? The honorable member knows what they are perfectly well. He was in office with me for about two years and four months during the war, and the Government then had great powers under the War Precautions Act. When the honorable member moved his previous censure  motion, I pointed out that, although he was the Minister charged with the administration of this Act, he took no action whatever so far as I knew to deal in any way with the high cost of living. He may have done so, but if he did I was not aware of it. The reason he gave was the only reason he could give. It was the reason he gave previously when he was my colleague, and really he gave it through my mouth. I explained that we had not done anything in that direction, because we were of the opinion that we could not effectively deal with the high cost of living until we had power to deal with combines, trusts, and corporations. The party to which the honorable member and myself belonged had pressed this view very strongly before the electors for many years, and regarded the amendment of the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over these vitally important matters as of such urgency as to justify them in putting it on their fighting platform. In 1915 I was present at the Adelaide Labour Conference, where the question of the high cost of living was brought up. It was regarded as a matter of vital importance, and the Government of the day, at the head of which was my friend Mr.' Fisher, and of which I was a member, was urged to press on with the referendum in order to clothe the Commonwealth Parliament with such powers as would enable it to take action. It was never for one moment suggested then that there was any other way of doing it. Until the honorable member for West Sydney (Mv. Ryan) made a statement to the contrary, no one had ever suggested that this Parliament had any power to deal with combines, trusts and companies, or to fix prices except under the War Precautions Act, unless and until such amendments of the Constitution were made as would clothe the Commonwealth Legislature with the necessary power. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cohen,</inline> who was one of the representatives of Victoria, said at the 1915 conference, " Surely they were not going to allow a handful of Tories in the Federal Parliament to stand in the way of the people's interests; everything should be done to put through the work quickly; the Government would be justified in taking such action as would insure the passage of these measures in a reasonable time, seeing that the carrying of the referendum meant so much to the people, who were being fleeced right and left by the combines and trusts in everything concerned." He moved an a'mendment, a long debate took place, and the conference affirmed the necessity for pressing on with the amendments to give the Commonwealth power to deal with these matters at the very earliest possible moment. The Leader of the Opposition was then a member of the Government, of which I was Attorney-General, and he was still a member of the Government when in the tail end of 1915 a proposal was made by the States to grant us certain powers temporarily upon condition that we postponed the referendum. The honorable member was strongly in favor of that course, and voted for it, and, at a meeting of the party upstairs, there were I think" only six or seven dissentients out of a total of 72 members. These two facts stand out: one, that it had been clearly recognised by the Labour party for years that there was no way by which the Commonwealth could deal with trusts. combines, and prices except by the amendment of the Constitution, and, two, that in 1915 the high cost of living was a matter of such grave and pressing concern as to make it imperative in the interests of the community that the Constitution should be amended forthwith. Yet, as I have said, the honorable member agreed to . the postponement of the referendum, and when the States did nothing he followed their example, nor was it until he left the Government and a new Government was constituted, that anything waa done to reduce the cost of living to the people of Australia under the War Precautions Act. I shall come later, as I deal with these matters, to the reasons which led the honorable member and his colleagues to act as they did in regard to the last referendum, but I would point out that the High Court has laid it down again and again that the Commonwealth has no power to deal with trusts, combines, or companies. And as nine-tenths of all commercial transactions are carried on by these means it is abundantly clear that unless we have plenary power over them we can take no effective action to deal with high prices. The honorable member has spoken this afternoon of rings. He spoke of a flour ring, and of a man being at once frozen out and burnt up as the result of the operations of one of ' those rings. He knows that the only way in which we can deal with any ring or combine is by amendment of the Constitution. He cannot deny that he agreed to the postponement of the referendum when he was a member of the Government, in which I had the honour to hold a portfolio, nor can he deny that at the last election, when a referendum was taken, an overwhelming majority of the members of the Labour party were led by the misrepresentations of their leaders to vote against that which for the last nine years the Labour party had declared to be the very corner-stone of their temple. I have here the referenda figures for 1913 -and 1919. They show that in 1919 the majority at the referendum against the Legislative Powers Bill was under 20,000, proving conclusively that had the Labour party voted as they were bound to do by the planks of the platform to which they solemnly pledged themselves, this Parliament would to-day not have the excuse that it has no power to deal with these things. That a great National Legislature like this should not have the power to deal with industrial matters, combines, trusts, corporations, <inline font-style="italic">er</inline> companies is, I say now as I said in 1911, when I was the mouthpiece of the Labour party, a disgrace to the intelligence of the people of this country, and a menace, to their security and welfare. I ask, and I shall continue to ask while I am on my feet, why the Labour party at the recent election did this thing? Why did they deliberately reject that which they had declared for the last ten years to be the one thing essential to the well-being of the people? </para>
          <para>The honorable member said we had done nothing to deal with the high cost of living during the war, when we had the power. I deny altogether that under 'the War Precautions Act as it stands to-day we have the power now. It may be that I am wrong; no one can tell that until a case is decided in the High Court. But I venture to say that" ho one reading the judgments of the High Court on those cases in which it was held that we had the power during the war would say that we had the power to-day to fix prices in regard to those commodities which, unlike sugar, are outside our own control. During the war we regulated the price of eighty-eight commodities, and the effect of our action, as has been admitted even from the Opposition side of the House, was to reduce the cost of living most materially to the people of this country, saving them' very many millions. But now we can do nothing. I do not hesitate to say that had Labour voted in 1919 as it did in 1913 this Parliament would this day have authority to deal with these vitally important matters. To-day I say most emphatically, despite what the honorable member for West Sydney may claim, that it has no power to deal effectively with them. Why have honorable members opposite abandoned those principles which they declared again and again to be vital? At every election since 1910 they have been in the forefront of their platform, yet when opportunity offers they denounce that which they have for years declared to be necessary for the salvation of Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">Why? I shall indicate later some reasons why they did this thing. </para>
          <para>The honorable member speaks of the cost of living in this country in regard to wheat, meat, butter, and sugar. He could not have selected four articles more unfortunate from his point of view, for it so happens that the people of Australia have cheaper flour, cheaper meat, cheaper sugar, and cheaper butter than <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> other people in the world. I shall leave it to members of the Country party to set out the facts in greater detail; but this I will say, that every man has a right to be rewarded for his labour. Whether he is a pick-and-shovel man, a legislator, or a farmer, the same principle must apply. I do not claim for one moment to have an intimate experience of the lot of the man on the land; but, since it is vital, in the interests of this country, that we should attract people from the great cities to the country, and since there is no better way of doing that than by making life on the land profitable, we should be doing this country a mortal injury if we drove people from the country into the great cities by making life on the land unprofitable. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition professed astonishment that we should now be paying 6d. per lb. for sugar, which, before the war, cost only  2¾d.  per lb. For that increase he apparently would make this Government responsible. The fact is that but for this Government the price of sugar to-day would be far more. I have no time to discuss in detail the sugar question; I fully set it out some weeks back, when dealing specifically with it. Coming to bread, which is a still more important article of food, there is in Australia to-day, despite the drought, a supply of wheat ample to meet the requirements of the people until next harvest. If there is a shortage in New South Wales, it arises from two reasons - (1) the appalling drought, and (2) the mismanagement, perhaps, of the local Wheat Pool, whereby good wheat was sold, and sent out of the country, regardless of the welfare of the people of that State. For that, neither the Commonwealth nor the people of the other States are responsible. And. even as it is, the people of New South Wales today are buying wheat at less than one-half of the world's price. These are facts which cannot be denied. When we are told that the farmer is selling his produce locally for more than he can get for it overseas, I can only say that these are the facts, and that they speak for themselves. The local price of wheat today is fixed by agreement between the farmers and the Government at 7s. 8d. per bushel, while the price of wheat in the markets of the world to-day is quite double that amount. So much for that point. In regard to sugar, as I have said, the people are obtaining it at a price below that ruling in any other part of the world. There is no country, save New Zealand, which secures its sugar so cheaply. In England the people are paying ls. and ls. 2d. per lb. for it, and in America the price is quite as high. </para>
          <para>I come now to butter. The dairy farmer works, not six or seven hours a day, but a great many morel I am not an advocate of long hours; but if a man works long hours, he is entitled to be paid for them. Let the Leader of the Opposition take a turn as a dairy farmer, and we shall see whether he will be prepared to sell his butter for less than it costs to produce. </para>

              <para>- My experience was rather unfortunate. The honorable member has sought to make the Government responsible for high prices. I have shown quite clearly where the blame lies. But the causes of high prices generally are so utterly remote from those put forward by the Leader of the Opposition that one is surprised that he would not, at least, have admitted to the House that they are for the most part beyond the powers of the Legislature to touch. They arise out of great economic factors that are affecting the whole world. They arise out of the war, out of the scarcity created by the war, out of the excess of paper money and the scarcity of products. The scarcity of' goods and the excess of paper money, and the consequent depreciation of money and appreciation of the prices of goods are the two main factors. For the evil of high prices there are but two. effective remedies - one to reduce the quantity of paper money, the other to increase production. Let the honorable member say whether he has given wise counsel to the unions and the people of Australia in regard to these matters. He speaks very loosely about the consequences of issuing on the markets of this country another £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 of paper money. The effect of such an issue would fall, as all these things do, quickly and certainly upon the very class that he seeks to benefit. The present high prices would become still higher. So much then for the first of his five points. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I turn now to his second charge. The Government is deserving of censure, he says, because of its failure to keep its pledges to the returned soldiers and their dependants. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, the</inline> honorable member's , charge is utterly without foundation. Let the facts speak for themselves. The . honorable member made some reference to war gratuities, pensions, and repatriation. I do not contend for one moment that in the demobilization and repatriation of over 360,000 men there are not some cases of hardship and injustice. But the repatriation of our soldiers will compare most favorably with that of any country. The pledges given by me on behalf of the Government have been carried out not only in the letter but in the spirit. Let me quote a few figures in proof of my statement. Up to the 10th instant 83,758 war gratuity bonds, representing a total of £7,254,874 had been issued, of which the bonds issued hut uncashed  amounted to £6,075,298, and the gratuities paid in cash by the Treasury amounted to £1,179,576. What was the position put before the electors at the last general election? They were promised by the Leader of the Opposition, and those who stand with him, that if they were returned to office the soldiers would be paid the war gratuity in cash? We promised that they would be paid in bonds. We said that we would cash up to £6,000,000 worth of bonds, and we made other promises, all of which have been carried out. The people deliberately rejected the proposal of the honorable member, and accepted ours. We should not be where we are to-day had not an overwhelming majority of the soldiers, their dependants, friends, and relations supported the party which I have the honour to lead. We promised that a gratuity should be paid <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> a certain scale; that it should be paid in bonds except in certain cases which were clearly specified ; and we promised that the legislation necessary to give effect to these pledges should take precedence of all others in the new Parliament. All these pledges have been most faithfully kept. </para>
          <para>And now as to repatriation. Ever since my return to Australia I have had coming to my office every day hundreds of letters dealing with this matter, and I have sought as well as possible to help the returned soldiers. The honorable member has read to the House two or three letters on this subject. I invite him to let me have them. If any man has been treated unjustly he shall have justice. But the great basic facts in relation to repatriation are that' for the year 1919-20, which has just closed, £6,103,061 was spent on repatriation, of which amount £3,869,827 was an absolute gift to the men. On land settlement we expended £11,235,716. The amount to which the Commonwealth was committed but hae not yet been applied for by the States for land settlement, is £17,764,284. For war pensions, we spent during year 1919-20, £6,032,000; on war service homes, £4,953,676, making a gross total for the year ended 30th June last of £46,088,737. These figures are unanswerable. They supply a complete and crushing  refutaton  of the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition that we have not dealt fairly with our soldiers. The like of this record cannot be shown by any other country. The provision made for 1920-21 Estimates is as follows: - Repatriation proper, £5,800,000; land settlement, dependent upon the forthcoming Conference with State Ministers of Land to be held on  Monday  next, £17,000,000; war pensions, £7,500,000; war service homes, £7,175,000; or a gross total of £37,475,000. In the face of these figures the honorable member's charge vanishes into thin air. </para>
          <para>On the 28th June last the total amount expended in respect of war service homes was £6,678,151. Seven hundred and sixty-seven houses had been completed, 2,461 were in course of erection, and contracts had been let for an additional 341. Five thousand three hundred and thirty-four houses had been purchased, and 1,296 mortgages had been lifted on be- half of returned soldiers or eligible dependants. </para>
          <para>Our men were demobilized in record time. On 30th June last, of the total of 361,000 only 662 men were on the J Australian Imperial Force strength. The number of returned soldiers unemployed has been steadily diminishing. While there were on 31st October last 13,000 soldiers unemployed, to-day on the unemployment return there are only 6,049 men. The Leader of the Opposition say3 we have not kept our pledges. These figures and facts speak for themselves. We said that we would increase the amount devoted to waT pensions by £500,000 or £600,000. We have actually increased it by £1.500,000. The gratuity that was promised is being paid very rapidly. The honorable member says that the men cannot in all cases obtain cash for their gratuity bonds. They knew that very well. That was set out plainly, and reasons were given for the inability of the Commonwealth to cash the bonds, or permit them to pass current from hand to hand. I say, now, that to put £30,000,000 worth of bonds on the market to-day would create a crisis the like of which has never been seen in this country. The honorable gentleman has referred to what certain firms dealing in furniture are doing' in the way of cashing war gratuity bonds. In answer to that, all I have to say is that if he will supply me with the names of the firms who are doing this, I shall make the necessary inquiries. One letter was sent to me in which it was stated that a returned soldier was compelled to give a war gratuity bond for £120 to purchase £60 worth of furniture. That, I think, occurred in the electorate of the honorable member for Yarra. </para>

A reference has been made to the cashing of bonds by insurance companies, and in that matter the Treasurer is safeguarding the interests of the men: In the action he is taking he is protecting the interests and' welfare of the soldier.

          <para>I promised the soldiers, on behalf of the Government, that they should have one representative on the Repatriation Board and the War Gratuity Board. On the Repatriation Board, the returned soldiers have not one representative, but three; and of the eighteen members of the Central and State Boards, ten are returned soldiers. The War Gratuity Board consists of three members, and all are returned soldiers or sailors. Instead, then, of giving the returned soldier merely representation on these Boards, we have given him control of the whole of the machinery of the war gratuity; while on repatriation, of three members of the Central Board and eighteen on the State Boards, ten are returned soldiers. The Government, then, has not only fulfilled its pledges to the soldiers, but has <inline font-style="italic">gone</inline> much farther than it promised to do.

          <para>I come now to the third charge: that we have failed to take steps to deal with the causes of industrial unrest. I think I have already shown, in dealing with the first charge, that the Legislature has no power to deal with industrial unrest except by way of arbitration, «and then only in regard to certain disputes, and in a certain way. Many honorable members opposite have stood upon platforms up and down this country, bewailing the unhappy condition of the people because the National Legislature was denied the opportunity to deal with these great industrial matters, and demanding the amendment of the Constitution. But what did these honorable members do when the opportunity was given them to secure for the Legislature the  power  to deal with this greatest of all modern problems? When that plank was put before them fairly, they went out and asked the people to turn it down. Why ? </para>
          <para>The honorable gentleman has in a sort of a way approved the suggestion I have made to call, a conference of the parties interested. He asks why this has not been done before, and why has not the Arbitration Act been amended. I would remind the honorable gentleman of something. He and the members of his party have been the most prolific wasters of time in this Parliament. This is the second motion of censure he has brought forward, and he brings it forward at a time when he knows that it is more likely that Julius Caesar " dead and turned to clay " should stand at the end of this table than that his motion should' be carried. Knowing this, and knowing how precious our time is, he again invites this Parliament to turn from those matters of great moment that affect the interests and welfare of the people, in order to consider a motion of censure, the sole reason for which he knows has ceased to exist. For this motion sprang mushroom-like out of the  dungheap  of the Ballarat by-election; and now, when instead of the mushrooms we have got the toadstool, the honorable gentleman still goes on with it. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I would rather see Julius Caesar. When the honorable gentleman asks why we have not brought in legislation to amend the Arbitration Act, he may be met with two answers. One he has himself supplied. By submitting this motion he has deliberately wasted the time of this House, as he has done on many occasions. The other is inherent in the limitations of the Arbitration Court itself. I state here, as I have stated a hundred times before, that the Arbitration Court is not a convenient and effective machine for dealing with all industrial disputes. I should be the last to say that it has not done excellent work. It has done good work, but its present state of congestion shows clearly that it lumbers too  cumbrously  after the greyhound of industrial difference. We require machinery that will be more nimble and effective. I propose, at a very early date, to introduce that machinery, and to give this House the opportunity to supplement the activities of the Arbitration Court. </para>

          <para>The honorable gentleman said, in reference to my proposal to call a round table conference to discuss industrial matters, that he hoped it would be called.  I have only to say that I regret very much to have to announce that one important Labour body has deliberately declined to be represented at that round table conference. I refer to the Melbourne Trades Hall. That body will not appoint a representative to the conference. , This is the reception which every effort to bring about industrial harmony meets with in certain quarters. One of the most valuable results of the Paris Peace Conference was the International Labour Charter, which provided machinery through which Labour all over the world could make itself articulate, could -meet in conference1, and seek means to ameliorate the conditions and improve the status of workers in all countries. I brought this prominently under the notice of the Parliament. I stated then that an International Labour Conference was to be held at Washington, to which Labour the world over was invited to send representatives. This- conference was to deal with matters of the greatest importance vital to the welfare of Labour the world over. Australia was invited to send delegates, the Government bearing all the expense. How was this invitation to the greatest Labour Convention the World has ever seen received by my honorable friend's supporters? It was rejected with scorn. Yes, sir, this country, this Australia of ours, the most democratic country in the world, whose proud boast has been that it has ever been in the very vanguard of Labour, and upon the lips of whose delegates the need of international brotherhood has been the sign-manual of their profession, was the only country unrepresented at that, conference! During the war, honorable members opposite were never tired of talking about inviting the workers of all countries to join hands in order to put an end to the frightful conflict, and yet when they were asked to meet their fellow workers in Washington in order that they might do something, if not for the workers of their own country, at least something for the down-trodden workers of other countries, they churlishly declined to do so. So much, therefore, for the honorable gentleman's charge that the Government have done nothing in regard to industrial unrest. I venture to point out that if he e and his followers took their courage in. both hands and would preach to the workers outside the only gospel that can bring about industrial peace, to produce more, and to seek peaceful and harmonious means of effecting an adjustment of their mutual interests with their employers, they would do something to bring about a state of affairs which would be lastingly beneficial, not only to those whom they claim to represent, but to the whole community. But what do they do when there is a strike? What honorable member opposite has ever had the courage, when there has been a strike on, to go out and tell the men that they were wrong ? </para>

          <para>In his next charge the honorable gentleman asserts that the Government have failed to secure an adequate return to the Australian people for their wool and other primary products sold overseas. In some respects this charge is the most extraordinary/ and the least supported by facts. I listened to the honorable gentleman while he strove to make out his case. So far as I could follow him, what he said was in effect that the farmer is deserving of censure because he is selling his goods at a higher price in Australia than he obtains for them overseas. This way of helping the farmer would be to compel him to sell his pro duce at a price below the cost of production. Yet he poses as a friend of the farmer, and says that we have not protected the latter 's interest. Let me point out what we have done. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and e of the honorable member's motion read </para>

              <para>For its failure to make definite binding contracts for the sale of such products which would have prevented any possibility of profiteering overseas in Australian products at the expense of Australian producers, and would have made it possible to secure a prompt adjustment of accounts in connexion with such sales. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I take those two things together. First of all, it is utterly untrue that the present Government or the preceding Governments of which I had the honour to be a member did not do everything in their power to secure for the producer the highest possible return for his product. The Wheat Pool has handled 468,807,000 bushels of wheat, and the prices received ranged from 4s. 9d. to 6s. 3d. per bushel f.o.b. The average price of wheat for years previous to the war was 3s. 9d. a bushel. The total amounts received from local and overseas sales by the Pool up to the 5th July was £120,969,000. It was shown in evidence before the Royal Commission which sat in this State that the farmer had received £10,000,000 above London parity by the operation of the Pool during the period of the war. So much for that. In regard to wool, sales have been made at prices 55 per cent. above those ruling before the war, and the four clips have realized to date £170,000,000, whilst under arrangements made by the Government it is estimated that the growers will receive approximately £40,000,000 as their share of the profits on re-sales. The Wool Committee has handled 7,000,000 bales of wool. Those figures speak for themselves. They show that, including the half-share of profits, the growers will receive nearly double the prewar value of their wool. It has been said that those arrangements were not definite and precise. Nothing is farther from the truth. The arrangements were most definite; the contracts made in regard to wheat were all in the form of ordinary contracts, and set out most minutely the duty of each party. The interest of the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian producer has been most carefully safeguarded. , I, myself, have sold for the producer 5,200,000 tons of wheat. In those contracts, as with the contracts made direct through the Board, the interest of the farmer was protected in, every particular. It is entirely wrong to suppose that the contracts were made in a loose manner. I have not time to set out the details, but I have telegrams here which show with what meticulous care the details of the contracts ' were covered by the telegrams which passed between the British Government and the Government of the Commonwealth. I need only remind honorable members that during the war there was but one buyer of wheat, and unless that buyer could have been induced to buy it was impossible for us to sell our wheat anywhere else. That created a situation without precedent, and one which could not be endured without relief; relief was to be obtained in only one direction, and we obtained it. As with wheat, so with wool. Money was made available to the producer before the wheat and wool were shifted from our shores. As examples of the procedure followed in all overseas sales of our products I may quote one or two instances. In connexion with the first wheat deals in 1915 there was, firstly, an inquiry from the British Government by telegram. That was followed by a definite offer from this end, and subsequently an acceptance in precise terms by the British Government. So it was with each deal. In 1916 there was an offer and acceptance, and a confirmation of such acceptance. In regard to wool, the same procedure was followed. A cable dated 14th November, 1916, contained a definite offer from the British Government to 'purchase the whole of Australia's clip of cross-bred and merino wool. I think it proper to state here that it is clearly shown in this cable that this is the result of representations made by me when in London during that year. It sets out quite clearly what the British authorities ' were prepared to do. That offer was laid before the representatives of the wool -growers ; they agreed to sell on the basis of ls. 3d. per pound for greasy wool. I cabled on their behalf an offer to sell at ls. 3$d. per lb., and this was accepted by the British Government. </para>
          <para class="block">I obtained for them <inline font-style="italic">$ha.t</inline> extra halfpenny per pound, which, apart from anything else, has yielded to the wool-growers £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 above what they would otherwise have received. A cablegram sent on the 4th December set out the duties of the parties, the machinery by which the transaction was to be carried out, and, in short, followed the method invariably adopted by business men in connexion with such contracts. In a cablegram received on the 13th December, the British Government accepted the offer. There was then a definite contract made. The price, conditions of sale and duties of each party were clearly set out. And this applied to every renewal of the contract. So much for the charges made by the honorable member in regard to the sale of primary products. The interests of the primary producers have been carefully safeguarded: they have sold their products under unique circumstances - when there was only one effective buyer, and no means of shifting their goods - at prices which speak for 'themselves. The contracts for the sale of these products have been carefully drawn, and have protected the interests of the producers. The honorable member's charges fail utterly, as he expected them to do. He indeed indicated so much in his final statement that those who voted against the motion would have to account to their constituents for their vote. ' Of course that is quite true; they will have to account for every one of their votes. &gt; The honorable member's motion fails, as it was fully expected by him to do. But there remains behind all this smoke some fire, or behind this fire some smoke. "Why is it that the Labour party, which once held undisputed sway over the Common-  wealth in this Legislature, and in the Parliaments of five of the six States, is today in this abject position ? The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the people, as if he represented them. </para>

              <para>- This once great party, which at one time held an almost unchallengeable position in this country, stands to-day where? It is rendered almost hysterical because it has won a byelection, thus increasing its strength in this House from twenty-five to twenty-six members. Let me remind honorable members opposite that on the day when, in the room upstairs, we were faced with a great crisis in the history of the country, I was the Leader of a party of seventy-two men. That same party to-day has a strength in both Houses of twenty-seven, whilst I lead a party of seventy-two. </para>

              <para>- It is a fact. Why is it that the Labour party, whose record for years and years was an uninterrupted series of victories, has fallen on such evil days ? Let me remind honorable members opposite of what they know only too well : In 1901, the Labour party numbered in the House of Representatives 16, and in the Senate 8, making a total of 24; in 1904, in the House of Representatives 24, and in the Senate 14, or a total of 38 ; in 1907, in the House of Representatives 26, and in the Senate 15, or a total of 41 ; in 1910, in the House of Representatives 41, and in the Senate 23, or a total of 64; in 1913, in the House of Representatives 39, and in the Senate 29, making a total of 68 ; in 1914, in the House of Representatives 42, and in the Senate 31, making a total of 73 ; in 1917 - when the party appealed to Csesar - in the House of Representatives 22, and subsequently 23, and in the Senate 13, making a total of 36; and in 1919, in the House of Representatives 26, and in the Senate 1, making, a total of 27. Let us probe beneath all this debris and look at the buried masonry of the once glorious temple of Labour. </para>

I point out to honorable members who are so constantly interjecting that their words almost assume the length of speeches in themselves ; and that every honorable member has the right to speak actually at great length upon the motion before the Chair; and I again emphasize that any interjection, coming from no matter which side of the House, is disorderly. It is painful to have to call upon honorable members to maintain order, hut I ask that the Chair be assisted, and neither ignored nor defied. </para>

              <para>- In 1910, the figures in connexion with the Senate election showed that the votes cast for Labour totalled 2,021,090; for Liberals; 1,830,353, and for Independents, 166,676; majority for Labour, 190,737. I may say that, in none of the comparisons which I "am now about to make between the two parties are the votes of Independents included. In 1913, the Labour vote was 2,802,529; Liberal, 2,840,420; Independent, 109,248; majority for Liberals, 37,891. In 1914- the year of the double dissolution - the Labour figures were 6,223,900; Liberal, 5,500,223; Independent, 9,799; majority for Labour, 723,677. In 1917, official Labour votes totalled 2,776,648; Nationalist, 3,516,354; Independent, 57,368; majority for the Nationalists, 739,706. In 1919- and here I shall quote first preferences only - the figures for official Labour were 795,858; Nartionalists, 868,016; farmers, 172,626; Independent, 21,323; majority for Nationalists over Labour, 72,158; combined vote against Labour, 1,040,642; combined majority of Nationalists and Farmers over Labour, 244,784. As I have said, independent votes are not taken into account. </para>

          <para>The figures speak for themselves. They demonstrate that at every election from 1901, every year, an increasing number of Labour supporters entered this Legislature until that black day in 1916, when the action of the majority of the party, taken at the bidding of those who had captured the machinery of the Labour movement, rent the united Labour party asunder. From that day to this, Labour - owing to the actions of those who have led it - has been wandering in the wilderness discredited and powerless. It has betrayed all those great principles of which it was so proud, and which it had held up to the topmost heights in the years that have gone. It has turned its back on those things which it had declared as being beyond price. It stood here stalwartly advocating an amendment of the Constitution; yet at the bidding of some of its leaders urged the people to vote against it. Compulsory training emanating from the Labour party, and declared by it to be the one thing necessary for the salvation of the country has been trampled -under foot. But a few short years since the Labour party was never tired of boasting that it had placed compulsory training on the Statute Book. But the gentleman who is to be returned here from </para>
          <para class="block">Ballarat in a few days openly proclaimed himself opposed to it. We were inordinately proud of what we had done for the Australian Navy, and we declared that any man who would do anything to weaken it would be thrusting a dagger at the heart of our national safety. Yet the man who is about to return here says he is not in favour of an effective Australian Navy! Why have they turned their backs on these great principles which they advocated so long and with such earnestness?' Is there one thing they stand for to-day for which they formerly stood? </para>
          <para>Let me remind honorable members of some things they would fain forget. Let me recall an incident of 1915, which, perhaps, tells its own story better than anything else. In that early year of the war, at the Inter-State Labour Conference, in Adelaide, a certain resolution was passed; and I ask honorable gentlemen opposite whether, in any Conference at which they may gather to-day, such a resolution would be met by anything 1 .t scorn and derision. At the Adelaide Conference, on 3rd June, 1915, the following motion was proposed: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the following message be sent to HisMajesty: - " The Commonwealth Political Labour Council, in conference assembled at Adelaide, loyally presents birthday greetings to  His  Majesty King George V., congratulates him on the attainment of his fiftieth anniversary, and confidently hopes that during the coming year his reign will be crowned by victory for the British and Allied arms in the great war of freedom and the realization of an enduring peace." </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This motion was carried to the accompaniment of cheers. When we turn from this striking evidence of the loyalty of the Labour party when led by men who had made and led the Labour movement from the beginning to the record of this same party since 1916 ; when we examine the chronicle of its doings during the years which followed the split, we perceive a complete explanation of its present position. We realize also the reason why it is where it is, and why it did what it has done. </para>

There is no outside organization, of any sort that can say to me, " Do this," and I will do it. There was an organization - the Labour party as it once was - which could do so; but it asked me to do the one thing which was impossible, and I refused it. It asked me to do that which was dishonorable to myself and treacherous to my country, and I would not do it.

          <para>I have just recalled one incident in the Adelaide Conference of 1915. I have set forth the figures of Labour's sweeping majority in 1914, when we polled 6,223,000, as against 5,500,000 by our opponents, giving us a majority of 723,000 in the electorates, and an overwhelming majority in both Houses of the Federal Legislature - there being thirty-one of our members in the Senate, and forty-two in the House of Representatives, making a grand total of seventy-three. Let me recall one or two things in order to make it clear as day to all who are not wilfully blind why the Labour party was triumphantly victorious in 1914, and why it has been overwhelmingly defeated ever since. I will read, for the benefit of honorable members, an extract from the Labour manifesto of 1914, the manifesto which fits the loyal resolution just quoted as a glove does the hand. It states - </para>

            <para>Our interests and our very existence are bound up with those of the Empire. In time of war half-measures are worse than none.

          <para class="block">That was the spirit of the Labour party as it existed in 1914. This attitude typified the very soul of the Australian people. It was in the genuine belief that we were animated by this spirit that the people decided to intrust us with the difficult task of governing the country during the supreme crisis of its history. But what is the position to-day? I turn from the manifesto of 1914 - in consequence of which we re-entered this Parliament with seventy-three supporters - to the sayings of those who to-day are admittedly in the inner council, in the holy of holies, of the Labour party. Here are some of their utterances :  - </para>

            <para>What does the Union Jack stand for so far as the Irish people are concerned? It stands for 700 years of oppression and alien rule; it stands for the depopulation of Ireland; it stands for the ruin of Ireland's trade and prosperity; it stands for coercion and martial law; it stands for famine and exile; it reminds Irishmen of the blood shed by those who loved their country above their lives. This is what the Empire flag stands for in the minds of the Irish people.

              <para>- Order ! If the right honorable the Prime Minister is disinclined to support the authority of the Chair  when  called upon to do so, whether the time occupied by the motion is taken out of his time or not, I am afraid it will be impossible to preserve order in debate. The honorable member for Maribyrnong distinctly defied the Chair on three occasions by deliberately interjecting after being requested by the Chair to conform to the rules of the House and maintain order, and no other course is open to me but to request the Prime Minister to move that the honorable member- for Maribyrnong be suspended from the sitting of the House. </para>

              <para>- I hope the honorable member for Maribyrnong will take the usual course by submitting to the authority of the representative which this House has chosen to preside over its deliberations, and thus uphold and maintain order and decorum in debate. If anything I may have said caused irritation, the honorable member must recognise, nevertheless, that in refusing to obey the Chair he is really offending against himself and his own privileges. I never move the motion I am now asked to submit, without the utmost reluctance. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has been here for a long time, and I ask him, as a sensible man, to adopt the proper course, and apologize to the Chair. </para>

              <para>- I was saying, when honorable members interrupted me, that  the Official Labour party had fallen upon evil days. If we contrast its present position with that which it previously occupied, and remember how abruptly, towards the end of 1916, it turned from being the very embodiment of warlike spirit and loyalty, to that attitude of grovelling pacifism and disloyalty, which marked our enemies everywhere, we need not look in vain for the explanation. I think I have given honorable members the key to it. Every one knows what I have said to be true. I warned my friends of the Labour party, when amongst them, that they had come to the parting of the ways. Since .then they have realized that I spoke the truth. Had they stood fast then, they would to-day, as they did then, enjoy the confidence of the people of Australia. This they have lost. They have gone farther into the morass by throwing this and that principle aside, and still they go on, under the leadership of those whose object is, not the improvement of the condition of the workers nor the elevation and progress of Australia/ - they care nothing for the Labour movement save as it will serve their purpose - they have, no concern even for Australia - but the dismemberment of the British Empire. It is of no use mincing -words on this matter. This is the avowed object of those who now control the Labour movement. If honorable members opposite deny that the section to which I refer controls the Labour movement, then they are saying that which they know to be untrue. Any one who knows the Labour movement can prove it. But they know it very well. There was a time when things were very different; a time when these men would have been "booted" out of the Labour movement ; but to-day they are its chosen leaders. At this very moment the Leader of the Opposition himself is in peril. Let me prove it by a quotation : - </para>

          <para>This Labour party was swept into power by the people at a great crisis - chosen because it was believed to .be loyal to the Empire and the living embodiment of every great principle for which Australia stands. It carried out the wishes of the people until 1916, when it became the mere tool of that disloyal section amongst us to which I have referred. Then what a change came over its actions and its attitude! It had been for the war, for the Empire. But at the bidding of those who had captured its councils, it turned against the war,  against the Empire.

          <para>All these things fit like the marbles into a solitaire board - the pattern is filled up, nothing is missing. These gentlemen still mouth some of their ancient shibboleths, but they are bound to the wheel. Their movement is in chains. They talk and talk about the high cost of living, but say nothing as to why they voted against the only effective  way  of  dealing with it. Nothing as to -why they abandoned compulsory training. They talk about the soldier, and proclaim themselves his champions, but they say nothing of why they abandoned him during the dark days of the war, or why they passed those resolutions at Perth in favour of a dishonorable and craven peace. We know, however, why they did all these things; we know the reasons for their abandonment of the principles which they formerly held so dear. It is because their machinery has been captured by those who would hurl them out of Parliament and office in the twinkling of an eye if they had dared to act in any other way. </para>
          <para>I have said that Labour has fallen under the domination of disloyalists - those who seek to dismember the Empire - and wild extremists.

          <para class="block">The Victorian Labour Conference, on the 20th April, 1919, expressed earnest hope for Bolshevist success in Russia, recognising " that common ownership and workers' management of the means of production" were sought. The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> according to the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call,</inline> Melbourne, of the 8th August, 1918, "hoped to see the policy of the Bolsheviks accepted all over the world " ; and ex-Senator Barnes, in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 21st January, 1919,. is reported as saying, "I am looking with hope to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia." Disloyalty and Bolshevism, between them explain everything that has happened to the Labour movement. They explain why it was that in 1914 the party was returned with seventy-two men, and to-day has twenty-seven in both Houses; they explain why at every election from 1901 to 1914, the party which went on without a reverse, gathering strength with every step, in 1917 met with such an appalling defeat. For twenty years in States and Commonwealth the party grew, favoured by the people, who believed it to be a party which would place principle before everything. Then came the hour of fiery trial. </para>
          <para class="block">In that hour the Labour party failed - it became the bondsman of crafty and disloyal men and wild fanatics. We have seen the ground around its feet littered with the <inline font-style="italic">debris</inline> of broken principles. Yet, this party has still the effrontery to speak of the violation of pledges by this Government. I challenge honorable members opposite to mention, during the years of the Labour party's triumph, any influence that has been exerted on behalf of the workers of this country in which I have hot played a great part. I particularly challenge them to say what they have done in the last few years except to destroy the Labour party. What is the policy of the party now ? It is a policy of destruction. In the industrial sphere it is a policy of " go slow " - of strikes. In Howe national sphere it is a policy of dismemberment of the Empire. In war, a degrading pact has to be made with the enemy. In Parliament, time is wasted. It is this party which has denied this Government power to deal with problems of the first importance to the people - industrial matters, Trusts and Combines, which for years they declared were a menace to the people. Honorable members on this side, to whom I was at one time opposed, know what the Labour party said in the days that are gone, and what they have done since 191C. And the people .of Australia know and will remember. Those behind their councils said that they must abandon compulsory training. They broke their god, smashing it to pieces at the bidding of men who led them to destruction. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has moved a vote of censure on the Government, but it would have been infinitely more proper had I moved a vote of censure on those who have shipwrecked the Labour movement. I tell him that the day will come when the Labour movement will have to fight for its life against those who are seeking to destroy it. </para>
          <para>I have said all I intend to say, and I am sure that some honorable members opposite will think I have said far too much. But they have deliberately chosen to put forward, as a pretext, this wretched, flimsy motion in order to prevent Parliament going on with its business. On their heads rests the blame for wasting precious time. I have not spoken as fully as I could, but neither have I minced matters. My very soul revolts at the mouthing - I speak not of honorable members opposite, but of those outside - by men who dare to speak in the name of Labour. All they wish to do is to fool Labour, and make a tool of it in order to serve their mean, disloyal purposes. </para>

            <para>. - During the course of his remarks this afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stated that he had previously heard all that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> had said in submitting this motion. I take it,, however, that a good thing will bear constant repetition. What the Prime Minister himself told us to-day we have all heard on many occasions. We heard it the other day at Ballarat, but it had no effect, and in the light of subsequent events would have been better left unsaid. However, that is a matter of taste. The first matter dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition was that of the high cost of living. How the Prime Minister could ridicule that question I utterly fail to understand. But in his reply to the attack of the honorable member he did so. In his effort to rebut the contentions of the honorable member, the Prime Minister made statements which will not hold water. Amongst other things, he said that whilst the honorable member was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Hughes Cabinet, he did nothing to lower the high cost of living. The right honorable gentleman must be possessed of a very bad memory, otherwise he could not have made that statement. It is well known that the honorable member for Yarra, whilst acting as Minister, for Trade and Customs, called down upon his head heavy condemnation from those who were supposed to be the farmers of Australia, but who, in reality, were only middlemen. The great deputation which was received in the Queen's Hall was engineered, not by farmers, but by men who farm the farmers. The best evidence of the effective way in which the honorable member for Yarra dealt with these middlemen is supplied by the fact that at the gathering in question his name was hooted. The farmers of Australia are as much entitled to protect their own interests as is any other section of the community, but the-- have no more rights than belong to any other class. </para>

              <para>- I am glad the honorable member concedes that. The Prime Minister's statement that the honorable member for Yarra, whilst acting as Minister for Trade and Customs, did nothing to reduce the high cost of living isa not correct. I would certainly use a stronger term in this connexion but that it would be unparliamentary to do so. What are the facts? In 1914, shortly after the honorable member for Yarra became Minister for Trade and Customs, it was made apparent that there would be a great shortage of wheat in Australia. ' Everybody knew that the approaching harvest would be small, and that wheat of inferior quality would need to be imported. Thereupon the honorable ' member for Yarra stopped the export of wheat and placed that commodity upon the free list. I have heard many condemn him for allowing wheat to come into Australia free of duty, but in the interests of the people that course had to be adopted. The honorable member also rendered good service in connexion with such commodities as meat and butter. Again, I say, that it was not the growers of wheat or the producers of butter who set up a howl at that time, but the men who had purchased these commodities from them and were selling them abroad for purposes of profit. Just as the producers of Australia should condemn the Government for their mishandling of our primary products abroad during the period of the war, they ought to assist us in condemning those middlemen who handle their commodities for the purposes of profit. We all know that since the armistice, and during the drought period, the farmer has been unable to fatten his cattle and sheep, and that while he has been receiving a less price for his stock the consumer has been paying a higher price for his meat than he has ever paid before. Our condemnation of these middlemen is therefore warranted, and should be supported by all those who are supposed to represent the primary producer of this country. </para>

But there are members of the Country party in this chamber who cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be called farmers. It cannot be controverted that, during the past few months, the people of Australia have been paying more for their meat than they have ever paid for it previously, and that the quality of the article supplied to them has been very inferior. Much of the meat put upon the market has been very tough, yet high prices have been paid for it. Is it any wonder that the people resent high prices being exacted from them for meat of inferior quality? </para>

              <para>- At a fair price. If the honorable member will go back to the early part of 1915, he will find that the dearth of shipping had not then become acute. There was not, at that time, the clamant demand by our producers for the world's parity, because meat and butter were then being sold for export cheaper than they were being sold for local consumption. To-day contracts are in existence for the supply of these commodities overseas for 50 per cent. less than they are being sold locally. </para>

              <para>- I am informed on very reliable authority that there are now in our freezing chambers large quantities of meat which has been sold overseas for 6d. per lb., notwithstanding that the wholesale price locally is 9d. per lb. We know that today the people of Victoria are paying1s. per lb. for tough bull's hide. I can speak upon this matter from personal knowledge, because I have very good teeth. I have mentioned these particular commodities because the Prime Minister, who has more effrontery than have ten ordinary men, has stated that the Leader of the Opposition, when filling the office of Minister for Trade and Customs, did nothing to keep down the price of foodstuffs. The right honorable gentleman knows perfectly well that at the time of which he was speaking there was grave doubt, owing to the decisions of the High Court, whether anything could be accomplished in that direction. I might enumerate much more that was done by the honorable member for Yarra to reduce the cost of living, and I was indeed surprised that he remained silent while the Prime Minister was making his statement. Had I been in his place, I would have interjected, in a tone sufficiently loud for even the Prime Minister to hear, that his statement was far from the truth. But the Leader of the Opposition refrained from interjecting, being evidently possessed of very much more patience than I have. It is no news to honorable members to be told what was done, because of the middlemen who engineered the mass deputation to which I have already referred. The members of that deputation, instead of wearing red ties, wore bits of wool in their buttonholes, and were evidently very proud of these emblems. They did considerable damage to the Queen's Hall in their zeal to howl down the name of Tudor. There was never a greater compliment paid to any man than that paid to him by the deputation in question when they hooted the mere mention of his name. By their action they admitted that the regulations which he had framed whilst filling the position of Minister for Trade and Customs had prevented them from cornering meat and butter. Until all these primary products were pooled, the farmers of Australia did not get the price for them that they should have received. They were obliged to sell in order to meet their liabilities. They had to sell their wheat at1s. 81/2d. per bushel in 1893, just after the great financial crisis in Victoria, when Melbourne was almost deserted, yet the middlemen who bought it sold it afterwards at 3s. 6d. and 3s.71/2d. per bushel. If the representatives of the farmers are determined that this should not happen again, they ought to support us in our endeavour to see that the people who produce get a fair return, while at the same time a fair price is charged to the consumer. Some representatives of the farmers seem to object to the desire of the workers to get commodities as cheaply as possible; but while the workers claim that the wages they are paid shall be- in proportion to the cost of living - I think, they ought to claim more' - they are all, with the exception, perhaps, of a few cranks, ready to admit that the farmer should receive a price which will give him a fair chance of living in comfort. </para>

          <para>When the Leader of the Opposition presented his case in regard to the bad handling of our commodities on the other side of the world, that charge being laid against the Government,, it was peculiar that, when the Prime Minister, was replying there was not a word of rebuttal from any honorable member in the Corner. Neither did the Prime Minister answer the charge. He was not aware that other nations had received our goods, and were charging higher prices for them ; but it was something he should have known. The Government ought to be able to follow all our commodities where they go, and demand that the Australian producer shall get the full return for what he sends away. I do not think that the producers ought to be so hard on the workers as, according to some of their statements, they appear to be. But perhaps it is thoughtlessness on their part. On the other hand I want the producers to get a fair deal. It is not under estimating the amount when I say that they have lost £100,000,000 on the sale of their products overseas. We are told that the armies of the United States of America were clothed with our wool at about ls. 3£d. per lb. </para>

We should have been able to reduce very considerably the financial strain on the country through the sale of our commodities. This was a matter which the ex-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> went to Great Britain to negotiate. Now we are told that there, is difficulty in the way, and we are led to believe that the honorable member for Balaclava resigned .his portfolio because be was not permitted to handle this very complex question in his own way. However, I regret that Australia did not get more of the money, because I know that the capitalists of other countries got it, and are now endeavouring to squeeze us here as well as the people of Great Britain. </para>

          <para>Having failed in his endeavour to prove that the Leader of the Opposition had done nothing towards reducing the cost of living, the Prime Minister in that peculiar style of his own, which is very effective with a lot of people, although not with honorable members in the House, launched forth upon an oratorical attack on the Labour party of Australia for having refused to accept his proposal for increasing the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. But he knows very well that the Bill he brought forward was not a copy of the Labour party's proposals. So much had been cut away from our proposals that it could not be recognised as being anything like the Bills put before the people by this party in 1910 and 1913, and which we again desired to submit to the people in 1916, but were prevented because the Prime Minister had accepted something from the State Premiers which afterwards they did not concede. As a matter of fact, when the Prime Minister's Bill was brought forward last year, the majority of our party accepted it, feeling that it was better to catch half a loaf than to have no bread, but the measure was so distorted in the Senate as to be rendered absolutely useless. In the circumstances, the honorable gentleman's statement that we were going back on the great desire of the Labour party to increase the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament cannot be sustained, and he knows it. When the Bill returned from the Senate, I objected to it, and, although the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> ' maintained that it was the same measure, it took the </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister three-quarters of an hour to elaborate the necessity for the alteration made in another place. Our proposals had been so cut down that they were hardly recognisable, and I for one could see there was no chance of the Bill being brought into operation. For one thing, the time would certainly expire before the proposed Convention could meet to draw up by some mutual arrangement the powers to be given to this Parliament. No one could imagine States which claimed sovereign rights conceding one jot of power to this Parliament, and I am sure that it will never be done by concession from the State Parliaments until the people of the States become alive to the situation, and make the demand that it shall be done. The Labour party turned down the Prime Minister's Bill because he would not ask for the full powers we thought this Parliament should possess, and there was consternation among many in the ranks when the question was left free to the individual, because a large number of our supporters outside advocated that the party should reject the Prime Minister's proposal outright. The Prime Minister is perfectly well aware of our reason for turning it down. We realized that, even if the people agreed to the Bill, the powers given to this Parliament would be useless. </para>
          <para>The right honorable gentleman went on to talk of the past glories of the great Labour movement. It comes with ill grace for him to gloat over the downfall of the movement, seeing that he was the principal cause of it. He would have shown more decency if he had left the question alone. By a play of words, he can make those who agree with him believe anything, but he cannot make those who understand the question believe in what he says. They are aware that it is nothing but his usual attempt to force his opinion ' on others. The Prime Minister will live to regret much that he has done, and which is now beyond recall, but it makes one's blood boil to hear him gibing at the Labour party because of the smallness of its numbers as compared with 1913-14, when we know that he was the principal cause of the whittling down of these numbers. No party can live with disruption within its ranks. No party can go to the country broken, and hope to come back successful. The Prime Minister knows that to-day he handles very lightly the majority on the other side of the chamber. Just before the adjournment for the visit of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the right honorable gentleman turned his back upon this side, and, addressing the Corner party, and those disgruntled ones sitting immediately behind the Government bench, said, " If I am to be pushed by anybody, it will not be by this side." On another occasion, boiling because of attacks made from his own side, he said, " I have led that side, and I have led this side, and I know where I got the most loyalty. It was not from this side." On each occasion, it was a warning to those on his side who would break away. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister made another charge against the leaders of the Labour movement. He said that the disabilities of the, workers could be removed, and the unrest that is causing so much discontent stopped, by a round-table conference of employers and employees, at which "the wolf would dwell with the lamb." We know, however, that when that happens the wolf has everything his own way, and the lamb is eaten. ' That is why the representatives of the Trades Hall would not' accept places at such a conference. They knew that after they had made, a fight, and used all the guile that is needed to meet successfully the rapacious profiteer, whatever concessions their ingenuity might extract for the benefit of the wage-earners, no lasting advantage would be gained. When employers and employees confer to settle a question, though the workers may gain an advance in wages, that advantage is immediately whittled away by a rise in prices. To make things even for the workers, there would have to be round-table conferences every fortnight. The refusal of the representatives of the Trades Hall of Victoria to attend a round-table conference was a warning to those who wished to sit with them as to the temper of the workers to-day. Notwithstanding his taunts and gibes at the workers, the Prime Minister was" "beating the air." Of course, he may get many foolish workers to believe him, because at the close of his address he brought to bear his long-range gun, and he imported what some persons call " insecticide." For many years past that has been the last shot fired. He knows what he can do with it, and by similar methods; but these will not always act. </para>

              <para>- No. The cause of the rise in prices is that during the war certain men made enormous profits, and if prices had not gone down they would have been able to buy the world. Prices had to go up, so that their purchasing power should not be so great as in pre-war times. That may bo rule-of-thumb financing, but it is the truth. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> proposed to issue Commonwealth notes we were told that an issue of £7,000,000 in notes with a backing of 25 per cent. in gold was rotten currency. The notes were termed "Fisher's flimsiest," and it was said that we were creating a currency that would not be accepted anywhere. Yet, during the war, the banks rushed to the Treasury with 10,000,000 sovereigns, for which they accepted £40,000,000 in notes. They knew that that action was essential for the financing of Australia. What in peace time, when everything was normal, was called rotten currency was during war-time inflated 300 per cent. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister has said that the only way to improve our position is for the workers to stop going slow and to produce more. He says that when the workers realize that they can get out of the present position only in that way, it will be better for the community. It will be the better for a section of the community. The wage-earner knows that the more he produces the higher are the profits of the boss, and that in time he will be thrown on the unemployed market. I read an article recently in which it was counselled that the worker should go on producing until we got normal, and that then would be the time for him to talk; but when we become normal as regards productivity the wage-earners will be thrown out of work, and will not be able to purchase the commodities that they have manufactured or helped to produce. That has happened all over the world under the present economic system. At one time it was possible to tell the producers to go on producing. The cry in America was " Produce; produce; make your country rich." Yes, and to hell with the unfortunates who did the producing ! During the depression of 1893 the warehouses of Melbourn were full, and yet many persons were thrown out of work, and, therefore, could not buy those commodities. Why was wheat down to1s. 8d. then? It was because the people could not afford to buy it, which made it possible for those who had the money to buy it wholesale, and hold it until they could get a better price six months later. To say that the worker should produce more in order to improve his position is to say something so economically unsound that I wonder the Prime Minister uttered it. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps it is not. The Prime Minister raised his voice about the loyalty of the Labour party. He referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> promise of the last man and the last shilling, and he spoke of the message that was sent to  His  Majesty King George the Fifth, on his birthday, in 1915. That message was news to me. The wax in 19.14 was a very different thing from the war in 1916, because, in March of the latter year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George admitted that the Germans were howling for, peace - his statement appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> .and in other British newspapers - " But," he said, " we will go on until we bring them to their knees." The Labour .movement then recognised .that we were no longer fighting .for our own protection, but for the money-bags of Great Britain and her Allies. What was gained by prolonging the war for two years and six months ? Have the Germans been 'brought to their knees ? According to to-night's <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> they are still giving impertinence at Spa, and .have .caused a dead -lock. That the Germans should dare to claim from the representatives of so-called civilized nations the right to live themselves seems to be a .matter for surprise. Had the war been- brought to an end in .1916, when the Germans knew that they could not gain what they w.er.e after, millions of lives would have been spared, and -thousands of millions of pounds would have been saved. But the making of profits :of thousands of pounds .by war contractors would have been stopped. </para>

          <para>When the Prime Minister referred to our victory at Ballarat, he again soared to the heights. He charged the honorable member-elect for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> with wanting to do away with ' the Australian Navy. Does any honorable member believe that the people of Australia will stand the keeping up of the Navy we have with its establishment of about 5,000 men, and its -enormous cost? Before the war, our expenditure on the Navy was £800,000 or £900,000. To-day it is over £5,000,000, although we were told that the object of the war was to. put a stop to the expenditure on war material and the raising of armies. "It is said 'that if we had stopped the war in 1916 our victory would not have been an effective one. Is it an effective victory now when we have to. keep armies and navies larger than we kept before? The hope held out to the people was that when the war was finished we would do away with our enormous armies and navies. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> that it is impossible for the people of Australia to pay for the Army and Navy at the rate we are paying now. </para>

              <para>- I still say that the expenditure on the Navy will be about £5,000,000 a year. We are not ashamed to contend that the expenditure on the Army and Navy should he reduced, as we were told it would be reduced. The Government are trying to make up their minds how far they will reduce it, and how and then we read an inspired article in the press about what they intend. Yet, when a Labour representative dares to state during an election campaign that our military and naval expenditure will have to come down, and that our Navy will have to be broken up, the Prime Minister regards him with horror, and endeavours to make capital out of what he has said. If the press, which talks about economy, would howl for it in that direction, it would be much more effective than when it cries out for the reduction of wages among the working members of the community. If the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> had devoted to the Army and Navy expenditure one quarter of the space which it gave to the " salary grab," it might have done some good, but it is not getting a share of the " salary grab" whereas it is getting a share of the other profits. That is why it will not howl about them Our expenditure on the Army and Navy is one of the directions in which we can economize., No Labour man will ever be ashamed of saying that, now that the great war which was to settle all wars is over, most of our warships should be placed upon the scrap heap. We know that is all they are fit for. I do not ask the Minister for the Navy to admit it. </para>

              <para>- I am giving the honorable member my own opinion. I am not speaking for the party, but I believe the general opinion of the party is that the present Navy establishment is too large for Australia to keep up ; that the expenditure ought to be reduced ; and that much of the Fleet that we saw here recently could safely be stored away in Sydney harbor, or in portion of Hobson-'s Bay, or some other port, with watchmen on board. Then the people could look with awe upon it as upon a relic of the great war. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> on one occasion, when I said that most of our Navy ought to be scrapped, asked if I was serious, seeing that I was the representative of a naval port. If I tried to bolster up unnecessary expenditure simply from a desire to hold my seat, I would be unworthy to represent any section of the community. In spite of the fact that I may lose votes by my attitude, I still say that our Navy establishment is too large. We cannot afford it, and that is where economy ought to be applied. </para>

          <para class="block">Treasurer must extract it from somewhere, and if the war had continued, he could still have produced millions. We paid a good deal of war expenditure out of revenue, but we are not doing so now. If the Treasurer liked to tax those who have made the most money, according to the extent of their wealth, he would find that they could spare a few millions without being hurt. We are often told about the great wealth of the country, but most of it is held by a few persons, who have not made it by their own exertions, but by exploiting the rest of th* community, although they have done it legally. They could not have made their wealth if it had not been for the rest of the community, because only human beings can produce wealth. Many of those who have produced it for the wealthy people of Australia have fallen by the wayside. They have become invalids, or have been worn out. In our present economic system, old men and women cannot be  poleaxed,  or thrown to  the lions and tigers at Royal Park. Such practices would not be  tolerated  even by our present partial civilization.' In past days, before we had .become even a quarter civilized, people who were old and worn out were never considered at all. In much of our present day legislation we recognise that it is the duty of the State to look after the interests of its people, but in calculating the wages that a man should receive the tendency is to reckon only what it costs him to live, taking no account of his need to put by savings for his old age. The Acting Treasurer has stated recently that he cannot find money to increase the old-age and invalid pensions. During the last six or seven months I have received quite a hundred letters from all parts of the Commonwealth from people who have told me the actual facts about their position. Through no fault of their own they find that the 15s. a week pension is all they have to live on. One old lady tells me that her savings of £800 were lost in the failure of one of the building societies twenty years ago. She is now 80 years of age, and all she has to look to is the 15s. per week pension. There must be hundreds and thousands of these cases. V.Te know that those who ' can get no assistance from relatives or friends cannot possibly live on 15s. a week. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Lemmon, a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, has forwarded me a letter from an old couple, over 70 years of age, who wrote from a benevolent asylum to ask him if they could not possibly get some of the increased pension money. Somebody has the money in the community. The Treasurer will not make friends by taking it from those who have it, but civilization demands that something more should be done towards the support of these unfortunate people. War widows originally received a pension of £1 per week; but, finding that they could not live on that allowance, the Government granted them an, increase. Recently the amount has been reduced in the case of young widows to £1 per "week. </para>

              <para>- That is not correct. If we were in .power, we should hot be afraid to tax those who have the money in order to raise the funds necessary to provide an invalid and old-age pension of £1 per week. The increase from 12s. 6d. to 15s. per week was made only last January, but the cost of living is still going up. In passing, I may say that no trade union will ever again be induced to sign an agreement for three years, or even twelve months, because the workers now realize that a wage that they might to-day consider adequate would probably be wholly inadequate three months hence, because of the increase in prices. We are told that as wages increase so the cost of living must go up. If that is so, a change must be made in our social system. We shall have to change our industrial conditions unless we are to say that the workers must be content, as in the old days, to accept without cavil whatever is offered to them. The day has long since passed when the workers would be prepared to do anything of the kind. The Prime Minister said this evening that we were wasting time by discussing this motion instead of giving the Government an opportunity to deal with the cost of living. They have, however, given us no evidence of any intention on their part to move in the right direction. If the cost of living is to go on increasing we shall have more trouble. We have had a strike in Melbourne for some weeks; but it is only the forerunner of an infinitely larger trouble that will arise unless some action is taken to put down profiteering. I hope that the Government will find some way of providing the money necessary to enable them to keep their compact with the men who have fought for us, and with their dependants. I hope, also, that they will increase the invalid and old-age pensions in proportion to the increase in the cost of living. </para>

When the War Gratuity Bill was before us, the Prime Minister distinctly stated that it had been so framed that the harpies who prey upon mankind would be unable to make money by trafficking in these bonds. He declared that no one would be able to rob the returned soldier of the full face value of his bond. I do not know whether certain traders in the community have discovered a flaw in the Act, but I do know that, in many cases, the bonds have changed hands under circumstances that were not contemplated when the Bill was before the House. </para>

              <para>- In come cases soldiers are being told that they can purchase furniture to the value of 60 or 70 per cent, of their bonds, and receive the balance in cash. This system of trafficking is being so largely resorted to by certain traders that unless- a stop is put to it ' immediately our second-hand furniture shops will shortly be overcrowded with furniture purchased by soldiers merely with the object of getting cash for portion of their bonds. If there is a flaw in the Act every one should know of it. Why should one section of the community be able to deal in this way with men who wish to get cash for their bonds, while others who are prepared to do business in a genuine, straightforward way are shut out? </para>

              <para>- The men were promised a cash gratuity, and the Government should have been prepared, if necessary, to find the money by a compulsory loan. If the Act is ineffective, so that harpies are able to trade in these bonds to the detriment of the soldiers, the Government should immediately amend it. If they are not prepared to do that, they should, at least, make a straightforward statement on the subject, and so put every one on the same plane. Will the Acting Treasurer state whether it is a fact that tradespeople, before taking a bond from a soldier in payment for goods are able to go to the Treasury and have the bonds transferred to them? </para>

          <para class="block">Labour party were outside the movement. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> was our leader. He knows that is not correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> has as much right to interfere in the political world as has any other minister of religion, and no more. He has' as much right to interfere in political affairs as has the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodfull,</inline> the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Worrall,</inline> or any of their class. If he has been more effective in his- interference, it is, perhaps, because he is a strong man and the others are weaklings. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> has taken advantage of every opportunity to attack the Ministerial party, he was justified in doing so. He occupies rather a peculiar position, because, as an Irishman, and one of a race who have always been clamouring for liberty they have never been allowed to enjoy, his sympathies are naturally with the downtrodden. I am not a member of his Faith, 'but rather the opposite, as I have frequently said; but, unlike the clergymen of other denominations, he has taken the side of the lowly in the community; and because he has done so, we are told that he is our leader: That he is admired by a great section of the workers is quite correct, and if they choose to admire him who shall say them nay? When the Prime Minister drags this question into political life, as he did successfully at the last general election, and as with less success he endeavoured to do at the Ballarat by-election, he treads upon, very dangerous ground. He hurls these taunts at us to-day in the hope that they will prove injurious to our party ; but let me gay that we welcome assistance from every section, of the community. In my opinion, it is to the everlasting disgrace of the representatives of other churches that they have not been found with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> on the side of the lowly, but on the other side. It is because of this difference that the Prime Minister selects the representative of a particular church and hurls at him, and us, the taunt that he is our leader. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> has assisted us- in many directions, and that his assistance has been used to injure the Labour party. But honorable members opposite will not always be able to adopt that course. It will not wash for ever. They have talked of our  disloyalty, that of Dr: Mannix, and about dismembering the- Empire. Suppose that we did dismember the </para>
          <para class="block">Empire, who should say us nay if to do so were for the benefit of the people?  Is  it not the boast of this great and glorious Empire that it concerns itself with the -well-being of its people. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> does not approve of these remarks. Those associated with the honorable member do not want to disrupt the Empire, because it is by waving the flag that they have made their money. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister taunted the Leader of the Opposition by reading 'an extract from a newspaper playing Ryan against Tudor and Tudor against Ryan, and endeavoured to belittle the honorable member. -Our party is like every, other party in this respect. If certain members of the party believe that one of their number would make a better leader than .another, what is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prevent them <inline font-style="italic">from holding</inline> such a belief? Why should the Prime Minister throw, stones? Does he not know that the names of Watt and Hughes are set one against the other? Is there not an impression throughout Australia to-day that we have only- to wait until Watt gets back to &gt;see what " Billy " Hughes will get? People who live in glass-houses should not throw stones, and the Prime Minister should certainly not throw stones until he knows what will happen when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> returns. The suggestion of rivalry between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> will not break up the party on this side, whatever may be the effect upon the party opposite of the rivalry between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> Let the Prime Minister keep -his personal taunts to himself. When he becomes personal we can give him all he wants. We have had newspapers counting how many on the opposite side will follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and how many will follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> There may be some truth in what is said in the newspapers. But it is -the same with every political party. I am told that even in the Farmers' party there 'aTe some who think that they might have another leader. Throughout, the Prime Minister's reply we had nothing but taunts, and he would not deal with tha motion before the House. </para>

I deal with the case as one concerning a community that is supposed to. be free. It is stated that because Father Jerger is of German birth or extraction he is to be deported from this country. How brave we are! We were going to try and execute thousands of Germans who perpetrated most damnable acts during the war. They were to be brought to trial by the Allies and have meted out to them the punishment they deserved. </para>

              <para>- Just because we cannot get at him he is to be let off, and Father Jerger is to be punished for something he did not do. I do not care what Father Jerger's nationality is. I know that he has been in Australia for thirty-five years, and he should be tried by the laws of this country. He has asked that he should be so tried. All sorts of subterfuges are put forward, and it is time that we looked to ourselves in these matters. We boast of being a liberty-loving people, and I should like to know what danger is anticipated from allowing Father Jerger to remain here. Is he to be deported to indulge the spite of some one ? Now that the war is over, why should we not make this country free to the world'? I say that if this man is sent away from these shores it will be to our everlasting disgrace. If we deport him we can no longer claim to be a civilized people, because he has lived under our laws, and has been accepted by us, and his relations are members of this community. I say that the Government should look to it that his deportation is not carried out. </para>

I do not know that there is anything in the Standing Orders to prevent the honorable member dealing with a matter that is <inline font-style="italic">sub justice,</inline> but it is a well-established practice in this Parliament, and also in the Parliament of New South Wales, that in respect to  any  matter before the Courts honorable members observe silence until the Courts have dealt with it. It is a matter of good taste on the part of honorable members, but I point out that even though we have no rule forbidding it, it is parliamentary usage not to refer to any matter that is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

              <para>- While I have every respect for the Chair, I do not feel that I can follow the suggestion which has been made. You, sir, have said that any. reference to the subject is a matter of good taste, but I see no good taste in deporting a man who is innocent, and I feel that I should be remiss in my duty if I did not protest against the deportation of any man under these circumstances, no matter who he may be, and whether he happens to be a Catholic clergyman of German origin or not. There is no more reason for putting into force the provisions of a Safety of the Realm Act or the War Precautions Act now than existed 'before the war. It would appear that, boiled down, the reason for this deportation is that Father Jerger belongs to a certain religious persuasion, or that he is a man of German birth. I want to know if that is so. Again I say that it will be a crying disgrace to us if we deport this man without giving him resort to the Courts of the country, not <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> but under such conditions that the press and every one will know what he is being sent away for. I say that the Government and those behind them will regret having assisted to deport a man who, according to the principles of British justice, must be regarded as innocent until he is proved to be guilty. </para>

          <para class="block">This is si peculiarly opportune time at which to test the strength of parties in this House. The Ballarat election on Saturday has resulted in an addition crf one member to the strength of Labour in this Chamber, and a corresponding reduction of the direct Ministerial party. There has been in the newspapers and the minds of the general" public some speculation as to the position of parties in this Parliament in view of the result of that election. Whenever I have been asked for an opinion upon this matter I have said that the result of the Ballarat election can make no difference whatsoever to the position of parties in this Parliament. There are now in this House 49 Nationalists and 26 Labour members, for although* there is a slight division in the ranks of the Nationalists, those who sit on the Government side are not separated by principle, and when they vote on a vital issue which challenges the Government from the stand-point of Labour, the Corner Nationalists will vote with . their <inline font-style="italic">confreres,</inline> the direct supporters of the Government. At least a sufficient number of them will always vote with the Government to save it from destruction. </para>
          <para class="block">What difference is there in the voters who returned the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> to the last Parliament, and those who elected him to this Parliament? I undertake to say that not 500 electors of the 20,000 or 30,000 who voted in that electorate have changed their allegiance or voted differently at the two elections. The honorable member was returned for the last Parliament by Nationalist votes, and he was returned to this Parliament also by Nationalist votes; therefore, he was a Nationalist in the last Parliament, and he is a Nationalist to-day. The same remark applies to the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> the Leader of the so-called Country section. He was returned to the last Parliament by Nationalist Liberals, and he is elected to this Parliament by the votes of the same people. Except for the little ebb and flow in public opinion which takes place between general elections, the so-called Country party represents Liberals and Nationalists identically the same as do the members of the direct Government party. </para>
          <para>What has happened in this Australian Parliament has happened in every British Parliament. When there is a large Government party, all the members of capacity and personality cannot be Ministers, and those who are left out immediately set about the formation of a cave or clique, or a corner party in order to force the Government to recognise them. That is not peculiar to this Parliament or to the Ministerial party. It has happened in every representative Parliament in Britain and the British Dominions, and with every party, whether called Liberal, Conservative, or Labour When all the men of strong personality in a large party cannot be recognised as Ministers, some of them break away, and by organization within the party insist that the ruling faction shall recognise them and offer them some preferment. </para>
          <para>If there be, during the life of this Parliament, any change at all in the relation of representatives, it will be by a reconstruction amongst members on the Government side. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> may go out of office, and the ex-'Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> may take his place. Some Ministers in the present team may lose their portfolios, and other members from the Corner section gain them. In my judgment, based on the experience of a good many years in the Parliament, that is the most extreme disruption that can possibly take place before the next general election. </para>
          <para>In thirteen years I have contested six elections, and during the whole of that time the 1910-13 Parliament ' was the only one which ran its full course of three years. No Parliament since then has seemed more likely to survive its full term than does the present one. </para>

Parliament- receives as his allowance will influence him in casting a vote in, this House. The honorable member could not heap a greater insult on every member in. this Chamber. Labour ment:bers, at any rate,, are showing that they are prepared to, vote against, the Government, and to take, every opportunity to put them, out of office-. We shalL continue, to. do so, because that is our- duty. The honorable member's suggestion does not, cast a slur on those, who vote against the Government,, but imputes that, those who vote with the Government are afraid of' losing the few paltry pounds, they receive in. salary for. fear of being sent to tie country.. </para>

          <para>Both sections of the Nationalists I have been- describing represent capitalism and vested interests. The direct Government party represents the middlemen, agents, distributors, and the proprietors of the secondary industries in the larger centres of population. The so-called Country party represents the big landed proprietors in the country districts; it, too, represents vested interests and capitalism, but as the Ministerial party is so large it can .afford to divide into sections. The country capitalist desires to get a bit more at the expense of the city agent and distributor, but on the very instant that vested interests are threatened the two sections becomes as united as the Holy Trinity itself. I venture to predict that there will never be a challenge to the Government no matter upon what subject, whether it be the interests of the primary producers or anything else, when the so-called Country party and representatives of the farmers and country producers will vote with Labour to defeat the Government. </para>
          <para>This so-called Country party was said to have entered this Parliament with three main planks to its platform. The first was that there should be a restoration' of What is called responsible parliamentary government. </para>

The same sort of thing has happened in regard to sales of wheat, metals, butter, &amp;c.

            <para>Land monopoly has been, and is still, the greatest curse of Australia. The holders of great estates have compelled farmers to pay exorbitant prices for land, or have forced him on to the poorer lands away from rail and market. Middlemen and commission agents fleece the producer. He is at their mercy. They control the channels through which alone the farmer can sell his produce. And the great combinations of capitalists who form trusts, rings, and monopolies fleece the farmer, both when he buys his machinery and goods' he needs and when he sells his produce. These are the enemies of the farmer. And they are all behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> and his party; yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has the audacity to declare that his party is the friend of the farmer. . . . </para>

          </continue><para>We charge this Government with (a) failure to prevent the inordinate rise in the cost of living. When the Prime Minister, in 1919, was yet on the waters adjacent to the Australian coast, making his Australian ward way from England, he set out a brief policy for the impending elections thus, "As to the profiteer and the Bolshevik, damn them both!" And he said he would " shoot them both." What has he done to damn or shoot them, since ? He now says he has not the power. One of our principal charges against the Prime Minister is that he has the War Precautions Act in operation to-day in all its original force and effect. Under that Act he can do anything he likes in regard to every mouthful that the people eat and every yard of material with which they clothe themselves. Yet, having this power, he has absolutely refused to use it. He will use it for other purposes - for deportation, for example. And, surely, to  deport without trial men against whom charges have been secretly made, so that they cannot face their accusers, is an acknowledgment that the ordinary processes of the law are insufficient for the. punishment of wrong-doers. The proper course is to hale an alleged offender before a Court, to charge him with an alleged offence, to give him a fair and open British trial, and to award punishment accordingly as he is deemed to have offended against the law. Apparently, however, there is some underground engineering going on in regard to certain men - and here I make no differentiation between Father Jerger and any other man.

              <para>- I have no time to bandy words with the Chair. To revert to the charge (a) in relation to the high cost of living - the Prime Minister, to escape his own pledges to the people to reduce the cost of living, states that what we have to do  i9  to produce more. How can enhanced production in Australia affect the people of Australia in the matter of food and clothing, seeing that we already produce ten times more than we can use ? Will it affect the cost of living if we produce twenty or fifty times more than the people can use? What those gentlemen who talk in that way wish us to believe is that until the aching void of Europe can be filled, there must be scarcity for the people of Australia. Such remarks are nothing more nor less than the expression of a foreign policy, dictated in the interests of people other than Australians. As an Australian, I demand that this country be administered in the interests  of Australians, and that not until we have attended to the requirements of the people of Australia shall we turn our attention to the necessities of the inhabitants of foreign countries. There is no man in the Commonwealth who can say we are not producing, in regard to almost everything, many times more than is requisite for 'the needs of our people. All this talk about  producing  more is so much humbug. </para>

              <para>- It does, in relation to our domestic needs, because, approximately, half of our Australian sugar is made into jam and other foodstuffs, for export. Manufacturers obtain cheap Australian sugar, and thus are able to export foodstuffs to the markets of the Old World, and make huge profits. At the same tame, the people of Australia cannot get enough locally-grown sugar for local requirements, and the prices of household necessities ' go higher and higher. The addition to our sugar bill of £7,000,000 per annum, as represented by the latest increase in the price of sugar, has been enforced mainly to enable Australian manufacturers to export all classes of foodstuffs and some interested persons reap huge profits. According to the Budget statement of 8th October last, in 1918' 72,000,000 lbs., of jam were sold for export at from 5£d. to 6d. per pound. A huge amount of cheap sugar was included in that, and the jam sold, f.o.b. here, at much less than that for which the Australian public may obtain it. </para>

          </continue><para class="block">  The Prime Minister speaks of the restricted -.power of this Parliament to deal with the cost of living problem. He said it is only recently that we have heard of this. When I was ' sitting behind the Labour Government in 1915, I moved a series of resolutions,  in  the course of which I pointed out that the Government had ample power then to deal with these matters. The Prime Minister asks honorable members to believe that a few years ago the Labour party did not think that power resided with the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the cost of living. But a lot of water has run under the bridge since then. We have been carefully studying the position:, and have discovered, some sooner than others, that the Government have powers which previously were not thought to reside in the Commonwealth Constitution. The resolutions to which I refer called upon the Government to take action to reduce the cost of living. Incidentally, they caused the Government some embarrassment. The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was sitting in the House at the time, and I intend to show honorable members that his interjections were an admission that my view was the correct one. They also show that the right honorable member has known for year3 that this Parliament has power to deal with the high cost of living. I drew attention to the fact that the Government had power to take a census and to call upon every producer and manufacturer to make weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or quarterly returns to a properly constituted Commonwealth authority, of the output and distribution of goods, and the movement of prices. We have always had that power, and if we desire to control the cost of living, this is one of the first and most essential pieces of machinery to that end. </para><interjection>

And so it ' is clear that he knows perfectly well now, as he did then, that this Government have the power; that under a number of different headings there is power, which, multiplied in an Act of Parliament, gives them the necessary machinery to control profiteering and prices. But the Commonwealth Government have so faT refused to exercise this power. That is what is wrong about the whole business. They- have the "War Precautions Act, and have used it for the purpose of controlling the price of some goods. Only a few weeks ago the Government issued a proclamation on a Saturday, fixing the price of cheese; but apparently some of their supporters complained, and on the following Monday the Government withdrew the proclamation. It is clear, then, that if they can issue a proclamation fixing the price of one article, they can do so with regard to any commodity. They have this power. Not one of them dare deny it. They sit facing me to-day. I challenge any honorable member to deny that the Government have this power at the present moment. </para><interjection>

          </quote><para>The Government are issuing a piece of paper, very little of which can be negotiated. Is that "spending money"? Were these terms used to mislead the soldier electors into the belief that they were going to get cash for their bonds? What is going on  to-day  with regard to those bonds is an absolute scandal. Traders in Sydney, who have the authority of the Government, are selling goods, say, furniture, and demanding that the soldier shall spend with them £60 out of every £100. In needy cases the furniture so supplied is taken to the auction rooms and sold for a song. </para><para>If interest-bearing bonds are issued they cannot be made inalienable or non-negotiable - they will be negotiated in some shape or form; and the proper thing is for the Government to carry out their election pledges. The Labour party said that if  they  were returned to power cash would be paid, and under the influence of public opinion, and the driving force of the Labour movement, the Government also promised to pay cash. The bonds should be paid in a negotiable instrument that can be openly traded at it face value, instead of being secretly and covertly negotiated at an enormous discount. This policy really means that, with the connivance of the Government, the soldiers are thus robbed by the profiters of the country of 10s. in the £1 of their gratuity. The Government is issuing depreciated currency in its worst form. </para><interjection>

The Government are not doing this business themselves, but have handed it over to some one else; and totally incorrect figures have been issued by some of the Departments. Two cases have come under my notice, one of a military medallist who left his farm in the hands of a partner to go to the war, and when he returned, after an absence of three years, found his whole business had "gone to smoke." That man has been two years begging the State Government to provide him with a living area, and he cannot get it. There is a published statement by the State Government that 16,000 men in New South Wales, who hold qualifying certificates to go on the land, cannot get homes for themselves. </para>

              <para>- We are now told that this repatriation is costing this or that sum; but why did the Government not find out, before they made their promises, that they could not fulfil them? Our charge is that the Government promised, and is not honouring their promise. The Government do not say they are carrying out their undertaking, but are giving reasons for not doing so, and that is no answer to the charge. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The next charge against the Government is that of (c) failure to take steps to deal with the causes of industrial unrest. This unrest is caused by two phenomena - the high cost of living and unemployment. It has already been shown, and it is admitted, that the Government have  done nothing to deal with the high cost of living; as to unemployment, the Government themselves are the greatest offenders. They are putting Government employees off work, and thus creating unemployment, as at Cockatoo Dock, Sydney, where large numbers of .men are out of work. </para>
          <para>The Government refuse to go on with the building of - the .Federal Capital, which would . riot "only  provide work, but create an asset that would return handsomely . on the expenditure. There are any number of private companies which would be very glad to take over the Federal Capital as a commercial proposition. At the present time, although the lands within the Federal area are let on short leases, which does not allow them to be put to their best use, they, are returning a profit. The development of the Federal Capital is a_ paying concern, and could be made so from the jump; yet the Government refuse to go on with the work,  although  the compact is nearly twenty years overdue. There are some honorable members on the Government side who have been vowing vengeance against the Government on this score. Amongst these are the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> and a number of others, and they now have  an opportunity of expressing their dissatisfaction with the Government for its "general incapacity" in this matter. However, as I have said over and over again in New South Wales, those members only express their dissatisfaction by their votes when there is no risk to the Government - never if there is any " business" in it. The Government know that the attitude of these gentlemen is only a bit of by-play; and it is certain that the very moment they assert themselves in regard to the Federal Capital, and show that they intend to take decisive steps by voting against the Government, the latter will render a hostile vote unnecessary and get to work very quickly. They will not risk being torn from the Treasury bench for the mere sake of declining to proceed with the erection of the Federal Capital. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has already appointed a Royal Commission to deal with the question of industrial unrest, but only a few weeks ago he was compelled to admit that this body represents only so much blank cartridge, and that the Government can do nothing with its reT port. </para>
          <para>The next count in the indictment of the Labour Opposition charges the Government with <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> failure to secure an adequate return to the Australian people for their wool and other primary products which have been sold overseas. In this connexion I do not propose to repeat the case against the Government 'which I put upon record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> earlier in the session. My case dealing with the wool sales effected overseas will be found on page 305 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and that dealing with the sales of wheat on page 341 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the current session. In speaking upon those subjects I quoted statements made by Ministers in the British . House of Commons, and from other authoritative sources, with a view to proving that this country has been grossly robbed in the prices which it. has obtained for its primary products under sales effected by the Government. All the admissions which have since been made have served only to confirm my charge, including the statement of the Prime Minister on the 13th May last that, during the war, we had sold our wool to Great Britain and the Allied Powers at one-third of its value. </para>
          <para>No doubt, when the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> returns to this country we shall get the full details of the dispute between himself and the Prime Minister, and shall thus secure further confirmation of the rotten state of affairs which has existed in regard to the sales of Australian produce. </para>
          <para>On the 13th May last- as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 2085-86 - the Prime Minister took up the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a prophet. He said, in effect, "Just watch how the prices of Australian wool will tumble after 30th June next." He then went on to show that prices were coming down with a run as the result of an express arrangement to exploit the Australian producer. A few weeks later his prediction was verified. The prices of our wool came down with an awful crash to the serious loss of our primary producers. The Prime Minister himself told us that those prices were being manipulated. Where are the representatives of the Country party that they allow this kind of thing to go on? They do not even register a protest against it. </para>
          <para>The next count in the indictment against Ministers charges them with <inline font-style="italic">(e)</inline> failure to make definite binding contracts for the sale of Australia's primary products. So far, these contracts have not been tabled. They have been asked for again and again, and their production has been refused. We can only conclude, therefore, that their production would not be to the advantage of the Government. Any attempt to do so would seriously embarrass the Government. What did the ex-Treasurer say prior to his departure for the Old Country? He said. " I am going to London to try and straighten out the threads of this wool bungle." </para>

Seeing that 60,000 Australian soldiers gave their lives to help Great Britain during the recent war; that, according to the statement of the Prime Minister, our wool has been sold overseas at one-third of its value;that there is now a credit to Australia in London of £40,000,000, an amount which will be increased by the 30th June next to £175,000,000. I say that if the statement was made that, unless the Commonwealth paid a sum of £8,000,000 by a certain date, she would be branded as a defaulter, our people should know it.

The very insinuation that is being industriously circulated against the honorable member for Balaclava demands that the whole of the cables shall be placed upon the table of this House. It is practically charged against him that, though an Australian bom, he regarded his obligations so lightly that he had practically to he put in chains and leg-irons, because of the fear that he would do something to prejudicially affect the vital interests of Australia. </para>

              <para>- I believe it is impossible, because an agreement that would do anything of that kind would not be worth the paper it is written on; hut if such an event should take place, I should be found going from one end of this country to the other, putting before the people what I believe to be the proper view, in order to prevent them from being entrapped into* any dispute, or from taking Bides against the people of America. </para>

          <para>The statements in current circulation amongst parliamentarians, Commonwealth and State, as to the serious allegations in the cablegrams which passed between the Prime Minister and the ex-Treasurer demand, not merely a denial across the chamber, but the production of the messages in an unabridged condition, so that the people may know the truth. I have known the honorable member for Balaclava for a good many years. I cannot conceive of him doing an utterly foolish thing; and I cannot but believe that something we have not seen has had something to do. with his resignation. </para>
          <para>The statement of the case put forward by the Prime Minister against his absent colleague was too strong, it went too far, it proved too much; it made the honorable member for Balaclava out as a babbling infant in swaddling clothes, or even a raving idiot. In the circumstances , I shall have very much doubt as to the facts until I hear the other side. In any case, I presume that the honorable member for Balaclava, as an Australian, is just as good a judge as is the Prime Minister, who is not an Australian, as to what ought to he published; and he asks for the publication of the whole of the cablegrams. </para>
          <para>I am not concern ect whether honorable members of the Corner party vote against the Government or not. On this indictment, let them support the Government; let their constituents see what their attitude is. Let the so-called representatives of the primary producers explain to the real primary producers why they did not demand further knowledge about the sales of their products, and something more about the supposed contracts in regard to those sales. Then their constituents, and not those who sit in the Chamber, will be the persons to judge them. </para>
          <para>The charges against the Government have been proved up to the hilt. Anything said in defence has been mere Billingsgate, or excuses or references to issues that are mere  side-steppings.  No real answer has been put up; nothing hae been said to indicate to the people of the country that the Government are not guilty of the whole of the charges. It only strengthens our case to say that our allegations are mere reiterations of what has been said previously. It shows that the charge of neglect, incapacity, and incompetence of the Government has been sheeted home against them time after time. </para>
          <para>I am  satisfied that when the people  of </para>
          <para class="block">Australia  read  these charges,  as  they  will  appear  in  the official record of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the case stated  in  support, they must come  to the  conclusion  that  the Labour party  was  entirely justified in the step it  has  taken. </para>
          <para>It is due to the people of the country that the House should be divided upon this indictment of the Government, so that they may learn where honorable members stand in regard to the issues at stake. </para>
