                    <para>- I have just heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, who was long a member of this Parliament) died yesterday. He held office as Vice-president of the Executive Council and also as Minister for Defence, in two of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> Administrations, and many of us knew him intimately. I had the honour of knowing him for many years as a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, and he was also a member of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth.  His  sunny nature and amiable disposition endeared him to all. I think we might say with safety that he had no enemies in politics. Although his circumstances were such that a life of leisure would have been more compatible with his disposition, he devoted himself with assiduity to politics, but his health suffered so seriously that he was compelled at length to retire. I desire to express my deep regret, as well as that of my colleagues and the Parliament generally, and to extend to the deceased gentleman&#39;s &#39; relations our &#39; sincere sympathy. </para>

                    <para>- I received a shock this morning when I learned that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing had passed away. He was a member of this Parliament for something like, ten years, and we all esteemed him for his genial nature. He had absolutely no personal enemies in this Parliament. While he did not spare his political opponents, his criticisms were always bright and breezy, and devoid of that sting which, unfortunately, is associated with much of our parliamentary dissertations. With the Prime Minister, I believe that his work as a member of this Parliament tended to shorten his life. I am very sorry to hear of his death, which is another addition to the gaps that are steadily being made in the ranks of those of us who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. On behalf of the Opposition, which I have the honour to lead, I desire to extend to the deceased gentleman&#39;s relatives the most sincere sympathy in their sad bereavement. </para>

                    <para>- May I add my expressions of regret to those which have fallen from. the lips of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. I was one of those who had the pleasure of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing personally, and as a member of this House. He was a member of the House of Representatives during the stirring days of the first eight or ten years of the Parliament, and although he was a really good fighter, he invariably fought with absolute fairness. No one could say that he ever took an unfair advantage of an opponent, or that he uttered a word of hostile personal criticism of a fellow member. It is characteristics such as these that uplift the public life of Australia. I, in common with honorable members generally, mourn <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing&#39;s death, and desire, on behalf of my party, to extend to his relatives and friends the most sincere sympathy. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to indorse what has been said by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Country party. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing was an old colleague of mine. I knew him well; he was loved and respected by all. The better he was known the more he was liked. He was a loyal comrade and always &#34;played the game.&#34; One regret I have is that all too often we do not discover these good qualities in our fellows until after they have passed away. I hope that we shall endeavour to do so while they live, and try to recognise the good qualities of honorable members, no matter in what part of the House they may sit. &#34; Tom &#34; Ewing possessed the most amiable disposition, and I feel his death deeply. I warmly indorse the kindly remarks that have been made concerning him, and which will be conveyed to his friends. </para>

                        <para>-  I am sorry to have to say that it is incorrect. The straitened circumstances of the Government were such that a windfall of this sort would have been welcome. I learn for the first time, and with some surprise, that the Soviet Government is in a position to pay any salary to its officers in this country. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Speaking quite seriously, the statement is grossly inaccurate. The Government has not seized the salary referred to, and it is entirely ignorant of the circumstances of the Soviet representative. It has not seized his correspondence, and is not treating him differently from any other citizen. So far as I know, the facts are that he is treated exactly the same as any other citizen of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I have considered the request, and it will be dealt with when the Tariff is under consideration.I would point out to the honorable member that even if a lower duty were brought in we should still be required, under the law, to collect the higher duty until such time as Parliament had altered the Schedule. Thus, no advantage would be  gained by introducing at the present time an amended Schedule fixing a lower rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>- At the request of the Australian Aero Club, the Australian Jockey Club, Sydney, and the Avro Company at Mascot, I wish to bring under the notice of the Assistant Minister for Defence the disgracefully low flying which took place over Randwick a few days ago, when machines, I understand, were dropping leaflets from so low an altitude that all the horses in the boxes were terrified, and the people on the racecourse rushed for shelter. I understand that the honorable gentleman is  President  of the Air Board, and I ask whether these facts have been brought under his notice. Cannot something be done, pending the passing of the Air Regulations, to stop this low flying, which, undoubtedly, before long will produce a great tragedy in one of our capital cities? </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that the course proposed by the Conference necessitates legislation. I desire, however, to make a statement for the information of the House, and to invite the criticism of all who are concerned in this matter. On Friday last a Conference, consisting of representatives of every section of the wool industry - growers, brokers, tanners, wool scourers and fellmongers, exporters, wool-top manufacturers, spinners and employees - was held. The question to be considered was the position created by the scarcity of skins, added to the fact &#39;that many hundreds of men are now unemployed. The matter before the Conference was how to overcome that difficulty of unemployment. It was decided, I think by thirty-two votes to eight, to recommend a scheme of this kind, namely, that all skins should pass through certain prescribed channels before being exported, and that the local buyer should have an opportunity of purchasing at the world&#39;s price before the skins were exported. Now, that is the practice already - so we were told - in the case of nine-tenths of the skins. As a matter of fact, there was some difference of opinion upon this precise point, that is, as to whether the quantity comprised nine-tenths or seven-tenths. However, the local buyer does have a chance* now, and&#39; it was decided, in order to encourage the industry, to give him the right to secure all his requirements at the world&#39;s price. That sounds a perfectly fair proposition. The Conference was called to advise the Government. I bring this matter before the House now. I ought to have done so before but failed, since the matter had escaped my attention. I invite honorable members to offer any criticisms and objections which they may see fit to present, either on Tuesday or Wednesday next at the latest, so that the sense of Parliament may be gathered1 in regard to the question. Honorable members will be able to gain precise accounts of the proposals from the press of Saturday last, and from the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> and the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley),</inline> who were present at the Conference. All sections of the House should be able to get first-hand information from those gentlemen. </para>

Anyone could say that the Government did not pay a man &#163;1,000 or &#163;2,000 a year to say things like that. (Laughter.) What men were paid for was to say how to do the impossible. When the Postmaster-General said it was impossible to get wireless telephones and ordinary telephone wire in this country, he <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Mr. Hughes)</inline> said, &#34;&#39;Go along and get them.&#34; The result was that the Postinaster-General told him that afternoon that he was getting them. </para>

                <para class="block">That report is like the curate&#39;s egg - it is good in parts. But I continued at some length to speak about experts. I was talking about experts - people who come  along and tell us that a thing cannot he done. As any one who &#39;has had experience of experts must know, they can be absolutely maddening ; they can drive one to the verge of despair when telling one that a thing cannot be done. I said that I did not want people like that. My office boy could tell me that things cannot be done. I said I wanted a man who would say, &#34; Yes, this cannot be done, but I will tell you how to do it, and see that it is done.&#34; This newspaper, no doubt, has been misled by some careless telegraphist in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. I am quite sure that the reporter would not have made such a mistake, and the idea that the editor or his staff has made it is, of course, absurd. Somehow or other, however, the mistake has occurred, and I want to say most emphatically that it is one to which I take very serious exception, and to which my colleague, the Postmaster-General, also takes serious exception. I take this first opportunity to say that I was referring to the experts; and if those gentlemen have any ground of complaint concerning what I said I will deal with them in due course. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are considering the whole matter, and I would not like to forestall their conclusion. Honorable members are aware that we are likely to get a bumper harvest; possibly, indeed, a record crop. There are 37&#189; bushels to the ton, and it is probable that there will be somewhere between 2,500,000 tons and 3,000,000 tons harvested. If honorable members care to multiply 37&#189; bushels by 5s., and to multiply that answer by 2,000,000 or 3,000,000- which performance is beyond me - they will realize that the amount of money involved will be quite considerable. My colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who has scarcely recovered from his endeavour to grapple with the serious financial position of the Commonwealth, will tell the House that it is no light thing to find &#163;7,000,000 or &#163;10,000,000 next January, for that is the least which we shall have to find during that month. However, we shall do what we can. I fully realize the position of the New South Wales farmers. The Government have considered that phase of the whole situation, and I will say that if anything can be done to give them special consideration it will be done. </para>

Upon the occasion of my originally putting the matter before him, the Prime Minister courteously announced his sympathy with my purpose. I may tell him, however, &#39; that I have been unable to obtain the information which I needed in reference to the Senate. Now that the Budget is before the House, I ask if honorable members should not be entitled to the information such as I have suggested, and in regard to the collection of which the Prime Minister was good enough to say that he supported me. </para>

                        <para>- The British Government have made certain suggestions as to the class of vessel that, if any selection had to be made, would be most useful in all the circumstances ; but the honorable member will realize that everything; we do in connexion with our naval defence must depend to a large extent on what the British Navy propose to do. Of ourselves we  avail very little, and in turn the British naval authorities are considering the whole situation in the light of the experience gained during; the Great War, and the fact that they are pressed by very great financial difficulties, and also with the knowledge that next year it is intended to hold a Defence Conference, at which this matter will be considered. </para>

I have always been in favour of the bicameral system, but my tolerance has its limits.

My question is as follows: - Will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> have the numbering of the bound volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> printed in Arabic numerals, which are far more simple than Latin numerals, as can be seen, for instance, when we compare 88 with LXXXVII1. ? I defy any mathematician to multiply CCCXLV. by CCCXXXIL, using Roman figures throughout. It seems to me that we should follow the example of the State Parliaments, and make use of the more up-to-date and scientific Arabic system of numbering our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> volumes. </para>

                        <para>- The system of numbering volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has been in existence from the beginning of this Parliament, but as the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports are not confined to this branch of the Legislature, the matter to which the honorable member refers would naturally have to be referred also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> Personally, I think there is a good deal to be said in favour of the honorable member&#39;s contention, and the method of numbering, suggested by him, is used in connexion with the House of Commons debates. At the same time I can see one advantage to honorable members in our system, because an honorable member who is anxious to make an embarrassing quotation from another honorable member&#39;s speech, perhaps long since forgotten, and recorded in a bound volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> may occasionally be restrained from doing so by a contemplation of the formidable numerals of which the honorable member has just given as. an example. </para>

In accordance with the Prime Minister&#39;s promise, employers and some trading firms and companies have permission to cash bonds, under certain conditions, to an unlimited extent. In the case of applications by private individuals, the registrars&#39; of war gratuity bonds at the Sub-Treasuries in the capital cities may permit not more than ten bonds to be cashed by any one person. &#39; Where a person desires to cash more than ten bonds, the matter must be specially referred to the Secretary to the Treasury for consideration. The average amount of ten bonds would be about &#163;800. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave).</inline> - Some time ago it was publicly announced that the Assembly of the League of Nations intended to hold its first session at Geneva on the 17th November next, and in reply to questions put to me in the House I stated that the Commonwealth Government would be represented thereat. Since that time a number of suggestions have been made, and much advice has been given to the Government, as to how the Commonwealth should be represented. It has now been decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> shall attend the Conference as the representative of Australia, and take with him competent official assistance, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles,</inline> an officer under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, in the office of the Attorney-General. I have had the opportunity of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knowles</inline> for very many years, and I can say that, excepting only <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, a more competent man does not exist in the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Service. If I were going myself to Geneva I do not think I could select a man upon whom I could rely with more confidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will also take with him M. Chevassu, formerly on the foreign editorial staff of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> who has made Imperial politics his study, is familiar with all the proceedings of the Peace Conference and the League of Nations, and an accomplished linguist. I need hardly point out to honorable members the importance to Australia of the League of Nations. The whole world now is in a state of flux, and the League of Nations, by its advice and by its power, can exercise a potent influence on our destinies. As honorable members know, the mandates have not been officially issued, and many questions relating to our quota of defence, to the means by which the world&#39;s peace shall be maintained, and disease, labour troubles, and other matters dealt with the world over, are in the hands of this, the only international body that has, as it were, the sanction of law behind it. This League, of course, has yet to prove itself competent to deal with all the great questions that are intrusted to it, but its influence already is considerable. Australia is a signatory to the Covenant, and, perhaps, has more to lose than any other nation from the deliberations of the Conference. Many of the things for which our soldiers fought have not yet, as it were, crystallized and assumed so definite a shape as to preclude the possibility of such alterations as would be fatal to our interests. I do not know any man who is more competent to represent the Commonwealth at this great world gathering than my friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He will go to this Conference with a clear understanding that he represents this Parliament and this country on those questions. On certain of the questions to which I have alluded in a general way there is no room for difference of opinion. We cannot have any difference of opinion - we cannot listen to any one who speaks about any encroachment on the principle of a White Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who holds the Australian view, recognises that fact clearly. There are other matters on the agenda paper &#39;which leave any amount of room for difference of opinion, and as to these, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will exercise his own discretion. The honorable gentleman will leave Australia towards the end of this month. How long the sittings at Geneva will continue it is impossible to say, but at their conclusion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will proceed to London in order to deal with matters of great public importance, which, unhappily, have not been dealt with owing to the resignation of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt). Senator Millen</inline> will take up the questions of finance where that honorable member dropped them. He will deal with questions of trade and trade organizations, and will also make such recommendations and effect such alterations in the organization of the High Commissioner&#39;s office as are considered desirable. Of course, I am expressing my opinion as a private member - but other honorable members have been to England during the last two years and are able to judge for themselves - when I say that there are far too few Australians in Australia House - far too few. I think it is essential, if we are to have an Australia House which really represents Australia, to have the staff continually refreshed By new drafts of blood from Australia. These men, after serving at Australia House for a period, will return to Australia and others take their places, in this way maintaining touch with Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No; there are limits. I do not think we could get a man to go to England to take up the duties of High Commissioner, and to come back just as a public servant does to resume his place in the Public Service. When a gentleman goes to Australia House as High Commissioner he has divested himself of his political opportunities in order to take up the position, and when he returns he divests himself of that office and all that the office means. There must be some continuity of policy, and, to that end, discretion must be exercised; but, subject to that, the principle I have laid down is, I think, a sound one. </para>

                    <para>I come now to another matter with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will also have to deal. I have spoken in this place several times on the necessity for immigration, and I referred to it when outlining the defence policy of the Commonwealth. I :said that 5,000,000 people can neither defend this country nor develop it, and that the remedy for this is more men. The Government have decided to take up the question of immigration, and put it forward with vigour on a bold and comprehensive scale, believing that in no other way can we hope for any success. The Commonwealth and States came to an understanding during the recent conferences - for there were several - in regard &#39; to immigration, an understanding that,. I think, will commend itself to honorable members. The States agree that it is well that one authority should have control at the other end, and any one who looks at the matter fairly will say that it is better that one authority should speak for Australia - that there should not be six or seven competing authorities talking about particular States. I do-not think honorable members quite realize the profundity of the ignorance of the Britisher in regard to Australia. He speaks of Australia as if it were a kind of place to be covered in a day&#39;s walk, and he talks about &#34; the climate&#34; of the country. I may say that I have been colder in this country than I ever remember to have been in England; indeed, I have been half frozen to death here. We can find any kind of climate in Australia, and in the interior I have found it colder than in any other country I know of. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not go further into that question, merely suggesting that, in order to test the question, an honorable member has only to camp out, put his feet outside his tent at night, and see how he gets on. What we have to tell the people of Britain is the truth about Australia. I have read some of the prospectuses and highly-coloured statements about Australia, and rose from their perusal convinced that they did not present a fair and accurate picture&#39; of this country. We do not desire to bring people here under false pretences, and, therefore, we must tell them the truth. The truth is neither that pessimistic wail we hear on the one hand nor those glowing eulogies we hear on the other. If we cannot induce people to come out here on the merits of the country, it is better they should stay away. -We do not wish to have disappointed men who complain that they have been induced to come here under false pretences; therefore, the first thing we propose is to see that the would be immigrant learns the facts. It matters nothing to the Commonwealth whether immigrants go to Tasmania or to Queensland. Now, as to the number and the kind of immigrants we desire. . Some of the States, of course, are circumstanced quite differently from others : but Queensland and Western Australia have authorized the Commonwealth to get as many immigrants as possible - they will take all we can bring. As to the kind of people we desire, when I put forward the views of the Labour party on immigration I said what I believed to be true, namely, that to throw on the labour market a huge mass of immigrants without regard to the requirements of urban industries is to create conditions that will prove most unfortunate. A community can digest only so many newcomers in a given time, and those newcomers must be of the right kind, and must be put in the right places. And the right kind of preparations must be made for them. The first essential of this country is land settlement; therefore, our efforts must be directed towards getting men to go on the land. As honorable members know, the British Government have offered to pay the fares of ex-service men to any part of the Empire up to, I think, the 31st December this year, and we are negotiating with a view to the extension of that period, so that we _ may have the advantage of the continued co-operation of the British authorities. We do not propose to stop at trying to induce British ex-service men to come to Australia, but to extend the invitation to all healthy men, young men particularly, including lads and youths, for plastic youth can adjust itself readily to the circumstances of the country. When a man is set in his course of life, it is very difficult to make anything of him in a new country. I think it will be found in practice extremely difficult to attract trained agriculturists from Britain. When I was in Scotland last year I found that the agriculturists were receiving &#163;2 8s. per week &#34; and found &#34; during the harvest. There is plenty of work for them in England, and it is extremely difficult to offer inducements that would attract that class of workmen to Australia. Then there is the farmer himself. He has had a bad harvest in England this year, and if we listen to him we shall hear exactly the same kind of story as we hear in Australia. We shall endeavour to attract men who have had experience on the land, and have some capital. Honorable members must not suppose that the farmer here is different from the farmer elsewhere. The farmer never does well. I visited my own people in Wales, and listened to the most melancholy tales. Yet they were all right; they were getting 16s. per bushel for their wheat, and, after all, that is not a bad price. Of course, they might have received more, but they were doing very well. I do not expect that we shall attract very many agriculturists, but I hope we shall inducemen with small capital to come here, and also plenty of young men on the threshold of life. They are the kind of men we want. They can be moulded to the circumstances of Australia, and imbued with progressive ideas. This country must go ahead, and to do that successfully it must have men in abundance. It cannot have too many men, provided they are of the right type and are set down in the right place. Organization is clearly wanted at this end. The States must do their part, and we have arranged with them that each shall say how many men and what kind of men it will take. That is the best guarantee against any State being swamped with the wrong kind of labour. Then we must see that public opinion is educated as to the necessity for immigration. We cannot allow a &#34; doginthemanger&#34; policy to rule this country. There are many quite well-meaning men who have a perverted idea of the fundamental facts of economics. They think that the fewer the men here, the more work there will be. That is not so. Work increases with the growth of population. If there were no other men coming - forward, employment would be reduced to the level of that on Robinson Crusoe&#39;s Island. The more men we have, the greater the opportunities for manufacture. We are now on the threshold of a new era of manufacture. If all goes well, we shall certainly have a magnificent season for primary production ; and we need it. But we also want abundant labour and additional men on the soil. We must have sufficient labour to develop this great country. The Government are doing what is possible in regard to the development of the woollen and iron industries, both of which are peculiarly suited to Australia. The Government recognise that unless we are prepared to deal with immigration in a comprehensive and systematic way we cannot achieve success. I believe that very much will depend upon those who are placed in charge of the work, and we have placed in charge, for the time being, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Hunter, who has had a very long experience of immigration organization. I have known him for many years, and I think he is a most competent man. I have read in the press a statement about the projected appointment of a Commission. I know nothing at all about any such Commission; the Government have no intention of appointing one. I protest against this habit of the press of first of all inventing acts by the Government and then writing leading articles condemning us for doing them. That practice is very trying. What we want is an Immigration Agent in addition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter</inline> in particular - and here I appeal to honorable members of the Country party - a successful farmer, who, having made good in Australia, is prepared to go to England to put the facts about Australia before the people of Great Britain. </para>

What is the use of honorable members opposite making this fuss ? I ask them to find me a farmer with the right qualifications for this work, and I do not care two straws what his political opinions are. What I want is a man who has made good, and will be a living advertisement of Australia. We ought surely to approach these great national questions from a national standpoint. </para>

                                <para>- I apologise for both those statements. It is a most lamentable thing that one cannot introduce any question in this Chamber without honorable members treating it on party lines. I was endeavoring to deal with this matter honestly and on its merits. I place the facts before the House in order that honorable members may know that the Government are going on with this scheme. They believe in immigration, and every man who loves Australia knows it to be essential for the country&#39;s development and defence. The success of this scheme depends upon, not only obtaining the right kind of men, but transporting them to this country, and dealing with them efficiently when they arrive. That in itself will require a very effective organization on this side. To both these phases of the question the Government propose to direct their attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> during the period he will be in England, will do what he can to give effect to this movement, and we hope that as a result of this policy there will be a large influx of desirable settlers to Australia. They will do very much for us in four ways - they will lighten our burden of taxation, they will produce more wealth, they will help to defend Australia, and they will help to develop it. That, broadly, is our policy. I hope that at the Geneva Conference we shall see that the interests of Australia are safeguarded, as I feel perfectly sure they will be in the hands of so competent a representative as my friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

It is entirely at the discretion of the House as to whether any honorable member shall be allowed to make a statement when no other business is before the House. The Prime Minister asked leave to make a statement, the nature of which was not indicated. But the granting of leave is entirely in the control of the House, . and one objection would have been sufficient to prevent the Prime Minister from speaking. A statement by leave can be made only with the unanimous consent of the House. But such a statement is not open to debate, unless upon a motion regularly moved. </para>

                        <para>. It. is not my purpose to speak at length on this measure. While I commend the action of the Government in. introducing this Bill, increasing as if does from &#163;700 to &#163;800 of the maximum advance for War Service Homes, I desire to make observations regarding the settlement of soldiers on the land. We have just heard from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that it is proposed to bring out from the. Old Country as many ex-service men and their families as can be attracted to our shores. I do not object to that.I do not object to a scheme of immigration that will attract to Australia the right class of people, whether they are ex-service men or not ; but to bring people here when our returned men, in some of the States at. least, casuist secure the land that was promised them, would be an almost criminal act. It would be cruel to those who were induced to come here, and unfair to our returned soldiers. Those who have had anything to do with the settlement of our toys on the land in New South Wales know that the money we have advanced for this purpose to the State Government has not resulted in anything like the adequate settlement of our men. The cost per head has been tremendous. I propose to give a few illustrations of the position in New South Wales. On one occasion I was requested by a couple of returned soldiers to inspect some soldier settlement blocks -in a certain district. I have a knowledge of the coastal country, and I do not hesitate to say that the officers who were responsible for the scheme to put returned soldiers on that piece of land ought not to remain in &#39;office for another five minutes. I found that it consisted of heavy forest country. The best timber had been cutout of it by the saw-millers, and it would take a life-time to clear the land of the rubbish that was left. Even if it were cleared it would not graze one bullock to the block, much &#39;less a bullock to2 or 3 acres. That is the sort of country which is being&#39;offered to some of our boys. I learned that a returned soldier who had taken up one of these blocks was killed while removing one &#39;of the trees, and that his wife and child, with her aged father, were living in a small bark hut on the selection, having been advised, no doubt by the Local &#39;Committed, to hang on to it until some other returned soldier could be persuaded to take it over and pay for the improvements. This is what is being done with the money we advance to the States to assist in soldiersettlement.Our boys are being misled. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of what I have seen in New South Wales. In another case a returned soldier was urged to take up what was described as an irrigation block, but according to the report of a Local Committee the water could be brought on to only 2 acres of the whole block. We are constantly boasting of what we are doing with respect to the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, but in my judgment there has been no real attempt in New South Wales to settle returned soldiers on the Hand in the way intended by this Parliament &#34;when we agreed that advances for that purpose should be made to theState Governments. I could cite other cases in respect of which most peculiar decisions have been given by the Department. In one case a returned soldier proposed, through the Department, to purchase for &#163;3 per acre a block immediately adjoining a dairy farm for which &#163;10 per acre was asked.  His  application, however, was turned down by the Department on the ground that the land, although surrounded with dairy farms, was not suitable for dairy farming purposes. One wonders at the reason for such occurrences. Our returned men are not being settled on the land. </para>

                    <para>Mr.Rodgers. - That is not so.The principal Act and this amending Bill have &#34;no relation to land &#39;settlement nor to the erection of homes on broad acres.. The land settlement scheme is purely an arrangement made between the Commonwealth and the States,under which the Commonwealth contributes a certain amount of money for the purpose. The whole administration of that scheme, including the erection of homes on broad acres, is left with the States. </para>

                    <para>There is room for improvement in regard to the prices paid for homes secured u- nderthe WarService Homes scheme. The returned men would like to secure grants to enable them to build homes of any kind they desired so long, of course, as they did not seek to involve the Department to a greater extent than the amount advanced. I realize that our  &#39; boys &#39; &#39; should be looked after and protected against exploitation ; but hardship is being inflicted because the Department is sticking too closely to its plans for home building, and has been refusing applications from those who desire to build according to private plans. I have in mind one case in which a man did not want a house of the type and size proposed by the Department, and had provided himself with a plan to meet his own views. However, because the Department was not prepared to accept the private specifications his application was not approved of. After all, these men have to pay for and live in these homes themselves, and they should have some say in the general scheme of building. </para>

                            <para>- Generally, I agree with that; but there is no reason why a  sound  individual, private plan should not be accepted, or why, because a soldier does not care to build on the lines proposed by the Department, his application for an advance should be disapproved. Numbers of homes have been erected in the vicinity of Cessnock, but returned men will have nothing to do with them. These houses do not appeal to them. It was mentioned to me some days ago by returned soldiers that in the building of homes staffs of, say, twenty carpenters are employed, among whom are four foremen. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. I am in agreement with those portions of the Bill which are intended to widen the scope of the original Act. I notice that benefits are to be advanced to persons who represented the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association abroad. I do not object to that; but I want to know why this legislation should stop at the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association? Why are not representatives of similar services also to be included? Was not equally good work done abroad by representatives oi the Salvation Army ? To give special preference to the members of one individual body will create discontent. While our fighting men may not have said anything depreciative of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, in the matter of its activities on behalf of soldiers on the fighting fronts, I know that they have spoken in far more appreciative terms of services rendered by members of the Salvation Army. This measure proposes te draw an invidious distinction. The Salvation Army representatives did their work in a different way from members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree that this Bill is an improvement upon the original Act. From what I have seen of the construction of War Service Homes in the neighbourhood of Melbourne I can compliment the Minister concerned, and his Commissioner, upon the very good work done and upon the reasonable cost. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> pointed out that the Commissioner insured the cottages erected by the Department. I do not object to that. In fact, it is a very good movement, and is similar to what is generally done by firms which carry their own insurance. The honorable member however, attempted to make out, following an interjection by myself,&#39; that I was against the action of the Department in effecting these insurances. The honorable member endeavoured to draw an analogy between what was done by the Department and the action of the Queensland Government in creating a State Insurance Department. I interjected that the. savings made by that Department were not effected merely by the fact of- its creation by the Government. There were other reasons, one of the chief of which was that the Queensland Government compelled every person who had to insure under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act to do so through the State Department. Thus, a State monopoly was created. Formerly, the sugar-growers had had their own co-operative companies for the purpose of effecting insurances under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. As the risks were small, these companies made big profits, and at the end of the year were able to divide a large surplus among their shareholders. But they cannot do that at the present time, because the premiums previously paid to their company now go into the State insurance scheme. Furthermore, the State makes it imperative on householders to insure their domestic servants against accident, &#38;c, under the Workers&#39; Compensation Act. There is no risk attached to this class of insurance; in fact,  1  have never heard of a claim for workers&#39; compensation being made by a domestic servant, or that one has ever suffered sufficiently to justify such a claim. I look upon this compulsion as representing so much money which is extracted from the public for the purpose of building up a revenue for this State enterprise, thus making it very much easier to reduce the rate of insurance on property on which there is risk. Again, the Queensland Government compel every municipality, shire council, central sugar mill, hospital, or other institution endowed by Government funds to insure through the State Insurance Department. This also gives the Government scheme a tremendous pull, enabling it to reduce the rates on certain classes of property. </para>

I understand that in the case  of  large companies or corporations, it was the practice  of  many insurance companies to make a considerable reduction in their schedule rates by commission as agents, sub-agents, or directors, so that their premiums were often lower than the flat rate which was charged under the Government schome. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. No doubt, some persons may have benefited by the Queensland Government scheme, but in very many cases the insurance premium was paid to cover practically no risk. It was unfair for the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> yesterday to quote a few isolated cases, as he did. Some insurance companies are very careful about certain risks, possibly more careful than a State Department would be. However, I am making these remarks now to justify my interjection of yesterday. I am not opposed to the War Service Homes Commissioner carrying out his own insurance. As a matter of fact, in the circumstances,I think it is quite the proper course for him to take. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable members, instead of interrupting, would allow&#39;  -me to continue, they would more easily appreciate the point I wish to make. I know nothing about this deal except what the Minister has stated, and what is contained in the papers laid on the table.I do not know whether the transaction is a good or bad one. The saw-mills in question are not in my electorate, and I have no more interest in the matter than has any other honorable member. However, I do regard it as the duty of this House to see that justice is done. The War Service Homes Commissioner, who had been given authority to construct so many thousands of houses, had to consider how best he could go about building them. He found that under the system of buying timber from day to day or week to week prices wore constantly jumping up against him. In one instance, where he made an arrangement with millers to receive a rebate of 5 per cent., the price of the timber had been raised by 10 per cent. within a month. As a matter of fact, the increase in the price of timber is largely due to the fact that royalty payable to the Queensland Government for timber standing in the scrub has been increased to 20s. or more per 100 foot. The Queensland Government are not to blame, but they submit the blocks for competition, with a fixed minimum royalty of, say, 5s. per 100 feet, and if the people who are competing to secure the blocks are willing to run the upset price up to 20s. per 100 feet, of course they can do so. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. It was not a case of looking at prospective orders. The War Service Homes Commissioner had instructions from this Parliament to build these houses as well and as cheaply- as possible, and no one who has had experience in business would say that it was not better to buy a large quantity of timber at a cheaper rate than would be secured by buying from hand to mouth, &#39;especially when there was very frequently arise in prices. TheCommis- sioner, realizing that some finality must be reached, and in his attempt to carry out his instruction to build these homes as nearly as possible at a cost of &#163;700 each, concluded that he could not do so unless he could insure an ample supply of timber at a certain price. None of the millers would make a contract with him. They would simply sell from month to month. Periodically they meet and decide upon the price they will charge for their output, and the rate goes up accordingly, the Commissioner, among others, being obliged to pay the higher prices. He acted wisely, therefore, in purchasing these saw-mills, always provided that he got them at a fair price. The only method of ascertaining whether the price paid was fair is by seeing who reported upon the value of the timber as it stood in the bush, and upon the machinery in the mills, and who checked the reports thus received, and by finding out if they were competent to present a fair report. In the first place the Commissioner approached the Queensland Forestry Department, and secured the services of their best man, who valued the timber, and made certain recommendations. Then the Commissioner obtained a man or men to place a value on the machinery in the mills and the plant. Afterwards consideration was given to the effect of having two mills working alongside one another on adjacent blocks. It was evidently decided that more economical work could be done by two mills working huge blocks of timber country side by side and using the one management than could be achieved by establishing two widely separated mills with different controls. Furthermore, the timber would not need to be carted such a long distance as would be the case if there were two separately managed mills. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose so, but. I do not think they would be likely to sell. I do not think offers would be obtained from any millers except those circumstanced as Messrs. Lahey and Brett were. These men went out into the scrub years ago, and took up blocks of 10,000 acres covered with splendid pine. They also secured the timber rights on other blocks and leases of other blocks when the royalty was probably 4s. or 5s. per 100 feet, and now that it has jumped to 20s. per 100 feet, surely they have an unearned increment of an enormous amount which they may he .prepared to vend as long as the purchaser, is willing to give them a considerable portion of the enhanced value of their timber. </para>

                            <para>- We must distinguish between saw-mill proprietors like Messrs. Lahey and Brett and. other lessees of timber areas. These men, in the first instance, went out into the backblocks and secured large areas of beautiful pine -and other timber, &#39; more as a speculation than as. an ordinary trading proposition; and, as the price of timber has been rising considerably, they have been in a position to command a substantial sum in the nature of the unearned increment:.. Apparently they were satisfied to sell out, instead of carrying on business permanently on their own account. In my own electorate there are to be found some of the largest and most up-to-date saw-mills in Australia, the proprietors of which -are. prepared to do legitimate business by supplying timber requirements, not only within my own State, but in other States&#39; as well. They are doing a very successful business, but they avoid any risk of selling at a lower price than that at which they could replace their stocks of standing timber by Belling only from month to month. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am referring to the saw-mill owners in my own electorate. They are not prepared to sell all their stocks at once, because, if they did that, they would not&#39; be in a position to supply orders, which are flowing in from day to day. The difference between the two  classes  of timber millers is clearly illustrated. The one class is satisfied to take advantage of the rise in timber prices already ascertained; the other prefers to carry on business on a permanent basis. . The rise in timber values is probably anything from 3s. or 4s. up to 20s. standing, and they offered to sell it at 15s. per 100 feet standing. A lot of the same class of timber in the bulk in Queensland cannot be bought at less than from 17s. to 22s. ; but Messrs. Lahey and Brett apparently were prepared to sacrifice  this prospect, and to be satisfied with the difference between what they gave for it and l&#39;5s., a very good profit. The question is how far were the Government justified in passing over other saw-millers and buying these mills. The War Service Homes Commissioner,,  charged as he. is with the responsibility of building about 8,000 houses, realized no doubt that he would not be justified, if it could be avoided, in building the first lot of soldiers&#39; homes at &#163;700 each if other houses built subsequently were going to cost much more. It was his duty to minimize, as far as possible, the cost over the whole transaction. This could, not be done by obtaining supplies in a hand-to-mouth fashion, because the mills would not sell for forward delivery. Their last offer, was a 5 per cent, reduction on the usual selling price, but they declined  to name any quantity, and within one month, after giving a rebate of 5 per cent., they increased the price by 10 per cent. This movement may constantly go on. No one can say that the royalty on timber will not be up to 30s. per 100 feet standing within the next two or three  yeaTs. </para>

                            <para>- They put up the timber for sale at a fixed price; but if, as the result of competition, an advance was offered, they could hardly be blamed for taking it; although in dealing with Wax Service Homes the Queensland Government might have been prepared to dispense with the royalty on timber altogether. This would have meant some practical help to returned soldiers. However, under any circumstances, 15s. per 100 feet is less than current rates, and there is a reserve of 10,000 acres of freehold in regard to which they have not paid one penny. It is all in reserve. I listened attentively to the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I do not know whether he  desired&#39; to&#39; convey the .impression that no proper investigation had been made in regard to the purchase, but I hope not. He omitted to mention that the first &#39;step taken was to get the best expert advice obtainable in the reafforestation department in Queensland to value the machinery.  The honorable member said that the Government got <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brett</inline> to value <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lahey&#39;s</inline> machinery and mill. </para>

                            <para>- Let me say that the sale of his own property was practically made, so far as I understand, before this request was made for an opinion. In any case, I understand it did not, in the slightest degree, influence the Commissioner in accepting the offer. It was felt that a good man had been secured to report on the value of the machinery, and also on the value of the timber . The land was taken as valueless, though I know it is of considerable value. The next question is whether there is a sale for the timber; and there certainly is, for the purpose of constructing the houses that the Commissioner is authorized to provide. I fail to see how, under the circumstances, any blame is attached to the Commissioner, whom it would have been folly to compel to ask authority for each &#163;50,000 he proposed to spend. Further, the present arrangements will enable the Commissioner to be able to fix the price he will have to charge the soldiers for their homes, which he would not have been able to do under any other circumstances. No direct charge has been made against this deal, and if there is one that can be made, I should like to know what it is. If the deal is a good one, let us approve of it. I have never been in favour of Stateowned industries, and I should not be in favour of this were it not for the exceptional circumstances. We know that in Queensland the State saw-mills were not a success, but they had to compete with privately-owned up-to-date mills in the sale of their timber. In this they were not successful because the Government mills were not so up-to-date as those privately owned; but that objection does not apply in the present case, for the Commissioner will utilize all that can be produced and know the price he has to pay for it. </para>

                            <para>- They are up-to-date for the purpose for which they are acquired, and there is the advantage that all the pine, hardwood, and other varieties of timber will be supplied from the same source. I have already mentioned the saw -mills in Maryborough, but, outside that city, there are many other large saw-mills at Gympie, Bundaberg, and right through my electorate. Timber and made-up goods, such as doors and sashes, are sent all over Queensland and to New South Wales, and some to places outside Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In order to show that the timber business is not so bad as has been represented, I may say that one of the largest firms in Sydney, the McKenzie Company, are erecting four mills on Frazer&#39;s Island, together with a pier for the purpose of loading. If the timber business was such a bad one as we have been told, we should not find men of enterprise, ability, and knowledge extending their operations in this way. Altogether there is evidently a good future for the timber industry. The Prime Minister, this morning, told us of the active immigration policy contemplated by the Government; and this means that timber in large quantities will be required in order to build houses for new settlers, workers, and so forth. Instead of regarding &#34;this purchase by the Government as a mistake, we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on its accomplishment if the valuations are correct. It is generally admitted that the valuation of the timber, checked by the accountancy expert, is one that ought to be satisfactory to this House. The only question is whether15s. was a fair price to pay, without taking into consideration the value of the land. I have yet to be told that the other expert reports were not satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the reasons are better known to the honorable member than they are to me. Returned soldiers desire to acquire land on a freehold basis, and if it were made available in that way, tens of thousands of soldiers would have been prepared to settle there, and not only develop the country, but build up the population.  There is another matter which I would like the Minister to take into consideration. Many of our returned soldiers, desirous of starting in business, have experienced considerable difficulty in opening accounts with wholesale firms. Under the present system it is impossible, with  out  considerable delay and risk, for the wholesale merchants to ascertain whether the applicants for . credit have any liabilities, because their encumbrances with the Department are not published in the ordinary way, and, although in many instances the merchants are desirous of helping the soldiers as much as possible, they are not prepared to do so because of the risk involved.  It  may be said that by paying a fee of1s. or so a necessary search could be made, but the merchants have not the time to inquire in other States to ascertain to what extent an applicant may be involved from time to time. Quite recently the following case was reported in White&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Mercantile Gazette,</inline> which is circulated amongst the commercial community - </para>

                        <para>A certain returned soldier got a loan over certain chattel assets; he left the Colony, and the Department took possession under its bill of sale and sold him up. The whole proceeds of the auction sale did not nearly cover the  advance. The man was made insolvent by the trade creditors, and some outside assets realized. The Department now claims the whole proceeds of these, and leaves the creditors absolutely nothing. It should be remembered that trade gazettes can bo prosecuted criminally if they publish the security token in such cases. </para>

                            <para>-No one has done more to assist in the repatriation of our men than the Honorary Minister. I am sure he will admit that there is a very small percentage of the men who have any knowledge- of business, and some may be indignant at such a proposal, merely because they do not understand the circumstances. I should like to take this opportunity of - protesting against the collection of the entertainments tax on the proceeds of band concerts. The bands in Queensland include a large number of returned soldiers, and they give entertainments for the benefit of soldiers, churches, and charities. They make ho charge for their services; some of them have even incurred liabilities for the purchase of instruments. Occasionally an entertainment is given in older to- pro vide- funds for the purchase of new instruments, which, however, do not &#39;become the property of any individual; they remain in the possession of the band. Yet . on the - proceeds of &#39; all these entertainments bands have to pay taxation. No&#39; less than four bands have communicated with me recently on this subject. One of them owes &#163;300 for its instruments. It seems a hardship that the members of these organizations, which are educational, and which do so much gratuitous work of a public and benevolent character, should be required to pay from their own pockets taxation on their concert receipts. </para>

                    <para>Mr.MAKIN (Hlndmarsh) &#91;2.47&#93;.- I. was very much impressed with the speech made by the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> last evening; and I recognise the seriousness of the statement he made concerning the recent purchase by the Commonwealth of sawmills, and timber lands in Queensland. Although I am a firm believer in State enterprise, which I consider to be more in the public interest than private enterprise, yet every care should be exercised in connexion with any transaction for the conversion of a private concern into a public utility. The interests of the taxpayers should be thoroughly conserved. If the statements made by the honorable member- for Cowper can be &#39;substantiated by evidence, he has made out a serious case against the Government, and it is. their duty to justify this purchase. Although I believe in public enterprises, I shall not countenance the subordination of the public interest to private interests, and the involving of the public in a liability for a purchase that is without merit. It is rather amusing to note that the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> should be to-day the champion of the action of the Government in taking over these timber enterprises. I wonder what his attitude would be if the same policy were applied to the sugar industry. </para>

                    <para>I am thoroughly in accord with the remarks made yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> in regard to the unfortunate soldiers who have suffered double amputations and are victims of tubercular disease.&#34; He disclosed a scandalous state of affairs. When I received a communication from the Association for Limbless and Maimed Soldiers I was&#39; shocked to learn that  such conditions . could prevail in a country in which we profess to take such a keen interest in tbo welfare of our soldiers. The circumstances disclosed should not be allowed to continue a moment- longer than is avoidable. I think also that greater consideration should be given to. maimed soldiers in connexion with the payments for homes. Every opportunity should be afforded to not only soldiers, but all citizens, to become possessed of a house, that they can call their own. Having regard to the immigration policyenun-. ciated by the Prime Minister this morning, more rapid progress should be made in providing homes for the people, because, if more population is brought . to the country, the housing problem which <inline font-style="italic">now</inline> confronts the people will be accentuated. In the district I have the honour to represent, some people are living in houses that should not be tolerated in a country like Australia, and many of the  tenants are men . who saw active service abroad. I am hopeful that in the near future the - objectionable form of housing with which wo are familiar will be removed. </para>

The Government should &#39; set about this matter in. a business-like manner: They should bend the whole of their energies to expediting the erection of these homes, so that we may abolish the slum life that has made its appearance in our midst, and thus raise the social standard of our people. It is incumbent upon us to see that those who fought  overseas are decently housed. &#39; The honorable member for Cowper . <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle  Page)</inline> has made out a case which the Government must answer. Only last evening, reference was made to a number of youths who saw active service abroad, and who, because they were under age when they enlisted, are being deprived of the advantages that will be- conferred by out War Service Homes legislation. I have submitted a similar case to the Department. It is that of a young lad who enlisted when he was only-lsixteen years of age, and who  is  to-day bdmg deprived of his gratuity and of all tne other provisions relating to the repatriation of our soldiers.  I hope that in this matter justice will be done to those to whom  just-ice  is  due. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Minister upon, having included in this Bill provision for mariners and those persons who were members of the Australian mercantile marine. Honorable members who know anything of tie genesis of the measure know that during the last session of Parliament the inclusion of members of the mercantile marine was fought for very strenuously. Now. that they have been included, I desire to convey to the Minister our sincere appreciation of the action of the Government. I do not&#39; in-, tend to speak at length upon this Bill, but there are one or two phases of it to Which I desire to direct attention. In the first place, I find that the War Service Homes Commissioner is interposing a bar against vocational trainees participating in the benefits which have been conferred by the  principal Act. To discriminate to the detriment of these men simply because, for the time being, they are not in as good a financial position as are other applicants for &#34;War Service Homes is entirely unjust. </para>

                            <para>- The only reason is that, in his opinion, these men are not in a position to bear the burden of paying the instalments that would be required of them under the Act, because they are only in receipt of a sustenance allowance from another section of the Repatriation Department instead of being in receipt of full wages. There should not exist, any bar &#34;against vocational trainees. As these &#39;men are being trained for a trade in which they will ultimately be able to. earn full wages&#39;, the Commissioner ought not-to penalize them at the present stage. I sincerely hope that the. Minister will be able to devise some means for the removal of this disability. The representatives of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association are. included within the provisions of the principal Act: </para>

                            <para>- That is a sound, common-sense proposition. But when we are training a man to earn a full tradesman&#39;s wage within three, six, or nine months from date, it cannot be urged that he has not a reasonable prospect of being able to keep up his payments. At the present time, the War Service Homes Commissioner is declining the applications of vocational trainees. However, as the Minister has promised to look into the matter, I will say no more about at. </para>

                            <para>- There are many chaplains who rendered remarkably good service at the Front, and I raise no objection to their inclusion in this Bill. I know something of the work which chaplains as members of the Australian Imperial Force performed. They were duly attested, but Young, Men&#39;s Christian Association officials were not attested until towards the close of the&#39; campaign, when some of their number were granted permission, and were attested in England* </para>

                    <para>Another phase of this matter to which&#39; I&#39; desire to refer has relation to cases- in which the Commissioner&#39;s estimate of the cost of building a home is exceeded. Where a returned soldier contracts with the War Service Homes Commissioner to build him, a house for, say,. &#163;750; and that cost, owing to extras and other circumstances over which neither the Commissioner nor the soldier has control, is exceeded by &#163;30, &#163;40, or &#163;50, the practice of the Department at present is not to allow the man to take possession until the additional amount has &#39;been paid in cash. I- would urge the Minister to regard this as an unsound principle. The Department has the additional security for the money so expended, and the man should&#39; not be penalized. Instead of being called upon to pay this additional cost in cash before being allowed to enter into occupation, he should be given possession on completion of the building, and allowed to pay the additional cost by instalments spread over a number of years. The Minister may say that a returned soldier who has a war gratuity or deferred pay should be able to comply with the present requirement. Taking it by and large, how- ever, most of the men, when they returned to Australia, had to refurnish their homes, and those who have had to do that in recent times will know full well what it involves. I have had a bitter experience . during the past few months of the cost of refurnishing, and I am convinced that returned soldiers could not reasonably bp expected to have in hand the cash necessary to meet these additional costs. That being so, we ought not to shut the door in their faces. We might very well follow the practice adopted in connexion with the Western Australian workers&#39; home scheme, which was established some eight years ago; and allow the returned&#39; soldier to take possession of his home as soon as it is completed,, and to pay by instalments spread over a period the amount by which the estimated cost has been exceeded. </para>

                    <para>Theonly other matter to which I desire to refer is the position of war workers under . this Bill. The term &#34; war worker &#34; is all-embracing. We shall find that those employed in connexion with the War Chest Fund, as well, as Salvation Army , officers who accompanied the Forces overseas, and, indeed, every form of war worker in Australia is covered by the term; - The Bill does not even provide that only war workers who went overseas shall come within its scope, and thus all auxiliary services, both here and abroad, will&#39;, in my opinion, be included. If in the administration of the principal Act. and this amending Bill preference be given to that ty,pe as against the genuine attested member of the Australian Imperial Force, untold trouble will be laid up for the Government. </para>

I have no objection to these other classes coming within the scope of the Act. As one of the vice-presidents for Australia of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, I can say that the League, as an organization, has no objection to their coming in, . but it asks that if they are brought within the scope of the Act preference in administration shall be given to the genuine attested members of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

                            <para>- I heard the honorable member&#39;s reference to that matter this morning. I have come to the conclusion that the definition of . &#34; war worker &#34; covers all who took any part in the auxiliary services of the Army, and that whether Young Men&#39;s Christian Association officials are or axe not specifically brought within the terms of this measure they will&#39; be. covered . by that definition.&#39; </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I have no desire to detain the House. I am. glad that the Minister is going to consider &#39;the views I have put. before him in regard to vocational trainees, the giving of preference over all others to genuine attested members of the Australian Imperial Force, and the payment of any amount in excess of the estimated cost of a War Service Home by instalments spread over a number of. years. These principles of preference might well be embodied in the Bill. It ought certainly to be made perfectly clear that first preference shall be given to attested members of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

                        <para>. - I fully appreciate the necessity for the introduction of this Bill in view of the experience which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> must have gained of difficulties arising from the operation of the principal Act. I approve of most of the amendments of the. original measure embodied in this Bill. Much has been said by speakers who have preceded me concerning proposals made to extend the scope of the original measure so as to include war workers and members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Associatio.n amongst those entitled to the benefits of the Act. I wish to say at once that I object to the scope of the Act being extended in. that way, and I am disposed, to vote against the provisions of this Bill which are intended to have that effect. </para>

Until such time as. we come within measurable distance of being able to meet the requirements of the soldiers, I will not agree to the extension to war workers, members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, or the Salvation&#39; Army, and similar bodies of the benefits of the War Service Homes Act. The soldier must be out first consideration, and in the circumstances I object to Specialize particular war workers in the way proposed in this Bill, and so I feel myself obliged to oppose that proposal . </para>

                    <para>A good deal has been said about the purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland. I do not wish to say very much on that matter, but I might mention, in passing, that I take quite a different view of it from that expressed by certain honorable members who spoke  on the- &#34;subject&#34; ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday last, and also from that expressed by the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who dealt with the matter last evening. As to the merits of the deal, I will say nothing, because I know nothing about  it. I think that statement applies to the average member of the House, if not to practically every member of it. It has been claimed that the War Service Homes Commissioner should not have entered into a deal of this sort without the matter having first been brought before Parliament for its sanction, but it has been quite evident to me that this Parliament definitely gave the War Service Homes Commissioner and . the Minister for Repatriation that power when it passed the original War Service Homes Bill. , If we cannot depend on the War Service Homes Commissioner and the experts to whom he can look for advice to say whether it is good or bad business to purchase timber for War Service Homes in the way he has done, then, in my view, this House is not in a position to express a valuable opinion on such a matter. It is about the worst . possible body that could be suggested to decide whether such a proposal is a good or bad deal. </para>
                    <para>The chief objection which has been raised to the purchase is that the timber, in the long run, will not be as cheap, and consequently the cost of the homes, to the soldiers will be greater than, it would be if timber were purchased from private companies as required. Time only can tell whether this deal is a good or a bad one. On the.- subject of parliamentary control of expenditure and the contention that such proposals should receive the sanction of Parliament before we are committed to expenditure to give effect to them, I. take the view that this Parliament has the right to decide, first &#169;f all, whether homes shall be -built for returned soldiers, and then whether the carrying out of the work shall be left to a&#39; Commissioner, or body of Commissioners, or to the Minister.  for  Repatriation and his Department. We certainly did give the War Service Homes Commissioner under the original Act the </para>
                    <para>T&#62;ower to spend millions of money in building waT service homes, and it is, therefore, absurd for honorable members to say now that1 we did not give him the power to purchase timber to the- value of &#163;500,000. </para>

                            <para>- In support of my contention that Parliament is not a fit body to decide whether such a deal is a good one - or not, I may mention that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> and I, though we are representatives from the same State, hold widely different views as to the success or otherwise of such a deal. On Friday morning last, the honorable member for Franklin, in referring to this matter, said, that he knew of no case where a large company had been successful in -the saw-milling business, and that only men in business in a small way have been successful in carrying on that industry. My experience has been exactly the reverse. I have known companies carrying on the saw-milling business in a large way to be very successful, and I have known of a great many failures amongst small companies and men carrying on the business in a small way. Many men have failed very quickly for the simple reason that they have not commanded sufficient capital to hold timber long enough, or to keep stocks necessary to enable the timber to be properly seasoned. My experience has been that in the timber industry men strong financially have a better chance of success than can be expected by two or .three individuals who have little or no capital at their backs. I mention this difference of opinion between the honorable member for Franklin and myself in support of my contention that Parliament is, perhaps, the last body that should be. appealed to to decide such a question. Though the State we come from is not a very large one, and probably similar conditions apply from one end  of it to . the other, yet we differ, so widely on this subject that we might debate it for . a week. Another matter which has been alluded to, and upon which I feel very strongly, has to- do with the position of limbless and blinded soldiers. The honorable member for Tarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> last night quoted from a circular issued by the association .of these incapacitated men, in New South Wales, and I&#39; also have received a copy. I have every sympathy with those of our soldiers who lost, perhaps, two limbs and, in some cases, three, and I sincerely hope that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> will consider whether it is not possible to assist them, to- some permanent extent,- along the lines&#39; suggested in their circular.&#39; I have always taken the view that those men who were incapacitated during the war are entitled to be kept&#39; in comfort for the remainder .of their days; and, although it may not be possible to go so far as is proposed in the circular- for example, to give to those who have lost the sight of one eye, up to one-third or one-fourth the value of their house - still, something very much more favorable than so far conceded should be given them. In the case of. those who have lost an eye there are pensions to assist them in earning their living; for, despite their defect, they should be able, in most cases, to do - almost as- well as whole men. But,, as for men who have   lost their arms, or their legs, it cannot be expected that they will be able to do much for themselves&#39;; they cannot hope to . secure much comfort for the future, even though they should be able, by their own activities, to add something to their, pensions. The Government should consider whether they cannot do something more for those maimed and limbless soldiers in the way of providing them with homes for life - although not necessarily by giving them homes straight out in which they could traffic. </para>

                            <para>-  I can only emphasize that there is nothing in either the original  Statute or in this amending Bill to disentitle any member of , the Australian Imperial Force from securing the full benefits of our legislation. Each case, of course, must be investigated on its merits, and it must be made clear that the applicant io eligible under the tests set out in the Act. It is impossible for me to answer all the points raised &#39;by honorable members as they crop up, but I will undertake to do bo before the House goes into Committee. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased with that assurance, but I spoke as I did for the reason &#39;that the Minister did not proceed forthwith to deny the assertions. I agree that there is nothing in our legislation, either past or projected, which would ex-  elude these youths from the benefits of repatriation - whatever&#39; reasons or excuses may be advanced by officials; and, if by chance there have been such cases as honorable members have alluded to, the wrong must be righted immediately. </para>

                    <para>I have just one note of criticism to offer regarding the building of War Service Homes, and I regret to have to do so, because the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator E. D. Millen)</inline> and the Commissioner have done excellent work. That has been demonstrated in the houses which have been built in the suburbs of Melbourne and elsewhere. On the whole, a very good type of house has been erected - a type suited to the particular locality, and, no doubt, to the requirements of the individual occupants. But I have to complain that similar progress has not been made in country towns and in certain parts of other States. From my own electorate, applications had been forwarded before my return to Australia twelve months ago, but nothing has yet been done. When General Birdwood was in Tasmania, he laid the foundation stone of one house, but nothing further has been done. Many of those applicants who have been waiting have been so disgusted with the delay that they have gone elsewhere, to private sources, in order to secure homes for themselves. Absolutely no progress has been made in the smaller towns in my electorate, although applications have been in for a very long time. In reply to an inquiry which I sent to the secretary of the Returned Soldiers League at Wynyard, as to whether any progress had been made, I received a letter stating that absolutely nothing had been done. The writer added that the building of War Service Homes in his district was a farce or a tragedy, according to the point of view from which one looked at it. The country districts should be given some of the benefits arising out of the building of these homes, and the soldier who lives there should at least have a share. In many cases at present he has nothing. Numerous homes are being built in the cities, where there are far too many houses already. If houses were built outside, where there is ample work for young men to do, it would be very much better. Houses are being built every day and every week to the number of hundreds in the year in the cities, but the soldier who lives in the country district has not received the same benefits. </para>
                    <para>I trust the Minister will take some notice of any protest on this matter, because it is the one point in regard to the War Service Homes scheme with which I am distinctly dissatisfied. </para>

                            <para>- That is in regard to everything. The boy who went overseas, whether he was sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen, who went into the firing line, and did his bit with the others, will be recognised, and get the full rights of a returned soldier. I  aim,  however, definitely assured by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and by my officers in the Department, that it was conclusively shown that on several occasions - and it is presumed that there were many more instances - there was collusion between the parents and certain boys under age to enable them to go overseas. Of course, all these boys made false attestations, but that will be forgiven to those who went into the firing line.. Still there were others who, with the connivance of their parents, designedly made false attestations, knowing they were under age, and got over to the other side, and after they had had a good trip, which cost them nothing, their parents put in a protest, and claimed that the boys should be sent back. </para>

                        <para>. - Yesterday I raised the question of the serious circumstances prevailing in the milling trade in South Australia, particularly at Port Adelaide. During the debate the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> said that one of the causes of the present lack of supplies of wheat for -millers was that they expected to secure their wheat for gristing for the export trade at the price of 7s. 8d. per bushel fixed for grain required for gristing for home consumption. That is quite incorrect. The millers of South Australia do not expect to purchase their wheat for gristing for the export trade at 7s. 8d. per bushel; but are prepared to pay the parity price. They have made an arrangement with the Wheat Board by which the price of the grain they require for their export trade may be fixed from month to month in accordance with the parity price. </para>
