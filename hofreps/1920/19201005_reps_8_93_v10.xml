                            <para>- I understand that there is a dispute of some sort with the boilermakers at Cockatoo Island, and since shipbuilding is in the main dependent upon boilermakers it is a fact that there is delay. I should like to add that the draft of a new ' agreement for shipbuilding has been made. It is now before the unions concerned, and there is no reason to believe that they will not sign it. The honorable member will recollect that a Conference was held, a little while ago, at which the representatives of the unions concerned in shipbuilding were present. As a result of that Conference this new agreement has been drawn up. Coming to the second part of the honorable member's question, as to what the Government propose to do in regard to shipbuilding at Cockatoo Island, the answer may be given quite shortly. The Government propose not to build ships at Cockatoo Island unless and until a very clear understanding has been arrived at with the Sydney branch of the Boilermakers Union, which caused considerable trouble under the present agreement, and apparently contemplates repeating its tactics in connexion with the new one. Unless and until it signs the agreement no ships will be built at Cockatoo Island. </para>

                        <para>- No. This Parliament has, on four different occasions, proposed amendments of the Constitution, and the people have rejected them. The Constitution was originally drawn by a Convention elected directly by the people, and now that twenty years have 'elapsed we are fairly entitled to call another Convention to review the Constitution, and to consider how far, it at all, it should be amended. We should let the authority which' drafted the Convention submit the amendments. I think the honorable member will recognise that no matter how much we desire to amend the Constitution unless and until the people accept the amendments this Parliament is powerless in the matter. We might save a little time, and a little money, by dealing with the whole question in the way proposed by the honorable member, but we should waste it' all, since when we went to the jury that jury would turn down our proposals. I, therefore, do not propose to consider the suggestion. </para>

                <para>A blank copy of British ship articles is sent from some port in Australia to Manila, or is procured locally in Manila from the British Consul, and the crew are signed on before the British Consul.

The food and the accommodation supplied to those men is far below the standard of what the white Australian receives. </para>
                <para class="block">I  do  not think the seamen are asking too much when they urge that the hours of labour, rates  of  pay, and conditions generally existing  on  these vessels shall be similar  to  those in force  on  Australian ships. This vessel the particulars concerning which  I  have just quoted, has never been  to  the Philippines. Those interested in securing crews for ships  of  this character bring the men down  as  passengers  to  one or other  of  the Australian east coast ports, and then place them  on  shipboard and trade with them  as  the crew, along our coastline,  to  the detriment  of  Australian shipping and seamen. The Australian ship-owner has  to  pay the wages, and comply generally with the conditions  of  employment required by our laws; and these other parties, who are  doing  exceedingly well out  of  sea transport in Australian waters  to-day,  should be made  to  work under the same set  of  conditions. There is already provision, where seamen are compelled  to do  what is known  as  shore labour, that if there is  an  award granting rates which are higher than the wages ordinarily paid  to  seamen or firemen  on  shipboard, those engaged  on  shore labour shall be paid the higher rates. The seamen are only asking that similar conditions shall hold;  so  far  as  the employment  of  persons from "outside"is concerned.  In  the matter  of  Japanese ships and seamen, I understand that the general conditions and rates  of  pay compare favorably with those applicable  to  the Australian coast trade. The clause is not aimed  at  Japan, but  at  any parties who have entered upon the practice  of  securing crews from foreign parts with the intention  of  employing them more cheaply than Australian crews. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister, no doubt, has in mind the case of Peninsular and Oriental and other vessels arriving at Fremantle, and then coming on to eastern ports. It is quite possible that the clause would affect such ships; but the object of the seamen is to prevent vessels from entering upon the Australian coastal trade in an illicit manner, and to stop the employment of coloured alien labour, seeing that it might reduce the Australian standard of employment. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a peculiarity of seamen, as I have pointed out previously, that they should claim the same conditions of living generally as are enjoyed by the ordinary man on shore. The latter is protected from the competition of coloured alien labour. Ours is a " white " country, and there is no longer need to argue that question; but it would require no great stretch of imagination to perceive that if the practice indicated by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is allowed to continue, the Australian coastal trade in a short while would be done by alien crews. One can quite understand that Japanese might be willing to pay our rates of wages while working Japanese crews around our coasts; but would we care to see our trade taken over by Japanese ships manned by Japanese labour ? Australian shipping companies wi.l be placed in an awkward position if the present tendency expands; unless, of course, they make up their minds also to employ coloured alien crew6. It might appeal to them, as a paying proposition, to grant Australian rates of wages while their ships are engaged around our coasts, and then, to give cheaper wages to the alien crews while outside of Australian waters. Apart from that point of view, the subject-matter of the proposed new clause must concern npt only our seamen, but Australian ship-owners, and the public as well. We have been claiming for years that this is a white man's country. The claim requires no defence to-day; it is established beyond argument. But we are beginning to permit coloured alien labour to work around our coasts under certain conditions. Where will it end if we do not protect ourselves ? There are Asiatic countries which, for the purpose of inserting the thin end of the wedge into " White" Australia, would not be above making insidious beginnings in this manner ; but our seamen have their eyes open ,  and it is only natural that they should, protest and take action. The honorable member for Yarra has quoted a glaring case, but the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will probably remember that officials of the Seamen's Union called his attention to a practically similar set of circumstances in respect of another vessel. It is not possible for alien coloured labour to compete on shore. That being so, I press the claim of the seamen that they should be treated in the same way as the men who work on shore, in order to protect them from alien coloured labour to that extent. </para>

Whilst not abating in the slightest degree our adherence to the policy of the White Australia, I wish to give reasons why it is quite impossible for us to accept the amendment in the form in which it has been moved. It is proposed to insert it as a new clause in Part VI. of the Act, dealing with the coasting trade. One of the objects which that portion of the Act was devised to accomplish was the very question raised by the proposed amendment: that is, to prevent the employment of cheap labour in the coasting trade of Australia by the use of coloured crews in competition with white crews. That was the main object which we had in inserting the coasting trade provisions. It was not the only object, but it was the main one. Section 288 of the main Act provides - </para>

After all, we are part of an Empire, and I do not know of any question so delicate and difficult, from the Imperial point of view, as the colour question. The British Empire has many millions of coloured subjects; and honorable members have only to cast their memories back a very short distance to recall incidents in connexion with this very question which have been giving the British Government for some considerable time past the most serious concern. Let me remind honorable members of some of the occasions on which this question was raised, and the manner in which Imperial statesmen from time to time dealt with it. As far back as 1897, the Imperial Government felt called upon, by reason of certain trouble that had arisen between some of the Dominions and India, to place before a Conference of Colonial Premiers, as they were then, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the general principles which they desired to maintain in regard to the relations between  Her  Majesty's Indian subjects and the self-governing Dominions. In the course of his address, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> made the following remarks, which are as apt today as on the day he uttered them :  - </para>

An immigration of that kind must, I quite understand, in the interests of the Colonies, be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object. </para>

The United Kingdom owns, as its brightest and greatest Dependency that enormous Empire of India, with 300,000,000 subjects, who 'are as loyal to the Crown as you are yourselves, and among them there are hundreds and thousands of men who are every whit as civilized as we are ourselves.; who are, if that is anything, better born, in the sense that they have older traditions and older families; .  who are men of wealth, men of culture, men of distinguished valour, men who have brought whole armies and placed them at the service of the Queen, and have in times of great difficulty and trouble, such, for instance, as on the occasion of the Indian Mutiny, saved the Empire by their loyalty. I say you, who have seen all this, cannot be willing to put upon these men a slight, which, I think, is absolutely unnecessary for your purpose, and which would be calculated to provoke ill-feeling, discontent, irritation, and would be most unpalatable to the feelings, not only of  Her  Majesty the Queen, but of all her people. </para>

                <para class="block">We have done a great deal in Australia . to prevent the influx of an alien immigration, and the British Government have never objected to that. We have always accomplished our end by indirect means, and we shall attain the result which the honorable member has in view, to a very large extent, at all events, by indirect means. The reason why coloured labour is still employed is that the Navigation Act has not been proclaimed ; the moment it is proclaimed, the special conditions which the owners of those vessels will have to comply with will make it no longer profitable to .employ Philippine crews. Owners will not pay such crews Australian rates of wages, and the answer to the honorable member's arguments is in the figures he supplied to the Committee. If owners have to pay Australian rates of wages, give the accommodation set forth in the Navigation Act. and feed the crews in accordance with the scales laid down in the Bill, it will not pay them to employ the comparatively large number of coloured mon in preference to white men. I presume that the only reason these coloured men are employed is that their employment pays the owners best. </para>

I remind the honorable member that in 1906, I think, a Bill was passed by this Parliament granting . preferential treatment to certain goods the product of the United Kingdom, but excluding from: the benefits of the Bill goods carried in ships on which lascars were employed. That Bill was reserved for  His  Majesty's assent, and in the following year the matter was discussed at the Colonial Conference in London, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> said - </para>

                <para class="block">In deference to the wishes of the representatives of the Imperial Government, the resolution * was withdrawn. I am giving the history of this matter in order to show honorable members that they will be absolutely imperilling the Bill itself by insisting upon the amendment which has been submitted. In  1910  the New Zealand Parliament passed a 'Bill .providing for an increased stamp duty upon bills of lading and passenger tickets issued by ships trading from New Zealand to the Commonwealth, and which were manned wholly, or in part, by Asiatics. There, again, the direct- colour line was drawn. That Bill was also reserved for the King's assent. In  1910  the matter was brought up by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Ward at the Imperial Conference in London, when the attitude of the British Government upon the matter was voiced by Lord Crewe, the Secretary of State for India, who, while admit ting the right of the Dominions to exclude cheap, competitive labour, of whatever race or colour, made a strong appeal that there should be no bar imposed on coloured peoples, simply as such. He pointed out that, as regards India, any disabilities imposed upon Indians in any part of the British Empire was resented in India by all classes, creeds, and political schools, and that the fact of any such disability being imposed by any Dominion furnishes a powerful weapon to those in India who are opposed to British rule, and who are directing all their energies to secure the secession of India from the Empire. The King's assent to the New Zealand Bill was withheld, and the measure lapsed. There are thus three occasions upon which this question has arisen, and upon two of them - one in which direct legislation was passed by this Parliament, and another in which similar legislation was enacted by the New Zealand Parliament, the King's assent was refused. In the third case the expressions of opinion by the representatives of the Imperial  Government were such that the Dominion representatives withdrew the resolution altogether. I have no desire to labour this question by dealing with it at greater length.. I am perfectly satisfied from the experience of the past that, if this amendment be included in the Bill - the measure must in any circumstances be reserved for the King's assent - that assent will not be given. By inserting the amendment, therefore, honorable members will simply hang up the Bill for an indefinite period, and thus make it impossible for the Government to proceed with the early proclamation of the Act, thereby depriving our seamen of all the advantages which they will ultimately derive from its operation. In these circumstances I have no hesitation in asking honorable members to reject, the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- If the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> be pressed to a division, I shall certainly vote for it, because I am' anxious to maintain in its entirety our White Australia policy. At the same time, I do not wish a single word of mine to give offence to our Allies who helped to defend us. I recognise that, artistically, they are superior to any race in the world. An Eastern people have shown Australians, who are descendants of the British race, how laggard we are,  seeing that within the short space of my own life-time they have learned to build anything from a mere coasting schooner to an up-to-date <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought.</inline> Theirs is an example which we may well follow. But for thirty years I have been returned to Parliament pledged to the policy which I am now advocating. Australians are the only race in the world which, owns a continent. It is our duty to preserve that continent as a heritage for white [ men. Should it unfortunately happen that an Asiatic race must dominate Australia, I hope that it will be dominated by the Chinese. Let me briefly analyze the language used by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain in discussing the proposal to prohibit the introduction of coloured immigrants by drawing a direct colour line. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was indeed a great man, especially from the standpoint of the facility with which he could turn his coat whenever it suited him to do so. He stated that there should be no restriction imposed upon race or colour, and that the natives of India are civilized and are our equals. As far as mere brain capacity is concerned, there is no race in the world which is equal to that of the Brahmins of India. Yet they were considered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> as not fit to be endowed with the franchise. They are subjects of the King, but they have not citizenship rights. We are subjects of the King truly, but we are also citizens in that we have the right to vote for our parliamentary representatives. Until the recent war, Britain did not give her English, Scottish, Irish or Welsh inhabitants the right to vote because of their manhood alone. There was always a property qualification attached to the exercise of the franchise. Yet this great man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who well earned the title of Judas on account of his treachery to the great Gladstone, says that the Indians are civilized. Of course they are, but not a single vote has been given to them. Even the majority of the British people themselves had no vote in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> day. They were not allowed to exercise the franchise until the recent war had taught manners to the aristocrats of England. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> says that the Indians are our fellow subjects. I have a great admiration for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Asquith's  abilities, but he would be a much bigger man if he travelled the world, and realized that under the British flag a greater measure of freedom obtains everywhere else than obtains in the Homeland. </para>

                <para>I am not criticising the attitude which has been adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> I recognise that he has delivered a great speech this afternoon - a speech which may possibly carry conviction to honorable members. But in the course of his remarks he stated that there has not been a' great change in Imperial matters since 1897. I entirely dissent- from that statement. Why, to-day women in England have votes. They may also qualify for the degree of M.D. at Cambridge, although they are not allowed to practise as doctors. In Great Britain the entire system of government has been turned upside down since 1897, and it is well that it has been. In my student days, in London, I can remember only three occasions upon which Chinese were seen in that city. Upon each occasion a crowd followed them down the streets, because they presented such a rare sight. In Australia, however, we may see any number of them. A very valuable report obtained by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Cameron Kingston shows the great disparity which existed between the number of Chinese who touched at Darwin on board vessels, and the number who were upon the same ships when the latter made their return voyage. In my student days I did not see a Iascar in London, but I met many Hindoos and Mahommedans, two of whom were beloved fellow-students of mine and remain my friends at the present time. They were equal in mental ability to any European, but were not thought fit to have a vote in their own country. Subjects, yes ; but little better than slaves ! One of them had graduated in the Middle Temple, and when, years afterwards, I saw him in Calcutta, knowing that he had been engaged to a relative of the Lord Chamberlain of England, I asked him, " How is your sweetheart?" he replied, "You had better say ' wife ' now." I asked, " Is she here <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> He rose, to his splendid 6 feet of height, and said, "Maloney, you do not think I would ask my wife to live in India ?" I said, " Why not?" " I will tell you," he replied. " We are old friends, and you know how I am entitled in my own right to large revenues and a high position in this country; but I do not care to ask my wife to live in India because ladies who would willingly dance with me in London pass me like dirt when they come out here married to some petty official. I could not allow my wife to be treated in that way. I am going to dear old England to live there." Here was an Indian gentleman, drawing large revenues, speaking of England as "dear old England," and going to live there because he could not live with his wife in India. The men of India may not be slaves, they may be subjects, but they are not citizens, because not one of the 350,000,000 inhabitants of that country possesses a vote. Yet we have the Asquiths and the Chamberlains of England speaking in the way I have indicated. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George says that India is very sensitive to colour. Another great gentleman - in his own opinion - an Anglo-Indian, said to me he wished another rebellion would take place in India so that he could make the people of Bombay walk in the road and not on the footpaths, which so many of them, as large property-owners in the city, are taxed to make and maintain. If these prominent English gentlemen to whom I have referred would only go to India. or come to Australia, or even go to California, where the racial fight is even more acute than it, has ever been here they would not refer so glibly to " fellow subjects." Yes, fellow subjects, but with no right of citizenship! As it is, I could well understand them refusing to pass this Bill if this proposed new clause was inserted in it, but with the future union of the British-speaking races - because I recognise that if we can only shake hands with the great Union that dominates the American continent we can hold and keep the peace we so desire - we shall be able to apply to our coastal trade whatever restrictions we choose to impose. If the King's assent is to be continually withheld from measures which voice Australia's needs, other representations must be made to  His  Majesty that may not be desirable to a small body of men in London, who, no matter how mentally gifted they may be, have never gone beyond the boundaries of the United Kingdom, except, perhaps, for a few excursions across the Channel to one or other of those charming European nationalities, so close at hand to them. If  His  Majesty would send out Commissioners to every corner of the Empire to gain wide experience on the spot, and learn the needs of the people, the advice they could give him would be much wiser than that which he now receives from the gentlemen whom I have mentioned. However, after the declaration of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> it is hopeless to expect the Committee to agree to the proposed new clause. I quite recognise from the Minister's speech that any shipping company which takes advantage of our inter-State traffic must pay to its men the same rates of wages as are paid to white crews. </para>

                        <para>- That being the case we have pretty well obtained all we desire to achieve by the proposed new clause. If the sugar-cane growers of Queensland had been obliged to pay to the kanakas the same wages as were paid to white men. and to work them for the same hours, and give them the same food, they would not have employed them. It was the cheapness of the black labour that caused the growers to import kanakas to work in their cane-fields, and to fight so hard to retain them. I shall vote for the proposed new clause if it is taken to a division, but I recognise that while we are portion of the Empire the Minister could hardly take up any other attitude. </para>

                <para class="block">This will have the effect of reducing the amount of coal handled by a fireman or trimmer from 3½ tons to 3 tons per diem. This is a very controversial question, upon which the seamen's representatives endeavoured to come to some arrangement with the Minister, but without success. For a considerable time the seamen's representatives have been endeavouring to have the amount reduced. Some people believe, apparently, that all a fireman has to do is to shovel coal into the furnace and close the doors again, whereas the work has to be done in such a way as to prevent the fire from being smothered and to extract the greatest heat possible from the amount of coal consumed. The accessibility of bunkers to the furnaces is an important factor in determining the amount of coal which any fireman or trimmer can handle in a day. Very often in a new ship trouble is made because the firemen and trimmers cannot get the most satisfactory results from the furnaces. There is just as much skill in this work as in many other callings, and some firemen are highly skilled. As far back as 1911, when the Navigation Act was under consideration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie endeavoured to secure a reduction in the schedule, and the motion submitted by him would probably have been carried but for the promise of the Government to attend to certain matters. </para>
                <para class="block">It is just as well that the claims of the men should be again placed on record - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The present schedule provides for 3i tons per day per man, and we are of the opinion that the amount is too much. The Manning Committee of the British Board of Trade some years ago recommended that " 3 tons of coal per man per day should be the allowance for this purpose in temperate climates, and 2½ tons in tropical waters." A great proportion of the Australian trade is confined to the tropics, but we are not asking for any distinction between tropics and the temperate zones, as far as the consumption of coal is concerned. But we do think that, when the Board of Trade Manning Committee recommends a less amount of coal per day in British ships than is provided for in the present schedule, the Australian fireman should not be put on a different and worse footing than his fellow fireman in a British ship. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting statements made by the representatives of the seamen, based on the report of the Manning Committee of the British Board of Trade. Reference to pages 1017-1019 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 1911 will show that the seamen unsuccessfully tried in that year to have the consumption of coal per man per day reduced to 3 tons, and the report of the Manning Committee of the British Board of Trade is also referred to in the same pages. But since that date the world has advanced considerably, and if at that time the proposition, although not accepted, was recognised as fair, surely, having regard to the improvement in the conditions of all workers during the last nine years, the firemen are now entitled to a little consideration. </para>

                <para class="block">Under the foregoing Norwegian scale a vessel consuming  42  tons of coal per day would be manned with twelve firemen and four trimmers while engaged in temperate climates, and in the tropics it would have to carry fourteen firemen and four trimmers, whilst an Australian vessel under the present scale would -be compelled to .carry only twelve firemen and trimmers combined, whether in the tropics or otherwise. Of course, those who are opposed to this claim maintain that the Norwegian Act is not as considerate to the seamen as is the Australian Navigation. Act. The seamen themselves, however, declare that the conditions of the Norwegian firemen and trimmers are much better than are provided for in the Australian legislation. This question has been discussed with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who is disinclined to agree to the amendment. If the seamen were asking for conditions that did not obtain elsewhere we might expect a rebuff, but, having regard to the fact that in all countries greater consideration has been given to the firemen and trimmers, and that nine years ago this concession was nearly made by this Parliament, the conditions should be improved in conformity with' the betterment of conditions that has taken place in every other calling. The Seamen's Union is of opinion that its members should not be called upon to work under conditions that are worse than those obtaining in other countries. We claim to have set up a standard for Australian seamen that is higher than the standards of other countries ; the workers do not admit that claim, but this Parliament ought to take whatever steps are necessary to justify it. </para>

                    <para>. -  I ask the Committee to reject the amendment. This is one of the questions which the representatives of the seamen, discussed with me quite amicably. I decided that it was inadvisable to make the proposed amendment, but I left the seamen to take steps to  te3t  the feeling of Parliament in the matter. Of all questions which exercised the mind of the Committee which has investigated the whole subject of navigation, and upon whose report this Bill is largely based, that of stokehold management occupied more time and consideration than any other. The chief difficulty in the way of fixing a fair standard for work for firemen is complicated by the well-known fact that a great deal depends on the construction of the ship as to whether the task of handling three and a half tons of coal per man per day is too great or too small. In some ships the shifting of three and a half tons per day would be almost a herculean task, on other ships it would be very easy. </para>

                        <para>- In an average ship, a man enjoying his full health and strength and capable of doing a good day's work, would not have to exert himself very much to shift three and a half tons of coal per day. But in some circumstances the task would be too great. The Navigation Committee recognised that fact and made certain recommendations which have been embodied in the Act.

                        <para>-  I think that the word " less " should come out of that.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GREENE.</inline> - That provision was inserted in the principal Act by the Government of which the honorable member was a member. That principle was decided upon because it was practically impossible to arrive at a standard which would be fair under all circumstances. The Minister has power to set up tribunals to decide the question with regard to any particular ship concerning which a complaint has been made with regard to the number of men in the stokehold. I believe the method will be found entirely satisfactory for dealing with the question. If we were to make it 3 tons as suggested it would be found that on some ships the quantity would be considered too large. I have been supplied with some particulars concerning fifty-seven ships now trading on the Australian coast which bears out what I have just stated. The figures relate to the vessels of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, Australian Steamships Limited, Huddart, Parker Limited, Melbourne Steam-ship Company, James Paterson, and the Australian United Steam-ship Navigation Company Limited. Of course, there are seventeen handling under 3 tons per man, six handling over3½ tons, nineteen handling under 3½, but not exceeding 3¼ tons, and fifteen handling over 3¼, but not exceeding3½ tons. It will be seen, therefore, that of the total number of ships there are to-day only six exceeding the maximum set out in the Act. There are seventeen vessels which at the present time are handling less than the quantity the seamen ask to be included in the Act. There are two things happening to-day. The ship-owners are taking3½ tons as if it were the law of the Medes and the Persians, and saying that they are not going to agree to any alterations, because there is power to make an alteration in the case of certain ships. On the other hand, the seamen are saying that they will not man the ships if the firemen are called upon to handle more than 3 tons. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say; but I believe the arrangements' in the bunkers are such that the men can handle a greater quantity of coal with the same amount of labour and effort. Of course, this is a question which, when once the Act is proclaimed, can be dealt with by a tribunal. At the conferences I have had with the ship-owners and seamen I have offered to at once proceed with the appointment of a tribunal to deal with individual ships, and, although the decisions of a tribunal will not have the force of law, they should be just as effective if both parties agree to accept the terms decided upon. Up to the present, however, that offer has not been accepted, but I am making it again, and am giving a definite assurance to proceed at once to utilize the machinery which we have at our disposal for establishing a tribunal. </para>

At all events, I am making the offer again, because I feel sure that whatever standard were adopted we should have some measure of give and take, as it would be impracticable to have a binding scale for every type of ship. Until the measure has had a fair trial, I consider it undesirable to make any amendment in the direction indicated, because I think it will bo found, in practice, that the procedure I have suggested will be the means of working equitably. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment. </para>

The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> quoted the practice in other countries, and showed that on some vessels of other nationalities a much smaller quantity is handled. The firemen and trimmers have exceptionally hard work to perform under trying circumstances, and, in addition to handling coal, the firemen have to keep up steam. The Minister has suggested that there should be some give and take, and it appears to me that the shipowners do all the taking. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the proposal did affect that number that is no reason why it should be rejected. I understand that quite a number of ships have been tied up because there has been a dispute as to the quantity of coal to be handled. The number of ships on which the men are called upon to handle a lesser quantity is certainly small, and it is quite possible that they may be inconvenient to work. It is more than likely that the men who are handling the smaller quantity are working harder than those who are handling a larger tonnage. I have seen men emerging from the stokehold tired and pale-faced, and in some instances almost human wrecks. Seeing that it is a most undesirable and arduous occupation, I think the Minister would be justified in acceding to the demands of the men. What is the position when a vote is taken on such an amendment as this ? The division bells ring, and honorable members supporting the Government enter the chamber and occupy the same side as Ministers. They have not heard the arguments on which the division is being taken. </para>

                        <para>- I know it does, and, unfortunately for the seamen, we are in a minority. Had the Labour party been in power I am sure we would have granted the seamen's request in this instance, because all over the civilized world labour conditions have been considerably improved during recent years. During the war period, firemen, in particular, were subjected to all kinds of dangers from submarines, and there was never an instance where they left their work. They stuck to their job. They ran the blockade and carried our troops. Now that the war is over all that they ask is that they shall be brought into line in this respect with their fellow firemen in other parts. They say that this amendment is vital to industrial peace, so far as seafaring men are concerned, and, therefore, of the utmost importance to the commerce of the country, yet the Minister will not agree to it. The shipowners would not be seriously affected by it. Firemen are not the white slaves that they used to be, and I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to concede this request on the part of the union. I hope that Ministerial supporters will show that they have some humane feeling by voting for the proposed new clause. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> in dealing with my proposed new clause, laid stress on the (point that it was not so much the weight of coal as the question of the accessibility of the bunkers that had to be considered. The quantity of coal which the men have to handle is, in my opinion, the all-important consideration. I wish to emphasize that point. I do not know whether many honorable members have had much experience of the handling of coal, but I have read some sensational statements as to the heavy work done by firemen on American ships. This matter was threshed out by Congress. The Americans have the reputation of being great "hustlers," and Congress has found it necessary to ameliorate very considerably the conditions of firemen. As the result of careful investigation it took action in that direction. Honorable . members have not had an opportunity to inquire into this question, and many are prepared to leave it to the judgment of practical <inline font-style="italic">men,</inline> who guide the Government in regard to these questions. I have nothing to say of those experts except that they are not at present working as firemen, and apparently are unable to appreciate the average fireman'spoint of view. I repeat that the weight of coal handled per day governs the situation more largely than does anything else, and I hope that honorable members in coming to a decision on this question will not be influenced by what has been said by the Minister as to the accessibility or otherwise of the coal bunkers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and he has too often been rated as chips. It was fortunate there was on board the <inline font-style="italic">John Murray,</inline> when that vessel was wrecked, a qualified ship's carpenter, who was able to repair the boats, and so enabled the crew to be saved. The position would -be serious if, in the event of an accident to a ship, there was not on board a shipwright who could repair a boat, or make a raft, or who did not know the vessel from stem to stern. I do not object to the further provision in the clause that persons rated as shipwrights or ships' carpenters " before the commencement of this division, shall continue to be entitled to be so rated." That provision is in keeping with a section in the Coal Mines Regulation Act under which certificates were issued to men who, at the time of the passing of the Act, were at work in the mines, so that they might continue in their employment. I do not  wish  to impose any hardship on those now employed as shipwrights or ships' carpenters, but we should el] act that, after the coming, into operation of this Act, no seaman shall be rated as a shipwright or ship's carpenter who has not served an apprenticeship as a shipwright. </para>

                    <para>.- The question, which the honorable member's amendment involves, has been threshed out time after time in this House. It really arises from a squabble between the Shipwrights Union and the Snips' Carpenters Union. The Shipwrights belong to the Shipwrights Union, and the Ships' Carpenters to the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners. The shipwrights have tried by one means and another to prevent ships' carpenters being employed on our coast. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference. The shipwright, I understand, is a man who has served an apprenticeship in the actual building of steel ships. The ship's carpenter is gradually passing away, as steel ships are entirely replacing the wooden ships. Nevertheless, quite a number of men employed on our coast have served their time as ships' carpenters, and they are ships' carpenters. </para>

                    <para>.- Since we dealt with this matter on a previous occasion, a deputation of shipwrights waited upon the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> and myself in connexion with it. They pointed out that what they desired is that in future only men who have qualified  as  shipwrights shall be appointed to the position of ship's carpenter. They have no desire to secure the discharge of men now engaged as ships' carpenters, but simply that qualified men only shall be engaged in this  position in the future. The honorable member for Newcastle desires to have struck out the words "  or  three years at sea as a ship's carpenter as the case may be," which appear to us to mean that any man who has been  at  sea as a ship's carpenter may, in future, ibc appointed to this position. </para>

No new man, the honorable member will see, can bo so rated. This provision is giving the whole business to the shipwrights in future. </para>

Under the Bill as it stands,  a  shipwright  can  be rated in this position so long  as  he produces his indentures, but a ship's carpenter cannot be so rated unless he has served three years as a ship's carpenter before the proclamation of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- The shipwrights object to that. They say that a man who has had three years' service on a ship is not necessarily a qualified man. He is, in their opinion, in the same position  as  an improver or rough and ready carpenter compared with a man who  has  served his time as  a  carpenter. </para>

                        <para>- I am giving the reasons why clause 13 should be considered on recommittal, in order that we may have an opportunity to secure the employment in this position of only skilled men. If there is a man on board a ship who should be a skilled man it is the ship's carpenter. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> who have had sea-faring experience, will know that in time of danger the man who is looked to is the ship's carpenter. If boats are stove in, the only man who can repair them is the ship's carpenter, and if he be a shipwright he will have had the better experience. I think that the Minister should give us an opportunity to reconsider the clause, so that we might set forth the reasons for the amendment it is desired to move in it. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know whether this amendment will apply to small boats running on the rivers, and not ordinarily used in carrying passengers. On the rivers in New South Wales there are many small boats engaged in carrying butter and other produce, but on holidays they are sometimes engaged by people for picnics. If boats of this character are to come under the Act their owners will be put to considerable expense to comply, for example, with the necessity for providing lifebelts for each passenger. If such a vessel could carry 200 passengers it would not be worth the while of the parties interested to equip her with 200 lifebelts for the purposes of conducting some two or three trips in a year; and, really, there is no considerable factor of danger, as the rivers in which the boats ply are often so narrow that one can practically leap from the deck to the land. </para>

                    <para>. - This provision will not alter the law in so far as it applies to river and bay ships, except that it will enable the Minister to meet special cases where it is necessary for a vessel, to which the provisions of the Act relating to river and bay ships apply, to proceed to sea for various purposes. There are, for example, dredges which take silt out of harbors. These belong to the river and bay class of ship, within the meaning of the Act, and they are not required to comply with the various conditions attaching to ocean-going vessels. The moment they go " outside," however, under the Act, as it stands, they cease to be river and bay ships. The object of the amendment is to enable the Minister to permit such craft, although river and bay ships, to proceed to sea for 3 nautical miles without being compelled to comply with the special conditions such as must be observed by ships proceeding to sea in the ordinary way. Of course, vessels which do not go " outside " at all will not be in any way affected. </para>

                    <para>. - I take it that the officials of the Department would always be careful, before granting permission in such circumstances as the Minister has indicated, to see that proper facilities were provided on board the ship. I hold that all vessels, no matter of what class, should be equipped with efficient life-saving apparatus. That applies not only to craft of the kind indicated by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> - seeing that disastrous collisions may occur in narrow waterways. - but official authority should extend also to river craft, such as one sees at Henley-on- Yarra. Scores of people are crowded dangerously upon a fancily-decked boat, the decorations of which are such that the passengers are practically caged in. Far more adequate provisions for safeguarding life should be insisted upon. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>There are four measures in connexion with the Public Service with which' this Parliament may have to deal. The first, which deals with Public Service arbitration, has already been passed, and is now on the statute-book. The next is the Bill, now before this House, dealing with the management of the Service. The third will be a general amending Bill, which is now being prepared for submission to the House, and which deals with the whole of the existing Act, and proposed amendments to it. The fourth, which we trust will be introduced at no distant date, will deal with superannuation in the Public Service. The Bill, now before the House, relates only to the proposed Board of Management, and is in some measure the outcome of the work done by the Royal Commission recently appointed to report upon the public expenditure of the Commonwealth with a view to effecting economies. Practically only one principle, the substitution of a Board of Management consisting of three persons for the existing Public Service Commissioner, is involved in this Bill. The Board will consist of a Chairman and two other members. One will be appointed for five years, another for four years, and another for three, so far as the first three members are concerned. After that, the proposal is to give each member a definite term not exceeding five years. The idea of rotation is introduced in order to secure continuity in the policy and administration of the Board. </para>

                            <para>- Presumably that will be so. No salary is set out in the Bill, because it originated with the Senate. The salary will be introduced in this House by amendments recommended by an appropriating message. The proposal is to give a salary of £2,000 a year to the  Chairman,  and £1,500 a year to each of the other members. The Chairman's salary will harmonize with that fixed for the Public Service Arbitrator. These two offices will be put, as regards salary, on terms of equality. The members of the Board are to have an assured position, because they will be removable only by joint resolution of both Houses. The Bill does not purport to amend in any way the general provisions of the Public Service Act. We can consider the proposed Board of Management in relation to the powers that now exist under the Act. If the Board is appointed, it will fulfil all those functions with respect to grading, classification, promotion, transfer, and so forth that are now performed by the Public Service Commissioner, but in addition the Board is to be given very important duties which are the direct result of the recommendations of the Economies Commission. Clause 11 defines the added duties to be imposed upon the Board. </para>

This report should be helpful to the House, and keep honorable members continually informed as to the administration of the Departments and the methods on which they are working. The Board is also to be given such other duties in relation to the Public Service as are prescribed. When this Business Board has arrived at a decision upon ' any of the matters above enumerated, the question will arise as to how that decision is to be carried out. The Bill provides that in the first place the Board must make its recommendation report or suggestion to the permanent head of the Department concerned. It will be for him then to consider its application to the Department of which he is head. </para>

                            <para>- Because the honorable member is jumping to conclusions without having read a single line of the Bill, or having the patience to listen while it is explained to him. I venture to predict that before we have finished dealing with it the honorable member will be the strongest supporter of the Bill. It is provided, absolutely and completely, that none of the suggestions or recommendations of the Board can be "'shunted." If neither the Minister nor the head of the Department approves,  Parliament must be made acquainted with the fact. Honorable members will admit that in order to preserve Ministerial control, the ultimate responsibility for every Department must rest with the Minister who has to answer for it, and the machinery of the Bill is designed to provide the procedure and attain the result I have indicated. The question may be raised as to whether the controlling authority should consist of one person or three persons. Different practices prevail in different places. In New South Wales there is a Board of three, in Queensland the work is done by a committee of the Cabinet, and in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia there is one Commissioner, while in New Zealand there is a Commissioner with two Assistant Commissioners. In the Commonwealth, up to the present, we have had one Commissioner, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> now points out that it is necessary to have an Assistant Commissioner owing to the growth of the work. The Commissioner must also be given some added strength, in order to effectively control the Public Service. A Public Service Commissioner is generally called upon to classify and grade the Service, fix rates of salary, and so forth, but the proposed Board will have added duties of a different nature, and of a character not hitherto undertaken by any. Public Ser-. vice administration in the Commonwealth. The idea is that there shall be business management as well as control of the Service, and this, obviously, cannot be obtained by means of one Commissioner this necessitates calling in aid from out- . side in order to bring some additional ability and strength to bear on the general control and the expenditure of the Service. </para>

                            <para>- I shall explain that in due time. At present I wish to give honorable members some figures showing the increase in the number of public servants under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner. In 1903 there were 11,374 permanent officers in the Commonwealth Service, receiving salaries aggregating £1,521,051. On 30th June of this year. the number of permanent servants had increased to 22,817, receiving salaries . aggregating £4,639,859. In addition there are also what are known as exempt and casual officers, who lately average, in number, 11,500. These include, of course, semi-official officers and others appointed from outside, and, taken altogether, there are about 34,000 public servants of all classes scattered throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

There is no reason, seeing that the business side is urgent, why we should not appoint this Board and get it to work as soon, as possible. If, as a. result, the Board could advise us in any way in the amending of the general law, we shall not have made a mistake in its early constitution. I desire to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Public Service of the Commonwealth, which is the subject of a great deal of criticism. We read and hear remarks made about the increasing expenditure, and are asked why we cannot go back to that" of 1913-14. </para>

                            <para>- Or even further- to the days of Adam and Eve. Would those organizations and companies which - criticise the Public Service, and the expenditure in connexion with it, show their own present balance-sheets, and compare them in the same way with' their balance-sheets of 19J3-14? Are those organizations' and; companies paying the same wages* now ' as they did then ? Are they purchasing material at the same prices, and making the same charges for the articles they . pro-' duce? It is only fair that people who indulge in such criticism should apply- the dame methods to the management of their own affairs. However, I do not wish to unduly press that -point now. Ever since the 'establishment of the Federation, ' the Commonwealth Public Service has been carrying put its duties in a, more. efficient manner than they are generally given credit for. I- have had a good many years' experience of the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and I know that it is only when some little difficulty arises that we hear this criticism; when the thousand and one duties are performed efficiently and well, and no  friction is observable, not a word of praise is forthcoming. Many of the men who were in the Service at the beginning .of Federation have now retired, and it is only just to express some gratitude for. what they have done for the country. I speak with some feeling on the matter, because it was my duty, in 1905, to introduce the first measure, for the classification of the whole Public Service.  Up  to that time we had been working under six different systems, all conferring different rights and duties on those concerned, and we had to introduce a series of legislative Acts' affecting the business of the whole of the continent. When we look back, as we can now, with some historical perspective, we can appreciate the comparative smoothness with which, the work has been conducted. When an occasion like this presents itself, it is only fair to express our appreciation. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps Parliament may sometimes, in its rashness, cause. difficulties in this connexion. However; it is a fitting time, when reviewing our Public Service, to place on record the facts that I have mentioned. What was suitable for 1905 is not. suitable for. 1920-21, and it becomes necessary to review the position, in the interests of the public generally, and also of the public servants. The first step we are taking is the appointment of a Board of Management, and in regard to this I refer honorable members to the report of the Economy Commission, Part VIII., page <inline font-style="italic">85,</inline> in order that they may appreciate the motives which actuate the Government. Throughout the war, other business men gave us most useful assistance in connexion with the administration of our public activities, and they deserve the thanks of the country.

                        <para> The outstanding feature in connexion with the conduct of business in those' Federal Government Departments which have been investigated by the Commission to date is the absence of systematic control or check upon the economical working of the Departments. </para>
                        <para>Not only is there no systematic, comprehensive, and continuous check upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments individually by heads of Departments, or as a whole by the Public Service Commissioner, but this duty is not recognised by these officers as a part of their work. </para>
                        <para>This does not necessarily mean, nor is it intended to convey, that all branches of the work of all the Departments is extravagant and inefficient, for we have had the pleasure of investigating some branches which are admirably managed, the work being economically and efficiently conducted in spite of the absence of any satisfactory control over economy and efficiency by the head of the Department and Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>It seems to us that the duty of maintaining such safeguards upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments should be performed by some authority quite independent of the Departments themselves, and as free from the possibility of its powers of healthy criticism being in any way impaired or intimidated, as the Auditor-General is in regard to his checks upon the accurate and honest accounting. </para>
                        <para>This duty should bo performed by a Board of Management for public services, consisting of three persons, whose appointment should be for a term of years, and whose retirement should be on the principle of rotation to insure continuity of policy and with eligibility of ro-appointment. The members of the Board should be partly recruited from persons with outside business experience. It is considered that the conditions in regard to the suspension or dismissal of any member of such Board for incapacity, incompetence, or misbehaviour should be similar to those which apply to the Auditor-General's. </para>
                        <para>It should be the duty of the Board of Management for public services to devise means of measuring the economical efficiency of each and every Department throughout the Commonwealth, and to continually apply these measurements to actual performance. </para>

                            <para>- And upon the Defence side also. I do not commit myself to the statement that these figures cover all the expenditure, but I wish to convey some idea of the magnitude of the expenditure that is connected with the general working of our Public Service Departments. This is part of the area over which the Board of Management will exercise supervision. It will be able to investigate the question whether there is a lack of co-ordination in a Department, an absence of system in the checking of expenditure, an ineffective system connected with the costing of works, or whether any contract for supplies ought to be looked into with a view to improving the position. A lot of this work will be detailed; it will be close investigation work, which will require constant supervision. In many instances it cannot be undertaken by the heads of Departments. Obviously there ought to be some supervision exercised over our expenditure similar to that which is exercised by the Auditor-General over our accounts. The Bill will insure efficiency and economy in our Public Service. That is the reason why we propose to appoint a Board of three members in lieu of a Public Service Commissioner. I have now shortly stated the general purpose of the Bill. Honorable members will recognise that it3 introduction has been rendered, necessary by the growth and development of our Public Service, and by the increased activities of modern government. </para>

It will insure a good deal of increased supervision and checking upon business lines, which was the object underlying the proposal to establish a Postal Commission. I hope that honorable members will assist us to get the measure through Committee as speedily as possible in order that we may get the benefit of the experience and advice which will be at the command of the proposed Board of Management. </para>

                    Higgins has held that he cannot see his way  to  include clubs as employers; but, as the Government were of opinion that they should have no special privileges over any other classes of employers of labour, they made provision in this Bill to include them in the definition of " employer." However, the Senate has omitted from the Bill the paragraph which makes this amendment. The Government cannot see their way to depart from their original intention in this respect.

I could not see my way to do so at the time, although on its merits it seemed to me to be a reasonable proposition in that it enabled members of unions, by signing an agreement, to see regular work ahead of them, and permitted the employer to have all his material ready, and make arrangements beforehand, for starting work on a definite date. Furthermore, the proposal seemed good inasmuch as the terms of any agreement arrived at must be settled according to the terms of an award of the Court. That is to say, the men would only be asked to work under an award of the Court. Whether the provision is constitutional or not, is an open question. It appears to me to be something in the nature of an attempt at industrial legislation, and beyond the powers of this Parliament; but lawyers differ as to our powers in this regard, and there is only one Tribunal which can ultimately give a decision upon the matter. If it decides that legislation upon these lines is within the power of this Parliament we will be given wider industrial power than some of us are now inclined to think we possess. However, seeing that the Senate has now inserted the provision, I am agreeable to its inclusion in the Act. </para></speech>

It was the  president  of the Employers Federation who in the Senate moved for the insertion of this provision, evidently in an attempt to smash trade unionism in the easiest possible way, by practically compelling the weak-kneed individuals in trade organizations to sign agreements. Employers have in former times secured men for wages lower than have been specified. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to say a few words in opposition to the acceptance of this proposed new clause. I happened to be in another place when this question came before that Chamber, and I noticed, with some interest, that the representatives of the Government there sturdily opposed the proposition that is now before the Committee'. They opposed it consistently with the attitude taken up by the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> who, when the Bill was before honorable members before, could not see his way to accept it at the instance of the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> I do not criticise the Government merely on the ground that they change their mind even though they have done so in  so brief a time as on this occasion; and especially when they make such frequent and such grave mistakes. I am opposed to the acceptance of this amendment, because of its demerits. Everybody knows that the right of an organization to make rules for its members is the right which every individual in this community enjoys to make contracts, free contracts, with other members of the community for the regulation of conduct and for their mutual welfare.' The rules of an organization represent the contract made by its members for their own protection; and they are accepted as the result of deliberation as to what is best to be done, in their own interests, in governing the conduct of its members. This proposal is of very grave importance, because it seeks to limit, in a very arbitrary way, the right of members of an organization to make rules for their own protection amongst themselves. And in a very curious way it overrides the principle, which I always thought was sacred to members on the other side of this chamber, namely, the right of freedom of contract. It may be said, in answer to this, that the Government desire to uphold the right of freedom of contract, and for that reason they have set out to coerce members of organizations who desire to make their rules in a particular way for their own protection. The clause says - </para>

At the very basis of conciliation and arbitration lies the right of members of an organization to make their own rules for their own governance. Of course this amendment has a practical but sinister meaning. </para>

He should not invoke the aid of Parliament to prevent such organization from exercising its undoubted right to make rules for its own members.

                    <para>. -  I am keenly disappointed at the attitude of the Government in accepting this amendment. It is drafted and instigated by one body alone - the Graziers Association of New South Wales - and is aimed directly and solely at the Australian Workers Union. Since 1007 the Australian Workers Union has been working under awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and until quite recently no member was prevented from signing agreements prior to roll-call. But because of the actions of certain pastoralists throughout Australia, who attempted to get an advantage from the men by charging them high prices for their meat, the Australian Workers Union was practically compelled to add a rule to its constitution to prevent members from signing agreements prior to roll-call at the shed. Having signed no prior agreement, the men, on arrival at the shed, were in a position to prevent exploitation by the pastoralists through charges of 6d. to ls. per lb. for meat. In some instances the squatters have positively refused to supply the men with meat, and in one case the men were compelled to send 30 miles for meat. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may accept my assurance that there are; hence the necessity for rule 112 in the Australian Workers Union constitution. This year, for the first time in the history of the industry, the agreement made between the Graziers Association, and the Pastoralists Unions of the different States and the Australian Workers Union included a fixed price for meat, with the result that, no matter where a member contracts to shear, he knows before he goes to the station what price he will pay for his meat. On four occasions during the last five years we endeavoured to induce the Pastoralists Unions and the Graziers Associations to come to an agreement as to the price of meat, but not until this year was a satisfactory arrangement made. Immediately that agreement was signed the Australian Workers Union agreed to suspend the operation of rule 112, and this year members of the union are making their arrangements prior to going to the sheds. If this amendment, which is instigated by the Graziers Association of New South Wales, and is aimed at the Australian Workers Union, is brought into operation the shearers will be compelled to pay - if the union will allow them to do so - any price for meat that the pastoralists themselves may fix. They will thus be completely at the mercy of the dishonest squatters of whom, unfortunately, there are quite a number. </para>

                <para>This proposal is not new. In 1917 the present Government were approached by the Graziers Association of New South Wales, and again in 1919 by the secretary of that organization. When this amendment was moved during the course of the Bill's progress through this House, the Minister in charge refused to accept it, but apparently sufficient pressure was brought to bear to induce the Government to accept the amendment when it was proposed in another place. Honorable members should not allow an organization of employers to use this Legislature for the purpose of getting amendments made to the Act, in order to hit at certain members of the Australian Workers Union. I hope that the Committee will refuse to accept the amendment, because, notwithstanding what may be said by honorable members opposite, there is no union covered by an award of the Arbitration Court, other than the Australian Workers Union, which the amendment will affect. </para>

Then its members will be in exactly the same position as they were when the union was forced by dishonest squatters to prevent its members from signing any agreement until they had arrived at the station and found that the conditions were satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- The Australian Workers Union is at present working under an award, and will continue to do so as long as Parliament allows it. But if the Government are determined to compel us to rescind rule 112 they will be taking one further step towards driving the Australian Workers Union from the Arbitration Court. The organization has been working under an award since 1907. No union has availed itself of the Court more than has the Australian Workers Union, and none has so faithfully and loyally abided by awards. </para>

                <para>Commonwealth Arbitration Act. - Proposed Amendment re. Signing Shearing Agreements beforeroll-call. </para>
                <para>In December last, the writer, by direction of the executive, laid before you in Melbourne particulars of a proposal for amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act to enable graziers to make binding shearing engagements prior to the arrival of the men on the stations. The necessity for the amendment of the Act is brought about by the action of the Australian Workers Union in adopting a rule imposing a penalty of £2 upon each member who enters into a signed agreement prior to roll-call. It has already been pointed out that it has been customary in the industry for very many years to sign agreements some considerable time before commencement of work, as it is only by such means that binding contracts can be made and the employer on the one hand be enabled to definitely arrange his shearing operations, and the employee on the other hand to be definitely assured of engagement prior to travelling long distances for the purpose of securing employment. As an award of the Commonwealth Court is in operation providing more favorable terms for employees than have previously prevailed, it is inequitable that the union and employees should, by the use of the rule in question, be placed  in the position of being able, while taking full advantage of the award, by force of the employer's necessity, to also demand additional concessions on arrival at the station. The rule can only exist for this purpose, and has already had the effect in this State of enabling members to demand in some cases increased rates of payment, in others adult wages for boys; and in other cases various concessions. The fact that general trouble has not yet arisen is no argument for the maintenance of such an unjust rule, which is disadvantageous alike to employer and employee, and which is also diametrically opposed to the spirit of the Arbitration Act. All means other than an alteration of the Act have been exhausted endeavouring to secure the withdrawal of this rule. A conference with the Australian Workers Union has proved unavailing, the Arbitration Court has held that the rule is not at present contrary to law, and although many employees have ignored the rule they have been penalized by the union and prevented from entering into signed agreements prior to roll-call. </para>
                <para>In December last, when I placed the position before you and before many members of Parliament, each member agreed that the union should be prevented from maintaining the objectionable rule in question. You, however, stated that your Government could not so late in the session introduce a debatable clause in the amending Act, and in addition raised doubt as to whether the proposal could constitutionally be enacted. The question was submitted to eminent counsel, and the attached opinion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adrian</inline> Knox,KC. (copy of which has been previously sent you), indicates that there are apparently constitutional difficulties in the way of adopting this association's proposal </para>
                <para>In view of the above, I have, by direction of my executive, again to ask that the proposal should be incorporated as an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act at the earliest possible date, in order to avoid industrial difficulty in the pastoral industry. </para>
                <para>The suggested amendment is as follows: - " The rules of an organization registered under this Act and the officials of such an organization shall not during the currency of an award in the industry concerned prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements in accordance with such award at any time prior to the commencement of service." </para>

                    1918.
                </para>
                <para>In my opinion, it is within the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution to prescribe the conditions under which associations or bodies of persons may become and remain organizations for the purposes indicated in that Act are themselves within the powers of the Parliament. On this ground I am of opinion that section 55 (2) of the Act prescribing the conditions to be complied with by associations applying for registration as organizations is within the powers of the Parliament, and it appears to me that the High Court so decided in the Jumbunna case - 6 C.S.R.. at pp. 340 and 347 perCJ. and Barton, <inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> If this be so, I see no reason why Parliament should not have power to prescribe that no organization shall be registered or continue to be registered, the rules of which contain any provision hindering its members from entering into agreements in accordance with the terms of an existing award. Moreover, it seems to me to be involved in the decision above referred to, even if not expressly decided in that case, that section 9 of the Act is within the powers of the Parliament. If this be so, I can see no substantial reason why it should not be equally within the power of Parliament to prescribe that no member of an organization should be subjected to any penalty of any kind by reason of his having entered into an agreement with an employer before commencing work provided such agreement conformed to the terms of any existing award. </para>
                <para>I think that Parliament might also prescribe that the rules of the organization should contain provision forbidding any official of the organization from hindering or preventing a member from entering into any agreement in conformity with any existing award. 2 and 3. The proposed amendment could not be effectively introduced by statutory rule, because as the Act stands at present the power to prescribe conditions by rules only extends to associations applying to be registered as organizations - Section 55 (2). </para>

It is really an amendment from the Graziers Association, and is intended to apply solely to the Australian Workers Union. As  president  of that union, I could not recommend it to remain registered under the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration if such a provision was inserted in the Bill. There is no necessity for it, so long as the pastoralists of Australia are prepared to do the fair thing in regard to the supply of meat. If they will only do what they have done this year, there is not likely to be any trouble. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and in relation to station hands only. While a Board of Reference could fix the price of meat for our members we have hot been able to come to an arrangement with the pastoralists and graziers. We are, therefore, compelled to prevent any member of our organization from signing on until he knows what rates of pay he is to receive for shearing and what he is to be charged for meat. </para>

                        <para>- We have had a good illustration this year of the solidarity of the Australian Workers Union. In Western Australia and Tasmania we entered into an agreement with the pastoralists, and in Queensland we have a State award, which leaves only South. Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. We have entered into an arrangement with the pastoralists of South Australia and the West Darling district of New South Wales, and southwestern Riverina in Victoria, leaving only a small portion of New South Wales where they refuse to concede a forty-four hour week. A strike occurred, and approximately forty sheds out of many thousands worked on the forty-eight hours system. </para>

                <para>The Australian Workers Union has already proved its solidarity and strength, and if it is desired by this Government - I am not making a threat - to make our position such that we cannot remain a registered organization, well and good. We are prepared to get out, and discard the Arbitration. Court altogether, depending upon conferences or direct action to protect our interests. That is the position. With the much -desired resignation - on the part of some- of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and the appointment of another gentleman, who considers £3 a week sufficient for a single man, it would appear to be impossible for the Australian Workers Union to remain a registered organization. </para>

I listened to the honorable member with considerable interest, because it is most refreshing to hear a man who understands what he is talking about. It happens so rarely in this place that I was glad I was present when the honorable member was speaking. But while I listened with great interest  to what he had to say, he failed to convince me that this amendment would injure or menace his organization. I am sorry the Senate inserted the amendment; but it did, and, of course, against the wishes of the Government. </para>

                <para>The honorable member has told us in effect that unless we are prepared to do as he wishes, he will recommend (his organization to withdraw from the Arbitration Court, and to resort to those other methods - conferences and direct action - the first of which is only mentioned for the purpose of effectively setting out the other. The honorable member has said that that is not a threat. What is it, if it is not a threat? It is a threat, because he followed it up by giving an instance of the tremendous strength of the organization, which we all know perfectly well. If I thought for a moment that this amendment aimed a blow at unionism generally, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> said, or that it aimed a blow at the Australian Workers Union in particular, as the honorable member for Darling said, I would not vote for it under any circumstances. </para>

                <para> The honorable member for Darling said, " The Senate's amendment is a blow aimed at the Australian Workers Union, and such a blow, that, if it is insisted upon, I shall be compelled to recommend my union to withdraw from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court." That is a very improper statement to make. It is the more improper because of the flimsiness of the pretext. The position has been outlined by the honorable member himself. He says that the Australian Workers Union members can now sign on before they go to a shed, and that this has been made possible because the pastoralists now have agreed to charge a reasonable price for meat. He could hardly expect the Committee and the country to accept that as a sufficient reason for the union's tame acceptance of a principle which the honorable gentleman  ha6  just declared menaces its very existence. I remember that the Australian Workers Union took up the same position that it does now when the price of meat never came into consideration. I speak of what occurred in a very large number of sheds in New South Wales which I visited in my capacity as a political and industrial organizer. I never heard the price of meat given out as a reason why the hands should not sign on before they went to a shed. I freely admit that if the pastoralists were using this system of making agreements, beforehand, as a means to get behind the award and defeat its real object, the position would be very serious, and that if I were a member of the Australian Workers Union I should not be inclined to countenance it for a day. I do not wish any one to be under a misapprehension as to what I should do in such circumstances. But the honorable member for Darling knows perfectly well that he has not set out his case completely. He does not tell the Committee that in very many cases it is true, as alleged in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allen's</inline> letter, that there- are extremists in his organization who have gone to sheds and, by  threats of a strike, have compelled the employer to concede terms and conditions outside the award. He has not said that extremists in his organization have torn the award into tatters, and have said to a station-owner, " We will not start for you unless you are prepared to give us higher rates and better conditions than those prescribed in the award." If we take the honorable member's own statement of his case, and the facts as we know them - and the honorable member cannot deny that what 1 say is true - we find that in very many cases the men have used the power and strength of their organization - certainly not at the behest of that organization - as a shield behind which to tear up an award and resort to direct action. Every one knows that they have done so. </para>
                <para class="block">It is proposed by the Senate's amendment that, in order 'that the pastoralist may know where he is, and make his arrangements, as he must do, beforehand, he should be able to make binding contracts with the men, and so fill up his board. The honorable member for Darling says that that is so serious a blow at the Australian Workers Union that if it is persisted in that organization will have to withdraw from the Court. In almost the same breath he tells us that the members of his organization are at the present time working under such an arrangement, and explains that by saying, " We now have the price of meat fixed." It is absurd to expect those honorable members who have had some experience of unions, and particularly of the Australian Workers Union, to believe that that union would be satisfied, and is satisfied, to go on suspending the rule to  which this proposal relates, provided its members get an assurance that the price of meat shall be as fixed. The honorable member knows perfectly well that in very many cases members of an organization - not once with the authority of the union concerned - have held up by the pistol of direct action the pastoralists in different parts of the country. That is not fair. The honorable member says that this amendment was moved in the Senate at the instigation of the Pastoralists and Graziers Associations. </para>

                </continue><para>The honorable member for Darling said a great deal about the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the effect of the Senate's amendment. Despite the opinion given by the Chief Justice before he was raised to the Bench, I do not think the amendment is constitutional. In my opinion, it is not constitutional,  for the reason that it does two things : In the first place, it limits the judicial power of. the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. No one denies that, apart from that, he could have made this condition had he chosen to do so. If this amendment is included it will apply to any award he may make. The Court will have no discretionary powers - this amendment is an impairment cf the judicial discretion. Under the Commonwealth Constitution, as I read it, Parliament has no power to do any such thing. It cannot make a law of any sort with regard to industrial matters, but is confined to dealing with certain classes of industrial disputes by means of arbitration and conciliation, and not by direct legislation. That brings me to the second reason why I think the amendment is unconstitutional, and that is i because it is, in effect, an industrial law. As my honorable and learned colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has said, there are opinions on both sides. The High Court alone can say what is the law. </para><para>The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> before the dinner adjournment, dealt with the invasion this amendment made upon the right of bodies and persons to make laws affecting their relations <inline font-style="italic">inter se.</inline> He said that was wrong. But what the amendment really seeks to do is to prevent the union from prohibiting its members, from giving full effect to the award by preventing the pastoral industry from being carried on effectively. The honorable member for Darling said we ought not to allow this Legislature to be used for the purposes of the Graziers and Pastoralists Associations. I admit that; but I do not know that, coming from such a quarter, "that is a reproach calculated to carry very great weight, because I remember very distinctly using this Legislature for the purposes of the Australian Workers Union. That was then considered to be not only permissible, but both moral and proper. I do not think it was proper. I had, however, to do it. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I admit that in practice this amendment will be limited to one organization, but that is really because that one organization is so vast as practically to control all industries connected with the primary producers. The honorable member may correct me if I am wrong, but I think it controls all primary industries with the exception of mining. The honorable member has failed, I think, to convince the Committee that his organization will suffer any wrong, and failed because he admits that, at this  very  moment, members of that organization are working under the very conditions for which the amendment provides. He says that the present agreement will lapse at the end of the year, and that he does riot think it will be renewed, or that another agreement will be made. I do not accept that statement. I think the honorable member will find, as time goes on, that the  pastoralists  will be quite ready to make another agreement. In any case, the honorable member has now a remedy, whereas formerly he had none, 1 and that remedy is contained in this very Bill. Under this amending law the Australian Workers Union can ask for the  variation  of an award. I do not think that it is quite- fair to say that it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' view that he cannot impose such conditions in an award as will insure the men. getting their stores at a reasonable rate. I should not like to say that he can do it; but I am inclined to think that ' if I were in his place I would do it. I think he could very, easily say that he had the power to do it, because the circumstances under which the men work are such that the purpose of an award will be defeated entirely if the pastoralists can extort what price they please for the things which the men must have to eat, and without which they cannot carry on their work. </para>

He says that if it is persisted in the Australian Workers Union will withdraw from the Arbitration Court. On my side, I say that none of these statements" carry much weight, excepting the threat which the honorable member made that, unless we did what he wanted us to do, he would not recommend the organization to continue its registration. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I forget what the particular amendment was, but I know that the honorable member predicted disaster if it was accented. The fact of the matter is that unionism in this country has reached a stage when it is beyond the power of any one to do it any harm. There is only one quarter from which danger can come to unionism, and that is from within. It cannot be hurt from without. Honorable members know that very well. A great union like the Australian Workers Union should welcome this amendment, because it should serve to preserve something like discipline. It would enable the union to deal with bands of Industrial Workers of the World who get into it, and, under cover of its broad wing, strive to bring it into disrepute. Discipline is wanted in the Australian Workers Union, and for that reason this amendment should not be regarded as a bad thing, although I can quite understand that the honorable member for Darling feels it to be his duty to speak against it. The attitude of the Government is that we regret that the amendment has been made. But we have already disagreed with one of the Senate's amendments, and we feel that on the whole the interests of industrial peace will be best served by accepting this" amendment, and so allowing the Bill to become law. </para>

If a remedy comes from no other quarter, the -Government will supply it. </para></speech>

A similar amendment was defeated in this Chamber, and, subsequently, was carried in another place. The right honorable gentleman gives that as one reason why the Government should accept it. Has it come to this now, that another place in which there is only one member, opposed to the Government is going to be permitted to dictate the legislation of this country, and the Government are prepared to accept that position ? On the face of it, if the right honorable gentleman is a strong man, and it is claimed that he is, he certainly should not accept an amendment of this kind when he does not really believe in it. He has admitted that he has no time for it, and that in his opinion it should never have been included in this Bill, but he goes on to say that rather than risk a crisis with the other Chamber he is prepared to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- No, but are we to understand that they are to rule the Government of this country? The majority of Ministers are members. of the House of Representatives, and is it to be said that, because a couple of Ministers in another place are unable to control the  followers of the Government there, if they insert an obnoxious amendment in a Bill it must be accepted ? That is the position which the Prime Minister has placed before us this evening. The division which took place on this amendment in another place goes to show that it had not the support of even the majority of members of that Chamber. This amendment was carried by a vote of nine " Ayes " to seven " Noes." </para>

                        <para>- There were no pairs recorded. The position, then,, is that nine members in a House of thirty-six have inserted in this Bill a clause, which was rejected in this Chamber, and because they have done so the  Government  is prepared now to accept it notwithstanding the fact that it is admitted that its insertion will not be in the best interests of the measure. That seems to me to be a lamentable position in which to place this House, and I am surprised that the Prime Minister should accept it in the manner he has done. </para>

                <para>The right honorable gentleman says that in his opinion the amendment is unconstitutional. Surely that is another reason why it should be rejected. The  Government.  I hope, do not propose to insert provisions in a Bill which are believed to be unconstitutional. Are we not here for the purpose of passing measures in  accordance  with the Constitution ? </para>

                        <para>-The right honorable gentleman's opinion, as head of the Government, should go a long way. If I were head of the Government, and held the- opinion that a certain provision was unconstitutional,.! should not permit it to be included in a Government measure. Here we have the spectacle of the head of the Government accepting a provision, which was rejected in this Chamber on a previous occasion, and at the same time expressing the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Where are we drifting to if we must accept an amendment of this kind because it has been made in another place? I arn inclined to think, with the honorable member for Darling, that this amendment has been supplied by a body vitally interested in its passage, and that is the Pastoralists Union </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> did not say what was attributed to him by the Prime Minister. He did not say that he would not recommend his union to still continue its registration in the Arbitration Court. What he said was that the present agreement will expire in December of this year, and that with this provision in the law he cannot, as head of the organization, recommend the Australian Workers Union to continue its registration. Why should he say that? Is it not because to do so would be to put him as head of the executive of the organization in the position of asking its members to continue registration after the inclusion in the law of a provision which they have been fighting against for a considerable time, and have only recently succeeded in defeating ? He pointed out that rule 112 of the rulebook of the union was brought into operation quite recently. </para>

                        <para>- They did so only because they have a satisfactory agreement under which they are working. If they secure a mutual agreement with their employers, which covers what they desire, the need not bother about a rule on the subject. But if for any reason the agreement were broken, they would fall back upon their rule, and endeavour to come to some arrangement whereby they could get meat at a fixed price. There could be no exception taken to such procedure, lt is admitted that the amendment applies to only one organization. For years the members of the Australian Workers Union have been fighting to secure a square deal in the matter of meat supplies, but they have been unable to get satisfaction. They found that when individual members had the right to sign independent agreements, they were liable to be charged any price for , meat and goods which the employers cared to demand. As for the Prime Minister's endeavour to disparage my experience of trade unionism, I may tell him that I am a foundation member of one of the biggest unions in Western Australia, and that I hold a certificate attesting that fact. I have been connected with as many unions, probably, as the right honorable gentleman himself ; and I say, definitely, that no union could accept a provision of this character. </para>

                        <para>- With respect to meat supplies, the Judge before whom the matter came up refused to make any provision in his award. In the circumstances, there was nothing to prevent individuals from entering into private agreements ; but, if the practice were permitted, <inline font-style="italic">how</inline> would it be possible to carry on an organization? Where would be the discipline? There must be organization. Every organization must have a head. There must be discipline; there must be unanimity in respect of the practical working of an organization. It is of no use for one body or individual to be working independently of another batch of members. All must pull together, or there will be disaster. Those are hard facts which can be confirmed by reference to any organization official. Honorable members may inquire of any industrial body, and they will learn that individual members cannot be permitted to enter into separate agreements. </para>

                        <para>- But the. only organization which the amendment is hitting at is the Australian Workers Union. My union will have nothing to do. with the Arbitration Act for the very reason that its recognition leads to situations of the kind which is now under discussion. As for the unions which have accepted the Industrial Peace Act - and I am very glad that they have done so - I point out that they do not come under this measure at all. Miners and other big bodies of unionists, are not concerned. This amendment hits at organizations which are registered before the Court. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows very well that that does not apply generally to the organization, and that, as such, it has been loyal to arbitration. The union desires to remain loyal, and it is well for this country, and for the individual interests of pastoralists, who are so anxious over the fate of this amendment, that the Australian Workers Union has remained loyal. Throughout the war its members continued to work, and made the best of their situation, although the cost of living was ever rising. </para>

                        <para>- So it should do. Very often, however, before a rise in wages could be secured the cost of living had gone up out of all proportion to wages. Supposing that the men had taken the bit in their teeth, and had said, " The cost of living has gone up another 20 or 30 per cent. We cannot secure rises in conformity with the increased cost. We will refuse to work until we get a fair thing." They did not take that stand, however, but went about matters in the proper way and secured an agreement. That is entirely to their credit. Because a few individual members of the Committee are pressing for the amendment, why should it be accepted? The effect of its inclusion will be that pastoralists will be free to charge whatever they please for meat and goods. Surely we should protect their employees from such a state of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already stressed, if individual members are to be free to make their own terms, organization will break down. Either that will occur, or a majority of the members of a union will say, " It is time for us to take a determined stand against this kind of thing. We cannot continue upon unconstitutional lines. We shall not permit the minority to enter into separate agreements and ignore the Act and its awards." Procedure such as that is similar to the insidious attacks of white ants in gradually eating away the foundations of a building. </para>

                <para>What are the facts ? The offending clause was rejected by this Committee; yet the Government have permitted nine of the thirty-six members of the Senate - all of them supposed to be supporters of the Government - to dictate policy. The white ants are eating into the ranks of the Government as well as working elsewhere. It appears to me that the Senate is going to control this Parliament and country. It will do so, if the Government are supine, and if we are to be forced to accept its dictation. However, I do not think the Prime Minister accepted the will of the Senate in this matter merely because it was such, or that he was afraid of losing the Bill. I believe the Prime Minister has sufficient power to whip up. the Senate and make it reverse its decision to-morrow, if he desired to do so. Behind the amendment, however, there are certain individual members of this Chamber who are pushing the Government. There is too much of this kind of thing going on to-day. It is not for the good of the country that the Government have not a larger straight-out majority in this Chamber. There are influences at work all the time. Certain individuals are giving conditional support to the Government. They want certain things, and they must be placated. It is very evident that there is an influence at work here to' enforce on the Government the acceptance of the amendment. I am confident that the Prime Minister himself is strongly opposed to the underlying proposition. If his remarks on the subject meant anything at all, it is clear that he has no time for any amendment of this nature. But, rather than precipitate a crisis, or run the risk of losing the Bill, he has preferred to be dictated to by nine members of another place. As a matter of fact, I do not really believe that is the case. As I have already said, the acceptance of the amendment is an evidence of the placation of certain members of this Chamber, who are the spokesmen for the pastoralists. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think even the honorable member believes that. I assure him and the Committee generally that the employers prefer to deal with organized rather than with disorganized labour. We have followed the trend of trade unionism here and all over the world, and realize its advantages as well as its disadvantages. I should be sorry to see anything done that would in any way help to destroy trade union organizations in this country, but harm very often results from incomplete legislation. I fail to understand where the objection to so reasonable an amendment comes in. No one has shown where any evil could result from it. Look at all the legislation that has been passed year after year for the last twenty years with a view to building up trade union organizations. We quite understand their advantages, and, if I were working for a daily wage, I would be one of the first to join a union, in order that we might fight as an organized body. But there are some things done by many of these organizations to which I would very strenuously object. I would not put into the hands of a few people absolute power to dominate me during the whole of my work. Does the Leader of the Opposition concur with the message from Sydney on Saturday night calling a stop-work meeting of the seamen ? That is the sort of thing we are going to have here. They talk about industrial legislation and arbitration courts, and industrial peace. Are these the sort of proceedings that we should have ? </para>

                    <para>In my opinion it is within the constitutional powers of the Federal Parliament to enact such a clause, and I am quite clear that it would be upheld as valid by the High Court if passed and its validity challenged. </para>
                    <para>In the Jumbunna case, 6 C.L.B.., p. 309, it was held by all the" then live Judges of the High Court that the constitution empowered the Federal Parliament to enact the sections of the Arbitration Act which regulate the registration of organizations, and in my opinion it was clearly competent for the Parliament to prescribe the conditions for valid registration, including what the rules of the organization should or should not contain with respect to anything connected with the awards or with the industry to which the awards related. </para>
                    <para>Looking at the real substance of clause 5Sb, which must be done when determining its constitutional validity, it does two things: (1) prescribes there shall bo nothing in the rules of an organization registered under the Act to prevent or impede any members of such organization from entering into written agreements during the currency of an award in accordance with its terms before the commencement of service; (2) prohibits the officials of any registered organization from similarly preventing or impeding any such members from entering into any such agreements before the commencement of service. 1 think that both .(1) and (2) are valid and will be upheld; (2) stands or falls on the same principles as would determine the validity of section ti of the Arbitration Act, which I have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> doubt is valid and which was assumed to be valid by all the Judges of the High Court in <inline font-style="italic">Metropolitan Goal Company of Sydney Limited and others</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Goal and Shale Employees Federation,</inline> 24 C.L.B., 85; and (1) stands on a still stronger basis, both because it is something that would have been enacted directly by section 6 and also because it was competent for Parliament to prescribe what the rules of organizations should or should not contain on such a subject matter. </para>

So long as the award itself is being carried out, where can any valid objection be raised by any of the members of the union 3 It will not in any sense affect shearing this season. All the agreements have been fixed up for the present year. The Australian Workers Union have agreed, in their contracts with the Pastoralists Association, to put the principle of the clause into operation, although some little time ago they passed a rule making any member of the Australian Workers Union liable to a fine of £2 for entering into any such agreement. </para>

                        <para>- What I meant to convey was that the Australian Workers Union suspended their rule on the subject for the present season, and permitted their members to sign on. In view of the enormous area over which shearing is conducted, many men must lose heavily who go to a shed and find that there is no board open for them there. Is it fair to those who specially follow this work to insist upon the method of balloting to- decide which men are to be employed ? ls it fair to those who give satisfaction time after time to those who employ them ? Take the case of men who carry out special contracts with the pastoralists to shear their flocks. I know several pastoralists who always engage a certain number of shearers, and these men travel over enormous distances to carry out the engagements which they have entered into months and months ahead. This practice must be to the advantage of the worker - I am talking of the better class men amongst the shearers, who follow this work year after year. If they can enter into definite engagements with contractors, surely it is far better for the industry, the organization, the pastoralists, and themselves ? I cannot see how it can be injurious, either to the organization or to the men. It must tend to get rid of a great deal of the difficulty which must arise if more men offer at a shed than are wanted, and some have to go away empty-handed. It must mean serious loss to them. </para>

                        <para>- I congratulate the honorable member on entering into an agreement of this sort. If representatives on each side who understand the industry get together at a round table conference, and come to an agreement, which goes to the Court and is registered as an agreement under the Arbitration Act, we shall have far better, more binding, and more workable awards than will be made by any Judge of the Court. If they cannot agree on all the points, they can agree on the majority of them, and then get the Judge to give a determination on those in dispute. </para>

                        <para>- They did it in the Kalgoorlie district for many years, and there- was always a splendid feeling between the employers and the employees, but as soon as they began fighting in the Arbitration Court that good feeling disappeared, and the greatest friction began to prevail. I am glad the honorable member believes in the principle of arriving at agreements in this way. It is a much fairer and better method, for the one great reason that the men who frame such agreements know the industry and all the difficulties on both sides. Any agreement entered into by them must be much more workable than an arrangement come to in any other way . The agreement contains quite a number of clauses dealing with the conditions that must be observed. I cannot understand how any pastoralist who endeavours to impose unfair or unjust conditions on any body of men, particularly such an organization as the Australian Workers Union, ever gets his sheep shorn. If a pastoralist played " the dirty game " with an organization of which I was a member, I would soon send out a " round robin " that would cause him difficulty in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I would be quite sure of my ground before I did anything of the sort. The agreement makes special provision with regard to the stores to be supplied, and so forth. These stores need not be bought from the pastoralist unless the men chose; but, if he does supply them, he has to supply them at cost price, plus 10 per cent. In the case of meat, the charge must not exceed the wholesale carcass price in the nearest township. </para>

                <para>There is not the slightest desire to destroy unionism. There are many phases of the Arbitration Act with which I disagree. I should like to see an Act which placed the same obligations on the employees as on the employer, and I have emphasized my objections time after time. I have always believed in arbitration, subject to certain conditions ; but far and away above all other considerations, is a system of fixing up industrial agreements by men who are associated with the particular industry, and who thoroughly understand it. I should be very sorry indeed to do anything that would in any way injure the industrial organizations of the country, because I realize what they have done for the workers in the past. I also believe that, if these matters were dealt with by conscientious men, who were always prepared to see the difficulties on the other side as well as on their own, the conditions of the workers' would be improved, and it would tend to pave the way to better industrial conditions. If representatives go to extremes, . they only injure those they represent, but with men who aim at fairness, justice, and equity for all, trade unionism must be for the benefit of the workers. I am satisfied that I speak for the great majority of honorable members on this side, who are prepared to do all they can to place these organizations on a fair and sound" footing. </para>

It is not merely a matter of protecting the pastoralist; this proposal, even if, as the honorable member for Darling says, it affects only -one union - although the Leader of the Opposition : <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> says, it affects all unions- - - </para>

The amendment is directed to conserve the interests of all the steady men in that organization. I have ' been interested in this particular phase of production ever since I was old enough to walk, and I can assure honorable members that the steady and reliable men, the best shearers, have always desired signed agreements in order that they may have security. As the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> says, these men go to shed after shed, and they desire to be assured of an agreement which binds the pastoralists exactly as it binds themselves. All the talk of the honorable member for Darling about the price of meat seems to me to be beside the mark. We know that for many years there has been difficulty with some graziers about the price of meat, but for the first time in the history of the industry, as the honorable member himself admits, we have an agreement. There is no reason to suppose that the graziers, having found the benefit of an agreement, are . going to burst up the . whole industry over -the price of meat. After all, the price of meat to the shearers means very little. </para>

It is only by mee;ting&gt;on . common ground that we. shall arrive 'atacsatisfac!tory: solution of all the troubles? in'?.' the primary  I  producing industries.This  amendment is really to prevent restless spirits, who are to be found in every union, as everywhere else, holding up a shed simply because there happens to be no agreement. The average shearer does not attempt to do any such thing. He is as decent a man as any other member of the community, but, naturally, in a great nomadic body of men, we find those who are prepared to take advantage of any loophole. If, as I have seen myself, there is no agreement, they will hold up the whole business, and, possibly, put the grazier to endless expense. A grazier will sometimes have his sheep ready mustered, and all his arrangements made at considerable cost, only to find them upset. </para>

                <para>It has been said by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that if members of the unions are allowed to make an agreement trouble will result, because it is impossible for any award or agreement to cover all requirements. Certainly that is impossible, but the main thing is to remove the chief cause of the trouble, and allow those concerned to come to a mutual agreement on the minor matters. No man . will claim that all the little exigencies can be met by any agreement, but it is a matter of working in harmony, and I believe that if this clause is inserted in the Bill there will be a much better spirit in the industry than at present. Eighteen years ago, in the State Parliament of New South Wales, I supported the Shearers' Accommodation Act, because there were-, odd pastoralists who made conditions extremely difficult for the shearers. So; such men' 'would make it difficult to-day but for the Shearers Union. The Australian Workers Union is powerful enough to protect itself in every way, and none of us has any desire to destroy it, but desire a common meeting ground such as an agreement of this kind would give. The amendment gives security to a great body of honest men, who, year by year, follow the sheds in order to make sufficient to maintain their families, and, possibly, build up homes for themselves in the future. The amendment would have a twofold effect; it would secure stability, to a certain degree, in the greatest wealth-producing industry in Australia, and protect the better section of the men who carry it on. </para>

                        <para>- These legal luminaries point out that the proposal is not unconstitutional. The best legal talent in the Attorney-General's Department affirms that it is, as does also the Prime Minister himself. The other branch of the Legislature, in the interests of the shearers themselves, professes a desire that its  amendment should be adopted. But what is the position? Out of thirty-six members of the Senate only nine voted in favour of the proposal, whilst seven voted against it. Yet the Government now say that we ought to accept it rather than precipitate a crisis with the other branch of the Parliament. What is all the trouble about? Surely the shearers themselves know what they want. Their organization desires that a certain measure of protection shall be extended to it. If we concede the right of any individual member of it to sign an agreement with his employer, wo shall entirely cut away the awards which have been gained by that organization. If once this principle be adopted, every award made by the Arbitration Court will be practically nullified. It will mean starting the " white ant " in  unionistic  circles. It will constitute a death-blow to trade unionism. To allow individual members of an organization to sign agreements with employers would be an intolerable position. I never heard the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> so weak as he was when discussing this question to-night. He was palpably arguing against his own convictions. He said that this was not a Government measure but that he would vote for the acceptance of the amendment in order to avoid a crisis, and that Ministerial supporters would be free to vote as they chose. What reasons' have been advanced for the acceptance of the amendment? I was present in the Senate when the proposal was under consideration there, and it was debated almost entirely by pastoralist representatives. If this Committee rejects it, and the Government intimate to the Senate that, in their opinion, it is an unconstitutional proposal, I have no doubt that it will be dropped. Upon the other hand, if it be adopted here, it will aim a blow at unionism, and will certainly not tend to industrial harmony in the future. The Australian Workers  Union has loyally supported the principle of arbitration, even when it has been opposed <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> other organizations. Consequently, it is up to us to support it now. </para>

                    <para>. - The people of South Australia, who- are interested in this matter, feel very strongly upon it. Personally I desire to secure some measure of stability for the pastoral industry, in the interests of the employees as well as of the graziers. It is idle for honorable members opposite to suggest that for years there have been no strikes in the shearing industry. There have been strikes every year, somewhere. South Australia, however, has been exceptionally free from them. The Pastoralists Association, and graziers generally, desire that the right of individual members of the Australian Workers Union to enter into agreements with them shall be continued, because it has been the custom for these men to sign on in the various towns where labour has been picked up, for more than thirty years. Upon many occasions, the unions have forbidden them to sign agreements that they would fulfil the terms of existing awards. What does that mean to the station-owners, and particularly to the old shearers, who have a large circuit, and who have been engaged in shearing' for eight or nine months out of every year? It means that these men will have the privilege of completing their big rounds with as little interruption as possible. If they are forbidden to sign agreements they will have to risk being involved in a cessation of work for a considerable period, because of unreasonable demands being made by a few individuals upon their arrival at a station. I am not here to justify the action of unreasonable pastoralists. If they do not choose to play the game they deserve to  be penalized. But generally speaking the Senate's amendment, if adopted, will be productive of industrial harmony, because it is in the interests of both parties. Some honorable members opposite have hinted that certain things will happen if all their demands are not granted. Surely it is just about time that the industries of this country had a look in. No reasonable man can say that generous attention has not been given by this Parliament, and by the State Parliaments to industrial matters for years past. I hope that we shall not allow these pin pricks, which are administered by men who are lepers in this particular industry, to disturb industrial harmony. Let us have a little bit of peace and some stability for the industry. </para>

The opinion expressed by the latter has since been supported by the opinions of two other eminent K.C.'s. Surely the great woollen industry of this country - the biggest industry that we have - is entitled to some consideration. If the men who represent that industry choose to obtain the opinions of the highest legal talent in the land upon this question, they have a perfect right to do so. I am1 quite certain that the stability of the industry will be promoted by the adoption of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- As has been pointed out by the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> not much difficulty will be experienced in dealing with that question. I know that there are some pastoralists who have no brains, otherwise they would not make trouble on account of an extra 2d. or 3d. per lb. in the price of meat supplied to the shearers. It would pay them better to have the latter start operations in a contented and happy frame of mind. In that case the increased efficiency, which they would obtain, would more than offset a small loss in the price of the meat supplied to their employees. </para>

                    <para>.- An astounding piece of knowledge I have gained to-night is that it is not this Chamber that has the say in matters of importance concerning the administration of the affairs of this country, but that another Chamber governs this House. As a matter of fact, two members of another place govern us in regard to the proposal now under consideration, because the new clause which we are asked to accept was carried in the Senate by a majority of two. There were nine senators in favour of it and seven opposed to it, whereas when the provision was moved by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> in this Chamber only eleven honorable members voted for it while thirty-seven voted against it. I wonder how many of those thirty-seven have changed their opinions. We know that the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has done so, because he has just informed us that he voted against it previously because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran had declared that the proposed clause was unconstitutional, which opinion the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has confirmed to-night. -If the provision is unconstitutional, why should we go through the farce of inserting it in the Act and making this Parliament the laughing-stock of the people when ultimately the section in question comes to be declared by the High Court unconstitutional? Immediately opposition was raised to the Senate's amendment to-day, and mention was made of the Australian Workers Union and certain agreements, the honorable member for Dampier and the honorable member for Wakefield, who have fought so strenuously for the acceptance of the Senate's proposal, interjected that members of the Australian Workers Union are already working under agreements with the pastoralists in regard to the price of meat. But the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> has pointed out that the members of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Australian Workers Union could not get the pastoralists ;to make these agreements until this year, and that they had been obliged to insert' a rule in their constitutions in order to make provision for them. And now it: would seem, when' the first year covered by these agreements is about to expire, that the pastoralists are making use' of the fact that they have been entered into as a lever for having this provision inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. At any rate, it would appear that they have some motive behind their action in consenting to make these agreements for the past twelve months. Perhaps they were looking a few moves ahead, for it is certain that they have mobilized their forces and laid their plans very carefully in order to get this provision into the Act, backed up by their friends, not only in another place, but also in this Chamber. I have had some experience with some of the big squatters of New South Wales, and, in my opinion, once this clause is agreed to the Australian Workers Union will find it very hard to get the price of meat fixed in any future agreements, or the inclusion of any of the other items usually to be found in them, before shearing time. I believe that the provision is directed against this large organization,, and that the signing of agreements before going to shearing sheds will not only prove dangerous to them, but will also prevent the smooth working of the industry in which they are engaged. </para>

                        <para>- But there are clauses in the constitutions of all industrial . unions providing that none of their members shall make individual agreements with employers, and any attempt to cut those clauses out, and make collective bargaining impossible, will be a direct blow at one of the fundamental principles of unionism. In fact, I am satisfied, that this amendment is a deliberate attempt, as one honorable member has put it, to get the " white-anting " process into trade unionism, and drive the organizations into taking direct action. It is certainly a farce to introduce an Industrial Peace Bill with the idea of creating industrial harmony, and then come along a few weeks afterwards with a provision which must fill the country with industrial unrest, because ho trade unions would dare to register under an Arbitration Act which compelled them to take out of their constitutions all provisions preventing their members from signing individual agreements with employers. I agree with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that we have spent about three months of this session in dealing with Bills patching up existing legislation or introducing new proposals for dealing with industrial troubles; but, on the other hand, I hold that each and every one of them is just as likely to create industrial unrest as to bring about industrial harmony, and that is more particularly true in regard to the proposal now under consideration. We are told by the Prime Minister that it is most likely unconstitutional, but rather than lose a Bill which he seems to think is essential to industrial peace he is prepared to allow the policy of the Government to be dictated by two out of the 111 members of the two Chambers. Honorable members here and legal authorities outside claim that the Commonwealth Parliament has ample power to deal with matters that make for industrial unrest other than trouble in connexion with trade unions, and one thing that has brought about considerable unrest and grumblings in this country for the last four years is the depredations of profiteers. </para>

                        <para>- I was merely referring to something that has tended to bring about industrial unrest. It is suggested that we can pass this legislation, although it may be declared to be unconstitutional, yet' evidently nothing can be done in other directions that tend to create industrial unrest, because some one claims that it is unconstitutional for this Parliament to attempt' to do so. According to the Prime Minister,' the Senate's amendment is unconstitutional and cannot be used, even if it is inserted in the Act, but rather than sacrifice the Bill he is prepared to make a fool of himself and of the Bill and the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly. The argument of honorable members who have spoken in favour of the proposal is that it will have no effect on trade unionism. They say, " It is merely nothing ; so let it go." But we know what has been the result of the fight for unionism from its very inception, when a few men organized in other countries and started unions, and when they came to this country and organized so that the membership of unions grew from a few thousands to tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands. They will do nothing except in a collective capacity. An honorable member opposite talked about the tyranny of certain unions over their members. As a matter of fact a member enters a union for co-operation and collective bargaining. There is no doubt that if individuals are allowed to sign contracts, and if any union making a rule prohibiting this course of action is debarred from registration, the Arbitration Court will be absolutely impossible as a means for the settlement of disputes to any trade union in the country. </para>

If there is one line of policy that we as a Parliament should, follow, it is to strengthen the hands of i those in the union who are prepared to abide by the principle of arbitration. By passing the amendment which has been, inserted in another place, we are really, being asked to play into the hands of the extreme section in the union, to . "whom we are handing another weapon with- . which to fight those who are trying to "keep the union within the purview of 'the Arbitration Court.

                        <para>-I see the danger, which, I am sure, has esiJa-ped the notice of the Prime Minister..While this may not now affect members of -unions who do not enter into engagements in the same sense as the  Australian', Workers Union, this amendment if agreed to will open the door to a small section  of unscrupulous employers, who may/under, its protection, force upon unions i that hitherto have not had agreements," Very objectionable conditions indeed. ' -'The Prime Minister, I think, laid - tod . '.jmuieh. stress upon the fact -that -'a/ certain agreement existed' between &gt; the'? pas toralists and the Australian    Workers Union. If this amendment is- passed it is " possible that ' this' agreement will not be renewed.  It may be that the Australian Workers Union 'has been.-able to get a satisfy factory agreement with- Regard to the . price i of meatj-vbecavfeeYc-f- its power to prevent its members signing an agreement. This amendment will take away that power, and so weaken the union in its fight for conditions which may be fair and reasonable. It is not right to say that the whole of the pastoralists, or a majority of them, are unreasonable; but it is a fact that on some stations the conditions imposed upon men, after they have signed agreements, with regard to matters not touched by the award, have been such as to deprive them, in part, of the benefits of the award. It is because of my appreciation of this fact that I am unable to follow the Government in regard to the Senate's amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable members for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Livingston),</inline> and Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> expressed solicitude for the members of the Australian Workers Union, but I may point out that this rule, No. 112, is not an executive rule, passed by a handful of men. For a number of years the treatment of Australian Workers Union members by certain squatters was such as to practically compel our members to demand that the Convention should provide some safeguard. Delegates from all parts of Australia attended the Convention, and it was only after many hundreds of resolutions had been received that this rule was brought into operation. Our men found, after they had signed agreements in Sydney, and went to Cunnamulla, Longreach, Camooweal, or away out on the Oodnadatta line, totally different conditions of working, especially with regard to meat, and so they were compelled to protect themselves against unscrupulous employers. The extra-ordinary feature about this amendment is that the Government do not believe in it. The Prime Minister, who is also Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> does not believe in it, and the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> did not believe in it last week. Whether, since then, he has been converted to a belief in it or not, I do not know, but I do not think he has. I think he is solid enough on law not to be turned aside merely by the quotation of a few legal opinions; for after all, one may buy almost any kind of opinion one chooses. I am prepared to say that, with regard to this particular matter, I could get opinions, contrary to those quoted during, this debate, all over Melbourne, or any other city. These legal opinions do not go for very much. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is quite frank about his attitude. He is working in conjunction with the pastoralists' organization. There is no doubt that the amendment emanates from the pastoralists' organization. There is equally no doubt that it is aimed at one organization alone. It will have far-reaching and important effects, as was shown by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> If by means of this amendment Parliament is to interfere with the rules of organizations registered under the Arbitration Act, those who support the amendment will do more than they intended, namely, to aim a blow at a particular organization. I say to honorable members, many of whom voted against this amendment a few days ago, that they ought to be very careful indeed lest they wreck the whole Act. There is a large number of unions which specifically lay down in their rules that no member shall individually sign an agreement - that members shall not sign any agreement at all. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The Australian Workers Union is the only organization in Australia which provides for individual . agreements, and it is the only organization at which the amendment is aimed. When this amendment was previously before this Committee eleven members voted in favour of it and thirty-seven against it. In another place nine voted for it, and seven against, leaving an affirmative majority of two out of a total membership of thirty-six. What is the reason for this change in the attitude pf the Government, a change that is extraordinary in view of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister to-night? He told us, quite frankly, that he does not believe  in the amendment, and that, in his opinion, it is unconstitutional. He deprecated the idea of any organization attempting to dictate to Parliament as to how it shall legislate. One would deduce from the Prime Minister's demeanour that the influences mentioned by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> are at work, and that they are so strong as to practically control this Chamber and another place. No new evidence has been brought forward in support of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister, after making an extraordinary Yes-No speech, said that, bo far as he was concerned, honorable members  could vote as they thought fit. Apparently he is being very hardly driven. He stated that a similar course had been taken before by the Australian Workers Union. That is not so. The amendments to the Arbitration Act which were introduced, by a Labour Government affected every union and every unionist, but this amendment is aimed at one organization only, and for that reason, if for no other, members of this Committee should think well before voting for such a provision to be inserted in the Act. </para>
