                        <para>- I thought I would draw some of you, as I shall again before I sit down. It is time that the people of Australia saw through the hypocritical guise of certain members of this House, who, while pretending to dissociate themselves from the Government, and to stand  for the. interests of the primary producer, are the very persons who are always ready to save the Government, and to vote against the interests of the primary producers. Is it not always those honorable members who sit on the Corner benches who keep the Government in office? On them the fate of the Ministry depends; without their support the Government could not remain in office for two minutes; </para>

                        <para>- It is a censure directed at the Government, and at every honorable member who votes to keep the Government in office, whether a Ministerialist or a Corner party member; On Saturday last the people of Ballarat in an unmistakable voice, declared that there is no practical difference between the Ministerialist&#39;s and the Corner party members: The- latter may call themselves what they choose, and adopt what tactics they choose; but they like the Ministerialists, are anti-Labour: That party, which entered&#39; the House with a great flourish of trumpets, crying for the restoration of responsible government, is keeping  in power a Ministry which has degraded every tradition of parliamentary history. The War Precautions Act is still in operation. Although the war; to all intents and purposes, finished long ago, regulations are still being issued under the War Precautions Act, and the country is being governed by them without a word or act of protest on the part of those who sit on the Corner benches. What have they done to put an end to this pernicious system of governing by regulation? </para>

                        <para>- Because, under our electoral system, we are compelled to cast preference votes, and being forced to make a choice, we, like sensible, people, choose the lesser of two evils. Politically speaking, the Corner party candidates and Corner party members, are to us an evil, though a little less so than the direct Ministerial supporters and Ministerial candidates: The great Australian Labour movement is always in the lead, and we know that the second preferences of our candidates are never counted. The electoral system adopted is therefore immaterial to us, because our candidates will win. Let me add in passing that the result of the Ballarat by-election may be regarded as the writing on the wall. It presents a forecast of what is in store for honorable members opposite when they go to the people at the nest general election. </para>

                        <para>- The reply made yesterday by the Prime Minister to the charge levelled against the Government in this connexion amounted to nothing but that. He put up his bogy, and did not attempt to defend himself or his Government against the attack of the Leader of the Opposition.  His  reply was merely, &#34;Here is the bogy, beware. Do not charge this Government with anything, because here is the bogy man.&#34; The right honorable gentleman should not forget that the people of Australia are not children, and are not frightened by bogy men any longer. </para>

                        <para>- The people will ask honorable members in the Corner why they approved of the action of the Government in throwing into the wastepaper basket the great charter of liberty which something over 600 years ago was wrung from the trembling King John at Runnymede. That great charter of liberty gave to every British subject the right to a free and open trial by his peers. The Government during the last three or four years have thrown trial by jury into the waste-paper basket, and they are doing the same thing to-day. There is no open trial, no charges are formulated, an accused person is given no opportunity to face his accuser. People are grabbed in the night and taken away from their families and loved ones. They are hustled from one State to another to evade the ordinary operation of the Law Courts of the country. In these circumstances I ask honorable members to say where the great charter of British liberty is to-day. How can the Government continue in office conducting the affairs of the country if honorable members who sit in, the Corner are not prepared to agree to this kind of thing? I ask those honorable members to say whether they stand for it or not. So far as I am personally concerned, I care not whether the crime with which a person is accused be great or small he has a right under our great charter of liberty to demand an open trial, and that he should be faced with his accuser. He has the right to demand an opportunity to defend himself in open Court. Do the Government give people of this country that right? We can refer to a case in connexion with which a supposed inquiry was granted the other day, but when we asked for the production of the evidence taken at that inquiry the Government refused to produce it. We have a statement publicly made by a gentleman of some standing in this country, that at a certain inquiry held in Sydney recently not one word of evidence was given against the person whom the Government held in custody. The whole of the evidence given at that  inquiry  was  in  favour of the accused person. Do honorable members opposite stand for that? I say that it does not matter what crime a man is charged with he has the right to an open and fair trial by his countrymen. I shall be no party to depriving any man of a fair trial.  In  my opinion the vilest criminal in the land has a right to an open and fair trial. In this case, because it suits the political game that the Prime Minister desires to play, certain men are hustled away, and no public statement in regard to the matter is made .by the Government. Not a word is said as to the charge against them ; no opportunity is given them to defend themselves, and they are deliberately denied the privilege of having counsel to appear for them. This is a negation of one of the basic principles of British liberty. In Australia to-day, even a man charged with the vilest murder is not only given a fair trial in open Court, but if he is without means counsel for his defence is provided by the Crown. In these cases, however, no specific charge is made against the men. No opportunity is given them to state their case, and they are not allowed to retain counsel to conduct their defence. It is about time that a stop was put to this sort of thing in Australia. If any man commits an offence for which he should be gaoled or deported, let, the charge be proved against him, and let him take his punishment. I do not stand here to protect any person from the consequences of his own acts, hut I do stand for the principle of giving every man in a British community the right of an open trial and an opportunity to clear himself, if he can, of the charge or charges made against him. The Government are building up for themselves a day of reckoning, and when that day comes there will be little left of them. They will be overwhelmed by a great avalanche of indignation, which will have had its birth in the action of the Government in depriving men of the great rights which hundreds of years ago were wrung from King John at Runnymede. </para>

When I believe in a certain principle, it is immaterial to me what may be said; I stand to it in any circumstances, and am prepared to take the consequences. This attempt on the part of the honorable member to hide behind so paltry an excuse will protect neither him nor his party.  His  excuse is too thin. The Prime Minister yesterday raised the bogy-man which was so effectively knocked down at Ballarat last Saturday, and he raised it against, not only us, but the Country party. The Prime Minister, whom they are supporting with their votes in this House to-day, raised this very same bogy against their candidate for the Ballarat by-election. Such are the tactics of the Prime Minister. The history of the public life of Australia is studded with instances of men who, entering upon the dying days of their political career, have trotted up this old bogy. The history of the failures in the public life of Australia shows that in every case they raised the bogy-man with the scarlet cloak. I wonder what honorable members of the Country party thought of the action of the Prime Minister in raising this bogy-man against their candidate at Ballarat. I hope they enjoyed it. </para>

                <para>The right honorable gentleman was pleased yesterday to attack this party on the ground that it comprised only twenty-five members. After the return of the writ for the Ballarat by-election we shall be twenty-six strong; but because of the relative smallness of our numbers he attacked us and sneered at us. Throwing  out his chest and pluming himself, he said that when he led Labour it was a gloriously strong party. As a matter of fact, he has never led the Australian Labour party to victory. When he assumed the leadership of the party, he led it to destruction. Hardly had he taken control than the party became divided and broken. The Australian Labour party was built up under the leadership of such men as J. C. Watson and Andrew Fisher. Those are the men, and not men such as the present Prime Minister, who1 led the party to victory. The right honorable gentleman talked of the great victory achieved by Labour in 1914, when our party overwhelmed all its opponents. I wonder what most of his followers who are sitting behind him to-day thought of that statement. The Prime Minister and the country know that the very men who were defeated by us in .those days are tie men with whom the right honorable gentleman sits to-day cheek-by-jowl. As the Prime Minister spoke, the face of the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> was a study. He could not but recall immediately his experiences of 19.14, when from one end of this country to the other the Prime Minister flogged and scarified him and the party which he led. The Prime Minister then crumpled into political dust the present Acting Treasurer and many of the men who sit behind him to-day. He has now the effrontery to hurl at this party the taunt that it consists of only twenty-five members. Victories gained at the expense of principle are paid for too -dearly, and the Labour movement will never buy victory by sacrificing its principles for the sake of place and pay. If we had chosen to sacrifice our principles, to hurl them overboard, and to go over to the traditional enemies .of Labour, the exploiter and the profiteer, we could have been, as the Prime Minister rightly says, sitting on the Treasury bench to-day. We preferred not to do so. To us such a victory would be a barren one. A victory without principle is of no use to the Labour movement. We have our trust deep down in the hearts of the people of this country, the great -working masses, the toilers of Australia. Those are the people to whom we look, and with whom we stand. All the taunts and  sneers of the Prime Minister will avail him naught. We stand to principle, regardless of the cost and irrespective of whether we may gain victory or not. </para>
                <para>When I heard the Prime Minister taunting us with the fact that we were only twenty-five strong in the House today, and when I saw the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> sitting alongside him, my mind went , back to some of the early days in New South Wales, particularly in Balmain. In those days I saw the Prime Minister in a very lowly and humble position in the suburb where I was reared. I was m close .contact with him for many years before he entered public life. I saw him there in his days of poverty, and I know how the workers stuck to him. .1 know what they did in Balmain for him, &#39;and he knows it, too. Now I find the same man hurling taunts at the party which stood by bini, and I .find sitting .alongside him the man whom he fought, and against whom &#39;he wrote scarifying articles. &#34;The Prime Minister -ventured into the realms of journalism in those early days. He and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> with great struggles and great trials., used to publish a paper called <inline font-style="italic">The New Order,</inline> and the most powerful articles in it were those from the pen of W. M. Hughes. He was the man who preached real rank red-raw Socialism to us in those days. He was the man who pointed out to the workers the way to go. The articles that the Government object to to-day -are only a .circumstance compared with those written by W. M. Hughes and printed in <inline font-style="italic">The New Order.</inline> One article in particular came to my mind yesterday afternoon, when I looked at the Prime Minister sitting cheek_ .by jowl with the honorable member for. Parramatta. That was an article written by the Prime Minister and entitled -, &#34; Joephisto Cook.&#34; The Prime Minister might tell honorable members what that meant. The sub-heading was, &#34; The Scoot of &#39;the Rats.&#34; In that article the Prime. Minister scarified his present boon-companion <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> for having ratted on the Labour party. Yet to-day he has the impudence and effrontery  to jeer at and taunt us. As the same time, he is sitting cheek by jowl with the man whom he scarified and condemned for doing just what he is doing to-day - condemning the party that gave him his political birth. It is unworthy of a man .holding the high position of Prime Minister of this great Commonwealth to descend to those, mean and paltry methods of attack. Surely there are big problems to be dealt with and bigger ways of dealing with them- than this paltry, petty, down.in the gutter kind of tactics adopted by the Prime Minister. My appeal is for a man of big ideals and big principles to lead this Commonwealth. Honorable members opposite may well ask, concerning the members of their own party, &#34; Where is he?&#34; and echo will answer, &#39;.&#39;Where?&#34; But I believe that there are. men in this House capable of taking a big stand, upon, big Australian matters. I believe there are many men here capable of properly upholding the position of Prime Minister; It is degrading not 1 only to Parliament but to the people of this great Commonwealth that its first citizen, the Prime Minister, should indulge in- this sort of vulgar abuse. The man who descends to such tactics is unfitted for the position of Prime Minister of Australia. It is up to the honorable members sitting in the Ministerial Corner to see if they cannot find somebody more fitted and able to fill with honour the position- of Prime Minister. The members of the Australian Labour movement cannot govern without a majority, because the Labour movement never goes back on principle, and we, as a Government, if we could not put our principles  into practice, would not remain in office two minutes. We should decline, if we had to govern by jettisoning our principles. Let a majority of the House- decide that we shall have somebody in that position who is worthy to -govern Australia, and capable of rising to the responsibilities placed upon the shoulders of any man who occupies it. This mere twittering, humbugging, sneering, and trying, by a trick of mental agility, to make an opponent look cheap or small, is unworthy of any person who1 holds the high position of Prime Minister of Australia. The House should endeavour to rise a little above that sort of thing. The House has in this motion an opportunity of deciding upon a Prime Minister who can worthily uphold the best traditions of Australia and of its Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I utterly fail to rise to the exalted idea which the honorable member for Grampians holds about, himself. N!o doubt the honorable member has been preening- himself, and imagining that he himself is the man. It is quite an open secret that he has been expecting appointment as &#34;Leader of the Country party. For myself, I am merely a humble follower of the Leader of the Labour party. My only desire is to help along  the  party and the movement with which I am associated, for the betterment of the conditions of the men and women who toil to build up the fortunes of the profiteers. The Prime Minister, I repeat, attempted to belittle the Labour party. I look at the spectacle of another honorable member sitting  cheek-by-jowl  with him. I wonder where the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> will be when the division takes place. A newspaper stated the other afternoon that the Prime Minister had been seen with his arm about the neck of the honorable member, and his mouth at his ear. No doubt he was telling the honorable member a sweet little tale. Do we not all remember the Prime Minister taunting the honorable member in this Chamber with having &#34; a mind like a toad in a cesspit ?&#34; To-day he is the boon companion of the Prime Minister, and his will be the vote that will continue the_ Government in office. The honorable member for Capricornia was returned to this House as a direct opponent of the present Government. The people of Capricornia sent him here to oust the Government from office, and he has no moral right to keep the Government in&#34; power. He was returned to Parliament as a direct supporter of the Leader of the Opposition, and as a member of the Australian Labour party. What happened subsequently is immaterial so far as the principle at stake is concerned. The honorable member may claim that certain officials of the Labour movement did something that they should not do, but that does not give him any right to go back upon his principles, and upon the people who elected him. If the honorable member desires to keep the Government in power by his voice and vote, the only honorable thing for him to do is to resign and go before his electors again. Let him say to them, &#34; I cannot now represent you in the capacity in which you returned me, but I ask you to re-elect me as a direct supporter of the Government.&#34; If he does that nobody will&#34; be able to find fault with him. But I find fault with any man who obtains election to this House under one banner, and then in arches beneath the opposite banner. If at any time I find myself in regard to questions of principle out of step with the party with which I am associated to-day, I shall take the course dictated by honour; I shall resign my seat, and tell the people that I desire to be re-elected upon a new pledge, If the people again accept me under those conditions, no fault can be found with me. On this question I am using the mildest language at my command. If the honorable member chooses to adopt a course different from that I have indicated, he must be the arbiter of his own conduct; but to my mind principles are of far greater importance than the retention of a seat in this House. I would sooner go down and out ten thousand times than accept any position in or out of Parliament at the expense of any principle I hold dear. There are some individuals who cannot understand a person holding principles dearer to, him than wealth and position. A man should stand by those things which he believes to be right, no matter what hand or tongue &#34;may be against him. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party did nothing of the sort. Nobody knows better than the honorable member the kindly feelings entertained towards him by the. members of this party. But having been returned to the House by the men and women of Capricornia to shift the present Government from office, he is now&#39; about to vote to keep them in power. That is the principle at stake; the actions and attitude of honorable members on this side are beside the. question. As a matter of fact, we took no action, and the honorable member knows it. But, whether we did or not does not affect the principle. </para>

                        <para>- I felt sorrow, deep and lasting, in my heart when I witnessed the spectacle of the honorable member for Capricornia voting with his life-long political opponents; voting to keep in power a Government which he was sent here to turn out. He, like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> has dabbled in journalism in his early days. Do I not remember the inspiring articles which the honorable member wrote many years ago? Do we not recall with a thrill that great slogan which emanated from the honorable member for Capricornia and was blazed from one end of the country to the other - &#34; Bread or blood&#34;? To-day, I wonder what the honorable member has to say. </para>

                        <para>- While there may be no arrangement with the Country party, as a party, how do we know that there may not be some working agreement among certain of the individual members in the Corner? If such be not the case, however, how can the Prime Minister assume and assert that he controls the great majority in this House? The fact is that he does not hold a majority. The Prime Minister has indicated that he is of opinion that he has the Country party &#34; in a bag.&#34; Last week he was speaking of the numbers on both sides of this House, and his attention was drawn to the members of the Country party, sitting in the Corner. What did he say? How did he indicate his feelings towards them? He referred to them in the language of a sheep, probably thinking that they would understand that.  His  reference to them consisted of a  wave of an arm and a contemptuous &#34;Bah!&#34; Probably the Prime Minister looks upon them as so many sheep, and has them well  coralled  in the home paddock, ready to be shorn when the time comes to take the pending vote. Here is the actual position of parties and individuals in this House, and the members of the Corner party must accept full responsibility for the situation as it stands. It is just as well to be candid. I do not run about from corner to corner, afraid to speak. So far as the members of the Government and its direct supporters are concerned, we know where they stand. I honour any man who is a straight-out opponent, and am prepared to give him credit for his opinions. I will always meet him as man to man, on fair ground. But as for those who desire to sail beneath a stolen flag, it is about time their craft was sunk and its crew forced to step aboard&#39; some ship which is flying their true flag and indicating their real identity. As a matter of fact, the people of -this country do not want -the gentlemen to whom I refer&#39; to sail on any ship, but would prefer to see them walk the plank. And they will have t% do so when it comes to the acceptance of responsibility for their votes. These country representatives go out into the country and condemn the actions of the Government in the matter of handling Australia&#39;s wool. Yet, at the same time, every vote they cast here is a vote to retain the Government in office. Such conduct will very soon be seen through, and the people will know what to do. </para>

                        <para>- Very doubtful! But, conceding the Prime Minister the support of all those who stood as direct Nationalist candidates at the last elections, it is obvious that he can command only thirty-six actual followers in this Chamber. Against him and his followers, elected by the people of Australia, elected directly in opposition to candidates of the Government party, there are thirty-eight members of this Chamber. Where is the great majority behind the Prime Minister? Never a truer word was spoken than that uttered by the Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> when he said the Prime Minister and the Government were hanging on by the skin of their teeth. The skin of their teeth consists of the votes of the members of the Country party. The Government would npt be permitted to stay in office for another two minutes unless that party were prepared to keep it there. And, for such a state of affairs the Corner party must take full responsibility. What is more, it will not be allowed to shirk its responsibility. </para>

Members of the Corner party have an opportunity now of putting themselves right with the people by accepting their responsibility. Are they big enough to shoulder this responsibility?

                    <para>. - A charge has been made against members of the party which I have the honour to lead, that yesterday they were afraid to speak. May I say now that they paid me the compliment, in my unavoidable absence, of waiting till I was present. There can be no doubt that we have to face the situation as it is presented to us, and so far as I am concerned I intend to do so. I have been in this House now for over seventeen years, and no man has yet been in a position to say that I have ever been afraid to take the consequences of any vote I have given. And I challenge any member of this House to say that I ever voted against what I thought to be right, even upon a question submitted by the Government of which I was a supporter. I candidly confess I cannot understand the tone of some of the speeches that were delivered yesterday by members of the Opposition. So far as I can gather, they constitute a direct attack upon the Country party. </para>

When we realize that the interests which we stand for have not the representation in this. House that they are entitled to by their numbers outside or their importance, we must regret the tone of the debate. The speech made by the honorable member who preceded me was. a direct attack upon my party, and everything for which my party stands. I am compelled, therefore, to ask myself if the honorable member who tabled the motion really desired the Country party to vote for it or not. If honorable members opposite desire the support of the Country party, then all I can say is that they have a most extraordinary manner of dissembling their love, because the speeches give one the impression that their object is to compel members of the Country party to vote against the motion. </para>

                        <para>- There is something a great deal more to be considered than the motion on its merits. I am prepared to accept the responsibility attaching to the vote which I shall give, as must every man who votes on the motion&#39;. We have to accept the full and complete responsibility for attempting either to put the Government out of  office,  or for expressing our confidence in the Government.  There  are times when a man can take a middle course, but when it comes to a direct issue, and the fate of a Government is concerned, no member can salve his conscience, but must take, as I say, full and complete responsibility for either removing the Government from office or keeping it in office, thus accepting the policy that it has followed up to the present. That is the position as I recognise it, and that is the attitude which I intend to take. </para>

                <para>May I say here that the party of which I have the honour to be leader, do not approach these matters upon cast-iron principles. Every member of this party is absolutely free to vote on this or any other motion exactly as his conscience dictates, and the same liberty which I allow to every follower, every follower allows to every other member of the party. The policy which some of our friends opposite have enunciated is diametrically opposed to every principle which the Country party upholds . The policy enunciated, especially by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> is that there must be a regulation of prices of primary production so far as the consumer is affected. Overseas, producers may get as much as they can for their produce, but here the prices must be regulated to suittheconsumer. </para>

                        <para>- The time has gone by when every worker in the cities and suburbs is to be permitted to have the full and fair results of his labour, while the producer in the country is to be sweated - sweated in order to give cheapness to men to whom cheapness is a curse in every other direction. I have no sympathy with a man who demands the highest price he can get for his labour, and, at the same time, is prepared to sweat the producer in the case of everything he has to sell. I warn honorable members on both sides that the man on the land is at last beginning to realize that an eight-hours system in the city is no good to him if he himself has to work ten or twelve hours and have his products sweated to the cheapest possible price. Cheapness has been a god so far as primary production is concerned, but anathema to people engaged in every other industry. The day for that, however, is gone. The primary producers, in the matters to which I am referring, have in the past had nothing to thank nay honorable friends opposite for, and, perhaps, have had quite as little to thank honorable members on this side for. We accent the position in which we find&#39; ourselves, and are prepared to plough our own furrow. So far as I am concerned, I shall vote for any motion - I care not where it comes from - so long as I believe in it. As honorable members know, I have - perhaps to my own personal disadvantage - taken that attitude on more than one occasion in this House. I have never been able to accept, and certainly I have never preached, that a motion is right if it comes from one man, and wrong if it comes from another; a principle is either  right or it is wrong. </para>

                <para>While I am entirely opposed to the attitude and speeches of honorable members opposite, I recognise that the Government have absolutely failed in dealing with the finances of the country. I am reiterating what I have said over and over again in this House for years past when I say that we are indulging in a carnival of financial folly -indulging in a &#34;boom, borrow, and burst &#34; policy. Never in the history of Australiahave the finances of the country been in the same deplorable condition. I am not going to exaggerate, because at a time like this one has to be exceedingly cautious in what one says ; but it is everywhere known that representatives of the Victorian Government went Home and failed to borrow ; that the representative of the Queensland Government is Home to-day and failing to borrow; and that the representative of the Federal Government went Home, and certainly did not succeed. As to the merits of the case in which the ex-Treasurer  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is involved, I am not going to say one word. The attitude I took at the time of that gentleman&#39;s resignation is, I think, the right one. We have heard one side of the case, and before I pass a verdict I intend to hear the case of the man who is absent. I am not prepared to debate that question at all. When the ex-Treasurer comes home, and makes his statement, will be the time for me, at any rate, to give my verdict. We can say, however, that the representatives of the Government who have been Home during the last month or two endeavouring to borrow, have all failed. It is not too much to say that the finances of the Commonwealth to-day are in a decidedly unsatisfactory condition, and that there&#39; is not the slightest attempt to curtail expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- We are borrowing money in Australia, and we cannot give this country too much credit for the way in which the financial people here have met their responsibilities in this connexion. If anybody had said ten years ago that the Government could borrow &#163;150,000,000  in  Australia at the current rate of interest, the statement, would have been ridiculed. Nevertheless that has been done. We know, too, that the investment of the moneys which have been loaned to the Government had a very serious effect  in  preventing expenditure where it was urgently needed, especially in the direction of establishing new industries and in opening up the country in the way that it ought to be opened up. </para>

                        <para>- Of all the Dominions, Australia alone made no effort during the war period to secure a reduction in her ordinary expenditure. During the war we were willing to overlook expenditure which at any other time would have been subjected to searching criticism, because we recognised that we were sailing on an uncharted sea. Instead, therefore, of our&#39; ordinary expenditure being curtailed&#39;, year by year it has been steadily increased. But we have now reached a time when, no matter who may be charged with the government of the Commonwealth, there must be either a substantial increase  in  our revenue or a decided reduction in our expenditure or both. May I point out some of the directions in which our revenue is being increased to the serious detriment of industries in the various States? Only the day before yesterday I received from the Treasurer of Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliott Lewis)</inline> figures which show that, between the 25th March last and the date I have mentioned, the sum of &#163;5,500 has been paid in duty upon machinery that has been imported into that State by the Hydro-Electric Company - a State enterprise - although that machinery could not be obtained in Australia. But the most serious aspect of the matter is that, during the next twelve or eighteen months, the duty payable upon materials to be imported will be approximately &#163;125,000. I ask honorable members to seriously consider the position. Here is a State which, at very considerable expenditure and risk, has undertaken the generation of electric power, which is being availed of by all parts of Australia. Refractory ores from Broken Hill are being treated by this State enterprise in Tasmania. The works which have been established there will permit of the treatment of millions of tons of low-grade refractory ores which it was quite &#39; impossible to treat previously. Yet, that State will be called upon to pay to the Commonwealth, by way of duty alone, the sum of &#163;140,000 or &#163;150,000. Further, this money will have to be borrowed by the State of Tasmania. I care not what views honorable members may bold as to the desirableness of encouraging local industries- </para>

                        <para>- Hydro-electric. Every effort has been made to secure in Australia every pound&#39;s worth of machinery that can be obtained here. When, therefore, Tasmania is asked to pay &#163;150,000 by way of duty in two years upon a State enterprise which will enable thousands of men to be employed in the reduction of refractory ores, it is time that the matter was considered seriously. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not intend to address myself to this motion. After the terms of the censure proposal had been committed to paper, I hardly thought it was necessary to insist too much upon the obvious, namely, that the Government are unworthy of the confidence of this House. The terms of the motion are, I think, sufficiently wide to enable me to refer to a public scandal which has arisen, and to an agitation which has &#39;been fomented and promoted by the Government in connexion with the proposed deportation of the Reverend Father Jerger. </para>

                        <para>- The matter was disposed of for the time being this morning, and I take this, the earliest opportunity, of referring to the position in which Father Merger stands in regard to his defence. Some time ago the Government determined to send that reverend gentleman out of this country, in which he has lived an honorable, and even a distinguished life, for more than forty years. When that determination became known it was not unnatural that great public indignation should be aroused, and that a request, which had been made more than once, should be repeated - a request that he should receive at least the bare measure of justice that is involved in a public trial. That request was refused. Indignation naturally became more inflamed, and the demand was made that further inquiry should be made into this case. The Government, feeling the pressure of public opinion, and having the knowledge of the approach of a general election, were graciously pleased to send one of their own officers for the purpose of holding an inquiry <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> No charge was then made against Father Jerger, but there appeared before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, who was detailed for this duty, learned counsel in the person of the present member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> who was refused a hearing, although he was graciously permitted to remain in the room while the inquiry was conducted. I am informed, and I know for a fact, that no evidence was adduced before this gentleman reflecting upon the character or the loyalty of the person in question. On the contrary, the whole of the evidence that was adduced went to show that he was a man of high character and unimpeachable loyalty. Notwithstanding that fact, this representative of the Government, standing in the shoes of the Government, and having the responsibility of pleasing and satisfying them, was not able to recommend that any departure should be made from the expressed determination of the Government to send this reverend gentleman out of the country without a trial. So the Government threw out its chest and informed the general public that an inquiry had taken place, and it was not proposed to alter the decision arrived at. A movement was immediately made to invoke the aid of the Courts of this country,, and then began a series of probably the most discreditable acts that have ever been perpetrated by a Government in a responsible community. This reverend gentleman, who was in Sydney, and who had the right that every Britisher is assumed to have of instructing his advisers as to his defence, was denied access to his advisers. He was not permitted to have communication of any kind whatever with them, and when this Government knew that application was being made to the Courts, they immediately and unceremoniously packed this gentleman off and &#34; shanghaied &#34; him out of New South Wales into Victoria, for the purpose of avoiding the position which gave the Courts of New South Wales jurisdiction to deal with the case. That in itself was a most discreditable act; it was most indecent, and every man who sits behind the Government is a party to that action. Let me inform some honorable members supporting the Government that they should find it exceedingly hard to satisfy their own consciences, much less their constituents, in regard to the action of their leaders in this matter. Father Merger was sent to Victoria. </para>

                    friends knew that he had arrived here. &#39; They knew he was taken in a closed conveyance to the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, and they immediately went there to see him. They were informed, if you please, by the officer in charge, that he had again been taken away in a closed vehicle to some unknown destination. I, as his solicitor, placed myself in communication with the State Commandant (General Brand) who shuffled and sought delay, and to do him justice, seemed to be ashamed of the position in which he was placed. I am prepared to give the State Commandant credit for that. On the following morning we ascertained that Father Merger had been taken to Queenscliff so hurriedly that provision had not been made for his detention there. The Government thought that they could hide the body. We made application to a Judge of the High Court, and embarrassed the Government, who in their ignorance, were not aware that we could invoke the aid of the High Court to deal with the matter, When this matter came before the High Court,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Starke said the matter was of grave importance, and that the person concerned, like every other citizen - and I ask no more for him than I would for the meanest citizen of this country - had the right to invoke the aid of the Court up to the last minute, as long as he was a resident in the country. What happened ? An order
                    <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline>
                    was granted calling upon the Government to show cause the following day why a writ of
                    <inline font-style="italic">capias</inline>
                    should not be issued, and reasons given for his detention. A representative of the Government appeared, and when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Starke suggested that this matter might go to the Full . Court, if there was not some grave public reason for its immediate determination, counsel for the Government rose and objected on the grounds, as he alleged, that there was public danger in postponing the matter any longer. It was a deliberate lie put into the mouth of learned counsel by the Government, and the Judge was deceived. What is the present position? The case was postponed again until this morning to enable the Government to state their position. The Government took the responsibility of saying that they were afraid of grave public disturbances and outbreaks if this reverend gentleman was not immediately deported. There has been no outbreak or disturbance of any kind, except that arising from the fact that the Government have flouted the laws of the country and outraged the spirit and traditions of justice that should, but which does not, exist. The Judge was driven,- bound as he was, to accept the statement of a responsible Minister of the Crown, if one can call him responsible, to give a decision there and then, and dismissed that application.

                        <para>- I submit that there has not been any evidence brought before you as to the position of the matter beyond my deliberate statement that the case was disposed of this morning. In my speech I stated, as I was entitled to do, that we do not propose to allow the case to rest where it is. The course of action taken may be one which will put it again <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and enable you to exercise your right, as Speaker, to prevent mo from ventilating further this public scandal. But I submit that, at present, there is not a tittle of evidence before you that the case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and, on the contrary, you have my statement that it was disposed of this morning. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will recollect that he distinctly said that the case was not finally concluded, that the matter was not to be allowed to rest where it is. That was tantamount to saying that the case has not been finally dealt with by the Court, and is still to be determined. A legal member of the Government has also just stated that the intention to appeal was indicated in Court this morning. Under these circumstances, I have no option but to rule that if the matter is still in abeyance and <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> which, as far as I can learn, it is, the honorable member cannot discuss it further. </para>

                        <para>- I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that you misunderstood the point that I raised. I wish to ascertain from you what your ruling was; I am not attempting to traverse that ruling. I understood you to rule that this case cannot be referred to because it is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> The question I raise is, &#34;What is covered by the term <inline font-style="italic">sub judice?&#34;</inline> The only point in this case, so far as it has been discussed before the High Court of Australia, and so far as it is involved in any appeal, is, Have the Government, now that it is contended the war is over, power to deport the reverend gentleman who has been mentioned? The honorable member for Batman was not discussing that point. He was not discussing the Government&#39;s power, but their abuse of power, assuming that that power exists. He is, therefore, discussing the case on the assumption that the decision of the High Court as it now stands is correct. I submit that if he discusses it on that assumption, his remarks are in order, because they cannot be taken to refer to any matter that is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

But it is important to remember that this Government has denied the spiritual adviser of this reverend gentleman, his own confessor, the right to attend him. It has denied to his legal adviser the right to do so. </para>

I believe, from my experience and knowledge of the recent conduct of these Ministers, that they are quite equal to closing the door upon the minister of religion who was seeking to give spiritual consolation to a person in their hands. </para>

In the light of what we have recently learned, I am quite prepared to believe that the Government would do that, and I have risen to make my protest against such conduct.

I desire no apology to myself; his personal remarks, offensive as they are, do not hurt me, as I am doing only what is right, just and fair, but it is the House that has been flouted by the honorable member. It is possible that, after time for a little reflection, the honorable member may realize that his course of action was not correct, and I therefore give him the opportunity at the present time, if he so desires, to apologize to the House. </para>

                    <para>.- In addressing myself to the House on the motion now before it, there are various matters to which I wish to refer. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in his reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> said that he saw no grounds for this censure motion. He claimed that the whole matter was futile, or something of the sort. I think that as the debate .has proceeded light has been thrown on many matters, and we are all now fully convinced that there are serious grounds, and good reasons, why this censure motion should be launched, and the Government should be told that they no longer have the confidence of the House to transact its business. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Before dealing with the more serious features of the situation, I wish to make a reference to the conduct of one of the great Departments of the Commonwealth, namely, the Post and Telegraph Department. Honorable members may recollect  that, in the course of a debate on a similar motion tabled earlier in the session, the Post and Telegraph Department came in for a&#39; fair amount of criticism. We then received the assurance of the Postmaster-General that many of the grievances complained of, and many of the patent injustices for which the Department was responsible, would be rectified. I was at the time less familiar with the proceedings of this House, and the management of a Government Department, than I am today, and I accepted the assurances of the honorable gentleman. I have little city experience of the work of this Department beyond some knowledge of the irritation caused by delays in making telephone connexions ; but, on the strength of the assurances given, I assumed that many of the inconveniences and difficulties suffered by country people because of the lack of postal and telephonic facilities, would be remedied. It is on behalf of isolated centres in the country that I wish to say a word to-day. Many instances could be quoted of applications made for telephone facilities in country districts in connexion with which the assurance has been given that the requests made would be complied with as soon as possible. I must have addressed some fifty requests to the head of the Post and Telegraph Department in New South Wales from people asking for telephonic communication, and the reply has always been that, as there would be so much loss on the operation of the lines asked for, they could not be granted. The people of one small town in my electorate, Bundanoon, have been incensed by the way in which their requests for telephonic facilities have been ignored . The neglect of the authorities is bringing one of the great Departments of the Commonwealth into disrepute. From what I can gather, very little effort is made to allay this public discontent. The postal facilities of the place have been curtailed, and the action of the Department in this connexion has been protested against because, although the town is small, it is growing, and the restriction of postal and telephonic facilities tends to retard its progress. I have been trying for the last two months to induce the Department to do something, but I have not succeeded. The following letter will inform honorable members of the character of the complaints that reach me - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I have to state, that the new arrangements seriously curtail our postal conveniences. Each day the post office is closed for one hour, and all Wednesday afternoon, the mails on that day being made up at 1 o&#39;clock - a most inconvenient hour. Further, a telephone service was installed about two years ago. Thirteen subscribers are installed, four or five others are waiting to be connected, and several others have applied for the &#39;phone. Now all these accepted the service as we hare it at the present time, that is, six days a week. Now the Department are cutting this down to five days, and this we consider a serious breach of faith. For, had the Department made known their intention earlier, several of those who have made application for the phone would not have done so. Bundanoon is progressing, and we consider this serious curtailment of our postal conveniences against the interests of our town. </para>

                <para class="block">I leave the matter at that for the moment with my protest on behalf of the people of this town, and also on behalf of ten or fifteen similar applications I have had from country centres in my electorate, Where the people are isolated, and are doing- their best to promote rural development. The Post and Telegraph Department treats these people in the most callous manner, and does nothing for them at all. </para>
                <para>I have, further, been inundated with complaints from mail contractors throughout my electorate, because of the way in which they are treated. They claim that when they entered into their contracts things were fairly  prosperous,  and there was no indication of the unsatisfactory seasons that have since followed. They have been applying to the Post and Telegraph Department for some recognition of the serious handicaps under which they have been carrying on their contracts, but they can obtain no satisfaction. They all get the same reply, &#34; Your letter to hand. The matter is being considered,&#34; and there it ends. These men, who are carrying the mails throughout my electorate, are doing a national work. In enabling a Commonwealth utility to perform its legitimate function they are making conditions a little better for those who settle in remote districts and promote rural development. 1 am disappointed, not to say disgusted, that the promises made in connexion with these matters have so far been unfulfilled. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister stated that, although everything said by the Leader of the Opposition in support of the censure motion had been said before, the House had voted its confidence in the Government. However, in a quarter riot at all friendly to Labour, we seem to be very strongly supported in the view that the Government are deserving of censure. I find that practically the terms of the censure motion are contained' in an article published in an organ which nearly always, and particularly at election time, stands solid behind the National party. I quote the following from the issue of the Sun for 12th July, which, by the way, is a very significant date: </para>

                    <para>Why does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> (Labour) exhibit a majority of 3,000 votes over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby</inline> (Nationalist) ? It is not because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerby</inline> helped himself to &#163;400 a year. The salary grab played a small part in the election, for the anti-salary grab candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Troup,</inline> with the aid of the farmers&#39; vote, polled negligibly. It is not that the woes of Ireland played any great part, for the inhabitants of Ballarat are three-fourths Protestant, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> raising of the sectarian bogy certainly did not have much effect either way - except that the insincerity of this move probably disgusted a few of his own supporters in Ballarat. The reason is that the people of Ballarat, and of Victoria and of Australia, are getting very tired of the dictatorship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> of his &#34; dominating personality,&#34; and his War Precautions Act, and his clumsy handling of the Watt episode, and his unpublished wool reports. There is a powerful feeling growing in Australia that it is high time the country got back to parliamentary government. Ballarat is the &#34;Mene Tekel&#34; upon the walls of the banquet hall of Belshazzar Hughes and his Nationalist courtiers. The party has still a chance of survival; but it will not survive if it is going to constitute the applauding court of Babylon. It must bring Belshazzar to reason, and the trouble appears to be that not one man of the Cabinet has the necessary force, now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has been driven out. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> returned last night to his referendum joke, and taunted the Leader of our party with having repeated former statements made by him on the subject. I propose very briefly to refer to the principles of the referendum taken at the last general election. The Prime Minister distinctly stated that the proposed amendments of the Constitution then put before the electors were practically the same as those which the Labour party had on prior occasions submitted. The curious fact is that every force and influence that opposed those proposals when they were submitted by the Labour Government professed a readiness to support them on this occasion. It is very necessary in the circumstances to ask the reason for the change of front. Honorable members opposite will admit that, when the Prime Minister first submitted to his party his proposed amendments of the Constitution, they met with a very luke-warm reception. The daily newspapers published articles which were anything but vigorous in their support of them, and the big vested interests of the country quickly began to show that they would oppose them. Something had to be done, and done quickly, to secure unity on the part of the Nationalist party. Conflicting interests had to be reconciled, and consequently the Prime Minister lost no time in announcing that certain reservations were to he made. He began by addressing a meeting of the inner circle of the profiteers in this city - the very people who, if the referendum proposals were carried, were to be dealt with. The meeting was held behind closed doors, the star-chamber tactics adopted being much like those associated with many other undertakings on the part of this Government. I dare say that soldiers in uniform were posted outside the meeting room to take care that no listening ear was at the keyhole. No sooner had the meeting been held than the Chamber of Commerce publicly announced that, having heard the Prime Minister, it had decided to support the referendum proposals of his Government, since they recognised that they would be circumscribed and altogether of a very restricted character. Even that, however, was not sufficient to secure unity among the Nationalists.  More remained to be done, and so other reservations were made. Finally, we had the reservation, which destroyed the proposals completely, so far as we were concerned, that, even if the projected amendments of the Constitution were accepted by the people, they would lapse unless a Convention to make recommendations in regard to the Constitution as a whole was called before the end of the present year. That Convention could make recommendations which would have stultified the decision of the people, and the Prime Minister announced that, unless . it was called before the end of ,1920, the proposed amendments, even if carried by the people, would become null and void. Having regard to our experience of the Prime Minister&#39;s political tactics - knowing, as we did, that he was prepared to jump from one party to another; that he would make definite statements to-day and qualify them, or almost deny them, to-morrow - we rightly said that we could not associate ourselves with any proposal of the kind, and that we would not support the referendum. Having regard to the desperate methods to which the Prime Minister had resorted - to the reservations and restrictions which he proposed with the object of placating members of his own party and his capitalistic supporters outside - we took the stand that the people should be advised to reject the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>

                <para>I propose now to deal with the questions of industrial unrest and the high cost of living. I group these two subjects, under the one heading since they must go hand in hand. While the cost of living continues to increase, and the position of the wage-earner becomes worse and worse - while the burdens to be borne by him become heavier and heavier every day -  industrial  unrest must increase in volume. That cannot be denied. It is the experience of the world to-day. Prior to the phenomenal increase in the cost of living the worker was more contented, and industrial conditions were far better than  they  are at present. The great mass of the people, whether they are employed in  offices,  in factories or in country fields, depend for their living upon the wages they earn. I care not what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> or any other authority may say; my own practical experience is such that it is useless to tell me that the cost of living has increased by only 60 per cent., and that wages at the same time have increased to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent. If wages have increased to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent - and we can measure the exact increase in wages - the cost of living has gone up by nearly 200 per cent. Week after week the wages brought home by the worker grow less and less capable of purchasing the bare necessities of ordinary civilized conditions of life. While that state of affairs prevails, and the Government do nothing to alter it, we must expect to have industrial unrest. In such circumstances the industrial upheaval will go on and on until finally it bursts forth into the inevitable revolution. As I have said before in this House, even a worm on the ground, when hungry, will fight. Will a man do less ? The Government may go on until Doomsday creating Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. I have nothing to say against such tribunals, but while the Government allow them to determine the rates of wages to be paid, and at the same time permit the capitalistic class and the profiteers to go on raising the cost of living, such lop-sided economics must necessarily result in unrest and discontent, and I am afraid that they will result eventually in revolution in this and every other country. </para>
                <para>I am not going to enter into a controversy to-day regarding the power of the Commonwealth Government to deal with profiteering. I have given much study to the problem, and followed the controversy relating to it long before I entered this House. I am not a lawyer, and am not going to give a legal opinion &#34; off my own bat,&#34; but I have heard many opinions on the subject. The Prime Minister says, in effect, &#34; It is useless to talk about this matter. I tell you that we have no power to deal with profiteering. I have spoken, and that is an end to the question.&#34; On any question of law, I would sooner have one opinion from the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> than 5,000 from the Prime Minister. The honorable member for West Sydney claims that the Parliament can deal with profiteering, and until his opinion is proved to be wrong I shall accept it. Having regard to their respective records as lawyers, I prefer the opinion of the honorable member to that of the Prime Minister. This Government has failed, and failed miserably, to deal with the problems of industrial unrest and the high cost of living. If they fail to deal with one they fail to deal with both, since the two must go hand in hand. If the Government make no attempt to discover the bed-rock causes - if they are content to deal only with effects and to go on talking about Arbitration Courts - the whole matter will ultimately betaken out of their hands and the problem solved for them by some one else. </para>

                <para>Another matter with which I propose to deal is the failure of the Government to carry out its pledge to our returned soldiers. I believe that, with the exception of a very few cases, the Government have failed dismally to fulfil their promises to the returned soldiers, and they have failed equally in their treatment of the repatriation problem from beginning to end. I shall give one or two cases. My opinion is based upon them, and hundreds more like them that I could produce. The Repatriation Department extended the privilege to returned men of receiving, after they were discharged, a &#163;10 allowance for tools of trade, in order to enable them to make a start in their old avocations. Much of this sort of arrangement was done by regulation, and not much publicity was given to it. It was not like an Act of Parliament, such as the War Gratuity Act which was debated here for a week, the speeches being reported in the newspapers. These regulations, I understand, are part and parcel of the machinery of administration, and hence a large number of returned men never knew that the &#163;10 allowance was available. I had a letter from two men yesterday, stating that when they found they were entitled to the allowance for tools, they applied for it; but the Minister for Repatriation informed them that he had made a regulation requiring them to apply within six months of their discharge, and that, as they had not applied within that time, they had forfeited their claim. To me, that sort of thing is an absolute scandal. When the regulation was made granting the &#163;10 allowance, every man who went away to fight for his country was entitled to that allowance, amongst other things : I care not whether he was discharged two months or two years before he applied for it. If he was entitled to it six months ago, he is entitled to it to-day. A number of returned men did not apply for it, simply through ignorance. When some of them came back, they were not in good health, even if they were not wounded, and they wanted a rest. Many of them stayed for varying periods with different relatives, and the six months slipped by before they actually went back to work. Surely they were entitled to six months&#39; holiday after what they went through; but the Repatriation Department has deliberately turned down these cases, one after the other, while those who were &#34; in the know &#34; drew the &#163;10 allowance. </para>
                <para>As regards war pensions, I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Pearce,</inline> of Yass-street, Young, who tells me that her son was reported missing in August, 1915, and payment of her military allowance ceased on the 5th January, 1916. Through ignorance of the pension provisions, and thinking that her son might still turn up, she did not apply for a pension until the 16th October, 1919. and it was granted from that date. She was afterwards told that she ought to have received the pension from the day the military allowance stopped, and of course she would have done so had she applied for it at once. Still, honorable members can imagine the mother hoping and praying that the son who was reported lost would turn up. She did not apply for the pension until later, and she was then told by the Pensions Department that as an act of grace they would give her six months of the back pay, and she got no more. Fancy the mother of an Australian soldier, as an act of grace, receiving only six months of pension money to which she should have been held to be entitled for at least eighteen months! The Repatriation Department, or the military authorities, whoever are responsible; ought to pay the full pension to that woman, and to every other woman similarly situated. That is the way some of the war expenditure, and some of our obligations for past services, are being evaded. The machinery of administration is being used to turn these cases down, in the hope, I suppose, that a little more money will be available for the manufacture of guns and military equipment&#39; for some future war, in which others may be maimed and knocked out, and afterwards treated as many people are being treated to-day. A similar policy, for which the Government are wholly and solely responsible, is being pursued with regard to the old-age and invalid pensions. These should be liberalized. </para>
                <para>I come now to the burning question with the Corner party - the position of the farmers. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> said that the farmers never received any consideration from this side of the House, and not much from the other side. I agree with him that they never got much from the Ministerial side, although they have supported that side for a very long time; but the farmers of Werriwa are quite satisfied that I represent them just as well and effectively as the honorable member for Franklin or any other member who sits in the Ministerial Corner, and that I understand their conditions and the disadvantages under which they labour just as well as any member of the Country party does. I understand that some of the members of the Country party have expressed some resentment against an agitation, for which we are supposed to be responsible, for the placing of an embargo on the export of wheat for the present. I wish to emphasize those words - &#34; for the present.&#34; We are not so stupid as to want an embargo on wheat export for all time. There is a great deal of difference between an embargo for the present time and an embargo as a fixed policy. All the shire councillors and municipal councillors in my electorate, as the Prime Minister should know, for I have sent their letters on to him, have written to him, through me, urging the Commonwealth Government to prohibit any further exportation of wheat from Australia until they find out how they stand at the present time. Two-thirds of the members of those councils in my electorate are farmers. </para>

The farmers of New South Wales, and, in fact, of the whole of Australia, are not opposed to an embargo on the export of wheat at the present moment, while the Government fail to make a statement to prove that we have sufficient wheat left here. </para>

                <para>I have touched previously on the position of the primary producer. We have had a very serious drought, and I believe there is a scheme in progress to-day which will prove a great blessing in conserving water; but in the last two months sufficient water has fallen in the Commonwealth to have justified vigorous efforts at conservation. What was wanted was a Government big and bold enough to take on big undertakings while the drought was on. It is of no use to start to dam the waters now that they have rolled away to the ocean. If the present Government had been bold enough to undertake big construction works for the benefit of the primary producers, I could understand the primary producers sticking to them when a motion of censure was being moved upon them. I, for one, would not have opposed such a policy. </para>

                        <para>- There is a grave necessity for conserving our primary products. The Nationalist Government ought to have some concern for Australia and its future welfare. We know the. conditions of the primary producers to-day. The position of the smaller men on the land, while they have to go on as they do to-day, is in many cases a greater gamble than that of a man who frequents the racecourse. The Government must spend whatever is necessary, and shoulder the responsibility of insuring the primary producers of this country against that speculative feature which is always associated with their industry, before the land can be made attractive to the people. Five or six thousand years ago the ancient Egyptians showed us how a great deal could be done in that direction by means of national storehouses for the conservation of food for man and fodder for beasts. </para>

                        <para>- The State Government built the silos. When the New South Wales Labour Government&#39; passed a Bill for the bulk handling of wheat, the Legislative Council threw it out. The wheat would not have been destroyed as it was by weevils and mice but for the nominee House in New South Wales stultifying the will of the people three years ago. Honorable members are well aware of the usual fate of the primary producer. In good seasons he produces in abundance. Although he gets for his produce the market rate, that rate is much lower than the prices which rule in times such as the period of drought through which we have just passed. I have no objection to the surplus above local requirements being shipped abroad, but we should always retain in the country a supply sufficient for two years. That undertaking could be financed through the Commonwealth Bank. The farmer could be paid the market rate for his product, and if there were a succession of two or three good seasons the store-houses could be emptied by export, and refilled with the new season&#39;s produce. </para>

                        <para>- That would make very little difference. I am not urging that the Commonwealth should speculate or endeavour to make money out of this undertaking. I merely urge the provision of store-houses to conserve the primary produce ; those store-houses could be filled in normal times at normal rates and then when the periodical droughts came - for we must regard Australia as a country subject to periodical droughts - the farmer might be able to get his supplies from the store-houses at the same price as he received for his produce instead of having to pay famine prices. If the Government would undertake such a scheme we would not then have the spectacle of a limited circle of financiers and capitalists making millions of pounds at the expense of the farmer while he was being crucified by the drought in the interior, as they did during the last and every other drought. </para>

                <para>In regard to the sectarian outburst in which the Prime Minister indulged yesterday, it seems to me that, as was said by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> the right honorable gentleman already feels the political death-rattle in his throat, and like every politician in a similar predicament he grabs at sectarianism in order to try to save himself and his Government from destruction. The right honorable gentleman said a lot about the Sinn Fein element and its association with the Labour party. Nobody but a stupid schoolboy would swallow the statements made about a certain gentleman being the . real leader of the Labour party. There, was a time when the Prime Minister held a different view of the Irish people, of whom he now speaks as Sinn Feiners, disruptionists, and fomenters  of rebellion. In a book containing the war speeches delivered in England by the Prime Minister, I find the following passage in a speech before the Pilgrims at the Savoy Hotel, London, on 17th March, 1916, Viscount Bryce presiding - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>And here, on St. Patrick&#39;s Day, let us pay a tribute to the loyalty of the Irish people and the valour of the Irish troops. And I, as an Australian, pay tribute to those thousands of young Irish-Australians in the Australian Forces, who have put the cause of liberty above life itself. </para>

                <para class="block">It did not suit the Prime. Minister in those days to condemn the Irish people, and so he repeated sentiments which he had expressed in this country  during the greater part of his political career. The right honorable gentleman travelled throughout this Commonwealth accusing. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> of disloyalty to this country. Those who know the right honorable gentleman well are aware that he does nothing without a motive. What is the reason for this sudden outburst? Is it to whip up some discordant elements in his own party or is it to save his skin from this vote of censure by appealing to some honorable members in the House to whom sectarianism appeals? He stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> had condemned the war. as a sordid trade war. That statement was qualified by the reverend gentleman.  But if he were disloyal for having said such  a thing, in what respect does he differ from the Prime Minister, who earlier stated in England that the war was being waged for the economic domination of the world? If a war for that purpose was not a trade war, I do not know what the word &#34; economic &#34; means. We were subjected to these same veiled attacks and innuendos and insinuations during the last election campaign. I believe that the flame of sectarianism is being deliberately fanned to conserve the interests of the capitalistic class, which the Government represent. It has  ever been used for that purpose. Sectarianism is as old as the world. I read a story of the life of Napoleon, in which it was stated that in order to popularize the war against Napoleon, the people of England was told that he was in league with the Pope for the purpose of restoring Roman Catholicism in England, whilst at the same time the people of Ireland were told that Napoleon had entered the Vatican and dragged the Pope about by the hair. In following this path, the Prime Minister is treading upon dangerous ground, as his own knowledge of politics in this country ought to tell him. To me it is sad indeed that, at a time when we are suffering all the aftermath of the terrible world conflagration and when we are troubled in every department of our national life with problems arising out of the conflict, the man who is leading the Nationalist Government, and who should be employing all his intelligence and ability in the great work of restoring this young nation to something like its pre-war strength, is engaged instead in appealing to the vilest passions of the mob. He is using his high and proud position to inculcate in the hearts of the people passions that will only further disturb and disrupt our national life. He is degrading his position, and the only consolation to be found in his action is that ho is sounding his own death knell. Other men who opened their public life with every promise of brilliant careers, and to whom the people looked confidently for leadership in big things, have failed because owing to mistaken judgment or in order to safeguard their public positions, they indulged in vile sectarianism; they even took the great God out of Heaven and dragged him through the gutters of political filth. In this way they degraded every fine instinct of our race. Any man, I care not whether he be a Roman Catholic or a Protestant, who appeals to the religious passions and prejudices of the people in order to retain a political position, is not fit to continue in public life. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know how elections are usually won, but if the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> makes the charges in the country which he has made here this afternoon, I can quite understand how country districts sometimes get representation of a certain kind in the House. When the honorable member charges the Government with failure in their administration, because they have not erected weirs across rivers and undertaken wholesale water conservation, he either does not understand the Constitution or is deliberately making an unfair attack upon the Government. It has been said that a vote cast against the motion must be interpreted as an indication of absolute confidence in the Government. I entirely dissent from that view ; further, I think it would be exceedingly difficult for any honorable member who desires to promote and build up the primary industries to vote for honorable members opposite, after the speeches to which we listened last night. </para>

                        <para>- It should not be forgotten that a Labour Administration was governing this country for some two years after the war began. It had every opportunity to take whatever action it saw fit to prevent the rise in the cost of living, which was even then beginning to show itself alarmingly. Those Labour members, and their Government, had their opportunities when they were in power. They should now explain what they did, or sought to do, and what efforts they have since made by way of suggestion to the present Administration, to overcome the rapidly soaring cost of living. I have heard little from honorable members opposite in that respect, and I certainly saw and heard nothing while a Labour Administration controlled the Commonwealth Treasury. The only suggestion made has had reference to the placing of an embargo upon exports. Apparently, the only proposition is to prevent exportation so that people here shall first be supplied with the produce of this country at any price which the authorities may see fit to give the producers. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that he is now getting a good price for his wheat. The primary reason for the increased price of bread is the higher cost of wheat-growing, and that item of cost can be added to by the ridiculous trade regulations which exist in regard to handling and delivering. Let us see whether the farmer is doing so well as would appear at this moment. I warn honorable members opposite that they are treading on very dangerous ground when they seek to discourage the farmer from maintaining and expanding production. There are to-day some 4,000,000 acres less under wheat than four years ago. </para>

                        <para>- That is an absurd remark. There were certainly blunders made in the administration of the Wheat Pool, but the greater portion of the blame attaches to the State Boards rather than to the Central Administration. There is not one honorable member from New South Wales who has shown himself prepared to defend the actions of the Board in that State. In the press to-day there is a report of a meeting of persons interested in South Australian wheat who desire to take action in order, if possible, to secure satisfaction from the authorities for what is regarded as gross neglect of the interests of the farmers. </para>

                        <para>- That action in selling New South Wales wheat was taken without the approval of the Central administration. I admit that to-day the farmer is getting a good price; but has he had a good price throughout the war ? So far as South Australia&#39;s 1916-17 harvest is concerned, the farmers have received only 3s. 3d. per bushel. There may be a further small dividend to come, but they have had to bear a heavy loss, in regard to that year&#39;s returns. Moreover, from the beginning of the war the cost of wheat production has increased enormously. During the past three years of wheat-growing in New South Wales, the farmer has carried on at an actual loss; and, to-day the State Government is advancing &#163;1,000,000 to aid the man on the land to secure seed and actual sustenance. </para>

                <para>During the past three years, wheat production has been carried on at a loss. There has been an enormous reduction in the area tilled ; and, even at present prices, the circumstances of the farmer are far from happy. I have learned from an official source that the actual cost of wheat production in the United States last year totalled no less than 8s.11d. per bushel. </para>

Just as the Administration to which he was attached in the early stages of the war acted in those days, so would a Labour Administration act again to-day. In the preamble of the measure which passed through the Victorian Parliament at the initiation of the Wheat Pool it was set out that, with the approval of the Prime Minister and of the four Ministers of the wheat producing States concerned, the price to be paid for wheat in Australia would be equal to the London parity. However, the wharf lumpers went on strike, and refused to load ships with our wheat, when the London parity was 5s. 2d. What did the Labour Government do at that stage? </para>
                <para class="block">It reduced the price to. the Australian farmer to 4s. 9d. per bushel, on account of the wharf lumpers&#39; clamour. </para>

                        <para>- There has been a considerable reduction of production in Australia. Owing to the serious droughts experienced during the past few years, our dairy farmers have been obliged to buy fodder at almost famine prices.  I have in mind, in connexion with an earlier drought, the case of a woman in the Murchison district of Victoria. She had a herd of from thirty-seven to forty cows, and had to pay &#163;12 10s. per ton for fodder. Then when rain fell and grass came, she lost nearly one-half of her herd in a few weeks. These are some of the privations which our dairy farmers have had to put up with. We all know that the high cost of fodder at the present time makes it extremely difficult for many of them to carry on. And there is no eight hours&#39; system on a dairy farm. In view of  an&#39;  these difficulties, surely it is reasonable that our dairy farmers should get world&#39;s parity for their products. Honorable members opposite are always declaring that the labourer is worthy of his hire, and so I say our primary producers are entitled to a fair return. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition dealt extensively with the high cost of meat. We all know that this is due to losses. In New South Wales during the past few months stockowners have been obliged to pay heavy prices for fodder for starving stock, and then recently, as the result of very heavy rains, serious floods have caused tremendous losses. The Leader of the Opposition spoke also of the consumption of frozen meat. It is useless on his part to refer to the extent of our export trade. A few moments ago I looked up some figures in <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> to see what our export of meat really amounted to. I found that in 1914-15 we exported meat to the value of &#163;3,413,000; in 1915-16, to the value of &#163;769,000; in 1916-17, &#163;1,540,000; and in 1917-18, &#163;452,000. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of to-day there appears a statement that in Victoria, from 3rd June up to the end of last week, 17,700 carcasses had been taken out of cold storage for consumption in the city of Melbourne. I am not concerned with the price charged by the retailer. That is a matter for the State Government ; but I remind honorable members that frozen mutton was supplied to butchers at 51/8d. per lb. plus1/8d. for storage charges, or a total of about 5&#188;d. </para>

                        <para>- Well, that is a matter for the State, and not the Commonwealth Government. Although prices are at a high level in Australia, we must not forget that elsewhere in the world living conditions are not nearly so favorable. Recently I had a letter from a friend in the United States of America stating that prices there were extraordinarily high. Mutton was about 3s. 8d. per lb., , beef 4s. per lb., and potatoes ever so much dearer than in Australia. Altogether, according to this letter, conditions in America were quite abnormal, the cost of living being more than double that in Australia. I ain not giving the Commonwealth Government any credit for this. I believe that but for the drought the cost of living in Australia would have been very much less than it is to-day. But we have to realize the difficult conditions under which our pastoralists and farmers have been working in recent years. These are the causes of present high prices, though in comparison with people in any other country in the world we have no reason to complain. </para>

                        <para>-If the honorable member will tell us what he would do, it might make things a little bit easier. But, after all, our first duty is to try to buildup Australia. We are all proud of this country, and our natural desire must be to see it develop. This can only be achieved by giving every encouragement to our primary producers. Take the butter industry as an example. Those acquainted with the history of Victoria know how the valuable assistance rendered by the State Government enabled the agricultural areas to be prosperously settled. Australia is not, and never will be, a great wheat-growing country, but satisfactory progress may be expected by mixed farming ; a combination of grazing, wheat-growing, butter production, and kindred industries. The value of our exports proves conclusively that our progress depends upon our primary industries. In 1861, our exports totalled in value &#163;17,000,000; in 1881, &#163;27,000,000; in 1891, &#163;36,000,000; in 1901, &#163;49,000,000. At about this time the frozen meat trade began to develop in consequence of insulated space on steamers; being made available, and in 1911 our exports totalled &#163;79,000,000. &#39; In 1916-17, the figure was &#163;174,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- No. I have taken that factor into consideration, and I find that for the last five years preceding 1916- 17 the average annual value of our exports was about &#163;140,000,000. In 1917- 18, it was &#163;135,000,000, excluding  gold. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody can say that any substantial amount of this export trade can be credited to our secondary industries. . Almost the whole of it must be credited to our primary producers. Surely then it is our duty to encourage land settlement, the success of which up to the present has enabled the worker to command better conditions here than prevail in any other country. It is quite clear that an impoverished country means an impoverished people, so that it would be criminal on the part of any honorable member to countenance any suggestion as to placing an embargo on the export of our farm products or to do anything to injure our great primary industries. </para>

                        <para>- Then I must, of course, accept the honorable member&#39;s statement. The Government is charged with failing to keep its pledges to the returned &#39; soldiers and their dependants, but the figures presented to us last night by the Prime Minister make us wonder if there is any other country in the world that has attempted to do so much. When I heard- those figures I wondered where the money was to come from, because the amount is enormous, though no more than our boys deserve. Everything possible should be done . to place the returned soldier, if not in a better position, at least in as good a position as he occupied before he went to the war. I was a little disappointed in connexion with some of the proposals in this connexion, because I wished every returned man to have an opportunity to repatriate himself. Are we now, after the experience we have gained, going to ask honorable members opposite to take charge of this work of repatriation ? </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of opinion. When we are living in tragic times it behoves every member to be exceedingly careful, and to endeavour to protect the best interests of the country. We can always easily find trouble if we look for it; it is dangerous to look round to see if we can find some way of causing friction between Australia and another Power. However, the land settlement scheme for our returned soldiers has cost millions, and will cost many more, in view of the wonderfully generous proposals for homes and so forth. As to the gratuity, I agree with the Prime Minister, that there would have been created something in the nature of a financial panic if it had been paid in. cash. </para>

                        <para>- The Government went to the country on the clear understanding that the gratuity was to be paid in bonds, and I may say that, in my opinion, if it had not been for the extravagance of this and previous Governments, we should not have been in the wretched position of having to give bonds. There has been gross extravagance in the past, starting in about 1910, and continuing ever since; and every effort must be made to stop it. This Government, however, only follows on the lines of the previous Government. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt there is extravagance at the present time, but our financial position is being greatly aggravated by the industrial unrest. For this I do not wholly blame either the workers or the Government; but, unfortunately, by this unrest the country has lost millions and millions of money. In New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, on the other hand, we find a fine financial position, and I am afraid that here we have missed wonderful opportunities. It is, of course, easy to be wise after the event, but I believe something might have been done by the Government to mitigate the conditions which have arisen. I cannot, as I say, wholly blame the workers for becoming dissatisfied, in view of the high cost of living and the troubles attendant on appeals to the Arbitration Court. But is there a single instance of a strike where members opposite have urged the men to go back to work and comply with the laws of the country ? </para>

                        <para>- What relief would we get if honorable members opposite were placed in power? Every member of the community must comply with the law. We surely do not desire that laws should be observed by one section and not by another. As I said before, it is easy to be wise after the event, but I believe that much loss and trouble might have been saved if, when the cost of living was found to be increasing, the Government had appointed a Board composed of the Government Statistician and a couple of other experienced men. Such a Board could have issued quarterly statistics, showing the increased cost, and an Act could have made provision for wages being raised by so much per cent. I do not mean to say that if the cost of living increased 15 per cent. the whole increase should be made up in wages. That is a matter for consideration; but if some suggestion of the kind had been carried out, I believe that much industrial unrest would have been prevented. On the other hand, I think we are quite justified in condemning honorable members opposite for not using their influence to prevent much of this unrest. </para>

I have no desire to indulge in any  trimming,  but merely to tell the Government straight out what my &#39;opinions are. I refer the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to a book he published many years ago entitled <inline font-style="italic">An Orgie of Extravagance,</inline> -showing the extravagant expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth Government; and certainly since 1910 there has been a continual drift. I admit that during the past twelve months there has been, in many directions, a desire shown to economize; but the drift continues, and taxation is increasing. If taxation goes above a certain level, people with money are driven out of the country. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must admit that the taxation here is fairly well up to the limit, and now enlarge estates amounts to something like 15s. in the &#163;1, taking Commonwealth, State, and municipal taxation together; indeed, we are getting to that stage beyond which it would be exceedingly dangerous to go. I rather regret that the Government have not introduced a measure to impose taxation on expensive articles and luxuries, such as high-priced foods and hats. </para>

                        <para>- I was just going to refer to that matter. It is almost an insult to this House- that the vacancy created by the retirement of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> from the Ministry should have been permitted to remain unfilled so long. The conditions connected with the Treasury are such that a Treasurer should be appointed, and I hope that we shall get a man who will be able to come down here reasonably soon and explain what is the financial position of the Commonwealth. If, on the other hand, somebody is to be pitchforked into the position at the last moment, he will be able to give us only the information which the Treasury officials choose to give him, so that we shall then occupy much the same position as we have occupied hitherto. The sooner that the office of Treasurer is filled, the better it will be for all concerned, because we are justified in demanding - particularly in view of the speeches made by tie Acting Treasurer - the fullest information as to what our financial obligations really are, and how they are to be met. I mention this matter chiefly because the Prime Minister recently made an announcement in connexion with the proposed unification of the railway gauges of Australia. Had that proposal been brought forward prior to the war it would have commanded my solid support. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, and I quite realize that it is a matter upon which a compromise will have to be effected with the various States, Before the war. we should have been quite justified in proceeding with the work of unifying the railway gauges of the Commonwealth. But , to-day we are not. In view of the enormous sums which we have expended in connexion with the war, and with the knowledge that we were unable to pay our soldiers a war gratuity in cash, and that the Government are &#39;not prepared to advance further moneys for soldier settlement in Australia, we are not justified in proceeding with that particular work. I am given to understand that the Government have actually stopped making advances for the purchase of single blocks of land for repatriation purposes. Their action will cause a good deal of embarrassment to many of our returned soldiers. </para>

There, are returned soldiers who have gone through vocational training, and who have been waiting for .months- in some cases for more  than  a year - to get settled upon the land. These men. are now. told that the Commonwealth has stopped making advances for soldier settlement. </para>

                        <para>- When . this soldier settlement scheme was started, a very  grave mistake was made in failing to fix a maximum average price in the different States. At the present time, the average cost is very high in some of the States, whilst in others it is very low; and yet both are placing on the land an equal number of soldiers. I trust that the Government will make every endeavour to redeem their obligations to our returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not give any credence to the honorable member&#39;s statement, because of what I learned whilst I was representing the Government of Western Australia at a Conference which was held about a fortnight ago. A grievance I have against the Government is their failure to arrange for a uniform system of taxation which would effect an enormous saving in administration and to the public. Moreover, I want taxation of incomes on the basis of a five years average, which will be much more equitable than our present system. </para>

                <para>Another matter which ought to be dealt with by this Parliament is the Defence policy of the Government. Enormous sums are being expended at the present time for the housing of war material that is coming from the Old Country, and certain large works are being held, in abeyance. Upon page 91 of the report of the Economies Commission, it is pointed out that if we allow matters connected with naval, military, and air-craft work to remain in abeyance for the next three years, a saving of &#163;5,250,000 can be effected. That is a very large item. We ought, as speedily, as possible, to arrive at a determination as to what the future policy of the Commonwealth is going to be in regard to military matters. We should not incur any further expenditure until that policy has been actually determined. Recently, I drew attention to the proposed expenditure of &#163;80,000 on Arsenal Research Department buildings at Maribyrnong, which, I understand, when completed, will involve an expenditure of approximately &#163;700,000. If the project is commenced, additions will have to be made, and authority should not be given for the work to be undertaken until this House is in possession of the whole of the details. </para>
                <para>Honorable members have been waiting for some time to hear some pronouncement concerning our future Defence policy. <inline font-style="italic">Now</inline> the war is over and conditions are becoming normal, surely it is time to call a halt in the matter of Defence expenditure, particularly in view of the present international outlook and the apparent absence of immediate danger. After making certain necessary provision, I would be inclined to favour a go-slow policy in matters of Defence. I am not in possession of all the facts, and I do not know what scheme the Government intend placing before us ; but I think it is their duty to submit their Defence policy before we are called upon to deal with the Estimates. </para>
                <para>I wish to refer, very briefly, to a matter which I know will be of considerable interest to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman).</inline> I do not think the time is opportune to seriously consider the expenditure of a large sum in connexion with the establishment of a Federal Capital. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to deal with that question in the same way as I am dealing with the break-of-gauge problem, and to admit that, although it may be essential for the Government to carry out the work at some future date, the present time is inopportune to incur such expenditure, particularly when we have such grave financial obligations to meet. In connexion with Defence, a uniform gauge, and the building of the Federal Capital, it is time to go slow in an endeavour to meet our obligations. I do not want the time to come when we will be forced to consider repudiation and proclaim the country bankrupt. It is not my intention to delay the House any longer at this juncture, as I have already made my position clear in Regard to this matter. In voting, as I intend to, against the motion, I am not necessarily expressing my confidence in the present Administration. I wish the Government to know that, if any further embargoes are placed upon the export of our primary products, they are not likely to have my support. The only exception would be in the event of a shortage of wheat in Australia, in which case the Government would be justified in refusing to sanction exports until our own people were supplied. It would have to be understood, however, that in the event of such a contingency arising, the wheat-growers would receive the world&#39;s parity for their produce. Any action taken by the Government to prevent producers obtaining the world&#39;s parity for their produce will have my strongest opposition, irrespective of consequences. </para>

It is not fair that any one section of the community should be made to subscribe a large sum to our loans; everybody should contribute a fair proportion.

                    <para>.- I intend to vote for the motion, a statement which I think needs no explanation from me. For many years - ever since the Watson Government was in power - I have fought the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I have never trusted- him since that time, and even if to vote against him would consign me to political oblivion, I could not see my way to keep him at the head of an Administration. </para>

                <para>T intend to address most of my remarks to-night to the subject of political economy. At the outset I wish to say that I shall welcome the appointment of a new Treasurer. The other day in the street I was asked, concerning the telegrams between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Watt,</inline> which were being published in the newspapers, &#34;Who was the liar?&#34; My reply was, &#34; Both are splendid prevaricators, true descendants of Ananias.&#34; For deception I would back the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> against any man I ever met, read of, or thought of; but whatever he may do, not even his most inveterate enemy - and I have been that since the days of the Watson Government - will deny that he possesses a quality that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Watt</inline> never possessed, namely, courage. Could any man in this House imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> deserting his country in her hour of need, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> did, when far away on a mission where no man1 could for the time being fill his place? I do not care what the quarrel might have been ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> when in England was like a soldier with a duty to perform, and he betrayed his country, and was unfaithful in the great mission he was sent to fulfil. I have memories of him crowing like a cock on  a dunghill when he -beat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast</inline> at North Melbourne, and weeping like a lost child when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast</inline> beat him. So much for that gentleman, who, to use his own words, went &#34;into the void.&#34; That may be the entrance to Hades, for all I know. </para>
                <para>My leader has gone so fully into figures, which no honest man, if he checked them, could contradict, that I shall not have much to say regarding the cost of living. At least while the war was on, and they could use the War Precautions Act, this Ministry could have done anything they thought proper to prevent the cost of living from rising. I repeatedly asked that the owners of property should be prevented from unjustly raising their rents, but I was always met wi.th camouflage or subterfuge. My charge against the Prime Minister and his Government is that they never raised a finger to help those unfortunates who were badly treated by the landlords. The Prime Minister could find &#163;2,500,000 to spend on ships, without asking the permission of this Parliament, and could have found another &#163;1,000,000 if he had needed it. We have had it from the lips of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> that the Cabinet was consulted, but honorable members know my opinion of his statements. I do not believe that one. Rents at the present time are an infamy, not only in this huge city, but also in the larger capital of New South Wales. Honorable members, if they go into the slum districts, can see for themselves the conditions that obtain there. Here in Melbourne, in a street 9 feet wide, there are houses which would be condemned if they belonged to private land-owners, but because they belong to the gilded aldermen or councillors of the city of Melbourne, they are allowed to&#34; remain. There are four two-storied buildings with only one latrine for the whole of them. All the families in those houses have to use if. When the Board of Health does, move, and the council has a building pulled down, it does nothing for the housing of the unfortunates who are dispossessed. I am out against landlords unless controlled. That is why I object to the inaction of this Government. My experience is that Governments do not sufficiently study the health and welfare of the human beings who elect members to Parliament. </para>
                <para>The prices of food have gone up and up. There are transfers from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Merchant</inline> A to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Merchant.</inline> B. and then to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Merchant</inline> C, each of whom wants his little bit; and thus the public has  to  pay more and more. Why do not  we  follow  the  example  set  in older countries during  the  war, where they were forced  to  fix the prices  of  foods. The farmer should be allowed  a  fair price for his wheat delivered at  the  railway station, and  a  fair allowance should  be  made for the gristing of the flour  at the  mill.  The  flour should  be  sold  at a  fixed price, anil millers who would not sell1  to  bakers at that price - and that occurred1 in Melbourne - should be sent &#39;to gaol. </para>
                <para class="block">Flour has been refused to honest bakers in Melbourne -who wished to sell bread over the counter at a fair price, and the law could not compel the millers, to sell to them. The incident makes one think of that mayor of Paris who said, &#34; Let the people eat grass,&#34; and was hanged from a lamp-post with grass stuck in his mouth. The ,price of bread&#39; sold over the counter should also be fixed. In this connexion, let me quote what was said by my beloved friend, the Leader of His Majesty&#39;s Opposition in the Victorian Parliament, in a speech delivered in the Legislative Assembly on the 12th November last. Bread was cheaper then than it is now. He said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The remarkable thing is that, while the public are paying from 7d. to <inline font-style="italic">8$&#38;.</inline> per loaf for bread, the bakers can accept contracts for the delivery of bread to Government asylums and other institutions at 5&#163;d. and 5Jd. per loaf, and  they make a profit at the latter prices. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Lei the baker charge what he can get for the bread that he delivers, but let the Government fix the price of bread sold over the counter. Jonathan Hutchinson, one of the greatest surgeons that England ever had, and one of the greatest European surgeons that lived into this century, advocated in the late nineties the nationalization of bread in England, so that every individual could receive his or her quota. The best surgeon in his specialty in London was man enough to advance that theory. </para>
                <para>As for the price of clothing, was it not stated in the other House, and did not the information come out in a mitigated form in sworn evidence, that cloth manufactured in certain factories &#34;walked into the warehouses, turned right round and walked straight out again,&#34; to use the words of a song, its price being doubled and trebled in the process t Tweed made in Australia is sold as European tweed. Honorable members have heard of the warehouseman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson.</inline> He is a most- charming gentleman to meet, and I should be very pleased to go a journey with him. Still I think I am not doing him any injustice when I say that he tried to trip rae. From Allen&#39;s, or somewhere else, they came up with a letter from a country resident. Luckily they forgot themselves. There are such things as looking-glasses, and it is possible sometimes for a man to see what is happening behind him. That did not happen in my case, but I learned sufficient to know that something was afoot, and I did not accept an invitation to examine certain books. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> and I had some correspondence. I stated that the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox,</inline> a relative of the ex-Treasurer  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> had made certain statements at Geelong. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox</inline> had repudiated that, and asked me to withdraw. I am never afraid to withdraw any statement I make if it is shown that it is not true. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> to let me know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox</inline> really did say, because I had the excerpt from the papers before me. I said that if the statement made in his letter was in accord with my notes, I should be prepared to explain the matter at my next meeting. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> sent me <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox&#39;s</inline> letter, and to my astonishment that letter confirmed my statement. It contained no repudiation of that statement. Honorable members may have read of the wonderful challenge to contribute &#163;50 to the hospital if I did so-and-so. I think so much of hospitals that I am always willing, when I can, to secure such a donation as that for them. My answer was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson,</inline> the  chairman  of the warehousemen of Melbourne, had challenged me in a certain way. I have had some correspondence with the gentleman which was not satisfactory, and unless he made a statutory declaration that the statements in his letter were true I should take no further notice of him. I said it was an easy matter, to offer a challenge in connexion with something which involved the inspection of accounts by a keen accountant. By that time evidence had been given before the State Fair Profits Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> did not care to say that his statements were true, They were not true, and he knows it well. I charge him here to-night, as I have done on a public- platform, to swear an affidavit, and then I shall know what to do. </para>
                <para>Flinders-lane has been an absolute curse to the Anzac tweed industry. I am at present wearing a suit of tweed made by some of those brave boys who have been to the Front. They have never had a dog&#39;s show. The Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> in his rough but good-tempered way, told some of those under him that they were never to &#34; sell him a pup &#34; ; but I may inform the honorable gentleman that he was given a &#34; pup &#34; that was absolutely bloated with rottenness when he was supplied with the report of the Committee that dealt with the subject. Three of these men have denied the statements of the Committee. Sergeant Sinclair, a man who fought in the South African war, and offered his services in the last great war, was elbowed out of the Anzac tweed business because he stood up to a Minister and told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that he was wrong. He refused to put any rubbish into the cloth, on the ground that if he did so, no man who had any of it made up into a suit would call for more. I exhibited the yarn here, and I showed it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in the presence, thank goodness, of another member of Parliament. He said it should not be done. And if honorable members want to know the end of it, let them ask Buckley and Nunn where it was sent. </para>
                <para>Sinclair is starting a private company to-day, and I hope that honorable members who have a little money to spare will take shares in it. He has done what this mighty Government said they could not do. They said they could not give more than 500 lbs. of yarn per week to the returned soldiers. If the Government had given the returned men a chance from the first, I do not hesitate to say there would to-day be a thousand men in Melbourne earning from &#163;5 to &#163;7 per week. Men engaged in similar business are. earning in Glasgow and Aberdeen from &#163;4 10s. to &#163;6 10s. per week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> with a superior air, acquired, no doubt, in Flinders-lane, said that there was not a future for hand-woven tweed. What is the answer to the honorable senator ? It is that Burbury, the greatest maker of overcoats in the world, has entered into a ten years&#39; contract to take all the cloth they make. I should like honorable members to go down and see these men&#39; working. As to the cost of machines, a contract for twenty has been offered for &#163;15 each. I wish Sinclair luck. I know that he is an honest man. He stood up against this Government, and. against Senators Pearce and Millen when they used their vilest influence, and when in order to get him out of the business they had to resort to the contemptible camouflage that no one must be employed in the Anzac tweed industry unless he was a returned soldier of the recent war. The man to whom I refer had actually created the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was foolish enough to write to the press that there were no injured men employed there. As a matter of fact, at one time every man employed in the industry was an injured man, and the Minister for Repatriation had only to visit the factory to be aware of that. </para>
                <para>I ask those who come from the other side of the Murray to see for themselves how the Anzacs are being treated in that splendid factory in Sydney, where they manufacture not only woollens, but the very best of worsteds. They are under the Red. Cross authorities, and not under the vile Defence Department. They have been given fair play from the very first, and are now employing about 35 men. They have contracts for all that they can produce for the next two years. That is another answer to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> which I can hardly find words to condemn. Honorable members can get the address of this factory from a telephone book, and if they visit it they will see how happy these men look, and they can inspect the splendid material they are making. Their &#34;blueys&#34; might be sold as the very finest ever manufactured in the West of England. The warehousemen of Flinders-lane know what I mean by &#34;blueys.&#34; The &#34;nigger browns&#34; and &#34;nigger blacks&#34; turned out at this factory are magnificent, and I emphasize the fact that it has had no assistance from the present Federal Government. I wish the men engaged in the industry all success. They are assured of a plentiful supply of yarn from private companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sinclair</inline> has been able to get yarn from private companies, and has entered into a contract, although the Government said they could not supply more than 500 lbs. per week. I do not say that the Assistant Minister for Defence is responsible for what has occurred. I believe that he desires as sincerely as I do to help these men. I ask him to go and see them, and I shall be pleased if he will permit me to go with him. </para>

                <para>I have here an extract from last evening&#39;s newspaper referring to refund&#39;s made in connexion with sales of bran. I desire to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> McCay, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Gray4 and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hutchinson</inline> for the work they are doing. They  are doing splendid work, but not all they might do if they were invested with more power. They have to report to the State Government, and State Governments, like this created thing we call a Parliament, once elected, can delay and continue to delay. The people who are our creators for one day in three years have, after our election, no more power over us. When an election comes on, as one did on last Saturday, there is some little turmoil and upheaval. I find that some &#163;453 overcharged in connexion with sales of bran has been refunded. If these charges were unjustly made, why are not those who made them&#39; in gaol ? That is the best place for them. I quoted on a previous occasion a translation which will be found buried in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> somewhere, of a section of the criminal part of the Code Napoleon. That almost superman formulated his Code in 1812, and he seems to&#39; have foreseen the course which would be followed by the money spinners of the present time, because he provided in his Code that if any man or body of men conspired to secure the unjust raising of prices, the punishment should be 20,000 francs and six months&#39; imprisonment. Not &#34;fine or imprisonment,&#34; but &#34;fine and imprisonment.&#34; If the offence was the raising of the prices of food, such- as wheat, flour, wine, which in Prance is regarded as a food, and other articles of food, the punishment was doubled at 40,000 francs and twelve months&#39; imprisonment. The imprisonment of one of these firms, would -be more effective than the imposition of any fine. </para>
                <para>It may interest honorable members to know the character of the fines that are imposed here. I have a list of some which I quote from a return to 30th December, 1918, in continuation of a previous return showing separately the fines imposed. I find that under the Dairy Supervision Act there were 94 offences, and the fines amounted to &#163;70. Under the Health Act there were 36- offences, and the fines amounted to &#163;9- 3. Under the Factories and Shops Act the offences numbered 395, arid the fines amounted to &#163;521. Under the Weights and Measures Act there were 24 offences and &#163;37 10s. was levied in fines. Under the Bakers arid Millers Act there were 36 offences and the fines imposed amounted to &#163;117. These figures account for a total of 886 offences, and total fines amounting to &#163;1,680. This gives an average fine of &#163;2 for each offence. A penalty of one week&#39;s imprisonment for a second or third offence would have a far more deterrent effect than the imposition of a fine of &#163;2. </para>
                <para>Honorable members know of the dirty kitchens we have here. There are more in Sydney. In my early days in Paris I once saw a crowd gathered round a baker&#39;s shop window in which was exposed a placard setting out that the proprietor had been fined a certain sum for putting alum in his bread, or committing some other offence against the pure-food laws. Under the law he was required to allow that notice to remain in his window for two or three weeks. If we had such a law in operation here I am satisfied it would have a salutary effect. In this city  many  persons charged, with offences against the Health Act or the Pure. Foods Act pay the fines into Court with the object of escaping publicity. The press is the real guardian of the health of the people, since it does not hesitate to publish the names of offenders. I am told that in Berlin if a draper advertises goods under cost prices and a Government officer finds it false by an examination of his books, he is entitled to mark these goods at 10 per cent, below cost and to require them to remain in his shop windows until they are sold. The return from which I quoted a few moments ago contains the names of Harper, Angliss, and a number of other well-known business people. It also includes the name of Lucas, who was fined for not keeping food in a rat-proof storeroom. I have also a return for the twelve months ending 30th September, 1919, which shows, that during that period there were fifty convictions in Victoria for offences against the Dairy Supervision Act, and that the fines imposed amounted to &#163;45. There were 297 cases under the Health Act, and the fines imposed&#39; amounted to &#163;900. Under the Factories and Shops Act there were 360 cases, and the fines inflicted amounted to &#163;325. There were also 52 cases under the Weights and Measures Act, and the fines amounted to &#163;114, while there were 28 prosecutions against bakers and millers, and the fines inflicted amounted tq &#163;76. For the twelve months there were 742 cases under these Acts, and the fines totalled &#163;1,400. In other words, they did not average &#163;2 per case. With all due respect to many honest men who hold the commission of the peace, I cannot help saying that a lot of them do not play the game, and are not even commonly honest when they impose trifling fines for offences of this kind. When the people have the power, which I hope they will soon possess, we shall have a change. </para>
                <para>Coming to the question of immigration, I am sure that when the people here are happy - when we have plenty of employment offering and the opportunities for advancement are great - we shall welcome immigrants. There is one form of immigration, however, that does not appeal to me. My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast,</inline> Leader of  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, when speaking in that chamber on 12th November last, quoted the following circular: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, Manufacturers&#39; Buildings, 304-316 Flinders-street. </para>

                    <para>Dear Sir,</para>
                    <para>You are doubtless aware that at the present time a delegation sent out to Australia by the British Government, viz., <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Simm,</inline> Miss Pughe Jones, and Miss Chomley, is in Melbourne, making inquiries and collecting information respecting the opportunities of employment offering in Australia for women, of whom there is a large number in England to be provided for as a result of the. war. </para>
                    <para>Arrangements were made for the delegation to meet representatives of the sections of the Chamber in which female labour is employed, and this meeting took place on Tuesday last. when the position in regard to the shortage of female labour in Victoria was thoroughly demonstrated. </para>
                    <para>As a result, the Chamber has undertaken to place in the hands of the delegation reliable information as to the number of women that can be absorbed in the factories. </para>
                    <para>I therefore inclose a form for you to supply me with the necessary information, and have to ask you to return it immediately, as the delegation will be leaving Melbourne at the end of this month. </para>
                    <para>They have undertaken to forthwith forward the requirements of Victoria to London, with their recommendation, and have stated that the Government will be most careful in its selection. </para>
                    <para>Please give the fullest particulars as to the class of female workers you require, so that the representatives of the&#34; British Government may be in a position to know the exact requirements of the class of workers they are to send out. - Yours faithfully, (Signed) F. L. W. Ashby, Secretary. </para>

                <para>If we are to have immigration, let us have the sexes brought out in equal numbers. Already in Australia we have more females than males. In Victoria we have 751,020 females and 716,168 males, an excess of 34,852 females. The population of Australia comprises 2,566,932 females and 2,513,023 males, an excess of 53,909 females. Every truly Australian woman hopes to meet her mate, and to rise to the God -given gift of motherhood. If we are not to advocate polygamy it is therefore necessary for us to see that in connexion, with any policy of immigration adopted by the Commonwealth care is taken that the number of males to females shall be fairly equal. I recognise the difficulty prevailing in England at the present time. In London alone there are 1,500,000 more females than males, and my heart goes out to them. Thank God they are now able to vote. They are not the disfranchised slaves that they were when, as a young man, I was in England. The franchise of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales before the war was the vilest in the world, not equal on paper to that of China, Japan, or Turkey, because no man had a vote because of his manhood, but was entitled to exercise the franchise only when he owns or rents property. </para>
                <para>Let me deal now with the treatment of our returned soldiers. Was there ever a greater piece of camouflage than that resorted to by the Government when they declared that those who did not apply for the gratuity within six months would forfeit their right to it. I was a member of the Victorian State Recruiting Committee, and am the only one who remained a member of it from the beginning to the end. When we were on the recruiting platform we did not tell our young men that upon their return from the Front they would lose their rights unless they made the requisite application within six months of their return. We also told the boys that if they went to the Front the Government would see that their mothers were treated fairly. We did not tell those who had been born out of wedlock that their mothers would not get a pension in the event of their death. I thank the Government for what they have done in the direction of mitigating that vile enactment. The lonely woman who has not the help of a husband has often greater love for her boy, and has frequently to submit to greater trials, than her more fortunately situated sisters, and to say that such women should not be treated in the same way as the mothers who are legally married was a disgrace. Then, again, the war gratuity is described as an act of grace.&#34; Was it necessary for the Government to use that glorious word, with all its scriptural associations, to describe the war gratuity. I hope that our soldiers, who have been able to do more than I was permitted to do, will see that they and their dependants get fair play. </para>
                <para>When Major-General Bridges lost his life his widow received a &#39;special grant of &#163;4,500. Although he was a general he could make no greater sacrifice than did the private who gave his life for the cause. I should not have cared had Lady Bridges received &#163;20,000, but &#39; since she was granted &#163;4,500,, and her husband was receiving something like &#163;30 per week and a field allowance of 25s. per day, why should we not have been able to make the same grant to every woman who lost her husband in the great . war ? &#34; A special Act was passed to enable this grant to be made to Lady Bridges. Surely she had a greater chance of saving money out of her husband&#39;s salary of &#163;30 per week than had the widow of a private who received only 6s. per day. </para>
                <para>What is the cause of industrial unrest? Every right-thinking man - every mother of a family who knows the value of money and the cost of food and clothing - will say that when the price of food, shelter, and clothing goes up it is only reasonable that a man should ask for more wages. The men and women outside should follow the example that we recently set them. How can we blame a man for asking for a higher wage when the cost of living goes up ? If honorable members think that we shall always have industrial unrest, let us fix prices from time to time, and arrange that wages shall increase according to the increase of prices, instead of the workers having to go before the Arbitration Court as they have now. I voted for arbitration, and believe in it, but not as it is now carried out. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said, it is far too expensive, and there are too many delays in getting to the Court. In the Tramways case, I believe between &#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000 was expended before the Court could be reached; and then in a three-days&#39; strike the men obtained more than they got through all that waste of time and money. The fault of the present Arbitration Court is that it is not up-to-date, but instead of amending and improving it, we try to work with our old-fashioned methods, with all their faults. I cannot call to mind any other instance than that now occurring in Western Australia, where the public offices and the banks have been closed down, in any part of the British Dominions; but that has happened in Western Australia because the clerical slaves are getting tired of being slaves. </para>

                        <para>- I told the Manager of the Commonwealth Bank to his face, in the presence of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> what I thought of his methods; and I am sure that if the honorable member lived for 1,000 years he would never forget that incident. In that Bank young men and women were brought back night after night, and not even allowed tea money. I belonged, in my earlier years, &#39; to the staff of what was considered to be one of the smallest banks; but we were always paid ls. -6d. tea money when we worked back at night. Doctors in Collins-street have sent young men to me to make complaints. I have been asked, &#34;Is it fair that these young men should be worked like this?&#34; If&#39; any of them had dared to take part in a political meeting, of course they have not been dismissed for that offence, but they have been sent away to some small place in the interior. I have made inquiries about the conditions in the Commonwealth Bank in New South Wales, Adelaide, and Perth. I went over to the opening of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney to ask the Manager if he intended to give up sweating his bank clerks. After I had asked him that twice, he did not make a very happy speech. He is an autocrat. Who knows how much money the man called Kirkpatrick is getting from the soldiers by sending out standard plans for war service homes? It might foe worth while asking that question. Has he ever paid rent for his rooms in that splendid building? I do not care whether he is a relative of the Manager or not; but I object to men like him having all the advantages. Why is not the design of the bank to be built here thrown open to the competition of all the architects of Australia ? The best thing ever done by a Minister here was to send for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> from America in connexion with the competition for the design of the Federal Capital, and to turn down the abortion put forward by the robbers in the Government Service, who made a patchwork plan by picking the brains of one man here and another man there without acknowledgment. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. He knows that my vote is always available for him on that question. I remember the late Lord Forrest saying that no man should have the power that the Manager of the Commonwealth Bank has. Can any one tell me what rent  Kirkpatricks  pay for their big rooms in the Commonwealth Bank? The only way to remedy the evils of our present system is to introduce the initiative, referendum and recall. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want the honorable member to think that it would apply only to the question of increase of members&#39; allowances. It goes very much further. It would tend to make politics honest, and to make members mind . their p&#39;s and  q&#39;s.  It would enable the people to keep in their own hands the control, not only of members of Parliament but of public expenditure, both parliamentary and municipal. The municipality of Melbourne could run the city into a debt of &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;1,500,000 without consulting the people. The ratepayers have no control over them. One Melbourne newspaper, perhaps not designedly, made a great error in stating that the members of the French Parliament were paid only &#163;600 a year. According to a paper issued by the Empire Parliamentary Association prior to the war, the salary of a member of the French Parliament was, at the rate of 25 francs to the &#163;1, &#163;600 a year. This was increased in February of this year to &#163;1,080 a year. The French elections were held in November, and ours were held in </para>

                <para class="block">December. The members of the French Parliament raised their salaries in the February following, and we raised ours to almost the same sum in the following May. If the referendum, initiative and recall were adopted here, the people would have the controlling power, not only over members of Parliament, but over the Governor-General. They might be asked to say if he was worth &#163;10,000 a year, seeing that only &#163;15,000 a year is paid to the  President  of the United States, who rules over 100,000,000 people. The people would be able also to fix the salaries of State Governors, Judges, stipendiary magistrates, heads of Departments, Commissioners of railways, and so on. The&#39; people have to find the whole of the money. Why, then, should they not have a say in the spending of it? </para>
                <para>I recommend honorable members to visit the theatre opposite this building and see the picture called the &#34; Right to Happiness.&#34; They . must not think that the scenes of slum life shown there are overdrawn. They will see ten or eleven human beings in one miserable room. I was surprised to find the very respectable paper, known as <inline font-style="italic">The Illustrated London News,</inline> publishing a picture called &#34; Typical Overcrowding in East London.&#34; This shows an eating, sleeping and living room for father, mother, seven  children,  married brother and wife. Here is another picture showing the &#34; Winter sufferings of the Russian  bourgeoise  under Bolshevism.&#34; It depicts a family huddled in the kitchen for warmth, with the mother and baby on the stove, and the rest in chairs. There is, however, a second room, and the conditions are apparently better than in East London. These terrible pictures recall to me what I saw in London in my younger days. As the obstetric officer called on to bring another little life into the world, I had to go into a room 10 x II feet by 10 feet high in what is called the mews - that is, a room over stables. All the others in the room withdrew to give me a little more space, and stood in the doorway in the sleety winter night. I noticed that in each corner there was another little child.  I thought to myself, &#34; This city is the mighty centre of the Empire, and yet in it human beings cannot find proper accommodation for a woman in her glorious hour of motherhood.&#34; Professor Pepper, a few days afterwards, said that an ordinary working man on 18s. a week could feed his wife and one child fairly well, but that when the third, fourth, and fifth children came, there was no room for them in the one apartment which served for eating, sleeping, and washing. Those little children were sent out to what was called &#34; harden themselves.&#34; That i s how they got the little blue legs and big wrists and ankles, signs of what the Germans used to call the &#34; English disease &#34; - rickets. Professor Pepper, who won more gold medals than any other man at the London University, stated that the seventh, eighth and ninth children rarely had a chance of reaching adult age. That is slum life for you in a mighty Empire. Our party is out to wipe it out, and to tear poverty from the world. We can do it only by the aid of the referendum, initiative and recall, which will give the people power over Parliament. </para>
                <para>If we had the referendum, initiative and recall, would the people of Australia support the continuance of six Governors and a Governor-General ? Is it not current opinion that the present Governor-General was sent to Australia to do the work that Lord Denman would not do when the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> with a majority of only one in this House, and that one the  Speaker,  and an adverse majority in another place, wanted a double dissolution? Denman would not grant a double dissolution, but Munro Ferguson did. If the people had a vote, would they continue to pay him &#163;10,000 per annum as well as a huge sum for the upkeep of his position ? Do honorable members think that the people would vote for the continuance of six Agents-General and a High Commissioner? Can any honorable member mention &#163;500 worth of work that the High Commissioner does? I say nothing against Andrew Fisher, who, as an honest politician, has my affection and regard. But has the country ever benefited through the creation of the High Commissioner, and the continuance of the Agents-General? I lived in London for five years, and I know of no earthly good that the Agent-General for Victoria did in that time. I have spoken with artists who were driven from Australia to earn their living in another country, and whose work has made the name of Australia widely known, and they told me that they had never been benefited through the Agents-General. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking from my own experience, I doubt that. I admit that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid did splendid, work as High Commissioner to my personal knowledge in Coronation Year. We could dispense with the services of six Governors and six Agents-General. The only service the latter are able to render is to introduce some swell Australian&#39;s wife, who wishes to be presented at Court to some needy Dowager Duchess who, for a fee, will put the visitor through her paces, so that she may not commit the awful offence of turning her back on Royalty. I believe that the spectacle of these ladies practising their bows and curtsies under the coaching of a hired Duchess is most interesting. Honorable members have read of the trouble that occurred at the last Indian Durbar, when the Gaekwar of Baroda was supposed to have turned his back on the King. These social services are the only ones rendered by the Agents-General, and their offices could well be abolished. At the proper time, I shall move a motion for a similar reform in regard to the office of High Commissioner. I shall do that with no personal feeling against the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who is generally understood to be the next occupant of that office. But I am tired of the High Commissionership, and the heavy expense it entails. Australia House has cost this country nearly &#163;1,000,000. That is too much money to waste. In place of the Agents-General, I would appoint men whom the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent described as general agents, who would receive a fair salary, and a commission on business transacted. I should say to them in the words of a celebrated American, in his letters to his son, &#34; The letters I want from you when you are away are your orders for business.&#34; With men of that type there would be no further gallivanting about Courts in order to introduce wealthy ladies to the King and Queen. Those rich Australians who take up their residence in England are not the best friends of Australia. </para>

                <para>The problems of finance were different during the late war from those of any other war. If honorable members will turn up the banking records, they will find that in no previous war did the gold reserves in the banks increase. There is instance after instance of the Bank of England refusing to pay in gold. But in the late war, banks in the Homeland and in Australia increased their reserves ; and whilst 80 per cent, of our available manhood offered their lives, I do not think 10 per cent, of the wealth was offered. We have not yet got one-tenth of &#34; the last shilling.&#34; But I have a belief that we shall get that money sooner than se me people expect. The Wunderlich Company had a debit of &#163;4,000 in 1913, and to-day has a credit reserve of &#163;37,000. The Commonwealth Bank, controlled by a gentleman who receives a salary &#187;of &#163;80 per week, and &#163;2 2s. per day for travelling expenses, but who would not pay ls. 6d. as tea-money to clerks who worked at night, started in 1913 with a debit balance of &#163;45,000, and now shows a profit of &#163;2,363,000, which was made during the war. Burns, Philp and Company had a reserve fund in 1913 of &#163;206,000, which has been increased to &#163;667,000, whilst the pre-war dividend of 5 per cent, has been doubled. The Bank of New South Wales has increased its reserve fund from &#163;2,400,000 to &#163;3,425,000, and is paying a dividend of 10 per cent. The Bank of Australasia has increased its reserve fund from &#163;2,720,000 to &#163;4,102,000, and its dividend from 7 per cent, to 8 per cent. And so on. </para>
                <para>I see no reason why any man or woman who is in receipt of an income of over &#163;1,000 should object to. the fact being made public. Everybody knows the income of the King of England and Emperor of India; of the Prince of Wale9, who is playing the game like a man in Australia; the Judges on the Bench, every public official in Great Britain and Ireland, and even members of Parliament. Though the precise amount received by Ministers is not known to the public, everybody has an approximate idea of what each one receives. What reason is there for keeping secret the names of those persons . who pay taxation on incomes of over &#163;1,000 per annum? That information would afford Parliament an indication of how the taxation should be levied. To his great credit, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock published a list in which the taxpayers were indicated by numbers up to 259, and which showed the profits made by various companies and individuals prior to the war and in the first two years of war. In one instance, the increase in profits was 2,000,000 per cent. The then honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> questioned the accuracy of my figures when I quoted them, but he would not support his opinion to the extent of risking having to pay for a life-governorship in a hospital. Why should not the information prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock be supplemented and brought up to date. I ask the Government to indicate in a similar return the profits of various firms and squatters from 1913 onward during the years of war. When I made that. request to a Minister on a previous occasion, he would not agree to supply the information. Even if the Government cannot see their way clear to publish the actual names, it would be an advantage to the House to have a return indicating by numbers all the persons who were in receipt of &#163;1,000 per annum in 1913, together with their incomes in the subsequent years. It would be found that the vast majority of them had increased their incomes during the period of war. </para>
                <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> publishes in its &#34; Wild-cat Column &#34; from week to week the balance-sheets of various companies, and rarely, indeed, does it disclose a reserve fund that has not increased since the commencement of the war. We have been told by that splendid statist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> whose reputation extends throughout Australia and Europe, that whereas the property of Australia was valued at &#163;1,200,000,000 in 1913, it increased during the war to &#163;1,600,000.000. That increase of &#163;400,000,000 would pay our national debt; and whenever the opportunity arises, I shall act in accordance with the statement I made in this House as soon as it re-assembled after the declaration of war, that I would never vote to saddle the future millions of Australia with the burden of the interest on the war debt. If the&#39; unborn generations are obliged to carry that burden, the Kaiser and his battalions will have punished Australia for all time. I say that the wealth of Australia should pay the war debt. Eighty per cent, of our manhood offered their lives; 800,000 of our men offered themselves for active service; over 400,000 were accepted; over 300,000 left our shores; and 60,000 have never come back. I want to know now about that last shilling. How are we going to get it? &#34;With my banking experience, and having made a study of the banking system, I can confidently invite honorable members to read the particulars of the Banking Commission of the United States, which inquired into the affairs of every bank in Europe. It is obvious that if all the war debt were to be requisitioned it would destroy credit. Sudden actions and changes would not only destroy credit, but, in many cases, would cause loss of life. I am out to prevent that. There is the unearned increment. Why not let us say that we will have all property valued now, and that the increase for the next ten. years, or until the war debt shall have been wiped out, shall be drawn upon for such specific purpose? I have asked the keenest business men whether they would prefer to give one-fourth of their property forthwith in cash or be dispossessed of ten years of unearned increment. Honorable members know full well what was their answer every time. </para>
                <para>I hope that, since this House has done that which no other Legislature under the British flag has ever done - that is to say, has agreed to the most momentous motion ever carried by any Parliament, namely, that for the establishment of the principle of the referendum and initiative - honorable members will now assist me to have that principle put into working order. It is a plank of the platform of the great party to which I -am attached, and it is a plank  of the platform of the Nationalist party. I welcome the Country party, and I hope it will amend its policy so as to come into line with the other two parties. Its members should be prepared to trust the people. If we were to give to the people the power to initiate legislation I would look forward with confidence to glorious days for Australia. I would be prepared to seriously consider offering a post of great responsibility to that greatest organizer of machinery and labour the world has ever known. I allude to Henry &#39; Ford, of America, who was told that ho could not employ a larger unit than 5,000 men, but who did so; who was told that he could not make an automobile for &#163;40, but who did so; and who, for the payment of one dollar a year, turned the whole of his machinery over to the welfare of his country, when the United States of America declared war. Money could have no value to a man who has made Ford&#39;s millions. When labour troubles occurred, his critics said he would not be able to carry on, that he would be beaten; but he was not beaten, and the unions did not object to his carrying on. He fixed the minimum wage of the sweeper-out of his factory at &#163;1 a day. If &#91; had the power, I would be inclined to invite Ford to come here and govern Australia. He would do it, perhaps, for the maximum salary of one dollar a year, for the honour and love of the task. And, so, he would set Australia going as a great, co-operative Commonwealth; for that is the only way in which to eliminate poverty from our midst. </para>
                <para>I commend to honorable members the last book published by that wonderful man, Alfred Russell Wallace. In his 93rd year he penned these words, &#34; The State should be the heir of all property.&#34; There is the thought which, in the minds of men, will grow. The State has never yet sold its property, nor the right, of taxation. In the words of the elder Napoleon, in his Code, property is that which is movable and immovable. I can remove my watch from taxation, but I cannot remove my house and my land. We hear threats of the removal of capital. Property cannot be moved, and I ask the wealthy to consider seriously the advantage to them of the referendum, the initiative and re: call. The shadows are creeping. The first shadow in Australia is being thrown by the happenings in Western Australia at this moment. Let us have the referendum, the initiative and recall. That will enable this nation to bring about reform by gradual change. What an insult it is to the intelligence of the people that this Parliament should permit them to vote upon a referendum! We say it is the most glorious thing iri the world to be the servants of the people. Why do we not embody in our Constitution provision for the people to have the right to initiate legislation? If we did, this &#34; fool &#34; game of Parliament, as carried on now, would cease to exist. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the expression. I have patiently listened to the various speeches delivered since the launching of the motion, and I have closely examined the reasons set forth in its support. I have wondered how the so-called Labour party was going to support, particularly paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of the motion, and at the same time be consistent. In the first place, it is complained that the Government has failed to reduce the cost of living. It has been amply shown in this House that the cost of those commodities which were specifically referred to during this debate is lower in Australia than anywhere else; and those commodities are primary products. The complaint set forth in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of the motion has to do with the alleged failure of the Government in regard to obtaining better prices for commodities sold overseas. It has also been shown in this Chamber that the commodities disposed of overseas, particularly our wheat, have been sold at considerably greater advantage to the Australian producer than that portion which has been disposed of at home. If there were to be a further reduction in the cost of living, enforced by the methods proposed by the extreme Opposition in this Chamber, the effect would be to disadvantage the primary producer even more than to-day. In other words, if there were no consumption of wheat in Australia, our primary producers would be receiving double that which they are actually getting for the portion of their wheat which is consumed within the Commonwealth. If there could be a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> between the primary producer and the other sections of the community we should have something like fair play. But since the primary producer gets no advantage in return the position is grossly unfair to him. And why is this so? Because he has not political strength enough to demand consideration. Honorable members of the extreme Opposition represent the interests of the consumer only, for they declare that after his needs are provided for, the primary producer is at liberty to get as much as he can from the other fellow. </para>

                        <para>- He is prepared to pay a reasonable price, but honorable members opposite expect him to buy in the dearest market and sell for home consumption at a price determined by them. In this way they talk about building up a two years&#39; supply by a kind of confiscatory method at the expense of the producer. If those who advocate this theory would undertake to give the farmer cheaper labour, cheaper machinery, cheaper clothing, and generally cheaper living costs, as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> the consuming public, outside the producers, would be justified in expecting Australian products at a cheaper rate. But what is the position? We cannot employ black labour, nor do we want to do that, as we are in thorough agreement with honorable members opposite in regard to the White Australia policy; but we complain that they are not with us in this principle, for they would have us work like blackfellows, and, moreover, they would, in effect, seize our property, by claiming that we must sell to Australian consumers at a cheaper rate than to any one else. To-day the Australian consumer is getting food at a cheaper rate than that at which it can be produced elsewhere by black labour. Honorable members opposite must clearly understand that members of the Corner party are out to defend their interests, and as an impartial representative - I claim to be that - I say that all we desire is sound government. When I spoke first in this House I declared that this little party of oura stood for sound government, irrespective of party, and I say that while members of the Government talk in a manner to indicate that they know what the primary producer requires, they have not yet given proof of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline></para>

                <para>Every honorable member in this House must admit that finance is the most important question for consideration to-day. The financial position of Australia is appalling, and in grappling with it honorable members should rid themselves of all party ideas, and, on behalf of the people, endeavour to get under this burden. The only thing to do is to produce more original money. Let us assume, for a moment that every honorable member of this House was possessed of &#163;1,000 - I am not referring to their salaries - and that we locked all the doors and windows of this chamber for twelve months. At the end of that term the aggregate of the wealth would be the same, though no doubt some of the abler men might have more than others. Wow, that is just the position Australia is in. No artificial methods will gain for us the additional wealth necessary to lift this burden from the shoulders of the people. We must keep the doors unbolted and the windows open in order to get additional original wealth, and we cannot continue to prosper unless we adopt a progressive policy. </para>

                    <para>Prices for all grains have risen sharply, and many predict a world-wide scarcity. Undoubtedly the dearth of farm labour will seriously affect the yield of the coming crop, there having been a general movement of labour to the cities throughout the country, owing to the higher wages obtaining in tie manufacturing centres. Reports from the Argentine show an enormous demand for wheat for export at advancing prices, and there has been talk of an embargo on wheat at Argentine ports. </para>

This isAustralia&#39;s opportunity, as a producing country, to insure a greater output, , and thus increase the wealth so necessary to cover our national obligations. There is, as the Prime </para>
                <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> says, only one method by which we can retrieve the position, namely, by working and producing. To-day I heard some honorable members opposite refer to the high rents now prevailing. I have sympathy with those who have to pay high rents, but I cannot help thinking of the position of our farmers who are obliged to work long hours and are expected to sell their produce for home consumption at about half the world&#39;s price; while the worker is asking for shorter hours in erecting cottages and other works. We must recognise the great obligation that rests upon us, and endeavour to work harmoniously for the development of this country, with a full recognition of the rights of all parties. I believe that, on my property, I give more satisfaction to my men than most people, for I pay the highest wages that are going, and a bonus to my permanent men.I endeavour, in this way, to give them an interest in the farming operations. </para>
                <para>My sympathy goes out to every man who is honest and straightforward ; but I am afraid that there is too much party feeling dividing Australia at the present time and hampering our progress. We have a splendid opportunity, now that the war is over, of getting back to those peaceful activities that will bring wealth to Australia. I have received many letters from labouring men , upon this subject. One communication is from the Australian Coal and Shale Employees Federation, in relation to the Tariff. Doubtless other honorable members have received the same communication. The federation sets out the facts as they affect the miner. </para>

                    <para>You will therefore see that if the Tariff becomes operative as set out, the price of explosives imported will immediately increase in price, and as the miner has to purchase the explosives, it will affect him, and not the coal-owners. Consequently, the miner is not disposed to bear the increase. </para>

                <para class="block">Of course, he is not disposed to bear the increase. I have had another communication from the Collie coal miners in Western Australia. There are Tariff duties on coal-cutting machines and similar appliances; and, to my mind, that is only tinkering with the most important industry we could have within our borders. It is claimed by the Miners Federation and by the Collie coal miners that these imposts increase the cost of this most important output; and yet, at the same time, the Prime Minister tells us that the only way out of our financial difficulties is to increase production, and thus create greater wealth. Is it consistent, is it statesmanship, is it wise legislation to burden the people who are asked to produce this greater wealth? Would it not be wise to afford them every opportunity to develop the industry? These questions are, to my mind, of paramount importance. </para>
                <para>I am extremely sorry to have noticed that so much time is spent on sectarian questions in this House. I have been here for a few months now, and have heard a great deal on sectarian matters from the extreme Opposition, and I have also heard the Prime Minister speaking on the same subject. I would like to say in the most dispassionate way that it would be just as well for us to understand each other here, on these great question?. It would be a good thing if members wove to try to differentiate spiritual religion from subjects which trench on matters which come within the jurisdiction of this House. Within recent times, people associated with the persuasion referred to more particularly, have regarded this intrusion on matters outside religion as going too far ; even co-religionists take exception to this clerical trenching on matters political. I am Australian born, and have lived here for just on fifty years, and I feel that, the Australian people desire every soul in the country to have perfect freedom in the matter of religion - desire that there shall be no trenching on the right of all to worship as they please. </para>

I do not say this for political aggrandizement, but in very recent years a very serious affront has been laid on me, as well as others, by a particular Church - by the introduction of the <inline font-style="italic">ne temere</inline> decree. Those who examine that decree closely must see that it is an affront to the clergyman of other Churches, including my own Church; and, in any case, this is a matter for those who make the laws. </para>

                        <para>- There has been too much bluff of that kind in this House, and my desire is only to speak honestly and fairly. If it is said that a marriage effected by a certain Church in Australia - a country where every one is free - is not a marriage, and that the parties live in sin, an affront is placed on the clergy of that Church, on me, and others who desire to live in peace with all men. It is loathsome to have to refer to these questions, but they have been raised in this House. </para>

                        <para>- I knew that would be said, but, as a matter of fact, I am speaking against sectarianism. Since i have been a member of this House the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> according to the press, has actually stood by and applauded a priest who said he would cause as much trouble as he could in Ireland and Australia until he got what he desired. What has poor Australia done that she should have so much trouble over such matters? Are those who are the cause of this trouble not judged out of their own mouths? Why should there be this cry from the honorable member? I am trying to remedy the present state of affairs if possible, and immediately I find the charge of sectarianism thrown at me. It reminds me of the days of my youth, when an elder brother frequently thought it advisable, during the course of our play, to hit me on the nose. On such occasions I would cry out very loudly in order to attract the attention of my mother, who had considerable strength; and, when I heard her footstep approaching my cries became inaudible, as I thought of the thrashing she would give my brother. However, when my brother saw the &#34; boot &#34; he immediately started yelling, and on my mother&#39;s arrival, he accused me of having hit him, and I got the &#34;walloping.&#34; That seems to me to be a very fair representation of the position in regard to sectarianism. </para>

                <para> I refer to these matters because I realize how much better it would be for the peace of this House, and the peace of Australia, if these sectarian questions were not raised. I am speaking seriously, without any feeling of hatred; I have no spirit of malice towards any living soul in the country. Many people of the Roman Catholic persuasion are my friends, and I hope to have them remain my friends. What&#39; I desire is that the Churches of Australia shall keep to themselves, teaching as much Christianity as possible to the people, and leaving the politicians to do the other business. This would be of infinite advantage; and we have only to read the history of other countries to learn that such intrusion on matters political has not proved of any advantage to the Churches guilty of it or to the country. </para>

                        <para>- Both Houses, if the honorable member likes; but I see difficulty in having a dissolution of both Chambers under the Constitution as it is while the present Government is in power. I fail to apprehend under what circumstances there could be such a difference of opinion between the two Houses as would lead bo a double dissolution, and until there is a Government in power with views quite different from those of the majority of members in another place, it seems to me impossible. Unless another place op-&#39; poses the legislation of this House we can-&#39; not have that clash which would lead to the very desirable result of sending honorable members of both places to face the electors. </para>

It was suggested by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> - if. I may refer to him as &#39; &#39; Acting Treasurer &#34; when there is no Treasurer-, and it is impossible to have a person acting for some one who does not exist - that the motion was introduced because of the pending-election at Ballarat. I need hardly say that the Labour party is in no need of adventitious aid, particularly at a by election ; the Labour party must rely on its own record of achievement on its own positive quality , and not. on the negative quality of the Government opposed to it. </para>

                <para>I&#39; congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on the time he has chosen for making his attack. It&#39; synchronises with the decision of the electors of Ballarat, for which constituency a. Labour candidate will he returned on. Saturday with a majority,I think, of. more than 1,000 votes over all opponents:. That is a fact honorable members should allow to sink: in.&#34; The electors of Ballarat, after an experience of nearly seven months of this. Government, are able to judge it in the light of the pledges given by its members and supporters to the electors on the 13th December. . The electors are able to judge the: Government in. the light of the removal of that mass of misrepresentation with which the Government endeavoured to cloud the issue when facing the electors in December last. . The Labour party has succeeded in the Ballarat. elections against the combined opposition of the Government supporters, the Country party in the Corner, and both sections of the press.. However, I am not quarrelling with the press . In the circumstances I am very pleased! that we were opposed by both sections of the press, because it convinces me that the strength of the case for Labour was so strong- that, despite all that . opposition and despite all the attempts that were made to stir up bitterness and sectarianism, the electors, of Ballarat stood firm and gave a more pronounced decision, in favour of Labour than they had! ever given before. </para>

                        <para>- I shall; deal: with that matter a little later. What I am concerned with now is not who is. right in the dispute between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the late Treasurer. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> I think that probably they are. both right in. their opinions of each other. At. all. events,, they ought to know each, other pretty well, by now. What I am concerned, with is the fact that at a very critical period in the. history of this country, when there are many important matters to be attended to on the other side of the world, we are left without representation because Ministers are quarrelling with one: another. When we raised our voices against, that we were told &#34;This is merely a family quarrel.&#34; But when the Prime Minister wishes to get some corroboration of his own. statement in regard not say that it is merely a family quarrel. He then says, &#34; I want my honor- able friends, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party, to edit these cables.&#34; Why? Because he knows that the people of Australia do not trust him, and because he recognises that unless those gentlemen affirm that they have seen the cables in question, nobody will believe him. Now we are told that the trouble is &#34;a mere family quarrel.&#34; </para>

                <para>Some very capable, comprehensive, and trenchant speeches have been delivered upon this motion by honorable members upon this side of the House. I do not intend to traverse the ground which has already been- so admirably covered by them. But I do wish to make a few observations in regard to the nature of the criticism which has emanated from the Prime Minister and from members; of the Country party. The Prime Minister&#39;s speech was very well summed up in a leading article, published in one of the Melbourne daily newspapers to-day. In speaking of it, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says very pithily- </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It was a loud sententious speech, designed to. give the Government a fine advertisement, to smooth down the ruffled feelings of the Country, corner and to inflame the passions which served political purposes during the war, but which now intensify the divisions amongst the people that true- Australians must necessarily deplore. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is still using <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mannix</inline> as a political scarecrow, still posing as the champion of the mighty Empire which stands unshakable before all the winds that blow and in his own puny strength guarding it from destruction. </para>

                <para class="block">That is not my description of the speech made by the Prime Minister. It is that of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, and I indorse it.

                <para>What is the nature of the criticism which has emanated from my honorable friends of the Country party? I have listened to the speeches of three members of that party, and if I am any judge of the nature of those deliverances, those members are not going to vote together upon this motion. But while they endeavoured to make good their own case, either intentionally or unintentionally they misrepresented the platform and programme of the Labour party. It very often happens that a wrong impression is conveyed to the people by the use of language which can be misunderstood, and which, if not misunderstood, can be misrepresented. It has been suggested by members of the Country party that honorable members upon this side of the chamber are not concerned with the interests of the primary producer. But anybody who studies the platform of the Labour party will find that it is built upon an understanding that the interests of the producer and consumer are identical, that the natural allies to form any party are the producer and the consumer, eliminating the middleman. I want to remove any misapprehension that may exist in the minds of honorable members as to. what our attitude is upon this matter.. </para>

                        <para>- The motion was evidently well considered by the leader of the Opposition, because it covers not only the sales of Australian products overseas, but also what has happened within the borders of Australia.. The honorable member for Yarra charges, the Government with general incapacity. It is for every honorable member to say whether or not he can support the charge. But I wish. to deal now with the positive programme of the Labour party rather than with the sins of the Government. I repeat that the programme and platform of the Labour party is based upon a recognition that the interests of the producer and consumer areidentical.The producer and the consumer are natural allies, and the middleman, whom members on the Treasury bench represent, is the common enemy of both. My honorable friends in the Country corner have shown by their statement of their own case that their party is not fitted to hold the reins of government in this  country.  Can any party claim to govern the country which, upon its own confession, represents only a section of the people ? The Leader of the party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> have affirmed that they represent the primary producer only and not the consumer. They have declared that the Labour party represents the consumer. I say that we represent both the producer and the consumer, who are natural allies. </para>

                        <para>- I say it, because our platform and programme show it. No party can claim the right to govern Australia unless it stands for the interests both of the producer and the consumer. On their own statement of their case, the members of the Country party do not pretend that they stand for the consumer. They stand only for the man on the land whereas the Labour party stands for both. There are many members of our party who represent the primary producing interests of this country. Any honorable member may run through the list himself. There is the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls),</inline> the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle),</inline> the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham),</inline> the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> and others. They are the living evidence that the primary producers of this country recognise  that the Labour party stands for the interests of the producer and consumer alike. It is very important that the people of Australia should understand that the basic foundation upon which our programme is built is a sound one. We show it in our platform and our programme. But members of the Country party do not claim to stand for the interests of the people in the city as well as of those in the country. </para>

                        <para>- That is where the honorable member is wrong. They &#39;ive not in conflict. The producers of the country can be treated unfairly, and so also can the consumers. The producers of Australia have been treated unfairly by the Government in that they have not obtained an adequate return for their &#39; primary products which were sold overseas. That is quite a consistent attitude to take up. in a country which produces a large quantity of the necessaries of life. It is only just, however, that those who live in that country should be able to purchase the commodities which it produces at a reasonable price, which at the same time will allow a fair return to the producer. We require prices which give a fair return to the producer, and provide the consumer with commodities at a reasonable price. What is the position to-day ? The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> stated during the course of his speech that we were exporting certain necessary commodities to foreigners at a cheaper price than they are being sold to the- people of Australia. </para>

Perhaps there are one or two members of the Country party who are prepared, to assist us. We call honorable members occupying the corner benches the members of a party, but we find that when the division bells are rung there is usually a sufficient number of those honorable members on that side of the chamber to keep this middleman Government in power. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I again ask the honorable member for West Sydney to resume his seat. It is my duty to call the attention of the House to another important matter, and that is that the presiding officer in this chamber cannot be expected to maintain order unless he is supported by the Government, to which he has to look to to take the necessary action if his directions are not carried out. If the Minister in charge of the business breaks the rules and ignores the Speaker&#39;s appeal to maintain the Standing Orders, the position becomes intolerable. If I cannot receive that support the time has certainly arrived when I shall have to seriously consider my position.&#39; </para>

                <para>In considering the charge levelled by the Leader of the Opposition, which is one of general incapacity, with specific sub-heads, it is necessary, particularly in view of what I hope will be the final result - a general election in the not distant future - to seriously consider the record of the Government. What is their war record? I have said on previous occasions that this Government have failed in their duty in every important particular in connexion with the carrying on of the war. We need only revert to the question of conscription, and recall the turmoil that was brought about on that occasion. We. know that the policy of conscription really interfered with the efficiency of Australia during the war period. We know how the Government broke pledges, and how they said they would not be able to carry on unless they possessed certain powers. Shortly before the last general election the Prime Minster said that unless the Government were granted those powers he would not carry on as Prim* Minister. But he is still carrying on, merely because honorable members of this House allow him .to do so. We cannot .shirk our responsibilities in this matter, and I propose to show how the action of the Government is affecting our position overseas, and particularly our credit. We know that Australia, through the failure of the &#39;Government to do their duty during the war period, expended over &#163;200,000,&#39;000 more than its fair share .in comparison with other overseas Dominions. Why should that be? </para>

                        <para>- It is well to remind the Acting Treasurer of the facts, because Australia to-day is heavily in debt, and .that is why taxation is mounting up. The Government failed, and they are continuing to fail, and I shall say 1 something new directly which, perhaps, the Acting Treasurer will not care to hear. We know of the great losses that were incurred .owing to the absence of business methods in this connexion with contracts for the construction of -wooden ships in America. We know .the losses the producers suffered owing to Australian produce being  sold  at lower prices in Britain than in other portions of the Empire, partly in .consequence of the loose contracts made .over the cables. The Prime Minister produced -some of the cables and said that they did not embody loose contracts. Lf they were not loose, why was the late Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> sent to Britain to adjust our accounts&#39;? </para>

                <para>During the war period the Government deprived Australian citizens of their rights by carrying on a system of petty tyranny under the War Precautions Act, and which they are still doing. Every honorable member who casts his vote in support of the Government is responsible  for  the manner in which the WaT Precautions Act has been administered. &#39;The Government allowed the &#39;profiteer to wax rich -while &#34;prices &#39;were soaring higher &#39;and higher. We know also of the misrepresentation which led to this Government being returned to power at the last election1. I do not wish to go into that- subject in regard to myself or to the State of Queensland, as I think on previous occasions I have answered the charges that have been made from time to time. The State of Queensland was supposed to be on the verge of ruin under the Labour <inline font-style="italic">regime;</inline> but it is well to remember that on the day after the last Federal election the Queensland Government  floated  J&#34; a loan in London that was nearly twice, oversubscribed. The&#39; balance-sheet of Queensland on the 30th of June this year shows a surplus of &#163;28,000. whilst New South Wale3 as a result of Liberal government has shown a deficit of &#163;1,800,000. We know this Government is in office by deceiving the people and by misrepresenting the Labour party. Since the Government have been returned to office they have continued with the same old methods and the same old  policy.  They are still allowing the profiteer to go on unchecked, and the Prime Minister - who was going to resign if his referendum proposals were not carried - still says that he has not the power to check profiteering. I have on previous occasions pointed out that these powers are possessed by this Parliament, and that it can deal with profiteering. The authority is contained in section 51 of the Constitution, and the two main points relate to census statistics and taxation. By using those powers the Government could make profiteering unprofitable. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to leave the matter to the judgment of the people. If the honorable member thinks that he can deceive the people with an interjection of that sort, he fails to appreciate the intelligence of the general public. My proposal asks for specific statistics, and for specific punishment for any failure to make returns, or for making false returns. It would enable the public to see the cost of every imported and every locally manufactured article, and thus each individual could protect himself, because he would know whether he was being profiteered against, and the strong arm of the law could make profiteering impossible. Federation was brought about to secure uniformity of action in certain matters. It would be detrimental to some industries if one State could take one set of steps to deal with a matter, and another take different steps, or no steps at all. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows well that in Queensland very effective steps were taken to cope with profiteering, in the interest of consumer and producer alike. But let us not be drawn from the main point, which is this, that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to deal with this matter, and is not dealing with it. It is our duty to make that clear to the public. We know that, during the war, the Commonwealth Government had power under the War Precautions Act to do what was needed. Did Ministers use it ? We know that they did not. They are still using the Act to interfere with the liberty of the subject, but they will not use it to interfere with their friends the profiteers-. The responsibility for this inaction rests upon every member who supports the Government, just as the responsibility for the extravagant expenditure that is going on also rests upon them. What steps have been taken by the Government to secure economy ? Have any been taken ? None. Has our expenditure on defence been reduced? </para>

I appeared not long ago, or endeavoured to appear, in Sydney, for a certain reverend gentleman, whom it was proposed to deport. I am not going to trench on any matter that is before the Court; or likely to come before the Court ; thei matters I shall refer to are not within the ambit of questions that come before theCourt in this case. A make-believe inquiry - I use the term advisedly - was ordered. No representation was allowed, although I claimed that my client had the right to be represented by counsel. I waa not allowed to examine or cross examine anybody. There was no charge laid, though. I claimed that there should be a specific charge, and that it should be tried before a jury. I was graciously allowed to sit and listen to the evidence. </para>

                        <para>- They are not. The writ that has been issued has to do with ascertaining whether the Commonwealth Executive has power to do a certain thing, namely, now that the war is over, to deport. The question whether it has that power has nothing to do with the manner in which it exercises it, assuming that it has the power. I am assuming that Ministers have the power. No opportunity was given to me to cross-examine witnesses. I was allowed to listen to the evidence that was given, every tittle of which was in favour of the reverend gentleman whom it was proposed to deport. I have challenged the Government to place the evidence on the table, and they have refused to do so. Are honorable members going to allow that sort of thing to continue! </para>

If the honorable member is alluding to the reverend gentleman whose case is still pending for further reference to a higher judicial tribunal, I can only say that it is not advisable that he should do so. I understood his assurance to be that he was not referring to that gentleman in any way in the remarks he was making. If he was doing so, I must ask him not to continue to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, sir, I have every respect for your suggestion, but I should like to impress upon you - and I am sure you will appreciate my motive in doing so - that it would be very unfortunate if, because some pure legal question is raised in a Court, for that reason the whole conduct of the Executive in connexion with a matter which is not being litigated in any Court at all, and has nothing to do with the questions before the Court, should be prohibited from being discussed. I will give you, sir, an illustration of what I mean. </para>

It is quite clear that I cannot permit him to raise a matter which I ruled to be out of order when raised in another way by a different honorable member. No reference to the reverend gentleman whose name was mentioned this afternoon, whether directly or indirectly, in connexion with a case that is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> can be permitted in the course of this debate. I therefore again ask the honorable member under the circumstances existing at the present time not to make any further reference to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I regret the interruption, but in deference to your ruling, sir. I pass on from the subject to which I was referring to the general conduct of the Executive in regard to deportations. It is not only in one case that the Executive have dealt unfairly with persons to be deported. I should be very sorry to confine my remarks to any one particular case. I say that since the war the Executive of the Commonwealth have deported quite a large number of persons, who lived for many years in Australia, without according them the right, which I say they have, to a trial before a jury of their countrymen. Honorable members opposite by allowing the present Government to remain in power are allowing them to set aside the provisions of <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Ever since then, it has been claimed that it is one of the bulwarks of British liberty that every one should have the right to trial by a jury upon a specific charge. Do honorable members think that it is a fair thing that, on some vague ground, persons who appeal to them as Britishers to give them a trial and make some definite charge against them should be deported from this country? Honorable members opposite refuse to do so, because each and every one of the supporters of the Government is as responsible for what is taking place in this connexion as is the Minister who actually signs the&#39; order for deportation. I hope that honorable members opposite will realize their responsibility. The matter is one of great seriousness, apart from the appeal to the conscience of honorable members, and quite apart from any consideration of their position in the different electorates. </para>

It is stated in the press that Australia&#39;s share of the payment to he made under the Nauru Island agreement has been handed over. I want to know under what authority that payment has been made. Is it under the authority of Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- Then, under what authority has it been made? We are told in the press that a sum of about &#163;1,500,000 has been paid over, and has been paid without the authority of this Parliament. No provision was made for it on the Estimates. What have our friends of the Corner party to say to this? The authority to make the payment is not contained in the Nauru Island Agreement Act. That Act does not make the amount a charge on the Consolidated Revenue, and yet it has been paid over to a private company. When the Bill was before the House the Prime Minister said, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 24th September, 1919, page 12680- </para>

                    <para>If I gave too low a figure I should mislead the House, and if I gave a figure higher than that which it is worth, it would be used by the company in the proceedings before the arbitrator, or in their negotiations with the Secretory of State. I did, however, mention a figure to the Secretary of State, beyond which we are not prepared to go without consultation. If the matter comes down to a direct affair, and is not referred to arbitration, that figure, of course, will be presented to this Parliament, which can express its own opinion on it. </para>

                <para>That amount, we are informed, was agreed upon; but the question of its payment was never brought before the Parliament. Parliament has been flouted. The money was paid over by the Acting Treasurer without reference to the Parliament. And members of Parliament, who have the responsibility of watching over the expenditure of the country read of this transaction in the daily press. That is where we get our information. It is given to us, not on the floor of this House; not on the Estimates, but in the morning press. </para>

                        <para>- There are some points in regard to the Nauru Island that I should like to have explained. The whole business . relating to it is very unsatisfactory. I notice that a company has been formed in Sydney, and has something <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do with Nauru. We should like to know all about it. For what are we here? What are honorable members of the Corner party here to do? Are we to remain silent day after day, and allow these things to be done? Are we to remain silent when no information is given to us concerning them ? When we on this side of the House try to bring these facts forward some honorable members of the Corner party say that we are only wasting time. Am I wasting time in demanding in formation as to these matters ? I ask for it not in my own interests, but in the interests of the people as a whole. </para>

                <para>It is the duty of Parliament to check Governments, to control Executives,. But this Ministry during the war got into the way of being not a Government of a number of men, but a one-man Government. And that sort of thing is still going on. What is the use of prating about the control exercised by Parliament? Cannot the people see that, under existing circumstances we have no control, and that the fault rests with ourselves? We have no control over the Government because we do not demand our rights. What would any honorable member opposite say to one of his constituents if he were asked a question in regard to the Nauru Island deal ? What would he know about it ? He would have to confess that he knew nothing. And yet honorable members opposite allow the business of the country to be carried on in this way? What as the effect of allowing to remain in office a Government that has over and over again made solemn pledges, and over and over again has broken them. After all that Australia has done in this war, the hundreds of millions of pounds she has spent in connexion with it, the sacrifice of many noble lives - 60,000 of the flower of her youth lie dead on the fields of Gallipoli, Palestine, and France - after all these things, because of the record of this Government, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> as Treasurer, went Home, he was told: &#34; If you do not pay up &#163;8,500,000, we will post you as a defaulter in the House of Commons.&#34; There is our return, because a wrong impression has been given in England of the people of this country by allowing to remain in power a Government that can make and break pledges from day to day.  Still they go on, and they tell us nothing. The effect in this country is to increase our difficulties, to pile up taxation, and yet we still allow them to go on. The responsibility is individually upon each and all of us. Parties will be judged on how they vote as parties. This is a great question, whether the Government is to remain in power or not. I would suggest to my honorable friends in the Ministerial corner that it does not look well to have the Government saved time and again by a sufficient number of their party voting for the Government. </para>
