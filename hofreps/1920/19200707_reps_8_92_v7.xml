                        <para>- I had not seen the message until the honorable member showed it to me. I notice that it was sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> from its special representative in London, which fact, in itself, I think, carries its answer. No doubt, parts of the cablegram are true, though what they are, beyond the date and the sender&#39;s address, I am unable to say. I cannot say whether the British Ministry remains adamant, though I think that that would cause general surprise throughout the Empire. But, emphatically, it is not true that the attitude of the Government in regard to the payment of these moneys has changed. For the rest, the cablegram is not an accurate presentation of the facts. It does not, in any way, state the present position between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Government of Great Britain. In all matters relating to the payment of half profits, I have been acting with, and in accord with, the representatives of the pastoralists, whom I met as late as last Friday. They are entirely in agreement with my views, and authorized me to make certain representations to the British Government on their behalf; which I have done. </para>

                        <para>- May I ask the Prime Minister if, as announced in today&#39;s papers, a definite basis for the conduct of the sale inside Australia of the coming wool clip has been arranged ? If so, does it cover the transition period between the 30th June and the opening of the new sale, affecting, in particular, any wool that may be gathered from the fellmongering or scouring of the skins of sheep slaughtered in Australia? Yesterday, fat sheep dropped 3s. in the market because the fellmongers had withdrawn from the purchase of skins. That is due to the auction sales of skins in both Melbourne and Sydney having been cancelled. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member&#39;s question divides itself naturally under several heads The first is as to whether arrangements have been made for the sale of the new clip. It is true,  as stated in the press that as the result of a Conference held on Friday last between the representatives of the Woolgrowers and the Wool Brokers Association, I was authorized to make the announcement to the British Government and to the public that sales of the new clip would begin about the 1st October next. I am unable to answer offhand the other portion of the honorable member&#39;s question. In part, it involves the point of what is and what is not included in the 1920-21 clip. Broadly, I may say that the same principle that governed the trade in pre-war days will decide that point now. All wool appraised up to the 30th June will, of course, fall automatically into the 1919-20 clip. All wool shorn before the 30th June, which was in bond or warehouse, or immediately available for shipment, will fall also into the 1919-20 clip. But wool, whether shorn before or after the 30th June, which was in bond or warehouse, but had not been appraised, and was not immediately available for shipment, will fall into the 1920-21 clip. That is the position as regards shorn wool, and the same broad principle would apply to skin wool. On the question of skin wool generally, as the fellmongers are to put their case before me, it is proper that I should defer any expression of opinion upon it until I have heard them. </para>

                            <para>- I saw several references to this matter in the press last week. I think it was stated there that the British Government had sold about &#163;4,000,000 worth of wool to Germany, but this was subsequently contradicted. It was then I think, stated that it was the British holders of wool who had sold the parcels to Germany. I am not in a position to speak as to the truth of either of those statements ; but, for the information of. the honorable member, the House, and the country, I may say that the Commonwealth Government, some months ago, took up the position that it did not consider that the British Government had a right to dispose of Australian wool other than by auction, except after consultation with the Commonwealth Government, who were the trustees for the growers, as to the price thereof. Honorable members will recollect that some 450,000 bales had been sold at issue prices, which might be &#163;40, &#163;50, &#163;60, or &#163;70 per bale less than the real value. Against the recurrence of this we protested, and the British Government admitted the correctness of the position we took up. I am &#39;not in a position to say whether wool has been sold to Germany, either by the British Government or by private individuals. </para>

                        <para>- Although the lot of the transgressor is hard, mine is much harder, because I am adjured by the honorable member for Wannon to do everything in my power to see that the producer gets the full value for his sheep, which obviously depends to a very large extent on whether the wool is to be put into the 1919-20 or 1920-21 clip; and at the same time I am urged by the honorable member for South Sydney to take such action as will insure cheap mutton to the public, at&#39; a time when the pastoralists are holding back their sheep. I am not able to answer the honorable member&#39;s question off-hand. I do not know whether the high price of mutton is due in any respect to the export of mutton. I have no information to that effect. I should have thought that, when from 10.000,000 to 20,000,000 sheep had died through drought, and some through floods, that fact in itself would not be altogether a negligible factor in the increased price of mutton. I do not see any  particular inducement being held out to the pastoralist to export mutton when the price for exportable mutton is at present certainly not more than half of what he can get here. I believe that in the sales last week lamb brought 9d. to 91/2d. per lb. on the hoof, whereas the price for lamb under the British contract is61/2d. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>That being so, it would be far better for the .pastoralists to sell their sheep here than to export them. Why they should, export mutton at 6 Ja. per lb. when they can get 9d. per lb. for it here, I cannot understand. Every one, however, must have a fair chance to present his case. If the fellmongers are suffering from any grievance which is resulting in the shortening of hands, if in the absence of wool men are being put out of employment - I&#39; shall have to consider the question on its merits. </para>

                            <para>- The State Premiers arc meeting here to consider the definite questions of immigration, the Murray  waters, uniform railway gauge, and one borrower and one tax-gatherer for Australia, which have been before them on many occasions, and twice in the present year. They have had an opportunity to discuss those matters with their respective Governments, and are coming here to give&#39; me answers to the proposals placed before them. Since the Conference meets on Friday next, it is perfectly clear that they could not discuss the question of the Wheat Pool beforehand and supply me with an answer, on that date. I am given to understand that some of the States are prepared to consider favorably the formation of a Wheat Pool, while others are not. Even if they were that would not clear up the matter, because the position created by the voluntary Pool and the Commonwealth&#39;s guarantee in regard to all wheat has to be faced. I am unable to say how the Commonwealth is to deal with the subject matter for which that guarantee has been given, without machinery whereby that control can be exercised. That is the point that is worrying me. I said by way of answer to the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> the other day, that the position has been complicated by the quite definite pledges given at the last general election that no one would be forced to come into the Pool. Those pledges, however, do not affect the States. The States themselves can act, and if they did the Commonwealth would consider itself quite free to act in conjunction with them. The position in regard to the voluntary Pool is not affected by the attitude taken up by the States&#39; in regard to wheat in their own territories. </para>

                            <para>- Solomon is dead. I think his reputation would have suffered if he had been given a job like mine. In answer to the honorable member I have to say that the inclusion of the wool in the old or new clip would depend upon the circumstances. What was the position before the war? If a man commenced to shear at Cooper&#39;s Creek at the end of May, and if the country were flooded, then under the conditions existing twenty years ago he could never have got that wool down to port in time for shipment on the 30th June. In that case it would always be treated as in the next year&#39;s clip. I am not attempting to decide particular cases, but I am going to say that the principle that obtained before the war obtains now. It will not apply to a man who deliberately holds his wool back with a view to getting it into the new clip. The question was raised on Friday last, and I will say that if a man has <inline font-style="italic">bonafide</inline> been unable to get his wool down to port so that it might be available for shipment or appraisement, or to be placed in bond or warehouse by the 30th June, he is very properly entitled to have it considered as falling into the new clip. Whether the delay in the transit of the wool is due to drought or floods is not material. The question is whether the geographical, climatic, or other circumstances of this great country are such at any time as to prevent the grower getting his wool down in a certain time. If the grower is in that position the wool goes into the new clip. </para>

                    <para>Quite apart from Anzac tweed, material for civilian suits is being made at the Commonwealth Government Woollen Mills, North Geelong, for sale to returned sailors and soldiers only. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League of Australia in the several States are the contractors for the distribution of this tweed. Priority of application is the governing factor in ascertaining the order in which demands are to be met, irrespective of whether or not the applicant is a member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League of Australia. </para>

                        <para>So far as the Australian Government is concerned, there is nothing to prevent Russians from leaving Australia. The Home and Territories Department, or State Collectors of Customs on their behalf, will issue permits which will serve instead of passports as authority for them to leave Australia. No charge is made for these permits. It is understood, however, that shipping companies are reluctant to convey Russians to ports abroad unless they have definite assurances that Russians will be permitted to land at those ports.

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - The war loan expenditure of the Commonwealth has practically absorbed the war loans already raised, and it becomes necessary to raise further money to meet expenditure in the financial year just beginning. The money will be used principally to pay for settling soldiers on the land, for the building of war service homes, for the repatriation of soldiers generally, and for certain small outstanding liabilities for carrying on the war. Inquiries have been made in London with a view to ascertaining whether a loan could be raised there. The information received from my late colleague before his unfortunate resignation, and since from other sources, shows that, owing to the very large investments in industrial and commercial ventures and other causes, the amount of money available has recently been considerably curtailed, and lenders are asking for such rates of interest as practically prohibit the Commonwealth going on the London market. The loan of &#163;2,500,000 just put on the market in England by the New South Wales Government at 61/2 per cent. at par was only applied for to the extent of441/2 per cent. by the public,551/2per cent. being left in the hands of the underwriters, while the rates being paid for high class British Treasury </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Bills or loans in England are up to 7 per cent. A condition of affairs even more acute exists in America. I have heard on good authority that the New York financiers quoted recently a rate of71/2 per cent, to a Government with a term of fifteen years. It is very doubtful if money can be obtained in America at the present time on the highest class security for less than 8 per cent. </para>
                    <para>  The Commonwealth Government, while realizing that in the circumstances it is necessary to reduce borrowing as far as possible, has certain definite obligations to the returned soldiers and in respect of the war which can be met out of loans only. The cost of land settlement of soldiers has been much greater than was anticipated, and, notwithstanding efforts to reduce the cost of this  phase of repatriation work, heavy expenditure in this direction will continue for some considerable time. The cost of settling the soldiers varies greatly in the States, and my colleague is at present engaged with the State Lands Ministers in reviewing the whole question from this stand-point, and we are hopeful of securing some modification of these conditions. Present information indicates large expenditure on war service homes during this financial year. </para>
                    <para>Of the war gratuities, which amount to nearly &#163;30,000,000, the Government has undertaken to pay special classes in cash, to meet which the banks have agreed to provide about &#163;6,000,000 on the understanding that the Commonwealth will raise and repay the money at the earliest opportunity. In addition, the Government will redeem &#163;10,000,000 of the war gratuity bonds before the end of this financial year. That sum <inline font-style="italic">must</inline> also be raised, unless the German war indemnity, which has been specially earmarked for the purpose, becomes available. </para>
                    <para>These obligations must be met, and the Government is, therefore, compelled to approach the Australian people with the view of raising a loan of &#163;25,000,000. This loan it is proposed to call the &#34; Second Peace Loan.&#34; </para>
                    <para>The nominal rate of interest will be 6 per cent. per annum, but a bonus to be given with the first interest payment will make the effective rate about &#163;61s. per cent. per annum on the average for the whole period of the loan. The effective rate of the last loan was &#163;5 6s. The rate of this loan is, therefore, roughly, 3/4 per cent. higher than the last. The principal will be repayable at par on 15th December, 1930. Subscriptions to the loan will close on 6th September next, and instalments will be payable as follows :  - 10 per cent. to be lodged with application. 20 per cent. on 4th October, 1920. 20 per cent. on 1st November, 1920. 25 per cent. on 6th December, 1920. 25 per cent. on 5th January, 1921. </para>
                    <para>Interest will be subject to Commonwealth taxation, but will be free of State income tax. </para>
                    <para>To raise a loan on more liberal terms tends to depress the value of stocks already held, and it is but fair to guard against this as much as possible. We have accordingly provided that subscribers to the new loan will have the privilege of converting at face value an equal amount of stock or bonds which they hold in connexion with previous War Loans. This concession is a valuable one, and, it is expected, will induce many persons holding stock and bonds in previous War Loan issues to freely subscribe to the new one. </para>
                    <para>The terms of the loan, although still below the price of loans elsewhere, are the best ever offered by the Commonwealth in Australia, and are such as to give a good return to persons having money for investment. The higher rate of interest offered for a long term will, it is believed, be attractive to the investing public. As the payment of instalment&#39;s is spread over a period of five months, the Government hopes that farmers and wool-growers who receive the value of their produce during that time will, with the assistance of the banks, be able to contribute liberally to the new loan. As in previous occasions, the Government is prepared &#39; to help persons who have not the ready money to meet the instalments of the loan as they fall due, and arrangements will be made with the Australian banks to make advances at a rate of 5 per cent. per annum to customers who have a good prospect of paying the money within eighteen months. Under these arrangements, the banks will advance up to 90 per cent. of the bonds subscribed for, and no security other than the bonds themselves will be required. </para>
                    <para>The Government will arrange, as was done in the case of previous loans, for the appointment of Committees to assist in obtaining subscriptions. These bodies have materially assisted in the past; their efforts have been greatly appreciated ; and their work in connexion with the forthcoming loan, it is expected, will greatly contribute to its success. </para>
                    <para>As before stated, the new loan is required mainly for the expenses of repatriation, and the Government confidently looks to the generous people of Australia to voluntarily subscribe the sum which is necessary to meet the obligations of the Commonwealth. The terms offered to subscribers to the new loan are in themselves very attractive as an investment. Apart from that aspect of the matter, however, the Government has obligations to the soldiers which must be fulfilled. This can only be done by the whole-hearted support of the people. During the war, while the issue was still in doubt, the people of Australia provided the means asked for by the Government. Victory has been secured largely by the efforts of those whom we are bound in honour to restore to peaceful and prosperous occupations in their own land for the freedom and security of which they fought. </para>
                    <para>To raise the money is an imperative necessity. The privileges of citizenship carry with them corresponding duties. The obligations of the Commonwealth to the soldiers to whose valour and sacrifice we owe our lives, our liberties and all that we have, must be honoured. To invest in this loan is both good business and good patriotism; and every citizen should, as far as his means permit, do his duty by contributing to it. We much prefer the voluntary method of raising the money, but if that method fails to provide what is required, it will be incumbent upon us to adopt other means. It must be made perfectly clear that those who endeavour to evade their duty cannot be permitted to do so. </para>
                    <para>Now, there are one or two observations which I would like to make upon the statement I have just made. The first has to do with the rate of interest. The nominal rate offered by the Commonwealth is slightly higher than that paid by the States for recent issues. It is necessary to offer a higher nominal rate because the States&#39; loans are free of both State and Commonwealth Income Tax, whereas the Commonwealth loan is subject to Commonwealth taxation, which is on a much higher scale than that imposed by the States. The governing factor in connexion with the rate of interest is the price of money all over the world. This has gone up very considerably. One has only to examine the returns upon bonds and stocks of various countries, and more particularly in London, as well as in Australia, to see just what it means. I have before me a list of stocks in London, together with particulars concerning their yield to the investor at the present time. For instance, our Commonwealth 51/2 per cent. stock, redeemable in June, 1927, yields altogether &#163;6 18s. per cent. at present. Other stocks, of the British Government, are yielding &#163;7 2s. 6d. and &#163;7 7s. 6d. Victorian 31/2 per cent. inscribed stock, redeemable in 1923, is giving a rate of interest amounting to &#163;7 12s. 3d. at present in the London market, while other stocks go even higher. I notice, as a further example, that City of Sydney 4 per cent. stock is returning in London now <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> 15s. </para>
                    <para>I have another statement before me, taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 7th May last, giving the prices for national war bonds. Some of them, redeemable in 1922, at a redemption price of &#163;102, and with a present price of &#163;96 10s., are yielding &#163;7 6s. per cent. Reference to the information before me will inform honorable members that other stocks are yielding similarly. There is quite a list of them. Our own stocks here are yielding in much the same way. For instance our 41/2 per cent. bonds, redeemable in 1925, are yielding &#163;6 7s. 4d. on the market. Our 5 per cent. stock, redeemable in 1923, is returning &#163;6 . 19s.11d. Our 5 per cent: bonds, redeemable in 1927, are quoted at &#163;6 14s. 7d. </para>

                    <para>There is another matter which I should mention, and that is the subject of provision in regard to old stocks. I find that in the Old Country they are converting some of their floating debt into Treasury Bonds, the currency varying from five to fifteen years ; and the inducements offered to the public to convert these moneys into fixed bonds are very remarkable. I have before me the latest prospectus, issued by the Imperial Treasury at the time. It is for the redemption of unfunded debt of early maturity. Honorable members will recollect that the Imperial authorities have to deal with about &#163;1,300,000,000 sterling of unfunded debt, and they are making an effort to fix that debt in order that they may know exactly what is the financial outlook for the immediate future. This is what the prospectus says - </para>

                            <para>- The term is ten years. We have about &#163;88,000,000 falling due in 1927, and that, I suggest, is about as much as we can expect to convert, even in the most favorable circumstances. My advice is that it would be better to extend the proposed new loan over a little longer period. It is much more convenient, of course, to convert our loans in big sums if the market be favorable; but, since we cannot guarantee future market conditions, it is deemed prudent to provide for the conversion in  1927 of the sum I have mentioned, leaving the proposed new loan to a later date. Referring again to the proposal of the British Government, I should like to read another clause of the prospectus - </para>

                    <para>Now a word or two about repatriation. The position, on the whole, is fairly satisfactory, though, as I have already pointed out, we have, in some cases, to pay extraordinarily high prices for the land on which to settle our soldiers. In some States, where land is cheap, the problem is an easy one; but. the position is different in other States where land values are appreciably higher, and its availability is very much less. </para>

                    <para>I should like now to say a few words, upon the general loan situation, and then I shall have finished. </para>
                    <para pgwide="yes">The public debt of the Commonwealth on the 30th June, 1920, in respect of war services was &#163;335,300,000. That sum is comprised of the following items: - War loans raised in Commonwealth, &#163;219,800,000; deduct repurchases and securities surrendered in payment of succession duties, &#163;7,040,000; outstanding debt in Australia, &#163;212,760,000; loans from Government of United Kingdom, &#163;43,080,000 ; indebtedness to Government of United Kingdom for maintenance, transport, and equipment of Australian Imperial Force, &#163;37,100,000; indebted ness to British Admiralty for transport of troops, victualling, repairs, and other services for Australian Fleet, &#163;6,100,000; accrued deferred pay, Australian Imperial Force, to 30th June, 1920, &#163;260,000; war gratuity (estimate), &#163;30,000,000. Gross wax debt, &#163;335,300,00. </para>
                    <para>The whole of that amount, however, has not been spent on active naval and military operations during the recent war. A sum of &#163;22,000,000, representing expenditure on realizable assets, should be deducted, leaving a net war debt of &#163;313,300,000. The &#163;22,000,000 is made up as follows: - Indebtedness of States for loans for soldier land settlement, wheat silos, &#38;c, to be refunded, &#163;12,100,000; capital expenditure on war-service homes to be refunded, &#163;4,900,000; present capital value of ships purchased or constructed out of war loan moneys (omitting wooden ships), &#163;4,000,000; other recoverable expenditure charged to war loan, &#163;1,000,000. Total, &#163;22,000,000. The expenditure for repatriation is of a character much different from that required for the active conduct of the war, inasmuch as the land settlement of soldiers is a reproductive work, creating substantial assets equal to, if not greater in value than, the expenditure. Similarly, assets are created in building war-service homes. In both cases the money spent - really advanced - by the Commonwealth will be repaid with interest. I think it is time we began to emphasize this aspect of the case. Up to date the expenditure by the Commonwealth for land settlement, war service homes, and silos is &#163;17,000,000. Several of the States have, during peace times, spent large sums on similar services. Shipbuilding and the purchase of ships which, during the war, were charged to War Loan, have also placed in the hands of the Commonwealth valuable vessels which have earned large profits for the revenue. </para>
                    <para>The amount shown above as owing to the United Kingdom, apart from the funded debt, totals &#163;43,200,000. That figure does not include a temporary advance of &#163;2,500,000 from the British Government to meet London payments, nor an amount of &#163;4,800,000 owing for interest. The latter sum has been placed in a Trust Fund in the Treasury for payment when opportunity offers. Both sums will be paid as soon as the cash can be conveniently placed in London. As honorable members know, our great difficulty is to shift money from London to here and from here to London. It is that which is causing a great deal of our difficulty at the moment: it is not that the money is not available, but that there is difficulty in moving it between the two places. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I can give any adequate reason just now. I suppose the money had to be found while the war was in progress, and it came out of war loan money, though, of course, it will be accounted for separately, and placed in a different category. I think I am right in calling attention to the deductions which should be made from our total war obligations, because all this expenditure cannot be called dead-weight war debt. </para>

                            <para>- Our deadweight war debt is very much less than the total of the loans raised during the war. Loans were raised for other purposes than the mere dissipating of the moneys in war operations. All the item of &#163;22,000,000 should come back to us with interest, and help the revenues of Australia, while assisting in the settlement of the country. This expenditure stands on the same footing as the expenditure on the ordinary settlement schemes of the State Governments; all we are doing is extending those schemes, and perhaps varying the terms &#34;a little, though not so very much. Therefore, it seems to me we should not be doing ourselves or the country justice if we included all this expenditure in our war obligations; it should rather be regarded as expenditure during the currency of the war for settlement and housing purposes. </para>

                    <para>As already stated, the new loan is required mainly for the&#39; expenses of repatriation, including war service homes - in short, for reproductive services. There is still a sum of about &#163;3,000,000 required to meet certain outstanding accounts in connexion with the Expeditionary Force and Australian Fleet, and this sum should be added to the net war debt of &#163;313,300,000 previously mentioned. The final net war debt may therefore be set down at &#163;316,300,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; which in their nature do not represent dead-weight war debt. After the new loan has been raised, no further loans will be floated for ordinary war purposes. It may, however, be necessary to raise further money for repatriation, but I hope this may not be for any large amounts. At any rate, for purely war purposes, the last of the loans has really been raised. I hope that the further money that may be necessary in the future for repatriation will not be very much more than that I am now asking the country to find. Our obligations are great, but our country is great and prosperous, notwithstanding the criticisms made from time to time. I am the very last to take a too optimistic view of our liabilities and obligations. I have stressed these far too often. But when we have the fact that our revenues for the year  are millions more than we anticipated, surely we may congratulate ourselves without indulging in anything which the newspapers seem to regard as utterly unjustifiable. I say, again, that our obligations are tremendous, but, at the same time, our country&#39;s financial position is thoroughly sound. No doubt all that is needed is proper prudence - the exercise of care in the spending of the moneys raised from time to time. So long as we proceed along these lines, we may face the future with hope and confidence. </para>

                            <para>- No. But, after all, this is not the time for the discussion of details, and I shall be prepared to give any information required later on. As a final word, I wish to say that, on the occasion of the last loan, there were Committees throughout the length and breadth of Australia which assisted us in a wonderfully effective way to the realization of our objective. I am hoping to reconstruct those Committees, and that they will afford us the same patriotic help they did before. I now appeal to every honorable member to help us to the extent of his power, his capabilities, and his opportunities to raise this money for the benefit of the soldiers of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Then, I protest against certain individuals being favoured. Personally, I ask for no favours. The Treasurer has made a statement setting forth not only what he proposes to do in connexion with the forthcoming loan; but comparing the conditions under which it is to be raised with those which governed previous loans, and pointing out the prices at which debentures in those loans can be purchased to-day. His figures in this connexion are, I think, fallacious, because although one may perhaps purchase stock at, say, &#163;91, bearing interest at 41/2 per cent., and the Treasurer may work out the return thus obtained at &#163;6 7s. 6d. per cent. per annum- </para>

                    <para>There is also another matter in respect of which I desire to make a. protest. Upon Friday last I asked the Acting Treasurer whether State loans were free of Federal income tax, and he replied that they were. I protest against any person having to pay income tax upon the interest derived from investments in Commonwealth loans when he is not called upon to pay Federal income tax upon interest accruing from investments in State loans. </para>

                            <para>- But since a number of these loans were floated, a progressive income tax has been made operative in this country. To-day the position is that an individual with a very moderate income of, say, &#163;200 or &#163;300 per annum, has to pay Federal income tax at about 3d. or 4d. in the &#163;1, whilst a person with an income of &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 per annum is required to contribute about 8s. in the &#163;1. It is unfair that we should remit only 3d. in the &#163;1 in the one case and 8s. in the &#163;1 in the other. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that. When we were discussing the Income Tax Assessment Bill it was pointed out that if we adopted a particular exemption which was proposed, and if an exemption was made of the Federal income tax we should be remitting taxation&#39; upon an amount representing some &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5,000,000 per annum. Unfortunately, by the time the next Budget statement is made the proposed loan will have been successful or unsuccessful. To-day the Acting Treasurer has submitted what was in reality a preliminary Budget, in which he set forth the amount of our indebtedness. In ordinary circumstances the debate upon that statement would have been adjourned, and honorable members would have been afforded an opportunity of studying it at their leisure. It was obviously impossible for any honorable member to follow the elaborate explanation made by the Acting Treasurer this afternoon, and to grip all the details presented so as to enable him to discuss it in the way that he would like. I protest against being obliged to ask the permission of the House to make a statement. </para>

                            <para>- There is a sound reason for objecting to it. Although the war has terminated, I recognise that we have to raise money for repatriation purposes. I am protesting in the interest of every honorable member against the course which has been followed to-day. Whenever a Budget statement is delivered, the Budget papers are distributed amongst honorable members so that they are in the position to follow the Treasurer&#39;s remarks. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in the proper place. When the question was raised some time ago, many honorable members who are now on the Ministerial side of the House, but who were then in Opposition, protested against the Government taking to themselves the power to tax State instrumentalities. At that time it was thought that the Commonwealth had power to tax such instrumentalities. </para>

                            <para>- Now that we have a progressive income tax, the position is infinitely different from what it was in 1915. If those who have been the largest subscribers to our loans find that by doing so they can escape the payment of income tax they will continue to do so. It is a well-known fact that persons who are liable to pay probate duties go into the open market and buy bonds at &#163;91 or &#163;92, and tender them in payment of the duties at the par value of &#163;100. That was not our intention when we agreed to allow Commonwealth bonds to be accepted in payment of probate duties. I join with the Acting Treasurer in hoping that the loan will be a success, because we must do the best we can for the men who went away to fight for us, but I hope the Government will not be half-hearted in the matter of making it a compulsory loan. </para>

                <para>The long delay in passing a Bill to establish an Institute of Science and Industry has only served to emphasize the necessity for such legislation and the creation of such an Institute, and to demonstrate that throughout tie length and breadth of the land, in many quarters, which,&#34; perhaps, have the best possible knowledge of the need for an Institute, there has been an insistent demand for the establishment of one. In some directions we are told that this proposal is simply an expensive fad of the Government which can serve no utilitarian purpose, but simply provides a means for spending money which the country needs sorely for other purposes. I entirely disagree with that opinion. The more study one gives to the subject the more one becomes convinced of the absolute necessity for Australia doing what is possible, at all events at the present moment, towards the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry. &#34;We are obliged to cut our coat according to our cloth. If we had unlimited funds at our command, no doubt we could launch out and do vast and useful work for Australia by spending a very large sum of money in this direction, but we cannot do that to-day. We must proceed slowly along the road. However, notwithstanding the present financial position and the enormous commitments ahead of us, I do not think we ought to refrain from making a start in a direction in which so much useful work can be performed. I was very interested a little while ago when I read a resolution passed by the American Federation of Labour dealing with this particular subject. No country in the world to-day, not even Germany, is spending more money in or devoting more attention to scientific research than is America. Presently I shall tell honorable members the extent to which America is subsidizing this class of research in many directions and in many fields, but nevertheless the last Federal Convention of the American Federation of Labour felt called upon to pass a resolution in such clear, concise, and comprehensive terms that, although it is lengthy, I propose to read it, because it sets out facts which show how necessary it is for </para>
                <para>Australia to follow the example of other lands. The resolution was as follows : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Whereas scientific research and the technical application of results of research form a fundamental basis upon which the development of our industries - manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and others must Test; and </para>

                    <para>Whereas the increased productivity of industry resulting from scientific research is a most potent factor in the ever-increasing &#39;struggle of the workers to raise their standards of living, and the importance of this factor must steadily increase since there is a limit beyond which the average standard of living of the whole population can not progress by the usual methods of re-adjustment, which limit can only be raised by research and the utilization of the results of research in industry; and </para>
                    <para>Whereas there are numerous and important and pressing problems of administration and regulation now faced by Federal, State, and local governments, the wise solution of which depends upon scientific and technical research; and </para>
                    <para>Whereas the war has brought home to all the nations engaged in it the overwhelming importance of science and technology to national welfare, whether in war or in peace time, and not only is private initiative attempting to organize far-reaching research in these fields on a national scale, but in several countries governmental participation and support of such undertakings are already active; therefore be it </para>
                    <para>Resolved, by the American Federation of Labour in convention assembled, that a broad programme of scientific and technical research is of major importance to the national welfare, and should be fostered in every way by the Federal Government, and that the activities of the Government itself in such research should be adequately and generously supported in order that the work may be greatly strengthened and extended; and the secretary of the Federation is instructed to transmit copies of this resolution to the  President  of the United States, to the  President <inline font-style="italic">pro tempore</inline> of the Senate, and to the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, and that is why I am looking forward to a good deal of support from honorable members opposite, because science can do a great deal to improve the position of the workers generally. Scientific discoveries have been the means of reducing expenditure, which, has enabled employers to pay their workmen higher wages and provide them with better accommodation. The resolution, in its preamble, set out in clear and comprehensive terms the reason for and the desirableness of Australia proceeding on similar lines. </para>

                <para>I stated just now that we have had evidence from the time when this project was originally mooted - I think in 1916 - that in many parts of Australia there is a general desire that the Commonwealth should proceed with the establishment of the Institute, to afford facilities for scientific and technical research. I do not think the necessity for the establishment of the Institute has been emphasized by any one more than by our organizations of primary producers, who are scattered throughout the Commonwealth. I believe this is largely due to the fact that they arc realizing more and more the extent to which it is possible for science to assist, them in the useful and sometimes difficult work which they are performing, and this has been borne home to them in a striking manner, particularly during recent years. Many honorable members will probably be able to recall a time when bullocks could be purchased at los. per head, and sheep at 5s. per head, and in those days it did not concern the owner very much - or, at least, not to the same extent as it does now - if disease entered their flocks and herds. Although they incurred losses, they did nor. feel them as they do to-day, when sheep and cattle are selling at such very high prices. I believe that many of the diseases that are common to our flocks and herd&#39;s are preventable, and Australian producers now realize that the chief assistance they can expect to receive is from scientists. Apart from the fact that the average grazier, pastoralist, and farmer has not the scientific knowledge to undertake research work on his own account, there are many reasons why it is almost impossible for him, even were he equipped with the necessary knowledge, to conduct the necessary investigations himself. For that&#39; reason, if for no other, producers recognise that the Government can materially assist them by providing the means whereby scientific research can be undertaken, not only in their interests, but in the interests of the whole community. I do not desire to weary honorable members by reading a list of the associations which have passed a resolution in favour of the establishment of the Institute, but I think it necessary to submit some particulars to the House. They are as follows : - The Graziers Association of New South Wale3, the Primary Producers of New South Wales- </para>

                        <para>- I have not the dates before me, but I can assure the honorable member that the one from the Graziers Association of New South Wales reached me only last week, and the one from the Primary Producers Association of New South Wales about three or four months ago. Many of these organizations, the names of which I am submitting, have passed a resolution comparatively recently, and necessarily all of them since the original idea was mooted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)-</inline> These organizations have directly associated themselves with the request that the establishment of the Federal Institute of Science and Industry be proceeded with. The list continues : - The Sydney Chamber of Commerce, the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, Institute of Civil Engineers, Australian Industries Protection Board, Australian Chemical Institute, Australian Aero Club, Electrical Association of Australia, Engineering Association-&#39; of New South Wales, Chemical Association, Master Builders Association, Institute of Local Government Association, Wireless Institute, Chemical Society of Technical College. Chamber of Agriculture, Society of Chemical Industry, Royal Society of New South Wale3, University Chemical Society, Linnean Society of New South Wales, and Master Process Engravers Association. Those associations passed a resolution in the following terms with the direct request that it should be conveyed to the Government: - </para>

                        <para>- Requests have repeatedly been received from the various organizations of primary producers in the different States for the investigation by the Institute of Science and Industry of problems affecting their interests. The temporary institute which has been carrying out preliminary investigation work has been approached over and over again in this way. The Primary Producers Union of New South Wales has given its strong support to the proposed institute, and has called attention to the enormous preventable losses occurring amongst the flocks and herds of the Commonwealth. In April last, a conference of representatives of branches of New South Wales agricultural bureaux, which, as honorable members probably know, are made up of farmers and primary producers, in association with the Agricultural Department of the State, which carries on experiments in their districts in regard to the growing of crops and other matters, approved of Commonwealth action. </para>

There is not the slightest doubt, however, but that there is to-day a great deal of overlapping. The six States interest themselves, to some slight extent, at all events, in the questions which the Institute of Science and Industry will eventually take up, and very often several State Departments are investigating the same matter. </para>

                    <para>In my view, this is one of the big questions which we might very well feel satisfied belong rather to the Commonwealth than to the States, because no scientific discovery will be purely a State affair. It is simply  a  question of whether the Commonwealth can show us that we are going to have increased efficiency without duplication of the cost of the State Departments. If it can show us, then I, for one, will heartily support the Commonwealth taking over the whole of the departments of scientific research, because I think they would do the work much better. .... </para>
                    <para>I would like to put another view from the stand-point of the States. I do not think any State stands more strongly for State rights than does South Australia, but we regard science as on an entirely different footing from practical administrative work. Science has no boundaries, and the operations of the scientific bureau could very well be spread over the whole of Australia, both from the point of view of more effective work and from the stand-point  of economy. What is the use of five or six different State Departments pursuing inquiries on different lines when possibly one body could much more effectively perform the work of investigation and research? </para>
                    <para>I think that there must necessarily be greater strength in the scientific methods of the Commonwealth than in those of the States. The greater scientific knowledge which money will enable the Commonwealth to obtain will strengthen every Department, and I think that&#39; in this case the Commonwealth can very well take over all scientific investigation on behalf of the general community. </para>

                <para>I think no very great harm can come of this departure, provided the Commonwealth Bureau exercises a reasonable amount of discretion - that is to say, that any matters which are being investigated by a State Bureau should not be undertaken by the Commonwealth, matters peculiar to the State in which the Bureau exists. If those are left to the States I can quite imagine there are many questions that can be well investigated by the Commonwealth. In matters that are common to all States, it appears to me, the Commonwealth Bureau can effect very essential service to the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>No, doubt, the question of scientific research is more important at the present moment than, perhaps, at any previous time in Australia. There are many diseases in stock that are common to the whole of Australia, and I am of opinion that better research work could be done by one central body. There are not many men in the world who are experts in these matters they are very difficult to obtain. If one State were able to get the services of the most experienced man to go into research work, the other States would be unable to avail themselves of his services. Although I am very jealous of the sovereign rights of the States, at the same time I think this research work could be better done through one central body. I should be prepared to fall in with any arrangement that might have that object in view, seeing that it is in the interests of my own State that it should be done. There are many different problems which we shall have to deal with in Australia in the future, and they could be better dealt with by one central body. </para>

                <para>I confess to a large measure of sympathy with the President&#39;s views as an expression of an abstract principle. It is, perhaps, possible that the Commonwealth, in the exercise of this right, might logically take over certain other matters which are specifically State functions, but I do not fear that. 1 think we might reasonably welcome this institution as capable of doing something which, unfortunately, the States have not succeeded in doing. In the State activities and State inquiries there have been overlapping and duplication; but, by means of centralization, more satisfactory results can be achieved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne&#39;s</inline> memorandum, which the Acting Prime Minister read, states the case fully. We want concentration and co-ordination, and we ought to leave it to one body to make specific inquiries, instead of all the States independently investigating the same subject, thus making for duplication. . . . </para>

                <para>Let me try to give the House very briefly some idea of the extent to which other countries have subsidized scientific research. Before the war, there was no country which devoted more time, attention, and money to it than Germany. Had it not been for this, she would not have been able to keep going half as long as she did.  Her  chemists were able to produce substitutes for almost everything her people wore or ate. That circumstance is not a reason why we should support scientific research, but it is a wonderful example of what scientific knowledge has been able to accomplish. When, because of the war, the world was cut off from the material advantages she was enjoying as the result of Germany&#39;s scientific research and applied science, it was found impossible to proceed with many industrial operations until the scientists had been called in. Great Britain was amongst the first to recognise that, and has created, since the war, a Department which she endowed with ?1,000,000 to start with, and which she has voted this year &#163;360,000 to maintain. She established this institution during the war, and is using it to-day to assist her manufacturers, because she then demonstrated the enormous amount of assistance that it can be to her people in times of peace. </para>
                <para>We find that America is doing infinitely more even than Great Britain. I quoted in the opening portion of my speech the resolution passed by the American Federation of Labour, and one marvels at the fact that they did pass that resolution in view of the tremendous amount that America annually votes for this particular class of work. Other countries were quick to perceive <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> wisdom of Great Britain&#39;s action, and to realize that immediately the war was over the international competitions of peace would be resumed. The United States, which, perhaps, with the exception of Germany, has done more .than any other country to subsidize and encourage research into industrial problems, was forced to the conclusion that her efforts in this direction, great as they had been, were insufficient. She not only increased her enormous subsidies, raising the amount expended on the many activities of the Department of Agriculture alone to &#163;6,000,000, but she established a permanent organization called the National Research Council. </para>
                <para>The principal reason which actuates the Government in promoting :the Bill for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry in this country is the desire to assist our primary industries. We realize that, unless something can be done to assist the man on the land, he is in for a bad time. </para>

                        <para>- That follows. _ The difficulty that the primary industries of Australia are peculiarly up against is this: We have in ,the cities a constantly rising level of wages. It is going up and up and up until, in competition for some kinds of labour, the primary industries have to pay more and more and more. Although there has been some rise in the level of prices which the primary producers are getting for their products, we have to realize at the same time that they are going back again into the old competitive conditions under which they will have to sell their produce in the markets of the world. The time, perhaps, is not very far distant when it will be found almost impracticable to compete with the rate of wages being paid in the cities, and keep the men on the land. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it has any direct bearing upon that question, although I shall be quite willing to argue the point when the occasion arises. The problem I have stated is self-evident. All those who have any close acquaintance with the rural industries of this country know full well that that is the real difficulty which the farmer is up against every day in the week. I believe that by the application of science in its broadest sense to primary industries the farmer can be helped perhaps to a greater extent than through anything else. If by improved methods of cultivation, and of breeding, and by eliminating the preventable losses which he now annually sustains, we can add to the farmer&#39;s returns, he can meet far more easily that increase which is going on in the cost of wages than he can today. The results which have been obtained in other countries, and particularly of late years in America, encourage us to believe that a vast deal can be done in this country upon similar lines, and that the producer can be put into a better position through applied scientific research than perhaps by anything else that we can do. The Government hope that, when the Institute is established, the procedure will be, as seems inevitable, to divide its work into various branches. It is impossible to conduct the whole of the operations of the Institute as one branch. The work must be specialized. One special branch will probably be devoted to agricultural problems, another perhaps to stock diseases, another, again, to forest products, and so on. We must have that subdivision and specialization. When the Institute is established, while it cannot hope to do as much as America is doing to-day, if, on the agricultural side, it takes as a model the activities of the American Department of Agriculture- </para>

                        <para>- It can, to some extent, but every country has its own peculiar problems. Take, as an example, the tick investigations in America. What they have done there is a help to us ; but, so far as our investigations have gone on the scientific side into that urgent problem, which is inflicting enormous loss on this country every year, they show that America&#39;s experience is not exactly ours, and that the problem in America is not exactly the same as the problem in Australia. These differences have to be studied from the scientific side, and only when the scientist has gone into them can he tell the agriculturist the right thing to do to get rid of his troubles. </para>

                    <para>Even if there had been no intellectual stimulus, the present great war would have forced science to the front. In the first days of the conflict the nations of the Entente were faced by problems soluble only through the aid of scientific research. Statesmen whose exclusively classical training had afforded them little or no means of appreciating the significance of science, were compelled to summon investigators to their aid in order to overcome difficulties demanding instant solution. The question of manufacture, serious as it was, frequently held second place to the necessity for research. Thus in England it was evidently impossible for the glass factories to produce the special kinds of optical glasses needed for periscopes, gun sights, field glasses, and many other military instruments, until the methods of making these glasses, previously worked out in Germany, had been re-discovered by British investigators. So with scores of other problems forced upon the nation under the stress of war. Scientific research was the first requisite, and both men and funds must be provided without delay. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not altogether right. The position at that time was that the German scientists were working in connexion with the optical industry of Germany and Austria. They had worked out the scientific problems connected with the manufacture of these lenses in a way which the scientists had never been asked to do in Great Britain. When the war broke out, and the sources of supply were cut off, and the British makers of optical glasses were asked to produce these instruments, they could not do it, fox the simple reason that they had not the necessary scientific knowledge. They had to call in the scientists and ask them to work out the problems for them. When the scientists had worked them out, then, and only then, were the British makers of optical glasses able to produce the articles required. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position at present to give the House that information, since the Director has not yet been appointed. I am hoping that he will be appointed in time to enable us to obtain from him some idea of what he proposes to do in the first year, so that we can then consider what amount will be necessary to give him reasonable opportunity to carry out some useful work. Rather than spread the Director&#39;s activities over a very wide area in the first place - rather than that he should spend a little money here and a little money there - it would be better, I think, to give him sufficient funds to enable him to deal thoroughly with one or more matters. </para>

                        <para>- We have not included in this Bill statutory provision for the appointment of Advisory Councils. The reason for this is that we feel that no one Advisory Council could cover the whole field of scientific research. It is contemplated that the Director, when appointed, will specialize his work, and that it will be necessary to appoint a special man to deal with such a subject as agriculture. That having been done, he would then call to his counsel men who knew something of the subject. </para>

                        <para>- The State Departments of Agriculture have their experts, and the Director will be charged with the duty of bringing all these into cooperation with himself. I wish to make it clear that the terms of the Bill do not preclude the Director bringing into his counsels men from outside. If he deems it desirable to ask three or four practical pastoralists to consider with him the details of his scheme dealing with, say, the tick pest, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent his doing so. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Bill, as previously framed, laid it down that there must be Advisory Councils. If, however, these Advisory Councils were to cover the  whole field of scientific research in agriculture, mining, forestry, and manufacturing in all its branches they would be so unwieldy as to render it impossible to obtain the best results. What is proposed is that instead of having Advisory Councils created by Statute-which would mean that certain interests would have to be left unrepresented, unless we were to make these councils altogether unwieldy - the Director shall be left free to call to his counsel in regard to the particular problems that have to be studied from time to time such men as may be considered desirable. </para>

                        <para>-  Certainly . It is thought that in this way we shall secure better and speedier results, and probably incur far less expenditure, than if we created councils which, however large, within reason, they might be made, could not possibly cover the whole ground. That, briefly, is what we have in our minds and it was that consideration which actuated the Government in removing from the Bill the statutory provision for Advisory Councils. Under such a system it would have been necessary to have a large number of men on a council. Only one of that number might know anything of a particular subject with which the Director was dealing, when perhaps he should have eight or nine men gathered from all parts of Australia to advise and assist him in regard to it. </para>

                <para>I am afraid that I have not been altogether a popular Minister with the gentlemen who have very kindly consented to act as an Advisory Council for some time past. Those gentlemen did a great deal of preliminary investigation work, and, naturally, having laid the foundation, they were very anxious to see the edifice raised. They wanted to proceed, but, as the Minister charged for the time being with the administration of the Department, I felt that until Parliament had definitely authorized the establishment of this institution, it would not be right for me, notwithstanding that we were not exceeding the vote passed by Parliament in respect of the year, to permit expenditure on work which would necessarily commit the country to expenditure in future years. Acting in accordance with that rule, I have pulled them up time after time. I have said to these gentlemen, &#34; Your preliminary investigations have been very useful, but there you must stay until Parliament has authorized the establishment of the Institute. You must not start upon a career which, having been entered upon, will necessarily result in the country being committed to expenditure in years to come.&#34; I make this statement quite frankly. </para>

                    They have at all events laid the foundations for future operations in respect of quite a number of investigations to which I hope to refer, and have done a great deal of most useful preliminary work. There has been only one exception to the general rule which, as I said a few moments ago, I have followed in regard to their expenditure, and that is in respect of the prickly pear investigation, to which the Commonwealth was committed some considerable time ago. Honorable members are no doubt aware that the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales agreed with us to expend some &#163;8,000 a year on the prickly pear investigation. When one considers the enormous damage that this pest has done, and is doing, one must recognise that if by an expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 we could rid ourselves of it, we should have paid very little for the solution of such a problem.

                        <para>- There are in Australia 23,000,000 acres of fine pastoral country covered with prickly pear, and practically useless. The pest is gaining  at the rate of 1,000,000 acres per annum. I do not say we are going to spend &#163;1,000,000 in the next five years in trying to rid ourselves of it, but if by such an expenditure within that period we discovered some means of effectively dealing with the prickly pear, we should have got off very cheaply. </para>

The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> and others who have seen the prickly pear country know that it is practically useless. We have no means at our disposal of turning it to any account whatever unless the land be of great agricultural value. In that case it will pay to clear, but it will not pay to clear pastoral land of the pest. </para>

                        <para>- The Government of Queensland have done many things in connexion with the prickly-pear pest. Honorable members are, no doubt, aware that for country infested with prickly pear in Queensland many leases have been issued under pear conditions, and the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> will be able to say better than I can whether those conditions have been complied with or not. The investigations, so far as they have been undertaken, by the Queensland Government and our experience tend to show that there are no mechanical means by which the pest can be dealt with. They have also tended to show that there is no utilitarian purpose to which the prickly-pear plant can be put. If the fibre were of use for industrial purposes, or if the plant contained, in sufficient quantities, a drug or any substance for which there would be a commercial demand, the problem of eradicating the pest would not be so difficult of solution. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member refers to a different cactus altogether. If any commercial use could be made of the plant, something might be done with it; but all the investigations, so far, go to show that there is only one way in which the prickly pear can be dealt with, and that is by the introduction of some insect which will destroy it. The Queensland Government some little time ago introduced the cochineal insect into Queensland, in the hope that it would destroy the prickly pear. However, the cochineal insect proved to be somewhat of an epicure. There is one particular kind of pear which the insect liked, and it has wiped that plant out of existence; but it has left the true prickly pear severely alone. </para>

                        <para>- It is thought that investigation may show that some insect can be found which will destroy the prickly pear. A committee is busy investigating the problem in America from this* particular aspect, and it is hoped and believed that it will be possible for them shortly to announce some results. We can only go on trying to deal with the problem, and I hesitate to believe that science is so bankrupt of resource in this matter that we shall not ultimately find a solution. Though the solution, when found, may involve the expenditure of a good deal of money, there can be little doubt that it will be thoroughly justified, in view of the loss caused to Australia year by year through the spread of this national pest over vast areas of the country. </para>

                <para>Apart altogether from problems connected with diseases in stock and pests of various kinds, most of which, I believe, were imported to this country, there is a vast field for research, which, I believe, will ultimately yield great results, in connexion with our forests and probably all our flora. Honorable members are aware that the flora of this country is, for the most part, peculiar to Australia, and is not found anywhere else in the world. The probabilities are that the establishment of. forest products laboratories in different parts of Australia will ultimately reveal that we have in our forests, as has been proved to be the case in other countries, vast wealth. I feel satisfied that in that particular direction there is not only a va6t field for research, but that in all human probability that research will reveal sources of great wealth to this country. </para>
                <para>Then, of course, there is, to be considered the immense assistance that science can afford to our manufacturing industries. This proposal is primarily connected with assistance to our agricultural industries. Action in this direction was originally suggested in this Parliament through a desire to help agriculture, and honorable members will recollect that many years ago the present Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> was associated in this House with the introduction of a Bill for the creation of an Agricultural Bureau. The purpose then in view is covered by the measure now under consideration, but I am satisfied tl: at scientists can also assist our manufacturing industries very materially in the future. I do not wish to delay honorable members by pointing out the many directions in which science can come to the aid of industry. Indirectly, in giving such aid we shall also be assisting our primary producing industries. The more readily the primary products of this country, varied as they are, can be turned to use, the better it will be for the man on the land in all his various activities. </para>
                <para>I take, for instance, the manufacture of leather. The more leather that is tanned in this country, the better. But there are all sorts of problems connected with the tanning of leather in Australia from a scientific point of view which have never yet, been properly worked out. There are peculiarities in connexion with our tanning material, our climatic and other conditions, which create special chemical problems in connexion with the manufacture of leather. These are specially, difficult problems, which can only be properly solved by scientific investigation, and until they are solved the best results cannot be obtained. </para>
                <para>Scientists can assist manufacturers in the working up of our metals. It is known that there are peculiarities associated with the metals of every country. One matter of considerable importance is the temperature at which various processes should be carried out. The temperature has to be assimilated to the particular class of material that is being dealt with. All these are matters of scientific research, and the ordinary manufacturer has not the apparatus or the knowledge to carry out this work of research. In scores of instances where bad work is turned out the manufacturer blames the material at his command, when, as a matter of fact, the fault is due, not to the material, but to the fact that the process of manufacture followed is not adapted to the material used. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. All that I suggest is that there are avenues in which scientific research can be made of immense assistance to our manufacturing industries, and indirectly to the primary industries with which they are concerned. If by applied science the manufacturer is enabled to use his raw material to better advantage, the primary industry supplying . the raw material will be benefited thereby. </para>

                        <para>- Everybody knows that the chemical work done by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in connexion with the manufacture of sugar has been of vast importance to the industry generally. Many persons engaged in manufacture to-day have not sufficient capital to employ technical experts to carry out the scientific work necessary to their industry. In those cases the Government can, through the proposed Institute,  come to their aid. They can give them direct assistance, or, as I have suggested, by calling them together work in co-operation with them in the solving of their problems. </para>

                <para>In South Australia the subjects have been grass-tree resin, tuberculosis in stock, and paper pulp investigations; in Western Australia, clays and pottery, paper pulp, forest products, cattle tick pest, Kimberley horse disease ; and in Tasmania, tuberculosis in stock. Honorable members will notice that cattle tick,  for  instance, is  a  problem common to  the  States of Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, each of which  is  acting in co-operation with the Commonwealth. Of course, there is no necessity for the States of Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, in which this  problem  has not yet arisen to any extent, to participate in these investigations. Generally speaking, we found the States not only willing but most anxious  to cooperate  with us. </para>

                        <para>- A Federal Minister has so many other sins laid at his door that it is a hardship to make that additional charge against him. I assure honorable members that there is an anxiety on the part of the Commonwealth and the States to co-operate in these matters, and I have instanced problems in regard to which we have already had full cooperation. The tick problem is one of them. Both New South Wales and Queensland had been carrying on scientific investigations, and Western Australia was doing something, although not very much. </para>

                        <para>- No; it was agreed that certain scientific problems which the tick question presented should be investigated by the Institute of Science and Industry in co-operation with the State authorities. Such a co-operative effort must mean a concentration of brains, which will, in the long run,, give better results than would the continuance of independent investigations. </para>

                        <para>- Expenditure of that kind is avoided. For instance,&#34; in dealing with the tick problem, the expert Committee will not start <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> ignoring those results which have been already worked out. They will have regard to the history of previous investigations, which have given perhaps negative results, or results which, whilst not actually positive, yet give hope that further research along the same lines will lead to a definite discovery. At times it is right to go over a certain area of the ground previously covered in order to pick up the connecting link before proceeding. The Government are just as anxious to avoid unnecessary expenditure in the field of scientific research as anywhere else. I feel confident that if we get at the head of this Institute the right type of man - one who has the sense to discriminate between what may be called merely abstract scientific research, which will lead to no practical result, and other research, which is intensely practical, and aims at definite practical end3, a man with the necessary broadmindedness, scientific training, and business and administrative ability - we shall have very little difficulty in steering clear of that avoidable expenditure which yields no commercial result. Nobody recognises better than I do that in this field of scientific research it is possible to engage in an orgy of expenditure which will lead to no practical good. At the same time, one has to admit that the world owes to abstract scientific investigation some of the greatest discoveries of modern times. What we are actually aiming at is that all scientific investigation undertaken through the agency of this Institute shall be directed towards solving the practical problems which. Australian industries, primary and secondary, present to us every day in the week. </para>

                <para>I wish to refer briefly to the provisions of the Bill itself. This measure differs in two main particulars from its predecessor, which was passed through another place and explained in this House. Firstly, it provides for only one Director, instead of three. Reasons of economy have led to that alteration, and we also thought that possibly we should be overloading the Institute at the outset by appointing three directors. I do not mean to say that it will not be necessary for the Director to have one or two expert advisers; on the contrary, I think that such advice will be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It was done at the special request of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. I was present at the interview ait which that request was preferred. The  deputationists  asked for representation upon that Commission, and I understand that the man whom they themselves had selected has been appointed. However, that has nothing ito do with this measure. </para>

                <para>The Government propose to appoint one Director. I hope we shall be able to find a man suited for that difficult post. We want a person of first class ability whose appointment will commend itself, particularly to , those various bodies with which the Director will be intimately associated, if his work is to be productive of the good anticipated. We have deleted from this Bill the matter of the appointment of advisory councils, for reasons which I have already given. The Government highly appreciate the services which quite a number of gentlemen rendered under very difficult conditions while working with a temporary institute, when it was found inadvisable to permit them to launch out in directions, possibly very necessary, but in regard to which it was felt they should not proceed until Parliament had given sanction to this measure. </para>

                        <para>.- Navigation Bills, in some such form as this measure, have been before this Parliament practically ever since the Federal Legislature was inaugurate-!. The present measure is due to various maritime conferences, but even today the Navigation Bill passed in 1912 is not in operation as a Statute of this country. That is largely due to the war. Certain parts, I understand, have been put into operation. In respect to this matter, the Government should state just how the Navigation Bill really stands to-day, and should indicate what parts, if any, are in actual operation. <inline font-style="italic">&#34;When the</inline> seamen&#39;s strike was in existence, about this time last year, it was stated that if the Navigation Act were proclaimed it might have an important bearing upon the settlement of the dispute. I have already stated,  when  dealing with another matter, that during the past twelve months I have travelled around tha Australian coast in various coastal vessels in which the accommodation for the crews was absolutely disgraceful. An ordinarily built man could not turn over in his bunk. It will be scarcely credited that such conditions could exist to-day. The Navigation Bill is different from any ordinary measure, in that it does not call for the assent of the Governor-General, but must be sent to England for the Royal assent. The British Parliament will not errant to any of the Dominions the right to legislate upon the matter of navigation without referring the proposed Statute to the Imperial authorities. It is to be expected, therefore, that even the present Bill, when it has passed, will be hung up for some time, No immediate relief can be expected from this measure in regard to the present  treatment of crews on our coastal vessels. It is a disgrace to some of the wealthy shipping companies of Australia, which take every opportunity to increase freights and fares,  that  such conditions as I saw should exist. At least 95 per cent, of the industrial workers to-day have failed to obtain the improved conditions which they have sought by any other means than by fighting for them, and the same, it appears, must apply to the seamen. Owing to the shortage of shipping, the Government, in some cases recently, have given reluctant permission for the sale of certain vessels off the coastal trade, but on the strict condition that new vessels shall be constructed or purchased to take their place. I learned only last week, however, that a certain company which had obtained permission&#39; to make a sale from among its coastal fleet, on condition that they replaced it with a modern vessel, had failed to fulfil its obligation in the matter. During the war, nearly the whole of our best Inter-State ships were sent oversea on transport and other service, and very many have not yet returned to Australian waters. One of the reasons why the effects of the recent drought have been so severely felt is that there has been a shortage of coastal shipping. To-day, the shortage of coal, owing to the lack of colliers upon our coast, has involved a consequent shortage of wood supplies, for wood has had to take the place of coal in many instances. Colliers have been sold off our coastal service, and have not been replaced. In to-day&#39;s press, there is a report 0;f a deputation which waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> at which seamen complained that the vessels constructed for the Commonwealth Government are not being built in accordance with the provisions of the Navigation Bill, in the matter of accommodation for crews. I hope, for the honour of the Government; that that statement is not correct. The Government should be a model employer; it should set an example, and should not construct ships which fail to fulfil the condition&#39;s laid down&#39; in the Government&#39;s own legislation. </para>

                    <para>It has been stated that, in relation to the proclamation of the Navigation Bill of 1912, unless exemption is granted with respect to certain ports - for example, from Fremantle up along the north-west coast - the trade of that portion&#39; of Australia will be entirely destroyed; no vessels will call there. That argument cannot be applied, however, to the greater portion of the Australian coast, at any rate, between Fremantle and Cairns, or Thursday Island. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, but the honorable member will admit that we ought to be prepared to face the situation. When the Act was passed in 1912 wireless was in its infancy, and as we have progressed since then, we should now provide every safeguard possible. Probably 90 per cent. of all vessels in the Australian trade are already equipped with wireless. It is very necessary that ships crossing Bass Strait should have a wireless installation, because very few vessels are met with on that run. Only the other day we had evidence of the value of wireless, an oil steamer which was short of coal being able to communicate with vessels that were sent out to search for her; and it is possible that the Government steamer <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour</inline> would not have been lost had she been equipped with wireless. </para>

                            <para>- That is a step in the right direction. As pointed out by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West),</inline> three vessels on the New South Wales coast were totally lost, and not one of these carried passengers. The Seamen&#39;s Association consider that the sailors are of equal importance with the passengers, and that they also should have the advantage of wireless. I am not clear as to how much of the Navigation Act is in operation at the present time, but I know that a certain portion of it has been proclaimed. Those honorable members who were here when that measure was before the House know that there are three distinct classes of vessels in the definition section, and that the limited coasting trade and the coasting trade represent two distinct classes of ships and ocean-going vessels. The signatories to the Convention provided that wireless should be installed on vessels going from a port of one country to a port of another country, and that, in the case of Great Britain and France, would mean a distance of only 30 miles. </para>

                            <para>- It is felt that if a concession is made in relation to certain ports of Australia, similar concessions may be granted to other ports. The question of the employment of coolie and other coloured labour is being discussed at the Seamen&#39;s Conference now sitting at Genoa, and there is a fear that if certain vessels are allowed to employ such labour, application for its employment in other directions may be made. However, the seamen, no doubt realizing the difficulties on the north-west coast, have not, I think, offered any objection to the exemption, though they have a fear such as I have just expressed. </para>

Persons have been given permission by the Government to sell ships for other than the coasting trade on condition that they are replaced by modern, up-to-date vessels; but one of the big shipping firms here which received permission to sell a vessel that was engaged in our coastal trade has not replaced it. We all know that on account of the abnormal conditions which have obtained during recent years, steamers which were constructed for &#163;8 per ton fully equipped, have been sold for from &#163;70 to &#163;80 per ton. </para>

They were all anxious to sell vessels, because in China and elsewhere they were able to find a ready market for ships for which it would be difficult to obtain a sea-going certificate to-day. Vessels which had been lying up creeks and on  mud-banks  in other parts of the world, and which had practically been relegated to the scrapheap were brought into service once more because of the shortage of shipping caused during the war. </para>

I am merely asking that those conditions should be stabilized, and that we should place upon our statute-book a Navigation Act which will be as up-to-date as was the Navigation Act&#39; of 1912. In Committee I shall move an amendment in regard to shipwrights, but if the Minister will give me an assurance in regard to the installation of wireless telegraphy on board our coastal vessels, there will be no need for me to move an amendment in that connexion. </para>

                        <para>. - I have not the slightest intention of discussing the technical details of this Bill, but I wish to say a few words concerning the northern part of Western Australia and the restrictions which may  unintententionally  be placed upon trade there - restrictions which may be detrimental Ito the best interests of the Commonwealth. I thank the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> very much for having, at my request, and in the interests of those who are pioneering Australia, withheld the proclamation of the Navigation Act, and for having brought forward an amendment which will enable him during these abnormal times to extend some consideration to the trade of the north &#39;and north-western portions of Western Australia: Had the Act been brought into operation without the .amendments which are contemplated in this Bill, we should have absolutely crippled, and possibly have destroyed, the whole of the settlement in the northern parts of Western Australia. The proposed amendments to section 96 of the principal Act, which will empower the Minister to grant exemptions in certain cases, may very well be enlarged without in any way imperilling the efficiency of the Bill. I feel sure that honorable members opposite, who wish to make the measure as complete as possible, have no desire to destroy settlement in the northern parts of this country. </para>

                            <para>- The shipping position in Australia at the present time is undoubtedly abnormal. I am very glad that the Minister is to be empowered to proclaim the Navigation Act piecemeal, and I would like to clothe him with ample authority to grant concessions until the shipping trade of Australia once more becomes normal. A little while ago, a &#39; terrible drought was experienced in Queensland and New South Wales. Whilst that drought was in progress enormous quantities of fodder were lying in Western Australia, and surely it would have been almost criminal if ships coming from other countries, and calling at Fremantle, had been prevented from bringing that fodder to the eastern States. The Minister should have some power in. that direction. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to refer to an incident which came under my notice whilst I was a member of the Pearling Commission, and which should induce this Parliament to do all possible to ameliorate the conditions of the settlers. Whilst taking evidence from a postmaster regarding the climatic conditions which obtained in the northern part of Western Australia, we were assured that, amongst other things, it was his duty to keep meteorological records, and that his reading of the dry and wet bulbs disclosed that, on many summer evenings, there was 92 per cent, of moisture present in the atmosphere. He added that it was possible for a white man to live in such a climate, but that the life of a woman who had to go into the kitchen was a perfect hell. Now we are asking people to settle in these remote areas, and to build up this country. I am extremely desirous of extending facilities to those who are pioneering these places. Freezing works have been established at Wyndham, and similar works are about to be started at Carnarvon and Geraldton. T believe that most of the northern ports could suppport works of this sort, and if they were established, treble the quantity of stock could be carried in that portion of the country. The report of the party which recently traversed the north-western portion of that State shows the wonderful extent of territory that we have, there, and the enormous numbers of sheep and cattle that it would carry if there were a near market for this stock. In order to build up that area, I believe that the Government would be justified in offering a bonus with a view to attracting ships to that particular coast for the purpose of bringing fresh and frozen meat to the southern portions of this country, and giving increased facilities for settlement. It is quite impossible for us to retain that great territory unless we people and develop it, and some special effort should be made in this direction. The provision contained in this Bill, under which the Minister will be enabled to grant permits to continue in the service boats at present trading on that coast, until such time as other shipping is available, meets with my warm commendation. But I do hope that he will agree to a small amendment under which, instead of making these permits returnable in&#39; six months, the period will be extended to twelve months. Shipping companies require to make their contracts some time ahead, and a. period of six months is scarcely long enough; though, when granting these permits, the Minister should insist upon all the coastal ports being served. I think we are making a great mistake in insisting upon white men going into the stokehold of vessels employed around the Queensland coast or the northern coast of Western Australia. </para>

The tropical conditions are so severe that it is impossible to get the same class of labour in the northern as can be obtained in the southern parts of Australia. Honorable members must extend some consideration to those persons, who, apart from severe climatic conditions, have to face immense difficulties in. connexion with drought, in the matter of obtaining necessary supplies, and the absence of all the amenities of civilization. I trust that, in this Bill, the Minister will make the small concession for which I have asked. </para>

                        <para>. - Hitherto .there has been a. good deal of sentiment surrounding the men who go down to the sea in ships. Much poetry has been written upon the beauties attaching to a sailor&#39;s life. Indeed, upon one occasion, the British Government specially subsidized a poet to write songs of the sea with a view to inducing the young men of the Old Country to embark upon a maritime calling. To the seamen themselves, however, there is very little sentiment connected with their avocation. On the contrary, very strong language is frequently used in regard to it. I intend to discuss this question from the stand-point of the seamen themselves, and not from that of a first class passenger in the saloon of a well-appointed ship. A long time back what were known as coffin ships were very much in evidence. Some owners used to insure their vessels and have them sunk in order to get the insurance money. The lives of the seamen were never considered. Conditions in the past were so horrible that it is a wonder men were got to work on ships. I suppose the sentiment with which a seaman&#39;s life was surrounded induced some men to go to sea, and crews were often recruited from boys who wished to get away from the Old Country. The conditions which prevailed were, however, so bad that I think many of the men must have been brought very close to the edge of starvation before they consented to sign on. </para>

                    <para>After all that has been attempted, from the day of Plimsoll down to the present, to render ships safe and to provide for the safety of those who go down to the sea, the difficulties and trials of sailors are still great, although not so bad as formerly. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in introducing the Bill alluded to the fact that, with all his ingenuity, man had not succeeded in building an unsinkable vessel. We know that many million pounds&#39; have been spent on well appointed ships, but any special provision made has been for the benefit of the passengers, and not of the crews. I hold that for the limited time passengers are on board ship they could put up with a little discomfort, and that full provision should be made for those who are obliged to live permanently on the sea. We all admit now that the seaman is a human being and ought to be considered, just as his fellow men are. </para>
                    <para>Hence our attempt to bring in a navigation law to improve his conditions. Other nations have followed in our footsteps.. The International Conference is following very closely the Bill which we passed in 1912 but never proclaimed, bub we are informed that the delegates to that Conference, while recognising that our law does not contain too many provisions for the benefit of seamen, are indicating where many improvements could bo effected. </para>
                    <para>It is now proposed that portions of Australia shall be exempted from the operations of the Navigation Act. The western coast, for instance, is to be exempted. But there ought to be some limitations in this regard. I have no desire to isolate the people on any particular portion of the Australian coast, which would be the case if the exemptions were not made, unless the Government chose to run their own ships, but my contention is that we ought to demand from every country in the world that conditions should be provided on their ships which would obviate the necessity for making these exemptions. They ought to be asked to see that their standard is that which we have laid down in our Act. However, our seamen will see to this. They have no desire to interfere with the position of people on any part of our coast, but at the same time they contend that these exemptions from the operation of the Act should not be used to their detriment. </para>
                    <para>Recently I introduced a deputation of seamen to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who was very courteous in listening to what they had to say, and promised to give their representations consideration, but it was the usual stereotyped reply. I hope that the consideration given to their requests will be satisfactory to them. One thing they complained about was that they should have been consulted before this Navigation Bill was submitted to Parliament. In days gone by the employer always said that it was not the place of the workmen to interfere with his business. He ran his own business, and would not let a workman interfere with it. But that day has gone. Were in a new world, and the employers recognise that the man who works for wages will demand, and, in fact, has demanded and received, better terms than were conceded to him in the past. I hope that the workers will continue to demand and get better terms until their position is improved. But there is only one method by which their conditions may be improved, and that is by consulting them when anything in which they are interested is under consideration by a Government or any one else. The sailors contend very rightly that they should have been considered in this case. They claim that they are at the mercy of shoremen. Parliamentary representatives of seaport towns are mostly men who have never been to sea, and while they may exercise the ordinary amount of common sense with the opportunities they get of seeing the conditions on ships, and how essential it is to improve them, they can by no stretch of imagination place themselves in the position; of the seamen themselves. They can only do so by actual experience of the conditions under which these men are asked to work. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite correct, and the Bill passed in 1912 was the best we could get up to that time; but since then the world has advanced marvellously. The British Government, who felt that we were bringing into operation something, that might work against their mercantile marine, are now asking that the conditions of seamen should be raised to the standard that was brought about by the war. We now realize the fact that no vessel can go to sea without seamen: That being the case, the men were perfectly justified in claiming that before the introduction of this Bill, they or their representatives should have been consulted. The secretary of the seamen asked the Minister, &#34; How would the farming community like to have laws made for them without first consul tin  r  them or their representatives?&#34; </para>

                    <para>I want to show how essential it was to have consulted the seamen. Since the Navigation Bill was passed in 1912 the Commonwealth Government have built ships in different parts of Australia, but the conditions provided for the sailors on the vessels launched at Williamstown are not as good as those on the old Austral line purchased by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> That statement was made by the seamen to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> They gave the dimensions of the accommodation provided. They explained how, in regard to the dining room for the seamen, if a man went inside and sat down to a meal, he could not get out again until the other men nearer the door had finished and gone outside. And this is the result of our efforts, although the desires of the seamen for improved conditions have been known to us. When the demand is put forward that better provision should be provided for sailors, the argument is advanced that the structural arrangements of the vessels prevent improvements of the character being effected. </para>

                            <para>- My contention is that if the Act has produced the conditions which the sailors say it has, and if these vessels with this accommodation comply with the provisions of the Act, we might as well tear up that measure and start all over again. There are probably men who still consider that the sailors are asking for too much. The seaman does not go on a voyage for the sake of his health, or for a holiday. When he is on a ship he has to work. He is away from his home, and is obliged to conform to certain conditions.  His  liberty is circumscribed. He can hardly be said to be on a parallel with other individuals. Once he signs articles he is in the power of the master of the vessel. There are provisions in the Navigation Act which make it a crime for a sailor to do what men on shore would be rewarded for doing. The seamen admit that insubordination must be prevented. They realize that, to a certain degree, people&#39;s lives, even their own, are at stake &#39;when insubordination arises, but they contend that the conditions under which they work should be such as would not produce insubordination or mutiny. 1 do not think they are asking too much in this respect. If their request is not conceded there will be trouble. I am not talking about any intention to strike or anything of that sort. If the men who will be compelled to work under the provisions of this measure are not satisfied, a strong attempt will doubtless be made by them to improve their conditions, and quite recently we had an example of their determination. It is the duty of honorable members to see that the conditions under which these men work are such that they shall be assured of a reasonable amount of comfort - much more than sailors have had in the past - and if this is not done there is sure to be trouble. </para>

                    <para>In connexion with the construction and manning of ships that have to pass through the tropics, provision is being made for the supply of ice-chests to preserve meat and other commodities. But ice-chests are useless in the tropics, as the meat becomes putrid. Under these  circumstances,  it will be necessary for the seamen to revert to the &#34; bully beef,&#34; used in Nelson&#39;s time. As ice-chests are of little use in tropical regions, it is necessary that a refrigerating plant should be installed on all ships, so that the seamen can be assured of receiving supplies of fresh food. Even if ice-chests are supplied, it is more than probable, according to the statements made by the men, that they will be placed in the vicinity of the boilers. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. In my youthful days I understood, and since then the impression has been confirmed, that of all the &#34; hell &#34; ships afloat, the American vessels were the worst. Most of us have read of the dastardly actions of American ship-masters in ill-treating their men - as has been the case on some ships in the British Navy - :and if we make the conditions too stringent, our ships will be placed at a disadvantage as compared with those of other maritime nations. The United States of America holds an important position as regards her mercantile marine, but I believe that on some American vessels the degree of comfort is not up to the British standard. I have heard sailors speak of the hardships they have experienced on American vessels ; but conditions must be changing, because I have had a document handed to me which was. drawn up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> J. Aldous, the secretary of the Port Phillip Shipwrights Association, setting out full particulars of the accommodation provided on the American steamer <inline font-style="italic">Liberty,</inline> which recently arrived from America. This -is not an isolated case, and it proves conclusively that American ship-owners are making the conditions so good for the seamen that we shall have to make very drastic changes if we desire to reach their standard.  For  the information of honorable members, I quote the following statement concerning the steam-ship <inline font-style="italic">Liberty, to</inline> which 1 have referred : - </para>

                    <para>Seamen are rather afraid of Acts of Parliament, and the officials of the organization consider that they can read an Act that applies to sailors as well as any one else. The representatives of the seamen have perused this measure very carefully, and&#39; have taken exception to certain clauses in it. Their views on these points have already been placed before the Minister for Trade and Customs, who allayed their fears as to the construction to be placed on some of its provisions. If the position is as the Minister stated, I think they will be satisfied; but they are rather afraid of the manner in which the measure is drafted, as they believe its provisions can be used in a way that will prove detrimental to them. The men protest most strongly against the proposed alteration of the definition of &#34; seaman &#34; by the insertion of the following section after section 28 of the principal Act : -  28a.  For the purposes of this division &#34; sea man &#34; and &#34;apprentice include any person who is seeking employment as a seaman or apprentice (as the case may be), or who is  engaged  or supplied, or who is offered for  engagement  or supply as a seaman or apprentice on board a ship. </para>
                    <para class="block">This definition of &#34; seaman &#34; will, it is said, result in lowering the professional status of a seaman, and will, if enacted, be the means of causing ships to be manned with incompetent crews, thereby making them unseaworthy and endangering the lives of all on board. The seamen&#39;s representatives propose that the definition of seaman in Part I., section 6, of the principal Act, viz., &#34; &#39; seaman &#39; means every person employed or engaged in any capacity oh board a ship, except masters, pilots, and apprentices, and persons temporarily on the ship in port,&#34; should be allowed to stand without any alteration. </para>

The seamen admit that while much is demanded of them at sea, It is unfair to enforce such penalties if they fail to join their ships.

                    <para>The demeanour of honorable members to-night shows that they consider that sailors deserve fair and just treatment; but I trust that when they come to details they will not be satisfied to make things merely better than they used to be; it would not be sufficient to do that at the stage of civilization which we have reached. I say to the members of the Country party,, and to the Ministeralists, that the prosperity of our farming and commercial interests is bound up with the well-being of our seamen. Undoubtedly Australia will continue to purchase or&#39; build ships for the conducting of oversea traffic under her own control. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We have proved that it is foolish to lie at the mercy of ship-owners abroad. A great deal is being said about Lord Inchcape and his attempt to control the shipping of Australia. He even went so far as to threaten this Government because of the shipping lines which it owns.  His  conduct is enough to prove that our commercial and rural interests demand that Australia shall govern her own shipping. But if her ships are to succeed, the conditions on board them must be vastly superior to those which now obtain. Men, nowadays, are ready to resort to direct methods if they cannot otherwise secure what they want. Every part of the community is organizing to protect its rights, and the seamen, if their conditions are not improved, will themselves take action to improve them. Unfortunately we have the evidence of sailors themselves, that&#39; even the vessels which have been constructed in Australia do not provide what they deem necessary in the way of accommodation. If that be so, how can shipowners elsewhere be expected to make adequate provision for those who man their ships? Merely from a selfish point of view it behoves the people of Australia to look after the interest of the sailors better than they have been looked after in the past, and to remember that those who cannot otherwise obtain what they deserve will resort to direct methods to get it. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to support the appeal made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews),</inline> for the improvement of the conditions of our merchant seamen, particularly on the Australian coast. The latter put his finger on the spot when he said that the mere betterment of the conditions of the past would not suffice. What we should aim at is to put the seamen on an equality with those who live on shore. In trying to do that we must not take as a guide the conditions of British seamen. For a number of years <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> lot was cast among British seamen on British ships, and I speak moderately when I say that the conditions under which we lived were a disgrace to  the  British flag. Some years ago, in the early days of this Parliament, an inquiry into the condition of seamen was set on foot with a view to some alteration of the navigation laws. </para>

A Port Phillip pilot giving evidence before it said, among other things, that he would not send his dog to sea under the conditions which then existed; that British seamen were the worst fed in the world, and British captains, as a rule,. preferred foreign seamen, because they would stand more than British seamen. </para>

The captain made it a rule ito sign on none but foreigners, because Britishers gave too much trouble at sea.

                            <para>- Less than that, in many cases. I  signed  on out of the port of Melbourne in 1905 for 50s. per month. The food, the wages, and the conditions on board ship were such that English lads were not attracted to the sea in any number, and consequently the British mercantile marine was largely manned by foreigners. The effect of this was seen, when , the war broke out, to be suicidal. Many a British ship during the war failed to reach port because of the foreign element in her crew. We want to guard against this with regard to our merchant seamen on the Australian coast, by making the conditions such as may attract our lads to sea. If we do that it will be better for everybody, and better for the nation, particularly in time of war. I was rather surprised, as I think the whole House was, to hear the statement of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the forecastle accommodation on the new Commonwealth steamships was unsatisfactory. I hope that statement will be inquired into, because it is rather an extraordinary one to make, and a scandalous thing if it is true. We in Australia should not set up for our seamen a standard based on the conditions given to the seamen of Great Britain. We should insist on a fair standard for the other nations of the world to copy, in spite of the plea of uniformity raised by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline> If the honorable member meant by uniformity that we should lower out standard to conform with that of the British Mercantile Marine, I for one will not favour such a proposal. Although I am a country representative, I took the opportunity of rising to-night in order to put up a plea for the men among whom my lot was cast for a number of years, and because the organised farmers, of Victoria have adopted the principle that, while they are out to secure justice for the men on the land, they are prepared at all times to give justice to all other sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>.- Can the Minister give the Committee any information as to what parts, if any, of the principal Act are now in operation? I understand that a certain portion of it was proclaimed, but that that proclamation was revoked. This clause provides that the Bill shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation. I am more concerned about how much of the principal Act is in operation than I am about this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- This is one of the most vital portions of the Bill. A lot of the trouble that has arisen has been caused by the continual postponements. I realize that the original postponement owing to the then existing conditions was absolutely necessary, but we are getting out of those conditions to-day, and what I am pleading for is a definite statement as to the time when we are likely to make a start in rendering our navigation legislation effective. It is of no use to hold the Act before the seamen and others employed on ships as a placard, with the assurance that at some time or other we are going to confer these benefits on them. That is one of the things that the seamen complain of, and rightly so. Can the Minister tell the Committee what has been done with the British Merchant Shipping Act, and with regard to the Convention, and the amending Act which was passed and assented to on the 1st August, 1914, just prior to the war? Is that Act in operation so far as Great Britain is concerned ? If it is, there is no reason why the Australian Act should not be put into operation. Whilst in the case of most of our Acts we bring the whole measure into operation at once, this legislation is cut into sections, and it is provided that we can put different sections into operation at different times. If a. good deal of this legislation were put into operation it would save a great deal of difficulty and trouble such as we have experienced in the past. </para>

                        <para>. - The British Act to which the honorable member has referred is not yet in operation. The British authorities have found themselves up against very much the same class of difficulty that  we have experienced here. The abnormal conditions arising out of the war have not entirely passed away, and they have been unable to proclaim their Act, just as we have been unable to proclaim ours. We are pressing on as rapidly as possible with all the preparatory work, but a great deal has yet to be done to place us in a position to proclaim the whole Act. It is the intention of the Government at the first possible moment to bring the whole Act into operation. I can give the honorable member the further assurance that, as our preparations to take over from the States the whole administration of navigation are completed, and we find ourselves in a position to proclaim any portion of the Act which can with advantage be brought into operation, we shall immediately do so. As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the position is still abnormal in many directions, and we could not with advantage to the country as a whole, notwithstanding our desire  to put this Act into operation at the first possible moment, proclaim it just at present. I can, however, give the Committee the definite assurance that it is the desire and intention of the Government to proclaim the Act at the first possible opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- There are quite a number of matters which we are not ready to handle. A great deal of preparatory work has to be done, and officers have to be appointed. We are proceeding with &#39; the making of those appointments as rapidly as we can. We have also to make all the necessary preparations for taking over so many of the State servants as are required in the circumstances. The Director of Navigation is now busily engaged on those things, and I hope it will not be long before we are in a position to proclaim practically the whole Act. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to attach special blame to the Ministry, but, speaking generally,  in  matters relating to the mercantile marine, there appears to be a desire to see what Great Britain is doing before taking action. The principle seems to be that what she does we may safely do. In 1912, this Parliament passed a Navigation Bill that was declared by the British Board of Trade to be a hundred years ahead of its time. Within less than two years, however, the British Government had to admit that in that measure, the Australian Parliament had laid the foundation for the navigation laws of the civilized world. Under this clause the Minister takes power to withhold the issue of certain proclamations bringing the Act into operation. Are we to wait until the people of Great Britain take certain action, and then meekly follow their lead, or are we again to take the lead in navigation matters, and set an example to the rest of the world ? </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that certain measures must be reserved for the Royal assent; but many people say there are numerous restrictions which ought to be eased. If the Government put up a decent fight, there would be a relaxing of this tieing-up process, but if there is a lack of &#34; fight &#34; on this side, we shall continue to remain at the apron-strings. </para>

                            <para>- My electorate does not touch the sea at any point; but eight years have elapsed since the original Navigation Act was passed, and while I admit  that war conditions have prevented the bringing of that Act into operation, I feel that we ought not always to live under the shadow of the Great War. Are we never to attempt to return to normal conditions? I protest against this handing over <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> power. Let us have this measure passed and brought into operation as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not think it fair to delay the bringing of this measure into operation. The reasons for delay advanced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> are not very sound. He says that the Government have not had time to make the necessary arrangements. The flaw in his argument is that the original Act was passed in 1912, so that both the Government and the shipping companies have had many years in which to make the necessary preparations. It seems to me that this is a piece of humbug on the part of the Government. They are promising some illusory thing to the seamen and those following mercantile pursuits. They have been dangling this measure before their eyes for years, and it is time for us to take a definite stand. Parliament and the country should tell the Government in unmistakable terms that they are not to humbug the seamen any longer. </para>

                            <para>- But it was allowed to remain in abeyance for years, because of the crisis through which the world was passing. But for the mercantile marine of Great Britain, the Allied countries would have been starved. They made it possible for the Allies to win the war. They were promised that if they carried out their duties these improved conditions would be given them at the end of the war. To: day, after five or six years of promising, they are told that they must wait for a further period. Either the conditions for which this Bill provides are right or they are wrong. The conditions demanded by the Navigation Act are right or wrong, and if they are right they should be complied with without delay. The shipping companies can have no ground for complaint in connexion with this matter, because they have had years of notice within which to prepare for the enforcement of the provisions of the Act. They have not done so because they have been top busy building up huge dividends during the war, and have neglected to so improve the accommodation for seamen on their ships as to comply with the requirements of the Navigation Act. I shall strenuously oppose giving the Government power to postpone the operation of one of the provisions, of the measure. </para>

                        has taken up the cudgels on behalf of the seamen, and if the facts were as he has represented them, there would be grave cause for complaint. But if we take into consideration the ships trading on the Australian coast to-day, it will be found that a very small percentage of them indeed do not, in respect of the accommodation provided for seamen, comply with the provisions laid down by the Navigation Act. The shipping companies have been preparing for the proclamation of the Act. I wish to remind the honorable member and the Committee generally that only a few months ago, when, unfortunately, we had a seamen&#39;s dispute affecting shipping on the coast of Australia, it was one of the terms agreed upon for the settlement of that dispute that every possible ship trading in Australian waters should, where necessary, be altered without delay to comply with the conditions imposed by the Navigation Act. It was one of the conditions of resumption of work by members of the Seamen&#39;s Union that the provisions applying to the accommodation provided for seamen should immediately be complied with whether the Navigation Act was proclaimed in force or not. I am surprised that the honorable member for Dalley, who represents a portion of Sydney Harbor, should not be aware of this fact. No proclamation of the Act will make the application of its provisions more binding than they have been made by the agreement by which the seamen&#39;s strike was settled and the. men agreed to return to work.

                        <para>- I am not responsible for the drafting of the measure now under consideration, but I can give a reason for the inclusion of clause 5. It was discovered iri Western Australia when certain sections of the original Act were proclaimed, that there was no power under the Act, once the proclamation was issued, to vary it in any shape or form. It was necessary to proclaim the whole of a division of the original Act, and there was no power to proclaim a particular section or part of a division. Clause 5 of this Bill gives the Minister power to proclaim particular sections of any division of the Act. The necessity for such a power became apparent immediately when certain portions of the original Act were proclaimed in March of this year. If honorable members will read clause 5 of this Bill they will see that it is designed to overcome that difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot remember the whole of the matters with which it dealt, but it was passed mainly in order to enable us to proclaim a portion of the Navigation Act at any given time, and to avoid the necessity of having to proclaim the whole of the Act at once. As the original measure was drawn it could be proclaimed in force as a whole, with the exception of the coastal trading provisions. There was a section under which it was necessary that the coastal trading provisions should be specially proclaimed, and we put through a short amending measure to enable us to proclaim the Act in force piecemeal, and also to enable us to extend the provisions of the Act to the territories which under mandate are to come under the control of the Australian Parliament. As the Bill now before the Committee contains no new principle, and is submitted only that Australia may carry out its pledge to adhere to the conclusions of the International Convention, I imagine that the Royal assent to it will be received very shortly after a copy of the measure is received by post in England. </para>

                        <para>.- On the question raised by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> I think, speaking from memory, it was over twelve months from the time the Navigation Bill was passed by this Parliament before we received notice that the Royal assent had been given to it. The reason for the delay is, I think, to be found in the fact that its provisions were so radical when compared with other navigation laws in existence at the time. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the Board of Trade and the shipping people placed every obstacle possible in the way of its acceptance. I do not know what communications were received by the Department of Trade and Customs in connexion with the matter, but I have no doubt that the Board of Trade and the shipping people at Home desired that some of the stringent provisions of our Act should be watered down. As I have stated, it was the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> soon after the passing of our Navigation Bill in 1912 that made it plain to the Governments of other countries that it was necessary to bring their navigation laws into line with that which we had passed. If the honorable member for West Sydney will compare our Navigation Act with the report of the Convention, which I handed to him this afternoon, he will see that the articles of the Convention are in line with the measure we passed in 1912. A statement was made by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> this afternoon concerning the Navigation Commission that considered the measure. I think the Commission sat from 1905 to 1907, and there was subsequently a Navigation Conference held in Great Britain, which was attended, on behalf of Australia, by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Wollaston. The Navigation Bill was .before every Federal Parliament from 1904 to 1912 on more occasions and in more various forms than even the Bill for the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry. </para>

                            <para>- As the amendments contained in this measure are very slight, nothing like the same length of time should elapse before assent is given to it. But I am anxious that the provisions of the original Act should be put in operation. Of course, we have to take over certain marine services from the States; that work must be done. </para>

                        <para>.- I asked the question as to how long it would take to get the Royal assent to this measure, not because I was unaware of the time usually occupied in the case, of measures that are reserved, but rather in order to obtain an assurance from the Minister that he would endeavour to expedite the matter. There, is no doubt that a great deal of dissatisfaction arose from the fact that the Navigation Act was not earlier proclaimed, although when the necessity arose for making an amendment, assent to the amending measure was obtained by cable. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell)</inline> ,has practically admitted that the seamen themselves forced action upon the Government. No wonder there are men who complain that parliamentary action is no good when they found that, as a result of their own direct action on that occasion, the Government were forced to take certain steps. It is unfortunate that the Government were not sufficiently alive to the situation to take action before they were forced to do so by the men. I quite agree with the remarks that fell from the honorable member for Maribrynong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> with regard to the reservation of Bills. I contend that the Royal assent should be given upon the advice 6f Australian Ministers only. That is part of the programme of the Labour party, and I think the time is opportune to have that view placed before &#39;the Imperial authorities. An opportunity to do so was furnished in connexion with the mission of the ex-Treasurer  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> I should like to know whether any portion of the ex-Treasurer&#39;s mission- was connected with navigation matters. Certain correspondence between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the ex-Treasurer after he left Australia has been placed before the House, but I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will give the Committee some indication of the scope of the ex-Treasurer&#39;s mission. Perhaps he will be good enough to explain also whether the purposes of the ex-Treasurer&#39;s mission were set out in writing, so that we may know what the mission was and what communications from the other side of the world led to the honorable member for Balaclava being sent to London. I do not think that the cables which have been made public by the Prime Minister can be properly interpreted until we know the scope of the ex-Treasurer&#39;s mission and authority, and&#39; the circumstances in which the mission was decided upon. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a very indefinite definition. It sets out to define really what a seaman is, and a true description will have a great effect in putting down crimping, which has been, and still is, rampant around the Australian coast. Seamen have expressed the fear that, under the section in the principal Act, an indefinite position would arise regarding the designation of a seaman, and how he should be shipped on to a vessel. The position was such that it admitted of other than practical persons being shipped, by any party, in any way, without proper check being placed upon their actions. But, in regard to the present proposal of the Government, I desire a clear understanding whether the other extreme has not been gone to in permitting the manning of ships by persons who have had no sea-going experience at all. Unless the position is made quite clear, considerable danger and trouble may arise in the manning of vessels. We should seek to ensure safety at this stage. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a matter to which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> referred, and in regard to which a deputation from the executive of the Seamen&#39;s Union waited on me some days ago. A fear was expressed that this definition, applying as it does, to this part of the measure, and to this part only, would weaken the general definition of seamen. It will not have that effect at all. In regard to the complaint made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the seamen had not been consulted with reference to these amendments, I might say that they were inserted as a result of representations made by the executive of the Seamen&#39;s Union in order to checkmate certain boardinghouse-keepers or crimps operating in Newcastle. The term &#34; seaman &#34; or &#34; apprentice &#34; in the principal Act has a very definite meaning. A &#34;seaman&#34; means a person employed or engaged in any capacity on board ship, and an &#34; apprentice&#34; a person bound by indenture to the sea service. Some difficulty has arisen in consequence of this definition, and in a Court case at Newcastle, where a man was charged with illegally supplying seamen, the defence raised was that the person supplied was not a seaman within the meaning of the Act because he was not at the time employed or engaged on a ship. The Court upheld the point raised, so that although the man charged was guilty of the offence, he got off. The executive of the Seamen&#39;s Union then made representations to the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Government in connexion with the matter, and this amendment has been inserted to meet that case. Outside of sections  28  to  33  the definition will have no effect whatever. It will not affect the definition of &#34; seaman &#34; or the obligation thrown upon the employers of seamen in relation to any other portion of the Act. The only purpose is to safeguard the interests of seamen. </para>

                        <para>.- Subclauses  3, 4,  and  5  are quite right, and sub-clause  6  is a wise provision, as it states that a seaman must satisfy the Superintendent that he can pull an oar and handle a boat. But their value is destroyed by sub-clause  7,  which states that any persons rated as greasers, firemen, shipwrights, or ship&#39;s carpenters, before the commencement of this division, shall continue to be entitled to be so rated. I remember on one occasion at Cairns the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Wodonga</inline> sent two men ashore in a boat to tie the ship up. The men promptly jumped ashore with the rope, and allowed the boat to float down the river. Naturally the captain used &#34; language,&#34; and remarked that on the next occasion he would send a stewardess ashore, as she would do better. That was his opinion of the ability of those men. The provisions in sub-clauses  3, 4,  and  5  are perfectly satisfactory; but I would go further, and say that no man should be engaged as a seaman unless he was able to swim. Under the clause as it stands, if a man is engaged on a vessel as ship&#39;s carpenter, he will be entitled to rate as such when the Act. comes into operation; though, as a matter of fact, he might not be qualified for that position at all, and as much may depend upon his ability as upon any one else on board. </para>

                            <para>- No, because a man need only show his discharge as a shipwright in order to be rated as such. I suggest that the Minister provide, either in this or a subsequent clause, that the superintendent, before whom a seaman is engaged, shall refuse to enter him unless he gives satisfactory proof of his title to be rated. In Great Britain shipwrights hold certificates from the Board of Trade, but the Board of Trade in Australia does not undertake that duty. I suggest that shipwrights and carpenters be excluded from the operation of this clause, so as to compel the superintendent to see that only competent men are engaged, and that trained men may receive a certificate of competency. </para>

                        <para>. -  I can not see my way clear to accept the suggested amendment. What is done by the Bill is to bring under one clause all the scattered provisions relating to the rating of seamen. Under the original Act fire men and greasers and able seamen who are rated at the time of the passing of the Act are entitled to be so rated, and  we propose to treat shipwrights and carpenters in exactly the same way.I think that clause 14 fully safeguards the position, but I shall look into the matter between now and to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- This work, which comprises the establishment of a mobilization stores depot, is both necessary and urgent. As explained previously to the House in connexion with the proposed  establishment of a similar depot at Seymour, Victoria, the Commonwealth Government has arranged with the Imperial authorities for equipment and vehicles for five dismounted and two mounted divisions of the Australian Imperial Force to be sent to Australia. The equipment and vehicles have to be stored and issued as required. This material is now arriving, and the Western Australian portion of it will, it is proposed, be principally located in these stores at Midland Junction. It is, therefore, an extremely urgent necessity that the buildings be completed at the earliest possible date, as temporary storage accommodation for only a limited portion of the equipment is available. The decision to erect these stores at Midland Junction has been arrived at after very careful consideration by the expert officers of the Defence Department, after reviewing and inspecting other possible sites. </para>

                        <para>- That condition has been embodied in this motion for the purpose of allowing the six members of this House who are members of the Public Works Committee to absent themselves from Melbourne while Parliament is sitting. I do not think that that is a wise principle to adopt. When the Committee of Public Works Act was passed it was expressly provided that the Committee should not sit whilst Parliament was sitting. If the work is urgent, cannot the information required be obtained in Melbourne? </para>

                    <para>. -I desire to direct the attention of the Minister for the Navy(Sir Joseph Cook) to the position which obtains at Cockatoo Island. The honorable gentleman will remember that a few weeks ago I pointed out that there was a considerable quantity of material lying on the island - material required for the construction of a coal ship - and that the work of building that vessel was not being proceeded with. As a result, numbers of men have been thrown out of employment. I am credibly informed that considerably more than 800 tons of material for the construction of this vessel are now lying at Cockatoo. This material in itself is sufficient to enable work on the ship to be carried on for the next two or three months. Yet men are being discharged daily. Unless the work is proceeded with immediately some 500 or 600 hands will find themselves in idleness. I would strongly impress upon the Minister the desirableness of doing something in this matter. I hope that he will not allow himself to be bluffed by any statement to the effect that certain material is not to hand. </para>

Upon that occasion the right honorable gentleman gave certain information to the public which was contained in cable messages that had passed between himself and the late Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> I gather from the press that in the course of that statement the Prime Minister affirmed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> had resigned three&#39; times prior to his departure for London. No doubt that statement was made with a view to discrediting the late Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- I conclude that it was made with that object, particularly when I view it in conjunction with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the late Treasurer had deserted the duty that he was to perform for Australia on the other side of the world. I think that, in the public interests - not to speak of the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> himself, who is now about 12,000 miles distant - an early opportunity should be given honorable members to discuss this matter. For my own part, I do not think that anybody can come to a correct conclusion in regard to the contents of those cables unless he is placed in possession of the cable communications from London to the Commonwealth Government, which led up to the sending of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to England. </para>

                        <para>- It is  necessary  that we should see them in order that we may learn what was the requirement of the British authorities which led to the sending of the late Treasurer to London, and in order that we may be able to conclude what his authority ought to. have been. In addition, I think we should know the actual instructions which were given to him when leaving here. What was the scope of his mission ? I suppose that it is contained in some written -document, a copy of which should be available to honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- It is very extraordinary if the Government sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to London without having some previous communication from the Imperial authorities. As far as I can gather from one reference in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt&#39;s</inline> cablegrams, there must have been some such communication from the Imperial Government. </para>

                <para>Then it is a matter of great interest to me to know what were the circumstances connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt&#39;s</inline> three resignations. In fairness to the late Treasurer, should not the grounds for his resignations have been stated? If those resignations were in writing - and we have been told that they were - the documents should be produced. No doubt, in addition to containing an intimation of his resignation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> also notified what were the grounds for his action. I am sure the country would be interested to know what were the representations made to the late Treasurer that prevented him from insisting on his resignation being accepted. These are all matters of great concern to the people of Australia, particularly in view of the fact that we were told important business which had to be transacted on the other side of the world suffered in consequence of the Minister&#39;s delinquency. Therefore, at the earliest possible moment, honorable members ought to be given the opportunity of discussing the&#39; statements made by the Prime Minister, and endeavouring to extract the information I have referred to, and other information of a similar nature. I hope that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will be able to give us an intimation as to what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the question I am submitting. </para>

                    <para>. - The further .intentions of the Government in regard to the matter are nil. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> might very well leave our little family quarrels alone. If he is very anxious to get into a fight, I have no doubt he could find plenty on his own side to concern him. He demonstrates plainly to-night that he is a true Irishman. He thinks there is a fight on, and he wants to be in it. I think he had better keep out of it. I do not know that it concerns him very vitally. </para>
