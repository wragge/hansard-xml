                        <para>- I wish to ask you a question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in reference to a paragraph that appeared in to-day&#39;s press relative to the presentation of an address to the Prince of Wales, on behalf of Parliament, by the Presiding Officer of another branch of the Legislature. Will you kindly inform the House if any precedent exists under which the Presiding Officer of the Senate can act as the mouthpiece of this Chamber ? What is the usual procedure followed in the presentation of addresses by Parliament to the King or his representative? </para>

                        <para>- I knew nothing of the matter to which the honorable member refers until I saw the paragraph in a morning newspaper, but I have since had an interview with the  President  concerning it, from which I have learned that some proposal of the kind referred to is in contemplation. </para>

                    <para>The procedure followed in the presentation of addresses to the King or his representative has been that each House has, on motion, adopted the address, which has then been presented to the representative of the Crown by the Presiding Officer of each House respectively. The last occasion on which Parliament  presented an address to the Crown was after the capitulation of Germany and the virtual termination of the war, when each House adopted an address of congratulation to  His  Majesty the King, and the addresses wore presented by the Presiding Officers of the respective Chambers, namely, by the  President  for the Senate, and by me, as  Speaker,  for this House, on ground common to both Houses; on that occasion it was on the steps in front to this building. On all other occasions when addresses have been presented to the King&#39;s representative, they have been presented, so far as I can learn, by the Presiding Officer of each Chamber on behalf of the branch of the Legislature over which he presides. The  Speaker  is the official medium of communication between the House of Representatives and the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- I did not read it through, and therefore I am unable to answer the question positively, but seeing that the. proposals were presented in a very condensed form, it is highly improbable that it does. I noted that certain things which in my view are material were omitted. However, I shall look at the report again, and see whether it may be said to accurately reflect my opinions. It does not, and cannot be said to, set out the opinions of the Government, because it was not intended to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Until I know what proposals the honorable member alludes to - and I am not at all sure that he knows what proposals have been put forward - I can hardly refute any statement that has been made, and I certainly do not propose to embarrass the wool-growers of Australia, or this Government, by having cable communication with the British Government over a matter that does not concern it. Our 1920-21 wool clip is the property of the growers of Australia, and the British Government have no more to do with it than the French or the American Government. </para>

                            <para>Prior to the war, the service was carried out weekly by steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Orient Line, under contracts with the British and Commonwealth Governments respectively. These contracts were interrupted by the war, and I have been unable to ascertain definitely when the Peninsular and Oriental steamers (under contract with the British Government), which were withdrawn altogether from the Australian service, will take up that service regularly, but I understand that the company hopes to resume monthly running to Australia from July, 1920. The Orient contract, which does not expire until 17th September, 1921, is being carried out as far as possible with the reduced number of steamers available, and action is proceeding on the question of arranging a fresh contract on its expiration. </para>

The  Deputy President  of the Arbitration Court, on 9th April, 1920, fixed the basic wage for the Commonwealth at &#163;3 10s. per week, and this is being paid from 26th April. The adoption of State rates would involve differential Federal rates, which is not desirable or practicable. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; that is why so much detail has been required in this new alternative amendment. There is not the slightest hope of our coming to an amicable arrangement with the Senate for the acceptance of our other proposal, and the only alternative is to send forward this new proposal or drop the Bill altogether, thus depriving those who are to participate in its extended benefits of the advantages it gives. There is no doubt it is a much more liberal measure than the Act on the statute-book to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to create friction between the two Houses on those lines. Some honorable senators are opposed to the proposition right out, but from what I can gather from reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the Senate&#39;s proceedings, the principal objection to our proposal was because of the loose way in which it was drafted. All cause for objection on that ground is removed by the new proposal, because it imposes fairly stringent conditions. As custodians of the public purse, it is the duty of this House, as well as of the Senate, to see that legislation of this character is so drafted as to adequately protect the Commonwealth revenue and provide no opportunities for abuse. </para>

                    <para>.- I sincerely regret that the Minister has not given the Committee more opportunity to consider these proposals. I take very grave exception to his suggestion that my amendment was loosely drawn. It was most carefully drafted, and the addition of the last paragraph, at the request of the Minister, providing that regulations might prescribe the conditions under which any loan should be repayable, made the clause almost perfect. </para>

                    <para>M.H.R.,  or by making advances to returned soldiers for investment in co-operative enterprises. This meeting is of opinion that a successful co-operative scheme will do much to solve the present high cost of living, and to foster Australian industries.&#34; </para>

                <para>I commend the foregoing resolution for your kind co-operation, and trust that you maybe successful in placing this concession on the statute-book. </para>
                <para>I do not desire to delay the passage of this Bill. It should be put into operation as soon as possible. But I fear that the alternative proposal suggested by the Minister can only lead to delay. I am satisfied that honorable members will not accept the amendment in its present loosely drawn state, for the reason that there is a doubt as to whether the &#163;150 is to be granted to each individual or to each group. </para>

                <para class="block">Probably over 200,000 soldiers are at work to-day. I understand that of all who have returned only about 18,000 are receiving sustenance. The great majority of the returned men are engaged in the factories, workshops, mines, or other places of employment. I suppose that most of them are, in the opinion of the Department, satisfactorily re-established in civil life. Therefore, if the Minister can prove that &#34; Digger &#34; Jones has been working at, say, Bedggood&#39;s factory for over six mouths, that man will be considered satisfactorily re-established in civil life, and he will not be entitled to any loan. The very men who might make a success of the co-operative scheme are probably those men who have been already re- absorbed in civil life. I suggest, and I will vote accordingly, that the Minister should withdraw his alternative amendment, and bring in a Bill to give effect to this scheme. If the proposal is to be placed on a proper basis, it ought to be introduced in the form of a Bill, so that the clauses may be properly drafted to insure a practicable scheme in which the interests of both the Commonwealth and the returned soldiers will be properly safeguarded. </para>

                    <para>.- After only a cursory glance at the proposition submitted : by the Government, a number of difficulties have been discovered. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has pointed to several mistakes, which the Minister, of course, has readily promised to rectify; but if mistakes can be found in this proposition after a mere cursory glance at it, it is probable that mature consideration would disclose many more. The suggestion that this scheme should be withdrawn from the Bill and embodied in a separate measure is one to which I shall not agree unless I have an assurance from the Minister as to the approximate date on which the new measure will be introduced. It seems to me that this new alternative scheme has been drafted at the behest of the leaders of the Senate, who are not the custodians of the public purse, and in such a form as to place almost insuperable difficulties in the way of returned soldiers who desire to become their own masters. It would exclude from the operation of the system applicants who, in the opinion of the Commission, had been satisfactorily settled in civil life. A concrete instance of the injustice which this would work is to be found in the statement made a few days ago by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart).</inline> The honorable member stated that he saw a number of returned soldiers doing the major work of a saw-milling business at a railway siding, and was told by them that the only reason why they did not start for themselves was that they had not the necessary capital. With a little assistance from the Government they would be able to start for themselves ; but, under this alternative proposal, they would be regarded as having been &#34; satisfactorily settled in civil life.&#34; These are the very class of men we want to reach. They would probably become leaders of others, and would be responsible for the industrial salvation of quite a number. I join with the honorable member for Capricornia in urging that the matter be allowed to stand over until a later hour, so that we might have time to consider it. I shall certainly oppose the proposition as it comes from the Senate. </para>

House suggestions, the carrying out of which would involve an expenditure of millions  of  pounds. And  these suggestions come from, the very men who are most clamant for economy.

                        <para>- I am saying so, and this further amendment says so in the plainest terms. It says in effect that there is a limit to which we can go, even in connexion with so desirable an objective as the repatriation of our soldiers. The Government would&#39; like to go quite as far as would any honorable member in that direction. This Sill is not necessarily a law of the Medes and Persians. It can develop just as the whole scheme of repatriation has done. This Bill represents a stage in the evolution of the scheme. As experience shows more and more to be necessary, more and more can be done. The Bill imposes upon us quite enough financial obligations for the immediate outlook, and these limitations are imposed so that we may know exactly what we are facing. That is necessary in the interests of the financial position of the country. </para>

I ask my honorable friends to get this scheme into operation, and if it is proved that more money can be usefully and  reproductively  .spent on these lines, the Government can always be asked for it. The Bill is much more liberal than was intended. According to the Prime Minister&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">pronunciamiento</inline> to the country, the expenditure under it was to be &#163;650,000, but the increase in war pensions alone, for which it makes provision, will run into at least &#163;1,250,000, and there are many other increases. We must pull up somewhere. Certain proposals may be justified on their abstract merits, and when regarded apart from their relation to the Bill as a whole; but I beg honorable members to consider what the measure involves financially, and I ask them to say whether it does not make a generous contribution for the welfare of the soldiers. </para>

                <para>May I remind honorable members of a few of the commitments of this new Parliament? It may seem to some honorable gentlemen a small thing to ask for an increase here or there, but  if they ever have to find the money for the whole, they will experience great difficulty in doing so. &#39;The War Gratuity Bill will increase our interest expenditure next year &#39;by &#163;1,500,000, and we shall want another &#163;1,500,000 to- meet other increases in interest on expenditure on behalf of soldiers or their dependants. In this Bill the war pensions are increased by &#163;1,250,000; the slight increase that has been made in the old-age pensions will add &#163;750,000 to the bill for next year and it looks as though the awards of the Courts would increase our expenditure by another &#163;750,000. It is estimated, too, that the expenses of the Repatriation Department will run to another &#163;1,000,000 next year. </para>

What that increase will be I cannot pretend to say. Again, the cost of running all the Departments will increase, because of the rise in the price of materials, upkeep, and everything else that makes living more expensive.

                        <para>- It really lapses at the end of this year, but we shall get some revenue from it next year. Apparently next year our expenditure may be anything between &#163;7,000,000 and &#163;9,000,000 more than this year, and the increase will be due nearly entirely to the war and the consequent repatriation of the soldiers. Yet I am told by honorable members that we should spend still more heavily. Dp not they see that our financial condition will nob permit us to do so? We must keep within our means and resources. No doubt were I in Opposition, I could criticise the Pill as effectively as its opponents are doing, because it is easy to criticise and to say that this and that should be done. But we have to make up our minds as to what is a fair thing under all  the circumstances, and having regard to the difficulty of getting the money that will be needed, I cannot regard proposals for expenditure as though they related to water-tight compartments. I have to consider them in relation to the finances generally; and our expenditure is mounting to a figure that is becoming appalling. This year, in connexion with repatriation, we shall spend something over &#163;8,000,000 on land settlement, &#163;5,000,000 on housing, &#163;500,000 on postal arrangements, and another &#163;500,000 on advances to the States to provide employment. </para>

                        <para>- Never mind sustenance - never mind details. The outlook for next year is &#163;21,000,000 for those same purposes, and for war pensions next year our liability is between &#163;6,000,000 and &#163;7,000,000, and it is more likely to be nearer &#163;7,000,000. I invite honorable members to keep these facts in mind when they so readily make proposals for expenditure of one kind or another. We have to &#39;&#39; bring up &#34; somewhere - there is some limit - if we are to keep within our compass and our means. I suggest strongly that to-day we arc doing a fair and generous thin,; by &#39;these men. We cannot possibly do what honorable members suggest by the implications of their speeches. We cannot set every man up in business, or give him chances, other than his own calling affords. No country could afford to do that, and no country has attempted it. In these respects we have done more than any other country on the globe. </para>

                        <para>- There is no manner of doubt, in my judgment, and the honorable member will find that what I say is right. We have the prospect of having to raise, in addition to revenue, about &#163;30,000,000 in fresh loan moneys during next year. Altogether, I tell honorable  members  the financial outlook is just as serious as it can be. Our revenue is coming in well, and our financial position is sound, but it requires careful handling. We can -just as easily make a mess of things as not, unless we stiffen ourselves to meet the financial obligations which are peaking up at so rapid and acute a rate. This year we are coming to the apex; we have been steadily climbing up year by year, and to-day we are getting to the top. I therefore suggest to honorable members that they do not push their proposals any further, for we cannot afford to carry them out until we shape ourselves differently, and see what the outlook is likely to be in the near future. We have as big a load as we can conveniently carry, and I beg honorable members to accept the Bill as it is - to accept it as a fair and generous contribution on the lines promised at- the elections and since. On the whole, it is a Bill and a proposal which I believe fairly satisfies the soldiers as a whole. I hope honorable members will do nothing to-day, or at any other time, to jeopardize our proposals or overload them in any unreasonable way, having regard to the obligations we have to face in the near future. </para>

                    <para>. --The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has said either too much or too little. Under cover of asking honorable members to defeat the amendment that was carried by this House, he has delivered what is practically ti semi-Budget speech; to quote his own words, the amendment has to be judged by the financial outlook. The honorable gentleman should have delivered that speech when the Bill was introduced; he ought to have told us that the financial outlook is black, and that we have to pay all these millions for pensions, war service homes, and so forth. The Ministers of the two big spending Departments - Defence and Repatriation - are not in this House, the Ministers <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen and Senator Pearce)</inline> both being members of another place. There they are gradually getting control of the spending of this money, and those two Departments spend more than the whole of the other Departments put together. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> in his Budget speech, showed that we are spending &#163;78,000,000 on war, up to the end of June, this year, an expenditure representing &#163;1,500,000 a week. </para>

I shall be pleased to support the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> in his original amendment, or any substitute for it, in order to show that we were earnest in all the promises we made to the men on the platform. I made promises on the platform, and to those . promises I shall be true, though apparently other honorable members would desire to evade them on the ground that they are afraid of a financial crash. We should have had to raise a great deal more money than this co-operative proposal would involve if the Parliament had accepted the proposals for conscription, which were supported by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir joseph Cook),</inline> and which would have resulted in the raising of 200,000 more men. I shall vote against the proposal of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I  agree with honorable members who have made an appeal to the Government not to press this amendment to a division without giving honorable members more time for consideration. I certainly do not feel in a position to express an opinion without more time being allowed. The difficulty in which we find ourselves now very largely arises from the fact that the Government really does nob believe in this amendment. I do not think that the Government believed in the amendment that was originally proposed by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and the amendment before us, after all, is, I feel very strongly, only a kind of makeshift. </para>

I  cannot understand the position that some honorable members seem to have taken up when on the recruiting platform. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. , Tudor)</inline> speaks of the lavish promises he made to the men to whom he appealed. </para>

                        <para>- That every one did not make. I did as much on the recruiting platform as most honorable members, and, speaking for myself, I defy any honorable member to say that on any occasion I held out any promises to the men to whom I appealed. I made my appeal from the highest stand-point - the stand- point of their duty to the country, and to their fellows at the Front ; and I never made any promise as to what would be done for them, or given to them, on their return. I may say that I found the appeal I did make to the men an effective one. I agree with the Acting Treasurer that Australia has acted justly by the men who went to the Front, and I think, if we were to ask the average returned soldier, he would say that he has been fairly and well treated. This cooperative movement is something over and above anything that was promised, I believe, by any one to the soldiers before they went away. </para>

                        <para>- It might mean delay, but what is the delay of a few weeks or months in a great movement of this kind? There is a new and great principle involved in this proposal - and we are establishing a new departure.  My  experience of the House, so far, has been that there is far too much impulsive legislation. Honorable members vote on impulse, instead of being given time for calm consideration so that their votes may be the expression of a mature opinion formed by a well-informed mind. As I have not had time to read this new amendment, I cannot honestly vote upon it, because my vote would mean nothing. </para>

                <para> My mind is not informed. I have not had time for consideration. One para-  graph catches my&#39; eye, the one to which the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has drawn attention, dealing with the classes of men to whom advances will not be made. Included among them are men who in the opinion of the Commission have been satisfactorily established in civil life. It all depends on what is meant by the words &#34; satisfactorily established in civil life.&#34;  A  man whom I know has come hack from the Front after four and a half years&#39; service, and instead of loafing on .the Repatriation Department, as some men have done, and drawing sustenance for months, he, by his own endeavours, &#39; gol a billet after drawing sustenance for three weeks only. However, at the end of six months, for some reason or other, his employment come to an end, and when he went to the Repatriation Department to see whether they could give him further assistance or not, they said to him, &#34;No, your case .has been dealt with.&#34; Evidently the Repatriation Department consider that he has been satisfactorily established in civil life. That being the ease, a man most deserving of sharing in the benefits of the scheme now under consideration would be told by the Repatriation Commission, &#34;You have been satisfactorily established in civil life, and are not eligible to participate in these benefits.&#34; To make matters worse, this man, who has a wife and four children, received notice from his landlord two or three days after he became unemployed, and was called upon to leave the house upon which he had been paying rent regularly for  3ix  years. This is just one phase that occurs to me, but I certainly require time to consider the whole matter. I am sorry that, I am not able to respond to the appeal of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> . I ask him now to respond to our appeal and give us a little more time for the consideration of the whole question. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in accord with the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> that this proposal should be left in our hands for a day or two in order to enable us to give it more consideration. I did not have the privilege of hearing the debates on this matter, and have not had the opportunity of learning what influenced this Chamber in deciding to assist in establishing returned soldiers in cooperative industries, but I think no better channel could be made available for them in regard to their future employment. From a cursory glance at the proposal before us, it appears to me that a returned soldier who ought to bare a perfect right to participate in the benefits of the pro vision will. not be permitted to do so if he is now following his usual civil employment. There are dozens of returned soldiers whose cases have come under my notice, who have found, on resuming their usual occupation, that their health has been so impaired that they have not been able to earn what their fellow-employees can make, or what they were drawing before the war. They would like to get into businesses of their own, and I have had applications from them asking for assistance from the Repatriation Department to enable them to do so. If they sought assistance under the proposal before the Committee, very likely it would be held by the Repatriation Commission that these men would not be entitled to it, because they had been satisfactorily established! in their usual occupations. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> says that honorable members ought to agree to this provision because of the position of the finances. We all know that the finances are not in a good position. We know, in fact, that it is getting worse, and that, as things are going, some day or other we may have financial chaos; but I cannot see in what way the argument of the Minister applies to the proposal before the Committee. He invites us to agree to the amendment, and commit the country to an expenditure of &#163;250,000, but I cannot see in what way it would add to the burden of the country if no limitation is placed on the classes of returned soldiers who may participate in the benefits given by the provision, so long as they are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> I have heard the remark that there are some men who have not done quite the right thing, who could have found work, but made no attempt to get it, who, in other words, have malingered ; but if there are men of that type  -  I do not say that there are - they will have the opportunity of benefiting under this scheme, whereas the man who has found &#39;work for himself on his return will not participate. </para>

                        <para>-I believe that everything possible should be done for those who went abroad to fight for us,  and if we can place them in suitable avocations we ought to do so&#62;, but I understand that in many cases a good deal of the money advanced to place soldiers on the land&#39; is to be returned to us in the shape of repayments. The argument of the Minister for the Navy, that we have already committed ourselves to the expenditure of about &#163;20,000,000 for .repatriation - it will probably be nearly &#163;30,000,000 before we are through- is only misleading, and gives no assistance to the Committee. The Government would be well advised to allow the matter to remain in abeyance for a day or two to give honorable members an opportunity of considering it. According to the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> who is a Government Supporter, the Ministry are not in earnest in regard to this proposal. It would appear that they .are endeavouring to find! an easy way of coming to a settlement with another place. But I contend that this House ought not to whittle away its rights in regard to finances. It will be a bad day for the country when we allow the Senate, to control the public purse We ought to insist on our rights, and should not back and fill on a matter of this kind. We came to a deliberate conclusion that the amendment we sent to the Senate was appropriate for &#34;the measure, and the Government have done wrong in bringing forward an alternative proposal - it really is sufficient to form a Bill in itself - and.&#39; asking us to consider and accept it at a moment&#39;s notice. </para>

                        <para>- Well, another fortnight would not he too long to wait, notwithstanding the fact that it is necessary to &#39;get the Bill passed as early as possible. The men need not suffer in consequence&#39; of the delay. The payments can be made retrospective. We are not justified in agreeing to this proposal on the reasons advanced to-day. Where shall we find ourselves if we allow things to drift in this way ? The experience of the honorable member for Fawkner is that we agree to matters too hastily. Bills .involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, just the same as those involving the expenditure of thousands of pounds, are passed without receiving the due consideration they deserve. I quite agree with the Minister for the Navy that there are honorable members who are constantly talking about the financial position, yet are willing .to still further extend the benefits that are granted to returned soldiers. But I am not going to withdraw from my position. If there is any malingering, or any injustice perpetrated on the part of the returned soldiers, it is a matter that should be rectified by those who are administering the Act. But we cannot escape from the promises made to the genuine man, the one who went abroad at our request, and to whom we made the promise that everything possible would be done for him on his return, or for his dependants in the event of his decease. Because the financial position is acute we cannot get away from the promises made in this chamber .and elsewhere. I have heard almost every member promise in this House to do his best to conserve the interests of the returned soldiers in return for the sacrifices they made, on our behalf. But now that the war is over, we are told that we are not able to find cash or do anything for these men if we can avoid it. We cannot honorably evade our responsibilities in this respect. This amendment involves too much to be dealt with hastily; it should receive the most careful consideration. I object to the proposed limitation to the assistance that is to be given; the fullest opportunity ought to be given to all returned soldiers. I have in mind some who are following certain occupations, working three parts time or half time, and often losing a day&#39;s work, on- account of impaired health, due to warlike operations. Those men- should be given an opportunity of getting out of such occupations. &#34; The majority of them have no money; but by pooling their war gratuity bonds and the loans from the &#163;250,000 which the Government propose to make available, groups of a dozen or fifteen might be able to engage in co-operative enterprises, and thus make their future easier. We have a perfect right to ask the Government to give us time to consider this proposal. We should not be asked to accept it in a hurry, merely in order to overcome a difficulty that has occurred with the- Senate. We -should have an opportunity to study the proposal paragraph by paragraph and line by line. _ It is largely because of the haste with which  we did many things during the war that we find&#39; ourselves in our present financial position. Much money was squandered because  of  this House not giving full and proper consideration  to  measures that were brought before it. I admit that we were all much alike. In the early stages of the war we were carried away with the desire to do all we possibly could to help the Allied cause, and we voted for things which perhaps in our calmer moments we would not have supported. Now we have to foot the bill, and it  is  an ever-growing one. I fear that in the very near future a financial slump  is  inevitable. We cannot continue increasing indefinitely the cost of commodities and labour; we must reach a dead-end sooner or later. When that stage is reached we shall have financial chaos, and thousands of men will be unemployed. Those men who went abroad to do their part in the war will suffer, and largely through careless legislation and administration during the last five or six years. The time has arrived when this  House  should reassert itself as a deliberative assembly, and consider every proposal brought before it, in order to do what is best in the interests of the country. If we do that, we may have some chance of escaping from the financial difficulty which the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has just foreshadowed. The information he gave should have been given to the House when the Repatriation Bill was first under consideration. We should not be told at this stage that we should be very careful as to what we do, that the country already 0 \Ves so much money, and that our proposals are opening up fresh avenues of expenditure. That has nothing at all to do with the proposal now before us. If the financial position is as the Minister has described it, the Government had no right to accept the proposal moved, in the first place, by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill).</inline> If the country is not capable of bearing the expenditure now, it was not capable of doing so then; therefore, that argument, -introduced at this stage, counts for very little. This scheme cannot be given that earnest consideration that is necessary unless honorable members are given more time to study the pros and cons. The Minister in charge of the Bill would be acting wisely if he agreed to report progress, and delay further consideration of the measure for a few days. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care to do that. If the Government see fit to continue, it will be their funeral, not ours. One cannot help being struck with the fact that some persons, who during the war could not be counted upon to render the assistance which the country needed, are by their eagerness to assist the returned soldiers to-day seeking to make political capital out of this matter. We should realize what this proposal means to the country and to the returned soldiers, and, casting all party politics aside, work together with the one desire of doing the best we can for the men who made sacrifices for us. - Already, large sums of money have been expended on repatriation; other large sums have been promised, and if the proposal now before us is adopted it will lead to a considerably greater expenditure than the &#163;250,000 mentioned in the Government amendment. We ought to recognise that if this assistance is to be given at all, &#163;250,000 will be quite inadequate. I realize that it is only through cooperation that we shall be able to give the assistance that is desired ; but I would prefer that every soldier who was qualified should be entitled -to the same measure of help regardless of whether or not he  wa9  in business before he went to the war. I can see no reason why the man who was in business before he enlisted should receive generous assistance from the Government on his return, whilst the man who&#39; was working for wages should get <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> assistance at all. A wages worker may have enlisted as a private, gained high promotion, even won the Victoria Cross, but under the regulations he cannot be assisted because he enlisted as  a wages man. But I can see no other means of rendering practical assistance in this way except through cooperative effort. To my mind, the amendment which this Committee carried, at the instance of the honorable member for Capricornia(Mr. Higgs), was of negligible value. It is useless for the Government to limit their assistance to &#163;1 for every &#163;l subscribed by the soldiers themselves. There is nothing generous in such a proposal ; I believe that any financial company would assist to that extent, on the security offered. When the amendment of the honorable member for Capricornia was first proposed, I realized that to be of any value the Government assistance should be at the rate of &#163;3 for every &#163;1 subscribed by the soldier. I still hold that view. The question is, however, how much money we can afford to spend. The Treasurer has told us of his financial difficulties, arising out of the enormous cost of repatriation and war pensions. I should like to impress upon the Committee that the greater proportion of the &#163;20,000,000 of which the Treasurer spoke represents debts due by the States to the Commonwealth in connexion with repatriation. To a great extent, it is the States which are taking theresponsibility. </para>

                        <para>- Not all of it. The Commonwealth makes rebates in interest, but those rebates are given to the soldier, not to the States. Therefore, the States are taking a great measure of the responsibility for the huge sums of money that are being expended on repatriation. The Commonwealth finds the money, and the States are responsible. So far as land settlement is concerned, the States are taking practically the whole of the responsibility. I should like to know a little more as to the financial position. I was not here when the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> spoke, but it is idle for the Government to say that there is a shortage of money, and that they cannot repatriate our soldiers as they would like to do, when they are prepared at the same time to expend a large stun of money in building the Federal Capital. </para>

                <para>I disapprove of the proposal to confine advances under this heading to &#163;250,000, and I also think that advances of &#163;1 for &#163;1 would be useless. If a man can hand in bonds or cash by way of security, then subject to the Commission being satisfied as to the proposed method of expenditure, the Department should be able to advance at least &#163;2 for every &#163;1 put up. The limiting of the aggregate expenditure under this heading does not display on the part of the Government a keen desire to assist those who are certainly deserving of assistance. Quite a number of men. who gave up good positions to fight our battles overseas, have found it impossible, on their return, to secure assistance from the Department in establishing themselves in business. I know a young man who, having qualified as a dentist, went to New Zealand, where he secured an appointment at a salary of &#163;6 a week. On the outbreak of the war he returned to Victoria, and enlisted. He worked as a dentist at the Barracks for about six months at a nominal wage of something like 13s. per day, and then went to the Front. He was in the danger zone in France, taking the same risks as many soldiers, and at the end of about four years returned to Victoria, and asked the Repatriation Department for an advance of &#163;200 to enable him to buy an outfit so that he might set up in practice for himself.Under the regulations, however, it was impossible for the Department to grant him any assistance because he had not been in business before he enlisted. That, to my mind, is unfair. It is unfair that a man who happened to be in business when he enlisted should receive assistance in reestablishing himself on his return, and that  another man who was not in business before he volunteered should be denied such help. </para>

                        <para>- I believe we have too many people rushing into small city businesses at the present time. Should we not encourage a man who desired to set up for himself as a blacksmith, a saddler, or a bootmaker in a country district? I would help such men in preference to those who wished to start a wood and coal yard, a ham and beef shop, or a small grocery business in one of our cities. A man who set up for himself in a country town, and was helped by the Department to the extent of  &#163;150  or  &#163;200  in securing his tools of trade, would do good for himself, and his industry would be valuable to the whole community. I do not care whether it is by means of co-operation or any other system that we grant help as long as we give to every man who went away a fair chance to be repatriated. The proposal to which the Senate has objected would help a number of those of whom I have been speaking to establish themselves in some business. Many of them would be able - perhaps only in a small way - to set up a co-operative boot factory, or a sawmill, or to embark in other industries. If the Government would, reasonably entertain the desire of the Committee that a little more generous assistance should be given to those who were not in business before they went away, I am satisfied that we should be able to come to some satisfactory arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- I should like assistance to be given- to the men individually as well as collectively. I would remind, the Committee that even if this proposal be rejected the Commission will still have power, by way of regulation, to give whatever assistance it pleases. Unfortunately, the regulations in the past have prevented assistance being given in the way I have suggested. The passing of the provision to which another place has objected would be an instruction to- the Commission that the Parliament desired this assistance to be granted, I hope, therefore, that the Government will not push the question to a. division this evening.  If they do, the decision of the Committee, I believe, will be very strongly against them. It is probable, however, that if we were given time to consider the proposal, and to suggest some reasonable compromise, we might be able to propound a scheme which would not entail upon the Government too great an outlay, and yet would be effective and advantageous in its working. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not approach the consideration of this question from a party point of view. It is to be regretted that the Bill was not introduced in the last Parliament. In that event many of the differences that arose between the contending parties at the last general election would have been less irritating than they were. The two parties could have faced the country with a proposal to give our returned men a fair chance. At no time during the recruiting campaign was it said that in our treatment of returned soldiers we would differentiate, between Harry Brown, who worked in a saw pit, and James Jones, who worked on the land. We said that we would look after the dependants of all who went to the Front. This Bill, however, differentiates between different classes of men. According to the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> the alternative proposal made by the Senate would provide for the settlement of only  1,666  men&#39;. By what right are we to say to one class of men, &#34;You are the sheep,&#34; and to another &#34; You are the goats.&#34; The honorable member who was responsible for the original amendment providing for the assistance of returned soldiers in co-operative enterprises will always be able to regard with satisfaction the action taken by him, and the future will do him honour. He did not propose that there should be any differential treatment. The Acting* Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> urged that there was need for economy. He admits, however, that the war-time profits tax has yielded only  &#163;2,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L.  Baillieu, to his eternal credit, publicly stated that that tax had never touched men like himself. It was not meant to do the work that we expected of it. Why do the Government not come forward with a strong measure of taxation which would take in a fair and equitable way from those who have most of this world&#39;s goods? It does not suit  the Government to do anything of the kind, but it does suit them to meet demands of this kind with the cry, &#34; The finances will not stand it.&#34; I know that the finances of the Commonwealth are in a dangerous state, and no one is more anxious than I am that they should be protected. It is for that reason I advocate the initiative and referendum and recall, since in that way the people would be able to control the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, who may be fairly regarded as one of the leading jurists of Australia, says that the Government have full power- </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Government, instead of holding a hole-and-corner meeting outside the chamber, which I presume is being done, should seize the reins. There is nothing to be afraid of in what is the remnant of the laughing-stock of the past and the abomination of the present. Some of the senators, when they salute the  President,  are much in the position of gladiators saluting Caesar - they are men about to die, their term expiring in June next. But until then those elected by the people must keep out of the so-called sacred chamber. I think that the Government should adjourn the debate until next Friday or Tuesday. The second Chamber should not boss this Chamber. There is only one way of preventing that.. Governor-General Denman, to his eternal honour, was man enough to refuse a double dissolution, and was replaced by another sent here to give it. The only way in which this House can control the other Chamber is by sending it to the people; and if the ruling power in tha community will not grant the Government of the day a double dissolution for that purpose, we , had better get another to take his place. I suggest to the Government that they should follow the advice given by members on their side. In conclusion I draw attention to the state of the Committee. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;QuoruM formed.}</inline></para>

                        <para>- May I set it to music, then? Since a week last Friday, when the Bill was sent from the Senate, the Government have been drawing up this amendment, and they now ask us to digest it without any time for consideration. This I regard as most unfair; the amendment ought to have reached us, at any rate, by post this morning. However, from what little I have seen of the amendment, I have arrived at the conclusion that the Government do not intend to do anything at all in regard to the proposal of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> or the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill).</inline> The former proposal was accepted by the Government, and sent to the Senate, the members of which, however, thought fit to reject it. The other day, when the division was taken in another place, we had the unusual spectacle of Ministers and Whips, with one senator from Tasmania, voting in favour of the proposal, and all the other senators voting against it. Even now we have no guarantee that the bridge built by the Government will be availed of. The members of the House who constituted themselves a Returned Soldiers&#39; Committee, came into existence with a great flourish of trumpets in the newspapers. They appointed a  chairman  and secretary, and, in order to show that they did not intend any harm to the Government, but were only a &#34; milk-and-water &#34; crowd, they emphasized the fact that a Minister was among them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not expect a Minister to have all the necessary knowledge, but I do expect him to have men around him who have. At any rate, a Minister always has the means of obtaining expert advice. No Minister, however reckless, would dare to throw money about indiscriminately over every wild-cat scheme. It will be observed that no man who has already been repatriated can avail himself of the proposed scheme. If a number of men desired, for instance, to start a co-operative machine boot factory, and sought to have a man who had already repatriated himself as their organizer or manager, they could not have their wishes complied with simply because of the fact that the man was already repatriated. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The number, in my opinion, would be very small, because most men who have been accustomed to work for wages have, according to my experience, a holy dread of co-operative concerns. The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> put up a. strong case for men who, for instance, might desire to co-operatively work a small saw-milling plant or a contracting plant. Many men, whom I know personally, were general station hands and typical bushmen before they went to the Front, capable of any work in the country. They might not be able to do everything in a cabinet-making manner, but still they were good rough carpenters. They were the sons of pioneers who had gone out into western Queensland and there built their homes, some of which are standing after thirty or forty years. These men returned with distinguished honours won on the field. </para>

                        <para>- No. When I. went out back I required no help from anybody, because I knew that, given health and strength, I could carve my own way. We must remember that the world is not so wide as it was forty years ago - that even Australia is not so wide. But there are golden opportunities. Put me down in Rockhampton with nothing but my swag, and in twelve months I would have a bank balance. There is no country in the world where a working man with no capital to start on can get on as well as he does here. But what does the Repatriation Department do to help the Australian bushmen? No one knows better than does the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> the value of the typical Australian bushman. He knows the initiative he can display, and that the man who has been reared in the bush does not knock off for breakfast, dinner, or tea, but only knocks off when his job is finished. Yet because he was a common, ordinary, general bush labourer before going to the war, he cannot get assistance under this proposal, even to the extent of 5s. All the Repatriation Department can give him is a new swag, a&#62; billycan. and dillybag, 1 lb. of tea, a few pounds of sugar and flour, a tin of &#34; bullocky&#39;s  joy,&#34;&#39; and send him on the road rejoicing, saying, &#34; We have repatriated you in exactly the position you occupied before the war.&#34; I know many men who served with the Light Horse under the honorable membEr for North Sydney. They say that the Australian bushwhacker as a fighting unit on a horse is second to none in .the world. Yet these ordinary bushmen, the noblest creation of God, men with initiative, and strong in their beliefs and desires, can get no assistance if they wish to band together and do something for themselves after all they have seen. And, God knows, some of them have seen a let; they have come back different men. But under this provision we cannot give them twopence, because they have already been repatriated into the position they occupied before they enlisted. Of two brothers who went away, one was killed and the other returned&#39; maimed. Two brothers who remained at home have selections alongside the parents&#39; land, but because the brother who has returned from the Front was not a grazing farmer before he enlisted,, the Repatriation Department cannot give him a grazing farm. However, the squatters and graziers of the Stanthorpe district have raised money among themselves, and without the assistance of a single copper from the Commonwealth, have put him into a better position than that of any other man placed on the land by the Repatriation Department. I have said, times OUt of number, that we cannot do too much for the men who have done so much for us, and I smile when I hear the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> saying that we must look after the taxpayers&#39; money, and that we have to find money for &#39;this and money for that. When  these chaps were fighting in Palestine or in the mud of Flanders doing their bit, there was no mention of money among them. They did not cavil about money when they were protecting this fair land of ours, making it easy for us to live here, and protecting the interests of the taxpayers. What would have been the position of these taxpayers if Great Britain had gone down in the war?&#39; It would have been a case of &#34; There ain&#39;t going to be no taxpayers.&#34; The interests, of the .taxpayers would have been guarded by- Germans, and a great many young fellows I see on these benches to-day would have been, swinging on the nearest trees. I read the books the German officers wrote prior to the war, saying what they proposed to do to the youth of Australia, and they made me shudder,, especially during the dark days of April, 1918&#39;. The Zeebrugge incident was a flash of consolation. After Villers-Bretonneux I realized that our Australian troops were second to none in the world. To them we owe the liberty we enjoy to-day, and why should we cavil at giving them a few thousand pounds or a few million pounds ? They would get all I could give them, or all I could get for them. Anything I can do to improve their lot I am willing to do. I do not propose to study the taxpayer&#39;s&#39; interests. I shall have regard only for the interests of the returned soldiers, who have made this country easy to live in. Let us give them a little of the benefits of the new world they have made for us. Do not let us be niggardly. Surely we cannot say that the soldiers were niggardly to us? Between 50,000 and 60,000 of them are lying dead for our welfare. Yet here we are cavilling about a few &#34; quid &#34; for them. We ought to make life as easy as possible for those who have returned, and no man has put forward a better proposal for helping them than has the honorable member for </para>

Do not let us say that those who wish to go on to the land can have thousands of pounds and all they require, but those who wish to commence secondary industries should not be entitled to assistance. </para>

I do not accuse the Government of being niggardly,; they are doing&#39; well, and- I can quite understand the Acting Treasurer being anxious to look after the finances of the country, but we ought to give the returned men a chance of establishing themselves on a co-operative basis. I have sufficient confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to know that he will want to see :a good pro1position. in any scheme brought forward, and if we leave the matter to him, the soldier, the country, and&#39; the taxpayer, about whose interests the Acting&#39; Treasurer is so anxious, will get a -square deal I ask honorable members to send back to the Senate the amendment moved by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> to the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca&#39;, and if they do not care to agree to it, let them, go te the country. Let us have a double dissolution. &#34;We have nothing to fear. It would be a case of heads- 1 win, tails you lose- If the &#39;Committee i3 true- to itself it cannot accept the Government&#39;s backdown on this matter. </para>

                    <para>. -  Instead of coming forward with, an amendment of this kind, which seeks to convey the idea that the Government are conceding what is asked for in the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> but yet gives nothing, it would have been a decent thing if the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> had gone back to his original attitude. He told us in the beginning that he could not accept the new clause submitted by the honorable member for Echuca. He said that no Government on earth would accept it. It was on such Socialistic lines that he could, not think of accepting it. His present proposal seems to be a case of giving with the one hand and taking back with the other. However, I rise particularly because the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has given us some- figures which prove that I contended, when speaking to -the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca, that the amount of money paid by this Government to returned soldiers in the shape of sustenance is &#163;2,000,000.- As a matter of fact, the Acting Treasurer amply verifies my figures, and gives the answer which I intended to give to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> when he challenged my statement. I mention that in passing because it affects the amendment submitted by the Government. Under the proposal which is now before the Committee, provision would&#39; be made for only 1,600 men. That is- to say, if the total amount of &#163;250,000 to be provided is divided into amounts of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15&#174;,</inline> only 1,600 men can benefit. That will go a very little way towards- satisfying&#39; the 18,000 men who, we are told, are out of employment &#39; to-day, and are living, on sustenance. I should think that the number of men unemployed, and drawing, sustenance is nearer 20,000. Allow that number &#163;2 per week each, &#34; and the weekly bill for sustenance becomes &#163;40,000, equal to about &#163;2,000&#39;,000&#39; per annum. The figures given the Committee to-day by the Minister for the Navy substantiate the statement I made a few days ago, and which the Minister for Repatriation was at great pains to challenge. </para>

                        <para>- I asked how much of it represented sustenance money, and the Minister replied &#34;&#163;2,000,000.&#34; If he now says that he did not mean &#163;2,000,000 for the year, I accept his statement. However, apart from that, the fact that there are from 18,000 to 20,000 men drawing sustenance would account for an annual expenditure of about &#163;2,000,000 per annum, and my statement to that effect a few days ago was sufficiently accurate as to be not worth contradiction by the Minister for Repatriation. The proposal which this Committee adopted at the instance of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> in the first place, would have provided an excellent opportunity for many of the men who very often, through no fault of their own, are compelled to draw sustenance from the Department. If they were provided with a chance of engaging in a co-operative business, the Department would be relieved of an expenditure for which it gets no return, whilst the men themselves would be deriving some of the benefits of that new world for labour which we were told was to come into being after the war. But according to the scheme put forward by the Government there is to be no new world for labour; men are to go back into the old grooves in which they worked before the war. If in the opinion of the Commission applicants for loans under the proposal we are now considering have been satisfactorily re-established in civil life, they will get no assistance to embark on any business venture. Many of the soldiers who have returned to their old employment have all the qualifications necessary to achieve success in saw-milling, bootmaking, and other industries. But, according to the terms of the clause suggested by the Government, men who have returned to their former employment will be deemed to be finally repatriated, and ineligible for the benefits of this scheme. There is nothing in this amendment to indicate any honest desire on the part of the Government  to redeem their promise to give to the soldiers opportunities commensurate with the great sacrifices they have made for this country during the war. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 7 provides that no assistance shall be given &#34;unless the applicants satisfy the Commission that they are qualified to carry on that business.&#34; How is the question of qualification to be decided? Are the members of the Commission to be Jacks of all trades, or will they employ a magic wand which will disclose whether a man has qualifications to make a success of a particular business? That paragraph alone is sufficient to unduly limit the assistance to be given to returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that there must be some discrimination, but I cannot see how this provision will operate. Some members of the Commission may be men without any industrial or technical training. How can they judge upon that question? A man who to-day is earning &#163;3 or &#163;4 at his old employment, may have particular qualifications for conducting a saw-milling business. Under the Government&#39;s alternative proposal, he would have no opportunity, because he might not have given any evidence that he had the necessary qualifications. Paragraphs b and <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of  sub-clause 7 impose limitations which destroy the whole scheme, and they are in themselves sufficient to make me vote against the Government proposition. I am quite in accord with those who desire that the consideration of this matter should be postponed, in order that honorable members may have an opportunity to look more closely into it, because the two paragraphs to which I have just referred satisfy me that we should not entertain the scheme as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- Let us put aside for a moment war-time considerations, and deal with this as a peace proposal. How are companies formed ? A man discovers what he conceives to be a good business enterprise, and invites others to join with him in putting capital into it. That capital consists either of the money of the men themselves, or money borrowed from a financial institution on the security of capital which people have saved. These men put their money into a saw-milling or boot-manufacturing establishment, or, it may be, into a co-operative society such as that of which the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook)</inline> is a director. We, in Parliament, now come along with a proposal to use Government funds in helping returned soldiers, to the extent of  &#163;1  for  &#163;1,  to start in opposition to them. Firms like Messrs. Bedggood and Company, the Marshall Shoe Company, a sawmilling company at Maryborough, or other companies who have been in business for some time, and have built up a big industry despite, in many cases, severe competition, might object to the proposal. Such political economists might reasonably be expected to look at the matter from the point of view which I have just put. I at first saw some reason for opposing this measure on the ground that it was not fair to use Government money, for which these thrifty people, with others, are responsible, as a means of making advances to other groups of persons to compete with them, and probably to put them out of business. </para>

                        <para>- Is the honorable member right in concluding that the cooperative enterprises of returned soldiers would be inefficient? In some cases &#39;they may, and probably will, be inefficient, and a considerable amount of money may be lost. On the other hand, many of them will be efficient. Last night I introduced to the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> a deputation of four returned soldiers, who did not want money from the Government, but stated that . they purposed establishing a co-operative Anzac tweed manufacturing business, and desired permission to obtain from the Government mills every week  300  lbs. of yarn, for which they were willing to pay the highest price for cash. Having seen these men, and heard what they had to say, and having seen the samples of tweeds which they produced, I was quite satisfied that they would not be inefficient. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that a successful manufacturing company would not be afraid of inefficient cooperative companies. Many efficient bodies of soldiers drawn from the  250,000  men who have: returned will be prepared to put up, either by way of war gratuity bonds or cash,  &#163;1  for every  &#163;1  advanced by the Government to establish them in co-operative enterprises, and they will prove very effective competitors with those already established in business. While we must all sympathize with those who by their energy, thrift, business capacity, and experience have established businesses in; competition with one another, and who object to Government money being expended in starting enterprises in opposition to them, the production of wealth in Australia at the present time is so limited that there is plenty of room for competition. If we may judge from the stories we hear as to the inability to place orders for bricks, cement, tiles, and galvanized iron for the building  trade, there must be ample room for others to set up for &#39; themselves. As in the building trade, so in the clothing and other industries. </para>

                <para>The Assistant Minister for Defence said last night that it might be found difficult to supply the &#39; four returned soldiers with 300 lbs. of yarn each week, because the Commonwealth Woollen Mills were working at their highest pressure to- supply the demand for cloth for returned soldiers. The fact that there is such a limited production in Australia is fair reason for this proposal. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said, &#34; We want more work and more production, of wealth in this country to enable us to bear our interest burdens and to pay our debts.&#34; I agree with him. I agree also with, the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that the financial position is extremely serious . The right honorable gentleman took that as his text when dealing with the proposal to make advances on the &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis to returned soldiers to assist them in co-operative enterprises. The country is not going to suffer from advances that are made to such enterprises, because, despite the suggestion of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> they will be largely reproductive. I agree with the honorable member, however, that there will be cases of inefficient men starting co-operative enterprises, and losing their own as well as the Government&#39;s money. </para>

                        <para>- When this scheme has been working for some time, there will probably be the same proportion of failures among returned soldiers that there is at present in the general business community, as shown by the annual bankruptcy records for the Commonwealth. I would remind the Acting Treasurer that what is causing trouble with respect to our finances is that we are advancing - and we have to do so, perhaps: - about &#163;36,000 every week by way of sustenance money. Something like &#163;2,000,000 is now being spent each year to maintain returned soldiers who are out of employment. That, as an honorable member interjects, is, largely, a dead loss. The &#163;250,000 proposed to be devoted to this scheme will be put into more or less efficient production, of wealth, or its effective distribution, which is the same tiling. </para>

                    <para>&#39;.- The experience that members have had with this Government makes it seem quite natural that an amendment should be proposed to block any scheme&#39; for cooperation among returned soldiers. As has been pointed out by the mover of one of the original amendments, the conditions in the new clause now proposed are such that very few returned soldiers would apply for Government assistance on behalf of a co-operative business. The House decided that it would be a good thing to allow the RepatriationDepartment to advance money &#39;for the assistance of .co-operative undertakings on the part of returned men, but the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> put his finger on the spot when he suggested that vested interests may consider themselves menaced by this proposal. The daily increase in the cost of the necessaries of life has again called the attention of thinking men to the possibility of reducing the cost of living by the extension of co-operative enterprises, and a Government whose every action has shown that it will support vested interests and monopolies to the death naturally at this juncture makes a proposal which, although camouflaged, has for its object the discouragement of co-operation, fearing, perhaps, that it may go in this young country further than it has gone even, in Great Britain, where it has become a danger to vested interests. Here, co-operation might well extend from the secondary to the primary industries, and our returned men should be encouraged in co-operative effort. It has been interjected that private enterprise has nothing to fear from inefficient co-operative enterprise on the part of soldiers. That may be so; but it is not necessary that every member of a co-operative concern shall possess expert knowledge of its business undertakings. Members of a cooperation! may be at once employees, or workers, in the business, and shareholders, having their say in the control of affairs, and drawing their part of the profits. But I expected that this Nationalist Government would fight, both here and in another place, to prevent the returned soldier from being repatriated in any better occupation, than that which he was following before his enlistment. It is thought by them that if a man was breaking stones before he went away, he should he satisfied to break stones on his return; or, as has been said, that if a man was carrying a swag before he enlisted, he might regard himself as sufficiently repatriated if he were given a swag to carry on his return. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> as Acting Treasurer, spoke of our financial difficulties; yet, when the war was on, money was as nothing, and could be found for everything. All sorts of promises were made to the soldiers when they went away, and all sorts of difficulties are now being raised to prevent the fulfilment of those promises. When members of the Labour party spoke about expense in connexion with certain issues put before the people they were held up to scorn; but the Nationalist party, now that the soldiers are back, and vested interests are secure again, are not concerned with the welfare of the soldiers. They speak now of pounds, shillings, and pence, and are willing that our returned men shall have to adopt uncongenial occupations, or occupations detrimental to their health and well-being, notwithstanding their sufferings on the other side of the world. The almighty dollar is again to be set on its pedestal and worshipped, and vested interests are to be protected at any cost. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to see the measure become law, but I am not willing that we should give -way to the Senate on the matter that is under discussion. This afternoon the Minister for the Navy, as Acting Treasurer, drew a black picture of the finances of the country, but I would remind him that our financial position to-day is the same as it was when the Government accepted the proposal of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> and sent it to the Senate, a few days ago. The Government was then prepared to finance co-operative soldier concerns, yet now that the Senate has rejected our proposal, the Minister for the Navy tells us of the millions that are needed for the government of the country. Our financial affairs should be well looked after, seeing that we have &#39;the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> now in London, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> as Acting Treasurer, and the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> as Assistant Treasurer, to pay regard to them. </para>

                        <para>- I have not gone to the Department for sustenance for any man, recognising that the officials had their hands full. I have not criticised the Repatriation Department. My desire, however, is to get the men off the books of the Department. In Sydney, last week, I saw returned soldiers coming out of the office in droves, after having been registered. If these men can be got to cooperate in the production of wealth, which we are told is what the country  mo3b  needs at the present moment, it will reduce our expenditure. Returned men are already bound together by ties of sympathy and association, and may be expected to co-operate in business very effectively. The original proposal sent to the Senate was not moved in any party spirit, but I think that that now put before us by the Government is so hedged round with restrictions and difficulties that returned men could as easily geb an advance from a bank or other institution as from the Repatriation Department. It must not be forgotten that all money advanced will be repaid with interest. Under ordinary circumstances, it may be difficult for co-operative concerns to obtain advances from the banks, and, therefor, the Government should grant assistance to them. If advances are made, the Government will be the first creditor, and will take no risk. When the Minister for the Navy spoke of the expenditure on war service homes, he appeared to forget that the cost of those homes, together with interest, will be repaid to the Treasury, and these repayments will furnish. us with a rent roll for many years. Our financial commitments in respect of soldiers&#39; houses, I regard as reproductive, and the money that has been spent will gradually return to the Treasury. This expenditure is one of the best investments that could be made, and it is taking place under what is really a co-operative arrangement. I shall not dwell on the advantages of co-operation, because the subject is worn threadbare, but the Government would - be well advised to report progress, so that a conference might be held at which some understanding could be arrived at. I object to the dropping out of the Bill of a scheme for co-operation, in order that a new Bill may be introduced to provide for co-operation. If this Bill is put through without any provision for cooperation, the Government will feel under no obligation to bring in another Bill to provide for it. Therefore, I hope that members generally, and especially those . members who represent the soldiers, will insist that the soldiers shall be given a fair deal. There is no need to mention the directions in which cooperation might succeed ; but the Minister for the Navy must be aware that a little money put into a co-operative affair will sometimes make men independent within a few years, and the Government will in any case get back the capital it advances. No loss could be incurred by the Government because they would have first claim upon any industry established in that way. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that there have been failures so far as&#39; private businesses are concerned. There have also been failures in co-operative effort, but they do not count, because there is, in other directions, abundant evidence of the success of co-operative movements in this country. I shall vote for the retention of that portion of the Bill which will give our returned soldiers an opportunity to co-operate in industrial enterprises as well as in land matters. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that upon the first occasion we have been asked to make a pronouncement upon the question of co-operation the test has taken the form of an amendment moved by a private member - with the very best of intentions, I admit - instead of a carefully-prepared plan launched by the Government upon well defined lines. The proposal of the Minister for Home and Territories does not afford honorable members a fair opportunity of making a pronouncement upon the question df co-operation, or upon the lines on which the movement should be established, or the safeguards which should be adopted in the conduct of such enterprises.- It seems to me that when we are called upon to consider a business proposition involving the public estate, it should be separated entirely from sympathetic considerations, that it should be upon sound lines, and subject to all those safeguards with which an ordinary business enterprise is surrounded. I notice that manufacturing operations are to form the basis of the financial assistance which is to be granted. Now we know that the cost of manufacturing operations to-day is at its very top. I do. not think that the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> which has already been disposed of, sought to limit the assistance to be granted to individual soldiers to  &#163;250.  The amendment submitted &#39;by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> and with which another place has disagreed, attempted to place the granting of financial  assistance to these men upon a pound for pound basis, without any limitation as to amount. Now the proposal of the Government brings this form of assistance into line with the financial assistance granted to any other beneficiary under the Act - namely, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150</inline> - and seeks to limit the trial of co-operation in this country to an expenditure of &#163;250,000. Spread over the whole of our returned soldiers, I must confess that that expenditure upon the establishment of manufactories will afford only a very meagre trial to the co-operative system. The honorable member for Capricornia spoke of the possible objection that established industries might have to the starting of new enterprises by soldier co-operators. My own opinion is that the up-to-date manufacturer will not be very much upset by the opposition of any new co-operative venture established by our soldiers if the Commonwealth expenditure under this beading is restricted to &#163;250,000. The proposal now before us does not give us a fair chance of considering the question of co-operation by our soldiers in secondary industries. I know that there have been complaints by some of our returned men of differential treatment .as compared with that accorded to their comrades who enter our primary industries. The latter may obtain, up to &#163;2,500 worth of land, in addition to an advance of &#163;625, to enable them to .secure a home and purchase implements, stock, &#38;c. When this fact is borne in mind, the assistance proposed to be granted to soldiers who are willing to engage in our secondary industries appears to be of a very negligible character. The Minister has told us that the financial assistance given to business enterprises by State Governments &#39;has produced very unsatisfactory results, and that a very big percentage of those who have received such assistance have failed. Now we have put before us a new proposal, and one which involves the settlement of our returned soldiers in our secondary industries. I do not think that a sum of &#163;250,000 is sufficient for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a much more substantial sum. I wish to put before the Committee what I regard as the essentials to success in cooperation. I recognise the safeguards which it is sought to establish in what is necessarily a hurriedly drawn proposal on the part of the Government, and I also recognise the value of affinity amongst individuals, particularly in connexion with our primary industries. Take, for example, the dairying industry, which came to the rescue of this State about a quarter of a century ago, when its finances were in a very unsatisfactory condition. At that time a great revival took place in the dairying industry, and the cooperative system was adopted for the purpose of producing a standard article, eliminating all the expense possible, and marketing that article under the best possible conditions. That was an illustration of co-operation in which all the cooperators had something definitely in common. In the first place they had a knowledge of their industry, and in the second they had the capital and plant which were essential to enable them to work in that industry. But it is a much more difficult proposition to establish cooperative enterprises in which anybody may take shares and set up as cooperators - enterprises, too, in which it is essential that only highly skilled men should be employed. To-day efficiency is the dominant feature in connexion with our secondary industries. </para>

                        <para>- There is no member of this Committee to whose ruling I would rather defer than to yours, sir ; but I claim a little more latitude to enable me to complete my argument. I ask the honorable member for Echuca and his associates in the Country party not to ignore the danger that would result from encouraging a number of young men who may have very little in common to forsake rural industries and come together as co-operators in any manufacturing industry, unless they can absolutely assure them that by so doing they will achieve better results. I know that the Minister for Repatriation has stated that, in our secondary industries, there are men who are earning good rewards for their labour. I know, too, that, by 30th June next, we shall have settled upon the land in Victoria alone 6,350 returned soldiers, a majority of whom were rural workers, notwithstanding that to-day the greatest difficulty experienced in country districts is to obtain such workers. We have, further, expended the sum. of &#163;6,000,000 in this State upon the purchase of land for soldier settlement. The establishment of returned soldiers in our secondary industries upon a co-operative basis will only tend to accentuate that difficulty. However, that is not a sufficient reason for denying them their chance in life. They have earned it, and this country has generously acknowledged its debt to them. This proposal, unless carefully guarded, may lead to all kinds of wild-cat schemes. We are all familiar with the glowing pictures which company promoters can paint, and he will indeed be a pretty astute Minister who will be able to shatter such pictures. I would like to see the Minister who, upon the eve of a general election, would stand up for the public estate by denying applicants this particular form of assistance. Of course, there is one safeguard in the proposal submitted, namely, that which limits the amount which may be advanced. The present inroads on the public purse are sufficient to rivet the attention, not only of honorable members, but of the whole community; and I do not think that the country is awake to what is ahead, though a forced loan of some &#163;30,000,000 will probably make people take notice. A proposal of this kind in regard to secondary industries is altogether different from a proposal for the establishment of homes, either in the country or in the town. </para>

                        <para>- In Queensland the public estate consists of leasehold lands not yet alienated, and it is an easy matter to make what appears a munificent gift; but when we come to deal with private lands, the circumstances are different. I have grave misgivings with regard to the success of the proposed co-operation in secondary industries. High technical skill, efficiency, up-to-date plant, and sufficient capital are all necessary factors, and these would be very difficult to obtain. If these co-operative proposals are adopted, they will commit the Government to more than appears in the Bill. If the amount be increased to &#163;500,000, the Minister in charge will have to &#34; follow his money,&#34; because money cannot be advanced for industries, and the industries allowed to collapse; and it may be necessary to advance still more, or lose all. This is a hazardous undertaking for any Government, and one that does not appeal to me. </para>

                        <para>- It has its hazardous side. The maps and plans of the country, from the days of the earliest settlement, tell a doleful history, for many good men have fallen in. their attempts to subdue the land. But. in all business the proportion of successes is, after all, small, and the proposal before us would, as I say, be hazardous for the Government in connexion with either primary or secondary industries. When I have learnt the fate of the proposal before us, I. shall probably move an amendment to the effect that where the Government is satisfied of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> and the prospects of success of an enterprise, the money for the gratuity bonds be found, even if to the total amount, for the purpose; and the. money used will then be the money of the soldiers. I take it that if the. &#163;26,000,000 or &#163;28,000,000 were paid to the men in the form now adopted, it would become the spending money of the country, and not find its way into any essential industries; further, it would go into the hands of those least accustomed to spend money to the best advantage. No doubt some of the men could spend it wisely, but, for the most part, they are young,, immature men, without business experience. I commend the suggestion I have made to the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">The alternative clause proposed try the Government supports the principle contained in the original amendment of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> wherein he set down a basis of assistance, namely, &#163;1 for &#163;1. The original limit of assistance, namely, &#163;150, meant that each soldier would have to contribute &#163;150 also. My amendment provides that for every sum of &#163;150 loaned by the Government the soldier so benefited will be required to contribute only &#163;75. The effect will be to considerably broaden the scope of the measure. Very many soldiers could find &#163;75 who could not finance themselves to the extent of &#163;150. My proposal is free from the suggestion of reckless financial extravagance, and will not increase the financial responsibilities of the Government. The individual limit will still remain at &#163;150. The total commitments of the Government will not be increased. I regret that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> could not see his way clear to accept my suggestion earlier in the day that, following upon his presentation of the long and involved new clause, progress should be reported. It is not fair to ask honorable members to accept without study a proposition of this nature. Personally, I was constrained to absent myself from the chamber during the course of important debate, so that I might consider the matter in quiet. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think the honorable member could have presented his amendment in considerably simpler form if he had moved to leave out the words &#34; one pound,&#34; with a view to insert in their stead &#34; two pounds.&#34; However, by offering such a suggestion I do not imply that the Government intends to accept the honorable member&#39;s amendment. It is true that, if it is agreed to, it will not increase the liability of the Government in regard to the amounts to be furnished soldier applicants; but the honorable member apparently overlooks that the basis of &#163;2 for &#163;1 would reduce the Government&#39;s security by 50 per cent. The considerable risk attaching to the proposition generally has furnished probably the chief objection of the Government to the introduction of the original principle. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that in this case the experience we have had in the past will be repeated. The Government do not seem to have known their own minds on this question, which has been a game of battledore and shuttlecock between the two Houses for over two weeks. We have had divisions on non-party lines here to some extent, but in another place the party whip seems to have cracked, and, as a. consequence, our proposal is now before us in! a mangled form. The debate to-day would not have been so extended if honorable members had been allowed ample time to  consider  the proposal brought forward by the Government this afternoon. In: common with the honorable member for Grampians, I was compelled to retire from the chamber in order to consider it in quieter surroundings, but when we examined it we found that its provisions were almost wholly those which had been discussed at length in the chamber, and had . been advocated by honorable members sitting in this corner. We found that we were in perfect agreement with the proposal except as regards the amount of money to be advanced, and the classes of .soldiers to be assisted. On this occasion there is no need to debate the general  question  of co-operation, but as we are wedded to the principle we ought to insist on its finding a place in this Bill. However, we are discussing co-operation among men who have the spirit of camaraderie well developed, and who have proved, even when- they are not officered by men senior in rank, and are left to their own resources, that they conduct themselves with the greatest order and to general satisfaction. We ought to look with a conciliatory eye om this proposition, and be prepared to give it more favorable consideration than if it were one applying to civilians. Early in the debate on this matter we were told that the amount at which the Government would be involved would be anything from &#163;40,000,000 to &#163;100,000,000, but we find now that the amount has been reduced to &#163;500,000, and there is not a great deal of difference between this amount and the small sum which the honorable member for Echuca (Mi\ Hill) indicated would be required when he was setting forth his proposal. I am afraid that if we adhere to the &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis a large number of men whose gratuities would not amount to &#163;100 each will be shut out. It is not expecting too much of honorable members to ask them to take a sporting risk when dealing with soldiers. We have heard a great deal about the millions spent on repatriation, and the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has told us about the enormous improvements that have accrued from that expenditure, but many millions have been spent on land settlement under conditions which are not very much more liberal than those which were in vogue for civilians before and during the war, and which still apply to them. It has always bean possible in New South Wales for two or three men who see a property they like to agree among themselves and the owner&#39; as to its value, and having done so,, to get the Government to resume it, so that they may cut it up into small blocks, the Government finding 96 per cent, of the total outlay. In Queensland, also, the State will advance up to 75 per cent, for the purchase of homes, whereas the War Service Homes Act only goes a little further. But  surely men who have been away for four or five years at the threshold of their manhood, and who have had to give up their careers and the possibilities of making money that the man who stayed behind had, d. serve a little more consideration in the matter of getting homes than those who did not go away. I admit that .there has been a  large amount of money paid away in sustenance, and that a great deal of work has been done in the matter of repatriation, particularly by the Local Committees, but there are hundreds of men who cannot get assistance because they had no proper calling or business before they enlisted. Under the present proposal they will now have an opportunity of establishing themselves in businesses with reasonable assistance from the Government. Otherwise they will not be able to do so. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has alluded to the need for a scheme similar to this, or perhaps an amendment of the regulations under the Repatriation Act to enable men who were not in a position to complete their training in any calling to set up in new businesses. At present there is no such provision. A case in point is that of two brothers who went to the war. One was a tobacconist, the other assisted in the shop. The elder brother was killed, and the younger would now like to get possession of the business his brother carried on, and which must be carried on, because the building has no value except from the fact that it is a tobacconist&#39;s shop. However, as the business did not actually belong to him, he can get no assistance from the Repatriation Department. Five* or six men may be anxious to establish themselves in a tannery or in a saw-mill, but they cannot get assistance by reason of the fact that they have had no previous record of business. I think that in this case the Commonwealth should act as their banker. That is all the amendment asks, and surely it is not asking too much to amend this proposal in order to make it sufficiently generous to the men, to whom it will be really valuable. </para>

                    <para>. -  I intend to vote against the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> because, by increasing the amount to be subscribed  by the Government from  &#163;1  to  &#163;2  for every  &#163;1  contributed by the soldier, we will be decreasing the number of participants. A certain amount is to be allotted, and, although the Government &#39;intend increasing the amount, the number of men to benefit must naturally be reduced. If the Government increase the maximum amount from  &#163;250,000  to  &#163;500,000,  and subsidize the soldiers&#39; payments  &#163;1  for  &#163;1; 3,200  men would benefit, but by increasing the Government subsidy from  &#163;1  to  &#163;2  for each  &#163;1  contributed by the soldier, only  1,600  will be able to participate. </para>

                <para>In considering this measure from the stand-point of a returned soldier, I cannot conceive of anything that can be more correctly characterized a &#39; f wild-cat &#39; &#39; scheme than the one embodied in the amendment. There is no one in this chamber who has the interests of the returned soldiers more at heart than I have, and I am prepared to concede that honorable members on the Opposition benches are also their supporters. But we have to recognise that they are their friends now because the war is over, and, though they are espousing their cause to-day, they kept their mouths tightly closed when the conflict was in progress, and never said one word to induce others to go forward and assist in the fight. It is all very well for members of the Country party to say that we should assist the returned soldiers by establishing them in co-operative concerns, and if we had the money I would be in favour of giving them all we reasonably could!. But can we, as members of the National Parliament and custodians of the public purse, honestly and conscientiously support this proposal when we have a national debt of approximately  &#163;740,000,000,  and an additional debt of  &#163;90,000,000  to be met this year? Honorable members must nob overlook the fact that we owe Great Britain  &#163;90,000,000,  and that our interest bill for the next year will fee  &#163;9,000,000  more. Who&#39; is going to pay it? </para>

I have been elected as a member of this Chamber, not merely to represent my own views, but the opinions of those who sent me here. I believe that most honorable members have the interest of their country at heart, and if they have they must admit that we should not saddle the community with additional financial obligations.

                        <para>- Does the honorable member realize that of the 300,000 who went abroad, only 1,600 would be able to participate if the amendment is carried? It is an unfair proposition to a majority of the men, and if we concede the point to some we must concede it to all. Many statements have been made concerning the promises that were made to the soldiers before they embarked, but is there an honorable member prepared to say that the soldiers went to fight for what they were promised? I hope I am in a position to express the views of the soldiers, and in doing so I can say that we went abroad with higher motives than securing benefits on our return. The men who returned bodily and mentally  strong  are the fortunate ones; and I am loath to believe that honorable members would say that I went away because I knew that I would receive a war gratuity. A definite statement has been made that men left Australia because they were promised certain concessions on their return. That is an insult to the soldiers of Australia. We did not go to fight because we would receive a gratuity or benefits under the repatriation scheme. Considering the attention returned soldiers are receiving, I think it can be said that the Government have acted most magnanimously. There is not a member of this Chamber who can prove that co-operative concerns where the shareholders were the employees have ever been a success. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member did not give particulars to the House. I have had experience  in  connexion with co-operative concerns, and I know of one in Sydney where a man who had been in business for forty years handed over the concern to four of his employees, &#39;who failed after two years&#39; work, because they could not decide as to who was to be the master. If a co-operative concern were to be established by ten members of this Chamber, would they be satisfied with an equal division of the profits? I do not think so. A business to be successfully conducted must have a manager, and that is usually where the difficulty arises. </para>

                <para>When the War Gratuity Bill was before this House the Government . conceded the point that any men desiring to start a co-operative business who proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners and the Minister that the business wa3 likely to be successful could have their bonds cashed, and that should be sufficient. If, for example, a dozen men were to contribute &#163;100 each, an amount of &#163;1,200 would be available to start a business. Personally I believe that we have arrived at the point when we are leaning too much on Government support; and the country that depends on the nationalization of its industries is on the downward path. When once we endeavour to dispense with private enterprise and competition we are courting failure. It would have been  better if the Government bad dropped this proposal altogether and passed the Bill so that returned soldiers, particularly the blind and maimed, would have been in a position to receive the extra benefits so urgently needed. If that were done the Government could then introduce a separate measure embodying the principle under discussion, and thus enable us to have a more lengthy and profitable debate on the whole question. After the consideration this question has received I trust honorable members will, in their wisdom, vote against the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians, because in view of our financial position I do not see how we can support it. </para>

                    <para>.-- I would not haven , spoken if the last  speaker  had not accused the returned soldiers of being men lacking in stability and determination. He also opposed the principle of co-operation. Originally the House agreed to accept this proposal, but since it was first sent to another place it has been amended to such an extent that we do not know where we are. In the earlier part of the debate reference was made to industrial unrest, which, it was stated, has increased. Why has it increased ? We know the profiteer . has been going on unchecked, and although we have the War Precautions Act on our statute-book its provisions have been used only to serve a particular cause. I am going to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians. I hope that the Committee will give to it the support to which it is justly entitled. According to a booklet issued by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> there are engaged in vocational training 5,000 returned soldiers in New South Wales, 4,000 in Victoria, 2,000 in Queensland, 1,000 in South Australia, 1,000 in Western Australia, and 500 in Tasmania. The Department is paying them sustenance as well as training them. Their work is a distinct credit to the Government, and the quality of their output is marvellous. I saw one man who had been only four months at a trade turning out work equal in quality to that of apprentices who have been two or three years at it. Amongst these returned soldiers are some of the finest men in the Commonwealth; indeed, they have been said by our own Generals to be amongst the finest men in the world. Yet Government supporters doubt those men, and predict for them nothing but failure. They did wonders at Gallipoli and elsewhere, but now they are told that they cannot possibly do anything for themselves. The reason for this attitude on the part of the Government is their desire to please the Trusts and Combines. It would appear that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Government hold a brief for the Combines in this country. </para>

                        <para>- We should endeavour to give in some practical form the reasonable assistance which we promised to the soldiers. I agree with the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> that they do not look for it; probably they do not expect it, but we promised it, and it is our duty to honour that promise to the fullest degree. I listened to the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> explaining the financial situation; his speech was loaded with common sense. But I believe that the majority of honorable members will nevertheless vote to build a bush&#34; capital at a cost of &#163;3,500,000. And we are told that the foundation stone of the Capitol is to be laid by the Prince of Wales. Surely, if we have money to squander in this way, we can find a few pounds with which to start additional industries. The reason for so much opposition to this co-operative scheme is that if the soldiers are given a chance- they will achieve successes that will be too great to please quite a number of companies in Victoria. This scheme will be one means of minimizing industrial unrest and of peacefully establishing a number of industries. If, having been given a chance, they fail, it will give to honorable members the argument that the profiteers have not been making so much money as is generally supposed. I intend to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> and I trust that it will receive the support of the Committee. The State&#39; Government of Victoria is already giving assistance on the &#163;2 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> basis, and in one instance is advancing the whole of the money required for the establishment of freezing works. If assistance is given to the soldiers on the &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis, with the safeguards that have been provided, there will be no wild-cat schemes, or, if there are, the fault will He with the Minister and the Commission. All that they will require to do in administering this proposal will be to proceed carefully. I have no intention of harassing the Government, but I desire fair play, &#39;and I am convinced that if this scheme is given a reasonable test it will prove highly successful. </para>

                        <para>- My argument has a distinct bearing on the Governmen&#39;t&#39;s liability in assisting cooperation by returned soldiers. The prizes won from co-operative efforts under infinitely more favorable conditions have been few indeed. This proposal implies co-operation in connexion with small concerns; the limitation placed upon the amount precludes assistance to any big project. The day of small businesses is past. Honorable members know that thousands of small business men have been ruined during the last ten years. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate I do not support a large number of them. I ask the Government to stand fast on the &#163;1 for &#163;1 proposition. Even that will not be good business, for it will not be safe. I indorse the. remarks of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr).</inline> This is nothing less than a &#34;wildcat&#34; scheme, and honorable members will realize that before long. The Government &#39;have got off the right track. I desire to restrict them to a minimum of liability in connexion with this reckless venture. I would like to see the whole scheme rejected; it would be in the general interests of returned soldiers if that were done. I indorse what was said by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in regard to the liabilities of this country. Honorable members ought to realize that we are getting right up to the limit of our resources, and that if we do not have continued good seasons for the next three or four years, we shall exceed the limit. I ask the Committee to consider the financial position of the country, and not to support ventures of this kind, because the successes in the past do not justify the confidence which some honorable members have in cooperative schemes. It is the duty of the Government not to give advances to soldiers on the basis of &#163;2 for &#163;1. </para>

                        <para>- What has that to do with the question? This scheme will create a spirit of unrest amongst returned soldiers, and will give the Department worries that I should not like it to be called upon to bear. Why is another place practically unanimous in its attitude upon this question? Because the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> with whom its members are associated day by day, knows too well of scores and hundreds of experiments in connexion with repatriation up to date, and knows the result of them. That Minister has been extolled over and over again by honorable members here ever since this Parliament opened, and when he gives the benefit of his experience we ought to listen to it. </para>

                    <para>. -We have been sparring for some time on this proposal in its varied forms. It was originally submitted to this Chamber by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and the Committee recognised that a certain principle was involved in it. Another place turned it down. We submitted a further amendment, and this another place has also rejected. In all that this Committee has passed, it has recognised a principle. I had some sympathy with the turning down of the first proposal that went forward, on the ground that if a certain a mount was granted to returned soldiers in the fashion then suggested, many of them, without much good intention, could say, &#34;We will give it a try; it will cost us nothing.&#34; The amendment now proposed will, first of all, reduce the number of applicants, and, secondly, will give security to the Government. When a returned man comes along with his 10s. to the Government&#39;s &#163;1 he shows an earnest intention to do something for himself. That is the security which the Government will have. I do not think that the trouble of the Department will be so great when the soldier will be under an obligation to present so much money on his own account before he starts. The Committee and another place will be perfectly safe in accepting the amendment as now submitted. These men should get a chance. I hope it will be clearly understood that those who have gone back into their businesses or offices are not to take the passing of this proposal as an intimation that there are other fields open to them. Many of our worthy soldiers have not had a distinct chance. Some men are not capable of managing a business of their own, and would be the first to admit it. They like to get a weekly wage or salary, but there are others who desire to embark in enterprises and get a start in life. I certainly admire them for that, and think we should give them that chance, which will involve a very small amount of money compared with what we are finding for soldiers who desire to embark on other avocations, such as taking up land. For these reasons I propose to support the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett).</inline> I am as conscious as any other member of the gravity of the financial position of Australia, but I feel that this will not be money wasted. &#39;It will be sent into avenues of business and production, to which we must look more than anything else in order to produce further money to meet our financial obligations. </para>

                    <para>. - I must differ from the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> in the reasons he gives for not supporting the amendment. One is that it will limit the number of soldiers who will participate in the benefits accruing from the principle of cooperation. He said it was only a simple proportion sum, but I cannot work it out to the same conclusion as he does. If the amount that will be advanced to each individual soldier remains at &#163;150, as it does in the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> and the soldier is to advance only &#163;75, then the liabilities of the Government will be no greater, and the same number of soldiers will participate. </para>

                        <para>- That is much worse; but, as a soldier myself, I shall not answer that accusation, because we, as returned soldiers, have had a lot of funny things hurled across the floor at us during this debate. It is evidently parliamentary to say funny things about your opponents, perhaps to irritate them or to make them change their minds. Although I am a young politician, I am not young in the ways of the world, and I am not likely to be even irritated by some of the remarks that have been made to-day about the attitude of the soldier members on this side of the Chamber towards the returned soldiers. I am certain, that the soldiers whom we represent understand our attitude perfectly, and have full confidence in the representation we will give them. But the statement of the honorable member for Indi, that members behind the Government were not supporting this scheme of cooperation because they support the profiteer and the Combines, is unfair to the House. The Committee has already affirmed its approval of the principle of co-operation, and of extending it to the returned soldier, by voting twice for this proposal. Is it fair, then, to say that Government supporters are opposing it because they represent the profiteer and the Combines? The object of bringing down this amendment is to place the proposal in such a form as will be acceptable to another place. That point has been lost sight of by some honorable members who have spoken to-day. The proposal has been twice sent to another place and rejected. Would it not be a further waste of time to amend it only to such an extent that it will be practically certain of another rejection? I do not intend to support the amendment now before the Chamber for that reason only . I have as much confidence in the returned soldier as any member of the Committee. A great many statements have been made in commending the soldier for his business capabilities, while others have said that, even if the soldier is a better man physically for his war experience, he has become unsettled by it, and is therefore unlikely to handle business schemes as sensibly as he would have done before the war. I disagree with that statement, and regard the argument as futile. I. should like to see the proposal as it is now before the Committee carried, with the one amendment proposed by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton).</inline> If it is accepted here in that form, I am sure it will be confirmed in another place. We shall then be able to get rid of the Repatriation Bill - none too soon, because the soldiers in general are waiting anxiously to see it become law. They do not want to read in the papers every day that we are still discussing it, and coming to no finality. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> because we should show the returned soldiers, as far as we can, that we have confidence in them, and this is one sure way of doing it. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> claimed it as a fact, although it is not a fact, that there were no successful cooperative societies anywhere in which the employees were shareholders. Any one who understands what co-operation means knows that that is not correct. The greatest co-operative concern in Great Britain is one in which the employees are shareholders, and it is distinctly successful. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to companies in which a big part of the shareholders are employees. The honorable member assumes that, because he does not know of any instance of a co-operative society where the major part of the shareholders are employees being a success, it necessarily follows that where a number of returned soldiers enter into a co-operative concern, and are employees, it must be a failure also. If that is his inference, it shows a lack of faith in the returned soldier, which should not be shown by any one who knows them so well as the honorable member must know them. It seems to me, both from the appeal made by the Acting Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and from much that has been said here to-day, that the opinion is abroad that the returned soldiers are bound to make a mess of this business. Why so? Why is &#163;250,000 advanced by the Government to be thrown into the sea because it goes to returned soldiers who desire to establish co-operative concerns? We should take the opposite stand. We should have faith in these men. They were good enough for us when they were overseas in time of war, and we should have faith that they will be good enough for us in time of peace. Instead of regarding this proposed expenditure of &#163;500,000 as money to be thrown into the sea, we should look upon it as an expenditure that will be reproductive, and likely to enable us in some small measure to increase our production as we desire to do. It seems to me that this opposition to the granting of monetary assistance to returned soldiers anxious to embark upon cooperative enterprises is due to the ingrained conservative instinct of some of our honorable friends opposite. Any proposal that seems likely to clash with individual effort is sure to be opposed by them. Much of their opposition is doubtless due to the fear that the success here and there of co-operative enterprises on the part of returned soldiers will lead to the spread of the principle. The principle, however, will spread despite their efforts, and will be one of the main forces making for better living conditions, and relieving the pressure of our social system. It has been said by honorable members opposite that the Labour party are looking after the returned soldiers now that the war is over. </para>

                        <para>- It is remarkable that such an argument is permissible from one Bide, but is out of order when it is taken up by an honorable member on this side. The Labour party has the interests of returned soldiers at heart. We are showing that we have their interests at heart in regard to this as well as many other matters. If it were true, as the honorable member for Parkes has declared - and I certainly do not admit it - that we did not have the welfare of the soldiers at heart during the war, then a mere sense of gratitude should lead us now to do our best for them. They will want our assistance. The Acting Treasurer has uttered a wail to-day in regard to this expenditure, and as time passes our returned men will be more and more in need of assistance from us. I can see the dawn of the day when they will recognise that we have shown ourselves to be their true friends by placing full confidence in them, and fighting to give them an opportunity to settle themselves so that they may become as successful in peace as they have been in war. </para>

                    <para>.- If this were the only proposal for the benefit of returned soldiers that had emanated from this Chamber, then the proposition submitted to the Government, as well as that put forward by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> would be indeed very meagre. But, as the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> said, in effect, in his very manly statement, the Government have just passed a Bill providing for returned soldiers a gratuity involving from &#163;26,000,000 to &#163;28,000,000. The honorable member asked that they should be given an opportunity to use their own money in effective co-operation amongst themselves. If the life they have led has created in them the true spirit of cooperation - if the spirit is there - I daresay they will muster into groups to carry on industries. I should like, even at this late hour, to ask the Government - if they are seriously thinking of giving a national stimulus to co-operation - to reconsider the whole question of cashing the war gratuity on a co-operative basis, thereby helping the returned soldiers to enter into co-operative enterprises with their own money. That would be in accordance with the true principle ofco-operation. </para>

                <para class="block">My desire is that the Act shall be deemed to have commenced on the 1st day of January, 1916. I submit this amendment because some time ago the Auditor-General desired to audit the books and accounts of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, but was prevented from doing so. I could never ascertain why he was refused permission to audit those accounts, especially as the Government were interested in the company. They had given that company a licence to manufacture wool tops and to sell them conditionally that they received 50 per cent, of the profits. The agreement under which the Government entered into this so-called partnership provided that an auditor should be appointed to audit the accounts of the company. But the  Chairman  of the Central Wool Committee, which was managing this business on behalf of the Government, decided to appoint, not the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth, but an outside auditor. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will see that I have given notice of a later amendment, which provides that the Auditor-General shall audit all the books and accounts of offices of the Commonwealth, and that he shall also be permitted to audit the accounts of &#34; any persons, firm, or company carrying on business in which the Government is pecuniarily interested, or from which the Government expect to derive a share of the profits from that business.&#34; That amendment I wish to have inserted after clause 8. As I have already explained, the Auditor-General desired to audit the accounts of the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, and the then Treasurer (Lord Forrest), thought that as the Government were interested in the venture he should be allowed to do so. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, the  Chairman  of the Central Wool Committee, thought otherwise, and would not permit the Auditor-General to audit the company&#39;s accounts. That is the position as it exists to-day. In my opinion, the Auditor-General should be empowered to audit those accounts, and had he been able to do so, possibly certain impending litigation would have been avoided. To my mind, the only reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins objected to the Auditor-General being permitted to audit the accounts of the company was that he feared any such audit would disclose that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes had proved himself too clever for the Central Wool Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know what the Government propose to do, but I understand that if we make the amendment suggested it will have retrospective action, and I know that in taxation Bills we always have to be very careful in this regard. I am anxious to give the Auditor-General this power as to the future, but to make the provision retrospective is another matter. I do not believe in any company being able to flout the Government or the Auditor-General; but if a bad contract was made, giving great advantages to one company which were not open to other companies, then the fault lies with the Government. I am not clear whether or not this contract was made by the Government of which the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> and myself were members. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins agreed to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> as auditor he accepted a man of the highest reputation in the public mind of the country, than whom we could get none more disinterested or with greater weight. Could there be the slightest suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> would do anything not strictly correct I could understand the anxiety for the services of the Auditor-General. If we were beginning the business the attitude of honorable members opposite would have some point; but since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard</inline> has been appointed a proposal of the kind before us is, under the circumstances, a reflection upon him - a slur that he really does not deserve. Is it worth while persisting in an amendment of the kind ? </para>

The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has upon various occasions sought to secure an investigation of this company and its affairs, and although it may involve retrospective legislation, if his amendment be agreed to, I intend to support it. If audits are allowed to be made in a loose fashion under. the New South Wales Act it is all the more necessary that the Auditor-General should conduct an investigation for himself, either personally or by medium of his own officers. </para>

                        <para>- No . When Lord Forrest was Treasurer he did not feel satisfied. He asked for information which he could not get. I believe that the attitude taken up by the Central Wool Committee was that if the further information which he sought were obtained, it would not be fair to the company, because it would disclose its business to the general public, but of course a company which enters into a business arrangement with the Commonwealth must always be prepared to have all its actions made public. However, provided the Auditor-General is authorized to audit the books, accounts, and vouchers of any company in which the Government has a pecuniary interest at the present time, I do not insist upon the date being put back to 1st January, 1916, but I would ask the Committee to amend clause 8, and provide that the Auditor-General shall have power to audit the accounts of any existing firm or company in which the Government are pecuniarily interested. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

I submit that, no matter what amendment is moved here no Court will read into the terms of the agreement anything but that G.

The company, however, refused to supply it, because it said it would be disclosing their business to the general public. If a company enters into a business arrangement with the Government, it must necessarily incur the risk of having its business disclosed, although there is no reason why its private business or secret processes should be made public. </para>

In reply to the interjection by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> I do not suggest that the Commonwealth will not get from the agreement all that it is entitled to, but the public ought to know the value of the concession that was given to the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company. I understand that the Commonwealth proposes to pay the whole of its share of the profits into the Wool Pool. </para>

The Prime Minister was absent from Australia when we sought in vain to get 20 per cent, of the profits for the employees in the fellmongering industry. They ought to receive a share of the profits. Some members are setting up an extreme claim when they ask that the profits made out of the manufacture of the wool shall go to the Wool Pool. </para>

                    <para>. - I have never lost an opportunity of urging that the Auditor-General should audit all Government accounts. In connexion with agreements between the Commonwealth and private companies, or bonuses paid to individuals or companies, or any other financial transaction to which the Commonwealth is a party, the Auditor-General should conduct the audit. I do not worry about the agreement made with the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company, or about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard.</inline> I know that he is a good Liberal, and that the members of the Wool Committee also are supporters of the Liberal party, and I know that business men are not loath to place opportunities in the way of their commercial friends. That is the practice throughout the commercial world. My point is that the Auditor-General ought to conduct an audit of every account in which the Commonwealth is interested. There is nothing to prevent him from appointing a. private auditor to do certain work in remote parts, but for the work so done he is answerable to Parliament. Ministers and members have no opportunity of verifying the correctness of public expenditure. When we authorize expenditure on certain projects, the only guarantee we have that it will be properly applied is the knowledge that it will be checked by the Auditor-General. I cannot understand why the Government oppose this amendment. The Audit Act should be made as stringent as possible, so that no expenditure in any direction can be incurred without being subject to the supervision of the Auditor-General. That is the policy in connexion with all Government expenditure in Great Britain. There Ministers have no control over the Auditor-General, nor should they have any here; he should be answerable to Parliament only. The amendment represents a step in the right direction. Commonwealth expenditure has increased enormously; whereas a few years ago we grumbled about spending hundreds of&#39; thousands of pounds, to-day we expend tens of millions of pounds. If there had been a proper system of audit there would have been no opportunities for the defalcations that took place in connexion with military expenditure in New South Wales, where it will be remembered&#39; that one officer served three years in gaol for his part in them. Opportunities create fraud and theft, and it is our duty to prevent them. There is no greater preventive than a. proper audit by. the Government auditor. The audit of accounts of Government Departments should not take place only at the end of the financial year. The accounts should bo subject to the indorsement of the Auditor-General during the whole year, even before they are paid. The public outside say that there is no business system in the Government Departments, and this amendment is a step in the right direction to assist to place the accounts on a true business footing. The only protection which the shareholders in some of our public companies have is the knowledge that all the accounts passed by the directors are subject to the scrutiny of an auditor of repute. The Government have not acted very wisely in the last agreement in including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Allard&#39;s  name. If I had known that the agreement was going to be made, I would have objected to the inclusion of that gentleman&#39;s name in it. There is nothing to prevent the parties to an agreement, other than the Government, having their own auditors, but to allow an outside auditor to control the accounts of the Government is not a position we ought to be placed in. Will the Government accept the amendment? </para>

                        <para>- I do not understand the attitude of the Government. Have they done something which they are afraid will be discovered ? There must be some reason for their refusal to accept an amendment which is at least within the realm of reason. I merely ask that accounts in which the Commonwealth is financially interested shall be audited in a manner that will give confidence to the Government and the House. Why do not the Government tell us their reasons for opposing so sound a proposition? I have nothing to do with the wool tops agreement, arid I did not support the previous proposal of the .honorable member to substitute 1916 for 1919, thus making the clause retrospective. However, I shall support him in this amendment. Surely the Government could not have read it. I do not know what outside people will think of this Parliament or of the Government when they learn that it was not accepted. </para>

                        <para>- It would be very beneficial if some contracts were inquired into. If the Minister knew a little more of what went on in connexion with military accounts he would be surprised at the loose way in  which Government cheques were passed and the hands that they got into. If the Auditor-General had known of it those officers would not have been allowed to continue in their positions, and the great frauds and deceptions that were perpetrated would never have occurred. One officer was of such high standing that no junior officer in the Military Department would say a word to him. Commonwealth cheques were passed into his own account, and the persons to whom they were made payable received cheques from his private account. </para>

                        <para>- I quite admit that, but we can give him even fuller powers in all transactions in which the Commonwealth is interested. I do not know the Auditor-General from the carpet on this floor, but I am supporting the amendment as a matter of principle in order to safeguard the public revenue. In some business companies with which I have been connected the auditor has been able to find out things which we were not able to discover, and I believe the Auditor-General would be in the same position as regards accounts in which the Government are pecuniarily interested. I am strongly in favour of the amendment. The Auditor-General should have power to see that every agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and any firm or company carrying on business in which the Government is pecuniarily interested is properly carried out. I hope to convince the Acting Treasurer that this amendment is in the best interest of the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>- I have done my best to urge upon the Government the desirableness of having a strict audit of all accounts. If the Government are not prepared to do what I ask, I shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done my duty in pointing out that no opportunity should be given to public servants or any one else to defraud the Government. Fraud and deception are possible only where business is carried on in a loose way. When some of our public servants have &#34; fallen from grace &#34; I have been inclined to think that they should not be punished, because the loose way in which the Departments concerned were carried on made dishonesty possible. The temper of the Committee appears to be against me, but I honestly believe that a thoroughly up-to-date Audit Act would be in the best interests of the Public Service as well as of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.- I have given notice of my intention to move the insertion of a series of new clauses, to which I understand the Government offers no objection, and with the permission of the Committee I shall do so in one amendment. Honorable members agree that the Auditor-General, If not the most important officer in the Commonwealth Service, is one of the most important, and should be quite independent of political control, and beyond the suspicion of it. At present he is free only in name. I am glad that the Government is of opinion that he should have a Department of his own, that he should be at the head of that Department, and that he should have power to appoint his officers, providing only that they shall for members of the Public Service or entitled to appointment to the Public Service. We ought not, I think, to permit the Auditor-General to make appointments in the manner that appointments were made in the old days, those appointed not being required to prove their capacity by undergoing an examination; but where it is deemed to be expedient or necessary in the public welfare to appoint some person who is not in the Public Service, the Auditor-General is to be given the right to nominate or recommend to the Governor-General the appointment of that person. I move - </para>

                    <para>That the following new clauses be inserted - 2a. The Audit Department of the Commonwealth shall be a separate Department and the Auditor-General shall be the permanent head of the Department. 2b. Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act to the contrary, all appointments to the Audit Department shall be made by the Governor-General on the nomination or recommendation of the Auditor-General, provided that the Auditor - General shall nominate or recommend officers in the employ of or entitled to employment in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Provided further, that if at any time, in any special case, it appears expedient or desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth to appoint to the Audit Department some person who is not in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, the Auditor-General may nominate or recommend such person to the Governor-General for appointment. 2c. In all matters affecting the officers of the Audit Department not provided for under this Act, the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902-1918 shall prevail. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta- Min- the honorable member for Capricornia that the Auditor-General should, so far as possible, be allowed to select his own officers, and that he should not be subject to the control of the Public Service Commissioner in his very important functions. He should be independent not only in his audit, but also in the selection of his instruments. Therefore, I accept the amendment with great pleasure. The Bill does away with many of the limitations of the old Audit Act. For many years past we have prescribed how the Auditor-General shall conduct his audit, a thing that is absurd on the face of it. Now we propose to allow him to conduct his audit in his own way. The proposed new clauses are complementary to the provisions of the Bill.

                        <para>- Then I desire to strike out the word &#39; &#39; thousand &#39; &#39; and to leave a blank. May I refer, even at this late hour, to the scope of the Auditor-General&#39;s work ? It covers the Commonwealth Treasury, the Military and Naval Defence Departments, including the Woollen Mills, Clothing Factory, Small Arms Factory, Cordite Factory, Harness and Equipment Factory, the Commonwealth Bank, Customs Department, land tax, entertainments tax, public passports, Australian Wheat Board, soldiers&#39; repatriation, Commonwealth line of steamers, Prime Minister&#39;s Department, Department of Home and Territories, and the Department of Works and Railways. I am aware that I cannot move for an increase in the salary of the Auditor-General, but I submit that his salary should be at least &#163;1,500 per annum, whereas he receives only &#163;1,000. He has had no increase since the day he was appointed in 1901, notwithstanding that nearly every other officer of such high degree has had increases. I would like the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to bring under the notice of the Cabinet the salaries of other highly placed officers. The High Commissioner receives &#163;3,000 per annum, and an additional &#163;2,000 for the tnanitenance of his official residence; the Australian Commissioner in the United States of America gets &#163;3,000, and an allowance of &#163;2,000 the First Naval Member receives &#163;2,500 per annum; the general manager of the Commonwealth Shipping Line in London is paid a similar sum, whilst his assistant receives &#163;1,080 per annum; the Chief Inter-State Commissioner gets &#163;2,500 per annum, and his two colleagues each receive &#163;2,000 per annum ; the Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Shipping Line gets &#163;2,000; the Commissioner of the Commonwealth railways, &#163;2,000; the Chief of the General Staff of the Military Forces, &#163;1,500 ; the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, &#163;1,500; the Public Service Commissioner, &#163;1,500 ; the Acting Public Service Commissioner, &#163;1,200 ; the general manager of the Arsenal, &#163;1,350; the Commissioner of Land Tax, &#163;1,250; the Prices Commissioner, &#163;1,200; the Controller-General of Trade and Customs, &#163;1,200; the Director of Quarantine, &#163;1,200; the Secretary to the Treasury, . &#163;1,200; and the Solicitor-General, &#163;1,200. I would point out that the Auditor-General in South Africa receives a salary of &#163;1,800 per annum. I believe in paying high salaries for the best brains; and the sooner &#39;that principle is recognised by the Commonwealth, the better it will be for all of us. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with that proposition too. Seeing that the members of the House of Representatives America are paid &#163;1,500 per annum, it is absurd that the members of this Chamber should receive only &#163;600 per annum. I hope that the Acting Treasurer will bring this matter sympathetically before the Cabinet, with a view to placing the Auditor-General in a proper position.. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in cordial sympathy with the object of the honorable member. I agree that the salary paid to the Auditor General is somewhat of an anachronism at this time of day. Having regard to the tremendous responsibilities of that officer and the character of his work, it cannot be said that he is adequately paid. I promise the honorable member that the matter will not be overlooked when the time arrives for a reconsideration of salaries. I have a new clause which I desire to insert after clause 3. It relates to the receipt of Customs moneys. At present these deposit payments may be retained only for three months in a suspense account, and the Act requires that they must then be paid into the public account. Consequently when refunds have to be made, they have to be taken out of that account and re-transferred to the Treasury. The new clause provides that the Customs Department may keep this money for six months instead of three months, thus doing away with endless confusion, worry, and trouble. I therefore move - </para>
