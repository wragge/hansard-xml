According to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 8th November, the honorable member is reported to have said - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The outrage committed upon Archbishop Mannix in England would never be forgotten by the Irish people of Australia. Never in Russia under the worst ruler of the Czars had there been such an infamous murder as that of the late Alderman McSwiney. They were told in the papers that Alderman  McSwiney&#39;s  poor widow sobbed over his coffin. If there was a just God in heaven that sob would reach round the world, and one day would shake the foundations of this bloody and accursed Empire. The other day he was approached by a vinegar-faced &#34; wowser &#34; who said that the police in Ireland were being shot in the back. If they were shot in the back it must be because they were running away. But there were no police in Ireland. They were spies, informers, and bloody cut-throats. (Applause.) He read with delight that some of those murdering thugs had been sent to their account, and he trusted that Ireland would not be profaned by their carcasses. Their souls were probably in hell, and their bodies should be sent to England. He would not have the sweet pastures of Ireland poisoned by their carrion clay. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>That this meeting expresses and extends its profound sympathy to the relatives of the late Lord Mayor of Cork, who was brutally done to death by the Lloyd George Government, and assures them that his prolonged martyrdom, which has kindled the indignation of the whole civilized world, will assuredly hasten recognition by the nations qf the Irish Republic, to which &#39; Alderman McSwiney devoted his noble life. </para>
                    <para>That this meeting earnestly invites the attention of free Australia to the complete destruction of civic liberty in Ireland by the action of the English Government; it denies the right of England to impose her will on the Irish people in view of the fact that Ireland, by an overwhelming majority,, approved of the establishment of an Irish Republic; and it condemns thu saturnalia of murder, arson, plunder, and destruction indulged in by the foreign army of occupation, with the clear connivance and approval of the English Government. </para>
                    <para>That this mass meeting of Australian citizens, in view of the policy of oppression and tyranny pursued by the English Government in Ireland, and which has brought eternal disgrace upon the whole British Empire, of which Australia forms a part, pledges its support to any movement for the establishment of an Australian republic. </para>

                    <para>- For nearly twenty years, with a slight interregnum, I have been a member of this Parliament. I claim that, during this long period, I have not been wanting in sobriety of speech or conduct. I do not now remember that I have ever been called to order during that time. I am certain that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Speaker,</inline> * who have been a member of the House nearly as long as I, have never,, during your occupancy of the Chair, found me acting in disobedience to the rules or in showing disrespect to your office. In anything I may now say, let me assure you that I intend no disrespect to you, and none to the Parliament created by the people of Australia. I have never, during my career here, called attention to anything said outside the House about me, about the principles I espouse, or about men whose reputations I reverence. Now, only last week most vile statements were made by men sitting on the opposite side of the Chamber about the religion which I profess, statements published at length in the newspapers, but none called attention to the outrage so wantonly  offered to the feelings of the &#39; Catholics of </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Australia . One man who sits opposite said that when a church, meaning the Catholic Church, became a political institution it should be broken up. The Catholic Church&#39;s record needs no championship from me. Bigger men than he have attempted to break up that church, but ito will stand and flourish when he and his like are in the limbo of ignominious oblivion. For anything I say inside the Chamber I am responsible to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and to the House. There is the law of the country to call me to account for anything that I may say outside this House. Therefore, if any man gets up here to catechise me about language that I have used, or am reported to have used., outside this House, I say to him, politely, but firmly and decisively, that he can go to the devil. </para>

                            <para>- In 1913 the right honorable member for Parramatta- <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> invited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> to come to this country for consultation shortly after his plans had won the international competition for the laying-out of the Federal Capital. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was here the Government, of which the right honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and the present Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> were members, appointed him upon a definite and binding agreement as Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction - in October, 1913. </para>

                    <para>Upon that appointment, and upon the terms of that contract, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> went to America and closed up a lucrative . and growing practice in Chicago, and then returned to this country for the purpose of carrying out his agreement, and building . the Capital, directing its design and construction in accordance with the plans with which he had gained the first .prize in the international competition. </para>
                    <para>The agreement under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was appointed gave him full executive authority as Director of Design and Construction, subject only to the Minister. </para>

                        possesses pre-eminent attainments. I have been associated with the agitation for the selection of the Federal Capital site and the &#39;building of the Capital for many years, and have taken a very close interest - I was going to say in its progress, but I should, perhaps, say, in its want of progress.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        is a Bachelor of Science of the College of Engineering of the University of Illinois, in the United States of America, and he has taken his degree in architecture&#39;, and also University courses in architectural and sanitary engineering.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket,</inline>
                        who was appointed a Royal Commissioner to inquire into certain charges which had been made against
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        in connexion with his office by departmental officials, reported in May, 1917, that from October, 1913, to June, 1916,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        was prevented from carrying out the duties of his office. I shall refer to this again later. The Government then suspended works at the Federal Capital on account of the financial position arising out of the war. Thus for seven years
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        has had no chance to carry out the work for which he was appointed.
                    </para>
                    <para>In November, 1913, it was decided by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> who was then Minister for Home Affairs, that there should be an international competition for designs for the Parliament House at Canberra; but that competition has, for one excuse or another, been held up until the present day. We were told that the leading architects of the world were at the war. For any old excuse the international competition for designs for the Federal Parliament House at Canberra has been held up. This is our general experience in connexion with all Capital matters. </para>
                    <para>Some of the officers whom it is proposed to place upon the proposed Com.mittee have shown throughout gross antagonism to the present Director of Design, and Construction of the Federal Capital. As I shall show, it would be impossible to expect progress from a Board or Committee composed of these  unwork-able  and antagonistic elements. </para>
                    <para>The departmental officials to whom I refer have been responsible for the most colossal blunders that have been committed in the building of public works in this country. I refer to (1) the water system, (2) sewerage, (3) electric light and power, (4) brick works, (5) the railways, (6) accountancy. All these matters were reported on by the Blacket Royal Commission. </para>
                    <para>The errors complained of were commenced prior to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin&#39;s</inline> arrival on his return from America after his appointment, and have been carried out in spite of his repeated protests. </para>
                    <para>The water system&#39;. The Federal Capital site at Canberra was offered in 1908 by the New South Wales Government, because of the plentiful supply of water by gravitation, and because of the enormous possibilities of providing cheap water power. Canberra is looked upon as one of the finest sites in Australia for the development of cheap water power. These matters have been reported upon by the leading experts of New South Wales. The Federal officers, instead of adopting a gravitation scheme for supplying water to the Capital, substituted .a pumping scheme which necessitated the pumping of water to a height of 800 feet. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board of Victoria, and recognised as a leading man in his profession in Australia, reported that the first cost and the subsequent service of water by gravitation would be cheaper than the pumping scheme that has been adopted by the departmental officers. </para>
                    <para>Sewerage. The departmental officers proposed to proceed with a main trunk sewer to empty 25 feet below the Molonglo River bottom, and to pump the sewage on to a sewage farm. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> when called in to report, estimated the cost of this trunk system of sewerage at ?250,000, and after ?40,000 had been spent upon it he reported that the proposal for a sewage farm was absolutely impossible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Oliver</inline> himself devised a scheme of sewerage for the Federal Capital site to cut out entirely the proposed expenditure of ?250,000 for mall&#93; trunk lines of sewerage. </para>
                    <para>Electric light and power. The location of this industrial undertaking is in such a position as to necessitate the construction of a special line of railway and destroy one of the main views of the city. It took into consideration the supply of light, but not the supply of power, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Blacket shows, in his report, that the building cost twice as much as it should have cost. The plant is already obsolete. Reciprocal engines have been installed, whereas the authorities to-day state that the building should be fitted with turbine engines. </para>
                    <para>Brickworks. These were set in. the residential area, the immediate effect being to depreciate the land values in that area, but the departmental officers also partially cut down a hill which afforded protection from the prevailing winds. No proper test was made to discover, whether shale existed in sufficient quantities to warrant the building of brickworks, and subsequently, when a test was made, it was found that there were only 13 feet depth of shale at that spot. The first plant had to be scrapped owing to its unsuitability. and the ultimate cost of the brickworks was &#163;40,000. It was estimated by the manager of the Northcote Brickworks, Melbourne, when he gave evidence before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket,</inline> that a modern plant&#39; of double the capacity of the brickworks at Canberra could be erected in Melbourne at a cost of &#163;10,000. He could not give the figures for Canberra, because he would have been obliged to make an investigation, on the spot. As the brickworks at Canberra were erected 3 miles from the railway line it necessitated 3 miles of haulage of coal from the railway to the works and 3 miles of haulage of bricks from the works to the railway. It has since been discovered that there is an inexhaustible supply of shale near the existing railway in the industrial area. </para>
                    <para>Housing. The departmental officers constructed temporary buildings which cost as much as permanent buildings. The administrative offices, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket&#39;s</inline> report, cost &#163;15,000, whereas they should not have cost more than about &#163;2,000. </para>
                    <para>Railways. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> came buck from America he found that the officers had a permanent railway nearly completed from Queanbeyan to the city boundary, a distance of 4&#189; miles, and that it was located in the river bed which in his plan, which had won the international competition, was to be in the centre of a series of ornamental lakes. A flood some time after the completion of the railway washed out half-a-mile of the railway works in the bed of the river, at an estimated damage, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> the Commissioner of Commonwealth Railways, of &#163;8,000. This information was supplied to me by the Minister, hence I accept it as accurate. The cost of building this 4&#189; miles of railway was &#163;50,000, and it has now been shown that it could have been built as proposed in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin&#39;s</inline> plan on high ground for the same amount of money. </para>
                    <para>Accountancy. It was shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket&#39;s</inline> report that no proper system of accountancy had been followed, and that, although colossal losses had already been incurred, it was impossible to tell the aggregate cost to the Commonwealth of these enormous blunders perpetrated by the departmental officers. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the matters reported upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket</inline> a number of bridges have been built within the Capital area, and not one of them has stood against floods, with the exception of one very heavy concrete structure, and even in that case the railway line which crosses the river upon it was washed off it. </para>
                    <para>This is the finding of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket,</inline> as shown on page 45, paragraph 170, of his, report - </para>

                        further reported that there was in the Department a combination of certain officers, hostile to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        and his design for the Capital city.
                    </para>
                    <para>For years the manner in which the departmental officers persisted in carrying out a plan of their own which had never been submitted to competition has caused the greatest amount of friction, prevented the work at Canberra from being proceeded with, and has entailed enormous losses to the Commonwealth. If the works which have been constructed on the initiation of these officers are part of. their plan, it is quite clear that the Federal Capital built on their plan would be one of the greatest hotch-potches in the world. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that if the building of the Ark had been left to committees the whole living world would have been drowned. </para>
                    <para>It is now proposed to substitute for a capable Director, who has designed the city plan which has won against the competition of the world, a committee consisting in part of officers who have not nearly hie competence, and have been shown to be filled with such antagonism towards him that it would be absolutely impossible for him to work with them. On page 18 of the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket</inline> on the issues relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> it will be seen that the present proposal to appoint a &#39; Committee is the very same as that which the Department proposed in 1914, when it was definitely stated that the intention was to deprive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> of the powers conferred upon him by his contract. I shall refer presently to what a succeeding Minister found of the attitude of these officers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline></para>
                    <para>I was not present when the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> referred recently to what is known as Adelaide-avenue, Canberra. The honorable member scathingly denounced part of one of the leading avenues which have been laid out in the area. Some time ago I visited Canberra in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Griffin,</inline> and had the works already carried out explained to me, and the why and wherefore in regard to everything; and I am sure that had the honorable member taken the trouble to ask for an explanation he would not have spoken as he did. Adelaide-avenue is part of a system of eleven radiating avenues, and the particular spot to which criticism has been directed is the Capitol circuit base for the Capitol Hill. For about half-a-mile this avenue is an embankment, and it is proposed to establish public gardens on either side; in fact, the whole of this area has been ready for planting for some considerable time past, and I have no doubt that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> had been allowed to proceed with the development of his design, this particular spot with its embankments and gardens on either side  would now be one of the spectacular features of the city. The point at which the road is cut through the hill to afford western communication with the Capital is the lowest gap affording an entrance to any part of the south of the city. The avenue is 200 feet wide, and it is proposed to have a natural park right down the centre, something on the lines of the parks to&#39; be seen on St. Kilda-road, with tramway lines running on either side, and on the outer edges provision for vehicular traffic. The experience of the world has shown that the separation of tramway and vehicular traffic in that way insures the most economical maintenance of the tram permanent way, and also minimizes the dust nuisance in a great city. The  same  kind of road is to be seen in Melbourne near the Treasury Buildings, cn the southern side, with the gardens at the sides. No doubt, the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> passes this particular spot often; yet it has probably not occurred to him that he has been criticising in the case of Canberra what is a perfectly acceptable piece of engineering at the very door of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Buildings. </para>
                    <para>If we needed another exhibition of the incompetence displayed in connexion with the public works at the Federal Capital, honorable members have merely to look at the Duntroon College, which consists of a number of temporary structures - a conglomeration of buildings which cost thousands of pounds annually in paint alone for maintenance purposes. It is stated that there is no plan in existence relating to the water pipes and sewerage pipes which have been laid down within that area. One may dig a hole and suddenly come upon a water pipe without ever suspecting that it is there. </para>

                            <para>- No, sir. I got most of it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket&#39;s</inline> report, and as the result of my visits to the area from time to time. My old friend, the  Hon.  King O&#39;Malley, is also an encyclopaedia of information on Capital matters. But what does it matter from where the information comes? The question is, &#34;Is it true?&#34; It has been stated that it is necessary to put all . our public works under the Works Department: Why has that plan not been followed in connexion with our railways? Why are not naval works placed under the control of the Work3 and Railways Department? </para>

In reality, the proposal of the Government is a notice to him to quit. Ministers ought to have the courage to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> to go about his business instead of adopting this underhand method of inviting him to accept a subordinate position  as the fifth wheel of the coach, when they know perfectly well that he has no course open to him but to decline. I have no authority for making this statement, because I do not know what are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin&#39;s</inline> views of this Committee; but I cannot conceive of a man of his qualifications being satisfied to become the fifth wheel of a coach upon a Committee which will brand his work as a failure, and when he will have no opportunity of vindicating himself and his professional attainments, not merely in the&#39; eyes of Australia, but before the whole world. </para>

                            <para>- Then it ought not to cost it any more. I do not think that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chapman)</inline> will cure the evil, by seeking to concentrate the whole of the power connected with the building of the Federal Capital in the hands of one man, who, in my judgment - and I speak as a friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> - has not convinced the public of Australia that he is the best of all practical constructionists. </para>

                            <para>- I was. The very conditions under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is operating to-day are the best evidence of the truth of what I say. What is his salary ? It is &#163;1,000 a year. Can anybody contend that that would be adequate remuneration for a man who had to take the sole responsibility for the construction of this Capital? The idea is absurd. Again, there is another term of the agreement that honorable members should bear in mind. Of course, this is the part of the agreement that the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> leaves out; but, according to it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was to give only three days a week altogether to the work of the Federal Capital. What an absurd term that would be to put into an agreement if the idea was that he should have sole control and direction of the construction of the Capital! These two facts themselves are the clearest of all proofs that no such thing was ever intended. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was brought to Australia because it was feared that the departmental officers - I wish to be fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> as well as to them - would interfere with his plan. </para>

I repeat that it was thought the officers would do so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was brought here to see and to report whether they did, interfere with his plan.

                            <para>- It does not say so in the extract I read. There are two facts - this gentleman was brought here to advise concerning the plan of the Capital, and the Minister was to determine what had to be done in the execution of the work under his own departmental officers. How can it be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was brought here to supervise the construction of the Capital? The very terms and conditions under which he is here now show that nothing could have been further from the minds of those who sent for him and made the agreement. He was brought here to police his plan - that and nothing more - to report to the Government if at any time in the carrying out of the works it was found that the officers were departing from his plan. </para>

                        has had a very different function assigned to him since he came here. Who has done that I do not know, but I venture to say that the sooner this question of the Capital is taken out of politics the better. That is my judgment; and I am inclined to think that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        is a pretty good politician as well as town planner.

                            <para>- No, sir; they would do exactly what has been done with other capitals, notably Washington; there is none of this business there, the whole administration being outside parliamentary and political control, as is only proper. I would take the same course, as I say, with the Federal Capital of Australia. I firmly believe - indeed, I am certain - that if this work were developed along proper lines, the Capital, in all its glory, with all its architectural grandeur added, should not cost this country a very great sum of money. But for many years to come, and in our lifetime, let us modestly develop alone lines of usefulness, and the immediate occupancy should not cost this country very much, if anything at all. This Committee is being got together with this amongst other objects in view. May I say another word in this connexion ? I would have this Committee slightly different. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is; and the reason why something should be done in this respect is the quarrel within the Department. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> contends that one man, now in the employment of the Government, shall have the sole control of the design and construction of the Capital. I have yet to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> has all the necessary qualifications combined and rolled into one; he would be a wonderful man if he had. What the honorable member for Cook desires, evidently, is to make our own officers subordinate to the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. The reason I would put this matter under a competent trust is because we can never deal satisfactorily with it on the floor of this House. Why should the Public Works Committee - and this is what I used to urge when I was on the Opposition side - go over the plan, and recommend to the House interference with it in any way whatever ? On that point I agree with the honorable member for Cook. The Public Works Committee is not competent to criticise the plan of the Federal Capital. That is why I think it should go into the hands of a body of experts, who would carry it out with due regard to economy, efficiency, and immediate success. What is the use of getting a man to win the first prize for a plan against the competition of the world, and then setting a Public Works Committee, appointed by this House, on to his design, to say whether this feature of it should be altered, or that feature carried out or not? There is something  wrong  about the whole scheme if that can take place. I am not suggesting that the Public Works Committee cannot do useful work, even in the Federal Capital; but they should let the design severely alone, because that has been- fixed, and accepted. </para>

We shall get the best results, in my opinion, by a combination of talent under the control and direction of the Minister. The great thing to do now is not to quarrel about who shall do this, and who shall do the other, but to begin at once the construction of some of these works. I advise the Minister, my colleague, who, I know, is- anxious to do it, to follow that course, and if the plans and specifications are not now ready, then somebody has been at fault. They should have been ready instantly the authority of the House was given. What we have to do now is to do the work, and not1 to begin quarrelling about it. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have taken part in this debate but for some of the remarks of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts).</inline> We in Victoria have suffered an experience from Yankee rule, on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> railways and elsewhere, that makes us rather chary about accepting people who come from the other side of the world. I am not offering any personal criticism in saying that, but I agree with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that the designer of the Federal Capital City is pretty expert in the political world, as well as in his picturesque landscape architecture. </para>

                            <para>- I do not speak without knowledge. Reference has been made to the expenditure in connexion with the Federal Capital, but instead of the Treasurer saying that the Public Works Committee should not, interfere, it should be mentioned that this House saw fit that the Committee should interfere, and specially intrusted to the Committee- an inquiry in regard to certain work on the Federal Capital site. I am proud to have been a member of that Committee which turned down proposed expenditure that ran into nearly &#163;500,000, particularly in regard to ornamental lakes. We do not want any ornamental lakes at this time in the Federal Capital or anywhere* else. Neither the Government nor the country have money to burn at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- There is only a short time to go before the debate must end, and I do not propose to take up the whole of that time. I must deprecate a plea- being put in for one individual, claiming for him a certain amount of sympathy and regard simply because he left a lucrative practice in another part of the world, and came &#39;o a country containing a mere handful of people, in order -to look after the carrying out of a design which he had fathered some time before. If he is the marvellous genius that some people would have us believe, he would have resigned from this particular sphere of operations long ago, and gone back to a country where there are over one hundred million people and any amount of money waiting to be expended. That is, of course, if he was after the almighty dollar, and I must say that most Americans are after it. </para>

                            <para>- I might say the same about&#39; the honorable member. I am a public man, and open to criticism. People can say what they like about me. I have my own ideas about why I am here and why the people put me here. I suppose that when the people no longer want me here they will set me aside. The honorable member for Cook made a good deal out of the Blacket report. What was done with it ? The &#34;honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> as Minister for Works and Railways at the time, went through it with a number of experts, and, so far as I know, turned down practically every recommendation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blacket.</inline></para>

The then Minister said he turned down those recommendations on the very best of advice, and that the Commonwealth Government should pay very little regard to the findings of that Commission. </para>

The honorable member objected to my remark about having had too much of Yankee control in this country; but when I made that statement I was not thinking of one man only. I believe we have in Australia as good men as in any part of the world, whether they are architects or designers. I believe that even now, at the eleventh hour, there are Australians better qualified to carry out the Federal Capital works than men who come from other parts of the world. I want Australians in and out of Parliament to guard jealously the expenditure that we are going to incur. I am not attacking the Federal Capital Director personally. I am simplv. speaking against him so far as I know of his operations. </para>

But for the war and the financial strain it has involved, I would be in favour of the proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital; but we can at present spend our money to much better advantage in other directions. I would urge the honorable member for Cook not to pay too much attention to these reports. I have no desire to take advantage of my position to do an injustice to any man; but from schemes which have been outlined before the Public Works Committee from time to time in regard to the Federal City, I have been led to certain conclusions. The designer of the Federal Capital has jurisdiction only over the city area, and not over the whole of the Territory, but unfortunately he considers himself to &#39;be a master of all the professions. In regard to various works in the Territory, he sets himself up against men who have made a life-long study of special branches of engineering, such as sanitary engineering, and also architecture. He sets himself up as a leader in all the different professions. </para>

                    <para>I have no desire to do an injury to the designer of the Federal City. I believe that his design would give us an artistic and magnificent city, but it is altogether too elaborate and too expensive to permit of the Commonwealth giving effect to it for many years to come. In the distant future, we may contemplate a city with ornamental lakes and picturesque settings such as the Federal Capital designer proposes, but I do not intend to vote for such an expenditure at the present time. I would advise the advocates of the expenditure of money on the Federal Capital not to be for ever bringing up the matter. I believe the work will jog along steadily, although perhaps not as merrily as they would have it; and in due time, when money is far more plentiful than it is to-day, we shall build the Capital to the delight and satisfaction of the people. I understand that the agreement made with the designer of the Federal City does not give him jurisdiction over its environments. He has not charge of the whole Territory, which comprises 1,000 square miles. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret the form which this discussion has taken, since I believe that it will lead us nowhere. I have some proposals of a practical character which I should like to bring before the House, but it was only when I entered this Chamber this afternoon that I learned from the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> of his intention to take this action. I am, therefore, not prepared at this moment to go into them. We are wrong in pitting officer against officer. There has been too much of that sort of thing, and I am satisfied, from my own experience, that the feud between the officials has cost the Commonwealth practically a quarter of a million sterling. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that we shall get down to something practical, and I shall begin by asking the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> what he has done towards carrying out the mandate of this House, given a month or six weeks ago, that at least &#163;150,000 should be expended on the Federal Capital this year? That was the decision arrived at by a majority of honorable members after a hard fight, but I am informed that absolutely nothing has been done to give effect to it. I am told by people living in the Territory that no additional men are employed at the Capital, and that although there are 1,000,000 bricks and plenty of timber available at Canberra, the Minister has done nothing to push on with any work. That does not suggest a sympathetic administration. Does the Minister think the appointment of a Committee means a start in building the city? I certainly do not. I agree with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> that it would be a good thing to have a trust of three practical men to deal with this matter, but I do not want the members of a Committee to start to quarrel amongst themselves and so again delay the work. We understand that an expenditure of &#163;5,000 on sewerage, &#163;5,000 on water supply, &#163;5,000 on road construction, and &#163;5,000 on electric supplies would be sufficient to provide, as a start, for a population of 25,000 people at Canberra. Has the&#39; Minister made any honest effort to carry out the direction of the House, or is he holding his hand pending a report from a Committee or Commission? This talk about a Commission is all &#34; bunkum.&#34; It is only another method of side-tracking the scheme. The Minister, however, will find some difficulty in side-tracking it, and, unless he acts promptly, he will have to face something more serious than a motion for the adjournment of the House. Unless something is done to give effect to the decision of the House I shall certainly take a more serious step. I blame, not the officials, but the Minister in charge of the Department concerned. I am not here to denounce or to praise officials who cannot speak for themselves. It is for the Minister to tell us what he has done. So far as I can ascertain he has done nothing. I warn him that such a course will not satisfy us. </para>

                            <para>- Even if the money was provided by the British Government we had no right to waste it. I want to know whether it is a fact that the designer of the Capital City desired that the internment camp should be established in the area set apart as an industrial centre, where the buildings and water and sewerage services could have been devoted after the war to our own requirements? I am informed that, while he took up that attitude, some other officials in the Department decided that the camp should be erected on a site for a park. I am told that this is true, although I do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement, and that when the designer of the Federal City pointed out that, if the camp were erected in the industrial centre, the buildings and water and sewerage services could be used for other purposes later on, some one else in the Department for whom the Minister must answer, said &#34;No. We will establish the camp on this park site, and when the war is over we can dismantle the buildings and pull up the water and sewerage services.&#34; Everybody knew the war would be over some day. If the statement, to which I have referred is correct, the position is scandalous. What is the stuff worth today ? I understand it is valued at about &#163;20,000, and that they want to foist it on to the Government. Some of the houses are, I believe, being sold, but those that remain will have to be pulled down and the pipes torn up. I suppose about &#163;130,000 has been thrown away. I have been told that it is British money. Well, I am a Britisher as well as an Australian, and I object to British money being wasted in this manner. The Minister should take steps to ascertain -what is the real position, and if the statement is not correct we should know why we have been misled. If it is true it points to a scandalous state of affairs. If we had a good practical builder </para>

                            <para>-That is my opinion, at any rate. My complaint is that nothing has been done to push on the work at Canberra. It is of no use for the Minister trying to sit on a rail over this business. He will either have to &#34; go &#34; for the Capital or else against it, and judging by his attitude during the last two or three months he is not very enthusiastic about it. The Treasurer will make the money available any day. There are 10,000 men unemployed in New South Wales, there are 1,000,000 bricks at Canberra, and &#163;50,000 worth of timber, so why, in God&#39;s name, do we not spend the money which has been voted, and give these men work to do? Do we want a committee of engineers and architects to build workmen&#39;s cottages? The plans are all prepared. The Treasurer knows all this, because he has discussed the matter with me on several occasions. He knows that the workmen would live in the internment houses until the cottages were ready. If we build fifty cottages they would cost only about &#163;600 a piece. We would then have habitations for the workmen, and the administrative buildings would cost &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000. These would include halls large enough for Parliament to meet in. Hostels and other accommodation for honorable members would cost about another &#163;30,000. These are the figures that have been discussed among honorable members, and would absorb the &#163;150,000 on the Estimates. But the Minister knows that there is over &#163;200,000 available, because other works have to be carried out. It is altogether useless to appoint a committee of experts, and allow this old feud between engineers and architects to continue. </para>

                            <para>- Three or four honorable members have been to me, and shown me their answers. They have answered in the negative. But I say this is a very dangerous position to drift into. Honorable members may laugh and sneer at <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s Weekly,</inline> but I have no doubt that paper is trying to do its duty. There is a feeling in New South Wales that we are being humbugged, and are not getting a square deal over this Federal Capital business, and probably <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s Weekly,</inline> realizing the feeling throughout New South Wales, is trying to get in first, as newspapers generally do. They want to know what steps honorable members are prepared to take. I have read this telegram for the sake of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> in order to show him that some interest is taken in this matter in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Many years ago I knew that there was a lot of waste going on in connexion with the expenditure on the Capital. I wrote to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> when he was Prime Minister, telling him all about the thousands of pounds that were being thrown away there and at Jervis Bay. I also asked for an inquiry, which would have cost nothing, but nothing was done then, and nothing has been done since. If we get this Committee of so-called experts, with somebody else advising them, what chance will there be of getting work done at Canberra ? If the Minister would get three practical men, and say, &#34; There is a vote of &#163;200,000 for expenditure at Canberra; go in and spend it,&#34; something would be done. </para>

                    <para>Mr.GROOM (Darling Downs- Minister for Works and Railways) &#91;4.19&#93;. - I am sorry efforts are being made, more or less successfully, to envelop this question with a political atmosphere. If there is one matter that should be dealt with in a distinctly national way, and apart from party politics, it is this question of the Federal Capital. I speak neither as a Victorian nor as a New South Welshman. I have always been an advocate for the establishment of the Federal Capital, for I realize that it would be as great a mistake to have it in Sydney as in Melbourne. The House has decided to initiate steps with a view to getting the city in such a state, at the earliest practicable moment, that the Federal Capital, with the Departments attached thereto, can be transferred to Canberra. The duty of the Government is to take such steps, of a sound businesslike character, that the work can be carried out as speedily, efficiently, and economically as possible in the circumstances. The sum of &#163;150,000 is the first amount which has been appropriated. Questions have been raised with regard to the expenditure of that sum. </para>

                        <para>- I have the list here. The matters were set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>  himself. There is an amount of &#163;1,250 in connexion with general stores ; of &#163;6,500 for reimbursements for equipment; of &#163;500, having to do with the lime kiln; &#163;2,250, excavating plant; &#163;4,000, construction of tramway ; &#163;25,000, temporary housing from Molonglo camp; and &#163;5,000 in connexion with road formation. Authority for all those items has been given; and there are other matters involved - important works such as sewerage, water supply, electric lighting, &#38;c, as yet unauthorized. There is, further, a large sum for the erection of cottages, authority for the  expenditure of which has not yet been given. What the Government had to consider was, what steps ought to be taken to get the business carried out on sound and proper lines. Last year the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> announced in this House, before the elections, that the Government were of opinion that a Committee should be appointed to advise the Government concerning the steps to be taken in connexion with the occupation of Canberra, and regarding the necessary works to be carried out in order to bring that about. When the House met again after the elections that announcement- involving a promise, as it did - was repeated -in the course of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. Honorable members knew all along, then, that this was to be done. Since the authority of the House was given, the whole matter was brought before Cabinet, and Cabinet favoured the proposal for the immediate appointment of a Committee. First it was suggested, and approved, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> should remain in the capacity of adviser for which he was&#39; originally brought out here. The position is that the plan of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> should be preserved as the plan of the lay-out for the Federal Capital. That is the definite position; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> knows it. He has been told so, on several occasions, by myself. </para>

                        has been already preparing necessary detail plans. In &#39;addition, it was decided to pick out works which, irrespective of any Committee, it was known should be gone on with, and this has been done. A further matter had to do with the carrying out of the design.&#39; It was intended that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline>
                        should  remain in his advisory capacity in order to advise the Government should there be any attempt at deviation from the original design. Then came the question of proceeding with the work, and the proposal was to appoint a Committee. That, I desire to say, has not been communicated to the public.

                            <para>- The person knows who has got it. It sets out the proposals of the Government; it was decided to appoint a Committee of five, and upon that Committee it was proposed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> should act in order to conserve his design. In addition, there was to be an outside architect of eminence, quite apart from Federal control. Then there was also to be a leading engineer, in whom there would be public confidence. Further,  Colonel Owen,  Director of Works, was to be upon the Committee, in view of his responsibility for the conduct of activities; and also an officer from the Department of Home and Territories, which Department is responsible for the policy of constructing the Capital. It was decided that that Committee should advise the Government concerning exactly what works could be carried out immediately, and that it should prepare a scheme having in view the early occupation of the Federal Capital. The Committee was to report upon a general scheme for that occupation, upon the question of the buildings to be used, temporarily or otherwise, and on the matter of the order in which construction should be undertaken. In addition, with respect to any sums being involved which might exceed an individual total of &#163;25,000, the Committee was to advise the Government in order that such works should go before the Public Works Committee for investigation. We are proposing to occupy the Federal Territory. We do not want to make mistakes. Mistakes have occurred in the past because works have been started without sufficient knowledge of the objective at which those responsible were aiming. It has now been decided to appoint a competent body of men who will give to the Government a considered report, so that when their scheme is before us and we have appropriated sums from our Estimates, from time to time, we shall have a definite series of works being carried out with the one definite objective. </para>

                            <para>- The Committee will report to the Government, and the Government must take the responsibility. The intention is to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> for a definite term as adviser to the Government, so that the whole plan shall be safeguarded and secured. These matters which I have outlined are sound and proper. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> has raked up a whole lot of matter about the Federal Capital. He came here this afternoon with a&#39; most carefully prepared speech, comprising voluminous quotations and references. </para>

I do not for a moment question <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin&#39;s</inline> capacity to carry out his design ; but the scheme is a big one, involving sewerage, water supply, and many other large engineering works in regard to which we should get the best advice. </para>

I may say that the Commonwealth Public Works Department possesses particularly efficient officers. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has had these officials before it giving evidence, and has had opportunity of judging of their capacity. We have in the Department capable and efficient men, who should be able to carry out the work that we propose to have done. </para>

                        <para>.- Before dealing with the past and future administration of the Capital question, I wish to define my attitude towards the determination of Parliament to locate the Capital at Canberra. Various newspaper charges have been made against me because of the action that I have taken in this Chamber, and I therefore say, frankly, that Canberra having been chosen by the deliberate vote of Parliament for the site of the Federal Capital, and a great deal of money having been spent there, I consider that there is only one thing to be done, and that is to go on with the work of building the city; but had I been a member of this House when the location of the Capital was under discussion, I should have suggested a site much further north. </para>

                            <para>- A site on the Guy Fawkes plateau, which is in my electorate, and would have proved a very good position for the Federal Capital. However, the location of the Capital has been determined, and I think that the time has arrived when the Government should take in hand the building of the city; at any rate, to such an extent as would permit the Federal Parliament to meet at Canberra. I trust that the expedition shown will at least enable the Constitutional Convention to meet there next year. But while anxious that progress shall be made in the building of the city, I should like to elicit from the Minister a statement as to the manner in which the money voted for the necessary works is to be spent. The old way was, apparently, for departmental officers to refuse to accept outside expert opinion as to the best method of carrying out fundamental public works, with the result that any one visiting Canberra can see at a glance that hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted there. I differ from the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> who thinks that the opinion of expert engineers should not be obtained. </para>

It was urged against the gravitation scheme that it would be impossible to put in at the beginning a plant for the supplying of 100,000 persons, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corin</inline> pointed out eight years ago that the gravitation scheme could be carried out in three divisions as the population increased, supply being provided in the first instance for a population of from 10,000 to 15,000; secondly, for one of from 20,000 to 50,000; and thirdly, for one of from 50,000 to 100,000. </para>

                            <para>- The banks have not advanced specific amounts to finance the Wheat Pools, but the overdrafts at each State capital have been adjusted from week to week, so that the total overdraft is apportioned between the banks in relation to their deposit business. According to the latest advices, the wheat accounts are in credit, but the overdrafts resulting from the further payments to growers of &#163;1,830,000, which commenced on 5th instant, will be adjusted between the banks as set out above. The rate of interest paid to the banks was 5 per cent. per annum. </para>

                            <para>- Considerable quantities of flour gristed in anticipation of sale are still held by the States unsold. The gristing of further quantities for export would have involved the diminution of the stocks of wheat available for overseas sale, and the consequent loss of favorable opportunities of realization. At present it cannot be stated when the export business will be resumed. </para>

In addition, the Minister has approved of a free issue of ammunition to the value of &#163;30,000, calculated on the basis of actual cost to the Department, besides a free issue of approximately 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition (valued at &#163;15,000) for use at Association and Union prize meetings. As stated in the recent announcement of defence policy by the Minister, these must be understood as representing the full extent of assistance to bo given by the Government in the way of subsidy to rifle clubs. </para>

                            The Department of Agriculture states that the Yeoman variety of wheat is to be tested this year. The variety is extremely late, however, and not suitable- even for the Glen Innes district. It i3 a typical English, wheat, and a very heavy  stooler.  A complete report on the trial of this wheat will be available in about January next.

                            - The Director of Agriculture has reported as follows: - &#34;We have no record of local experience with the variety of wheat known as Yeoman. A few ears of this wheat, however, were handed to us last season, and we distributed it over the Government farms. Speaking generally, however, I may state that wheats that are heavy yielding under a climate such as that of England, very rarely, if ever, succeed under South Australian conditions. We have repeatedly tested varieties alleged to have given heavy yields in countries such as England, but have always found them more or less unsuited to local conditions. Personally, I see no reason for believing that Yeoman wheat will prove any more useful than other varieties that have been introduced in the past.&#34;
                        </para>
                        <para>Western. Australia. - Both  Browick  and Red Fife varieties (the Yeoman is a hybrid between these), have been planted in the test rows at the Chapman and Merredin Experimental Farms in this State, last planting season. Past experience, however, indicates that they are not likely to prove as suitable for our conditions as they are reported to have proved under British conditions. </para>

                    <para>I have copied from the report of the debate the remarks which I have attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> and the late Lord Forrest as typical of the hostility shown by honorable members opposite to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, which they have. since taken every advantage of, and to-day there is not one man who was opposed to the establishment of the Bank .in 1911 who would advocate wiping it out. Its establishment is evidence of the foresight of members of the party that I have the honour to lead, because we had in our programme for some time the creation of a National Bank. I admit that I could wish that the Commonwealth Bank had greater powers than it has. </para>

                    <para>The other day the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cock)</inline> told us that, during the war, the Bank of England was making no greater profit than it was making prior to the war, but that remark is not true as applied to Australian banks; because they took as much advantage of the war conditions as did any .other section of the community. As a matter of fact, their reserved profits are higher than the original capital put into them, as for instance, in the case of the Western Australian Bank, whose paid-up capital is only a little over &#187; third of its reserved profits. Yet the Treasurer says that he will not give the Commonwealth Bank - the Bank owned by the whole of the people of Australia - any advantage over private banks. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear the Treasurer make that statement, but it is most peculiar that, after a Bill has been submitted, presumably after consultation with the Treasury officials and possibly with banking officials, we should learn, even before the Treasurer had made his second-reading speech upon it, that a vital clause specifying the proportion of its deposits each bank shall hold in Australian notes was likely to be altered: I admit that the Treasurer told us early in his second-reading speech that he proposed to eliminate this provision. </para>

                    <para>I asked the Treasurer by interjection during his speech whether the Commonwealth Bank would be able to issue as many notes as it liked, and he said that it would be entirely within its power to issue more or less just as it liked. Some honorable members have complained that the note issue is inflated. They contend that it is quite possible prices would come down if it were deflated. Of course, as I interjected the other day. when the Treasurer was speaking, prices are high to-day because so many men have been withdrawn from productive industries. If we withdraw 20,000,000 men from production, and place them where their task is nothing but destruction, it necessarily means that less articles are produced and that the cost of them considerably increases. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer tells us that the note issue ought to be removed from political control; he advanced as another reason for transferring its control to the Commonwealth Bank the fact that the Bank has branches all over Australia, while the Treasury has none. As a matter of fact, the Treasury does not distribute the notes except at the head office, and, perhaps, at a few sub-branches. They are now distributed by the banks. It is their proper function to do so. If the Commonwealth Bank is to do this work now it will be obliged to keep sufficient supplies of notes on hand in every capital, and will thus relieve the private banks of the necessity to send to the Treasury in Melbourne for the notes, and transmit them to their various branches. </para>
                    <para>I would like to hear what remuneration is to be paid to the board of directors which is to control the note issue, and whether the directors will be permitted to interfere with the other work of the Commonwealth Bank. Will they simply control the note issue? </para>

                        <para>- Well, he does disarm me. I cannot find it in my heart to attack him. There is that in his exterior which would deceive any one of us if we did not know what was underneath it. Beneath it all, however, we know that there is a perfect Machiavellian purpose. I desire to show how far away he is in regard to this Bill from the people on whose support he relies to carry it. It is my duty to show what they expect, and what he proposes to give. So far as the great struggling masses outside are concerned, this is another piece of Dead Sea fruit that the Government are offering them. . . The Prime Minister told members of the Opposition that the fact that the Commonwealth Bank will compete with private banks should not give them concern, because they profess to believe in private enterprise; but be gave no good reason for this revolutionary proposal. My main objection to the Bill is that it provides for a politically-controlled bank . This Bill ties the Governor of the Bank to the Treasurer in a way which, I believe, is very sinister, and will work out to the detriment of the Bank, and the country. . . . Whatever the ultimate purpose may be, they are setting up a control which will make it almost impossible to conduct the Bank on ordinary sound business lines. </para>

                            <para>- One of the methods adopted for killing a  measure  is to submit an amendment affirming that it should be referred to a Select Committee. I can only recall one occasion upon which such an amendment has been carried. That was in 1901, upon the motion for the second reading of the Iron Bonus Bill. The result of the adoption of that amendment was that the question was not again dealt with until 1908. The measure was thus killed for a period of seven years. The Treasurer has told us that the Bank of England is satisfied to make only pre-war profits. May I quote the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline><inline font-style="italic">Insurance</inline><inline font-style="italic">and Banking Record</inline> for February of the present year ? </para>

It was only the restraint which  was imposed upon them by. the Commonwealth Bank which prevented them from doing just as they chose with the people of Australia. The Commonwealth Bank is giving better terms to its customers to-day than are any of the private banks, notwithstanding that it started without capital, and notwithstanding that we were assured upon its inception that the &#163;1,000,000 which the Labour Government proposed to put into it would be simply frittered away.

                    <para class="block">From the same journal of 21st October, 1920,. I gather that during the September quarter of 1919, the ordinary banks had &#163;27,031,599 in deposits not bearing interest, and this amount had increased during the September quarter of the present year to &#163;35,205,331, an increase approximately of &#163;8,200,000. But their fixed deposits bearing interest increased only from &#163;27,286,453, during the September quarter of 1919, to &#163;30,288,489 during the September quarter of the present year. It will be seen, therefore, that the private banks can well look after themselves, and, consequently, this Parliament should do its best to help our own Bank. I have never professed to be an authority upon finance, although a great many other honorable members adopted that <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> when the last Bank Bill was before us. But we ought to endeavour, wherever possible, to assist our own Bank and to place every facility in its way. I know that some State Governments do not help the Commonwealth Bank, but prefer to assist private banks in opposition to it. I have here a few figures extracted from a return published in the Victorian Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> which will serve to show how the Victorian Government boycotts the Commonwealth Bank in favour of private banks. That Government, in August, 1917, had the following deposits in the various banks mentioned : - </para>

                    <para class="block">We have reason to ask why the Victorian Government boycotts the Bank which is owned by the whole of the people of the Commonwealth in favour of private banks. However, the Bill which we are now considering is more a machinery measure than anything else. Whether it is wise to transfer the Commonwealth note issue from the Treasury to the Commonwealth is a debatable question, and I shall be interested to hear the opinions of financiers upon the matter. Personally, I am anxious to do everything that I can to assist the Commonwealth Bank in order that it may have a fairer run in the future than it has had in the past. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that the motion for the second reading of this Bill affords honorable members an opportunity - of which I hope the fullest advantage will be taken - of discussing not merely the question of the issue of Australian notes and of the currency generally, but also the effect of the note issue upon the prices of commodities within the Commonwealth. One of the main objects of the measure is to transfer the control of the issue of Commonwealth notes from the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank under the supervision of a special Board which is to be created for the purpose. Personally, I regard the proposed alteration as an improvement upon the past method of controlling our note issue, although I have not one word of reproach to utter in regard to what has been done under the existing control. We are all agreed  that one great object in the control of our note issue should be the stability of the currency and the stability of prices. Honorable members who have studied the history of note issues in the past will recognise that the evil of excessive  issues has been due to the necessities - sometimes the political necessities - of various Governments. Notes have been issued in excess of the reasonable requirements of a country, and the issues have been deflated. They have become enormously depreciated, not because those in charge of the Government have deliberately intended that the issue shall be in excess or the currency depreciated, but because the financial necessity of their position seems to indicate the issue of notes as the best course. </para>

                            <para>- It is; but I am delighted to think that there is no fear of the right honorable gentleman, as Treasurer, succumbing to any such temptation. Any step that removes the control of the note issue from the Government, and places it in the hands of what I may call an independent Board, must make for the stability of prices and of the currency. Although I notice that in the Bill the Government reserve the right to interpose in what might be termed extreme cases, there can be no doubt that the establishment of this Board of control will serve as a great check should any such temptation assail a future Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>I should like to say a few words on the immense importance of the stability of prices. Every one will agree that if it were possible it would be highly desirable in every  community  to have the prices of commodities stable; that is, that those who produce commodities should be able to reasonably calculate ahead what their prices will be in the future. </para>

It is not in any way desirable that people should make a living by any form of speculation. I do not think I need say more than I have to emphasize the desirability of stable prices ; nor do I wish to dwell long on the enormous extent to which prices of commodities are compelled to fluctuate by reason of fluctuating currencies. There are many causes of these fluctuations in prices; there may be a great failure of the crop of corn, oats, or other product, and prices necessarily rise in consequence of the enormous decrease in the supply.. There may also be most bounteous crops followed by a natural fall in prices; but eliminating all the causes which are beyond human power to conto - apart also from any fluctuation in prices due to  some  special demand- </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. Leaving on one side all the other causes of fluctuation in prices it cannot be denied that fluctuations of the currency have an enormous effect on prices, and are an unmitigated evil.. It is a great evil when, owing to any country or countries being flooded with new currencies, prices rise excessively. This imposes great hardship on a great many people; any benefit there may be is derived by the comparatively few, and is small compared with the enormous loss to the many. Similarly, it is a great evil, if not a greater evil, when owing to the contraction of the currency, or &#34; deflation,&#34; as it is sometimes termed, an enormous decrease in prices is brought about. In that case, widespread ruin is brought to vast numbers of people engaged in the most important of all industries, the primary productive industries, and also to those engaged in the secondary industry. </para>

                            <para>- I think that where there is a large paper currency, especially when that currency is inconvertible, the great and abiding cause - although it is almost a paradox to say so - is the fluctuation in the supplies of currency. </para>

                    <para>I should like to refer briefly to one or two &#34;very remarkable and typical instances of the evil done by such fluctuations. I refer first to the experiment tried in France in the early days of the Revolution, an experiment which lasted from 1789 to 1796. The Revolutionary Government issued what are known as <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> - a vast issue of paper money on the credit of the national lands of France. It will be remembered that after the Revolution had been in progress for some time, the Government annexed large areas of land formerly owned by the nobles and by the Church. These were the national lands, and the theory &#39; then held - curiously enough the same theory crops up even to-day, and I am not sure it will not crop up during this debate - was that the national lands of France were of such colossal value that notes could be issued on the security of them without any fear whatever of the notes being depreciated. Every one of these <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> was practically a mortgage on the national lands - the national lands were assigned to the owners of the notes, and hence the name. </para>

                            <para>- I believe there is not sufficient historical evidence to support that statement; the causes of what followed were very different. It is very interesting to know that when the <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> were first issued, the French philosopher, Mirabeau, one of the greatest amongst many great revolutionary philosophers, was a strenuous advocate of the course taken; and I should like to read what he said in the course of the dis.cussion on the question. I think I have heard in this Chamber, during, the last few weeks, expressions of opinion very similar to those of Mirabeau. He said of the <inline font-style="italic">assignats: -</inline></para>

                            <para>- I have thoroughly investigated the charge that the over-issue and depreciation of the <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> were due to forgery; and I think the overwhelming evidence is against it. It is quite possible there may have been a few forged <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> in circulation, but these were infinitesimal compared with the colossal issue authorized by the French Government. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, but when repeated too frequently, it is apt to become a little less impressive. Launched under such auspices, with such sublime confidence that these <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> could never become depreciated in value, the issue took place, and the French Government continued the issue. One authority says, &#34; The necessities of the State compelled enormous issues of these <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> until they became greatly depreciated.&#34; That is my point&#39;. The necessities of the &#39;State compelled enormous issues of this paper money until it became greatly depreciated, and that is why I welcome the proposal for a Board in Australia. It is not that I say for a moment that anything wrong has been done by any Australian Government in having issued the notes that  they  have issued, but there is the fear that at some future date, since wo are issuing Government notes which are not convertible into gold on demand - they are an inconvertible currency - they may he issued in excess and become depreciated. That, I say,, is why I support the Treasurer&#39;s proposal for a Board. The history of the French note issue is very instructive. The French issued these <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> again and again, when they were in financial difficulties,, and the amounts became colossal. In one decree, it was solemnly stated that the maximum issue was never to exceed 1,200,000,000 francs - a self-denying Ordinance - but further issues brought up the total to 3,750,,000,000 francs, until a note representing 100 francs was worth only 20 francs in coin. The result of this was an enormous rise in the prices of commodities. The Revolutionary Government, no doubt from a most praiseworthy desire to protect the people from the effects of this enormous rise in prices which they had brought about- </para>

                            <para>- They had brought about the enormous rise in prices by the tremendous increase in. the circulation of paper money, and they issued decrees endeavouring to fix prices to protect the consumers. Such endeavours, however; were hopeless. They passed most extraordinary laws,, because these people of the revolution of 130 years ago had very great faith in the powers of compulsory legislation, but perhaps not much more faith than some of our friends opposite have to-day. Recourse was had to drastic legislation, that decreed six years&#39; imprisonment against any one who should sell specie - that is, gold and silver - for a more considerable quantity of <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> than the <inline font-style="italic">assignats</inline> purported to represent, and for the second offence twenty years&#39; imprisonment. That decree was promulgated on the 1st August, 1793. On 10th May, 1794, they decreed the death penalty in an endeavour to enforce their decisions. By June, 1794, according to the authority from whom I have been quoting, there were in circulation no less than 5,500,,000,000 francs in the shape of <inline font-style="italic">assignats.</inline> Trade was paralyzed, and all manufacturing establishments were closed down.- The </para>

                            <para>- Doubtless, for all effects there are many causes. Life,, both financially and spiritually, is complex. There axe many tendencies always &#39;at work in different directions, and I should like to allow the fullest possible scope for the tendencies indicated by my honorable friend. France was at war during that period, practically fighting the whole of Europe. It might be said, and I am not prepared to deny it, that this enormous issue of <inline font-style="italic">assignats,</inline> which some people might term an over-issue; was the only means by which France could raise revenue to carry on a war of existence, and &#39;that the course she took was justified, because she did maintain her existence as a nation. I am not concerned at present with that aspect of the case. I am merely pointing out the effects of the enormous issue, or&#39; overissue, of <inline font-style="italic">assignats.</inline> I wish to emphasize that here we have the evil effects of an over-issue of paper money bringing about an enormous rise in prices, placing vast numbers of people at a terrible disadvantage.. I do not wish to raise the question of who or what was responsible, for any issues of notes in various countries, including Australia, during the period of the late war. Those issues may have been necessary, or they may not. I emphasize the fact that those issues have taken place, and that there is a depreciation in the note issues of nearly all European countries, and in that of Australia, at the present moment. One of the results of that depreciated note issue is undoubtedly a certain measure of rise in prices. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will remind me later, I shall give the exact measure of the depreciation. I propose to give the clearest proof of it, because I notice with some amazement, and almost with amusement, that some people in this country claim that there is no depreciation in the note issue. I emphasize now the facts that the issue of paper has taken place, that a depreciation of the paper money has taken place, and that a rise of prices has taken place. The question now arises whether notes should be called in in order to bring the value of our notes to the sovereign, which they originally represented. The effect of that policy would be to bring about a considerable fall in prices, but to carry it into effect would, in its turn, create very grave evils. </para>

                            <para>- That is a theory which has been held by many great financiers and economic authorities, including the honorable member ;but I do not propose so much to examine that theory at this stage as to examine the facts of the present situation, and the probable effect on prices of putting into force any theories which are held. It is rather curious that on this subject, to-day and at almost all times of which we have record of currency discussions, there have been two schools of thought. One may be called the expansionists- the people who say thai the currency of the country should be expanded for various reasons. That is a very simple form of raising revenue, as was found in the French Revolution, and as was found in European countries, including Great Britain, and also in Australia, during the recent war. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> reminds me that it was also found a very simple form of raising revenue in the United States during the Civil War. It brings about a very buoyant condition of the finances, and of trade, for a time. I gather that one or two of my honorable friends opposite are among the expansionists. They do not say, &#34;We cannot have too much of a good thing; we can not have too much currency,&#34;but they say, &#34; We can do with a little more of it, and if the Government is short of money and does not want to curtail its expenditure, probably that is the best way of raising extra money.&#34;People who hold that theory I call, without disrespect, expansionists. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that is rather a melancholy view of life. I like to think I am in accord with my honorable friend on many matters, but on that point I cannot put myself in accord with him. I am not so great a pessimist as to think that we are on the road to ruin. There is no necessity to believe that we are on the road to ruin. All the terrible calamities which are preached and: prophesied so frequently from the housetops can be averted if we have good sound common-sense thinking amongst the people of Australia, and in this Chamber of legislature. There are always with us the school of expansionists, who believe in an unlimited currency. I gather from a hint from the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> that they regard the holding of vast stores of gold as not at all essential. They believe that all the functions which have in the past been carried out by gold, but which are not now carried out by gold, could just as easily be carried out by the issue of paper money without any gold at all. There is always in existence another school whom I may, without disrespect, term contractionists. They believe in contracting the volume of money in the world. At the present moment they stand on what appears to be fairly good ground in saying that there has been too much paper money issued, and too great a rise in prices. But they do not stand on safe ground when they say that the best thing we can do is to bring about a fall in prices, get back to the old state of things, and call in all the redundant currencies. There might possibly be some measure of justification for that view if they confined themselves to the question of a contraction of redundant paper currencies; but the result of my observations is that long before we had any redundant paper currencies these same people were still contractionists. They did not believe in the expansion even of the metallic currency. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that point in a moment. They did not believe in the normal expansion of the currencies of the world to meet the world&#39;s requirements, before we had any redundant paper money in existence. They stood openly for what they called a solid standard, which did not permit an expansion of the currency to enable them to face trade depressions and severe panics. The honorable member for Robertson interjects that they believed in stabilizing the currency. I cannot see any evidence of that whatever. In giving one or two instances, let me allude first to the features of the great Peel&#39;s Banking Act of 1844. I rather regret that I have been drawn aside to these somewhat recondite matters, but Peel&#39;s Banking Act has been mentioned. It was an Act to make it impossible to increase the currency as the requirements of trade and industry demanded. There was a. fixed amount - about &#163;15,000,000 - up to which the Bank of England was allowed to issue notes without holding any gold for them. But beyond this amount their note issues were useless. For one thing, the Bank of England was not allowed to issue &#163;1 notes. The Bank of England was expressly created to lend the Government of William and Mary, without any security whatever, a large sum of money, and against that Government debt the Bank was allowed to issue notes of a denomination of &#163;5 and upwards without any gold reserve. Not a bank in the whole of England was allowed to issue a note of a lower denomination than &#163;5, and every note issued by the Bank of England in excess of the &#163;15,000,000 due by the English Government had to be represented by gold. </para>

                            <para>- I assure my honorable friend that Peel&#39;s Banking Act of 1844, which was maintained by the contractionists of that day - the people who did not believe in enlarging or expanding the volume of currency in the country, to meet the requirements of commerce and industry - was from beginning to end a monument of folly. It has hardly been seriously justified by sound economists. On the contrary, it has been denounced by many political economists. It was a curse, and although it was suspended on three occasions before the war, its suspension did not take place until it had brought many people of the commercial, financial, and industrial classes of England to the verge of ruin. In a moment of panic it was suspended, and the stupendous folly of the Act then became apparent. </para>

                    <para>I have given a quotation to impress upon the House the evils brought upon (mankind by the over-expansion of currency. I propose now to make a further quotation with the object of showing the evils, in the shape of severe and sudden falls in prices, brought about by over-contraction or, in other words, an inadequate supply of currency. For we have to guard against those who are in favour of creating a contraction of currency, just as much as we have to guard against the expansionists. I stand for the stability of currency and prices. Honorable members will all have a knowledge of the economic situation which followed the Battle of Waterloo. It will be recalled that during the great Napoleonic Wars there were in England periods of very high prices, due to various causes, and that almost immediately after the Battle of Waterloo there was a tremendous fall in prices. Many people seem to have only one desire nowadays, and that is to bring about a reduction in prices. They complain, very reasonably, of the high cost of living at the present time, and object very strongly to many of the causes responsible for it. But I do not think they quite realize the danger of a sudden, or even a gradual, breaking down of prices and the disaster that would thus fall upon the whole of the producing, manufacturing, and trading interests of the country. During the Napoleonic Wars the farmers of England, encouraged by the high prices then ruling, were producing to the utmost of their capacity. But at the close of 1815 a great fall in prices took place, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Wallas, in an article on &#34; Agriculture after Waterloo,&#34; published in the <inline font-style="italic">Cornhill Magazine</inline> for September, 1917, deals with the effect upon the farming interests. After referring to the farmers, who, because of their inability to sell their produce, would be seen despondent and dispirited, walking home from market before noon, where a few years before they had driven in their smart gigs, he goes on to say - </para>

As he drew near homestead after homestead he would have seen the empty stack-yards - all had been threshed after harvest in 1815, and sold in a glutted market to pay the Michaelmas rent, or to meet more pressing liabilities of taxes, rate, or tithe, the banks having refused to advance the money. </para>

                            <para>- I am interested to be reminded by the Treasurer that, while in a rising market prices follow up wages because an increase in wages must result in an increase in prices, it is likewise true that when a great fall in prices takes place wages also fall. The first effect&#39; of any contraction in currency is very widespread. It entails the breaking down in prices of primary products, and the output of manufacturing industries to a point when it becomes unprofitable for the farmer to produce, and the manufacturer to manufacture. In support of this view-point, I again quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallas&#39;s</inline> statement as to the effect of the great fall in prices upon the agricultural industry in England after the Napoleonic wars: - </para>

The great enclosures taken from moors and commons are quietly resigned to their ancient possessors, the heath and the furze; and vast sums expended improvidently in subjecting land of very indifferent quality to cultivation are lost for ever. </para>

                    <para class="block">This breaking down of prices as the result of the undue contraction in currency has its inevitable effect upon wages and employment. So far as I can ascertain, wages have never been brought down in any country in the world by any other process than that which makes it unprofitable for the employer to carry on. The almost immediate effect of a contraction in currency is the unemployment of large numbers of workmen, because production has become unprofitable. I have been told that even now some manufacturing industries in this country, being unable to dispose of their output, are about to close down. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has asked me a question which on another occasion I should be pleased to answer fully. On this occasion the Standing Orders will not permit me to discuss it. In many manufacturing industries the cost of production has reached a point at which employers are no longer able to continue, and for the moment there is a danger of closing down. This movement has taken place in all economic history throughout the world. This widespread unemployment and a breaking down in prices generally are the inevitable results of any serious contraction in currency. Are those who advocate this course of events prepared to face such consequences upon the people of Australia? If we are to revert to those prices ruling for some years before the war we must expect a great deal of unemployment and distress throughout the Commonwealth, until such times as prices and costs are readjusted. </para>

                    <para>I have emphasized the evils resulting from an undue inflation or contraction of currency, because I think the wise and statesmanlike course, namely, the stabilizing of currency, lies, between the two extremes. The Bill, I understand, represents an attempt to insure stability by taking control of the note issue out of the hands of the Government, and placing it under an independent Board of experts. I am glad to think that the measure follows very much on the lines of the Federal Reserve banking system of the United States of America. I have a very vivid recollection of events in that country during my visit thirteen years ago - in September, 1907. There was a financial panic due entirely, in my opinion, to the fact that the people in control of the note issue were contractionists - of the same class as those who believed in Peel&#39;s Banking Act of 1884 - making it impossible for currency to expand with the legitimate requirements of trade and industry. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> was visiting the United States at that time, and no doubt will remember what took place. </para>

                            <para>- Prior to the suspension an honorable member had asked me if I considered that our Commonwealth notes were over-issued, and if they have depreciated in relation to gold. I do not say that our Commonwealth notes are over-issued. That is a matter of opinion ; but it is a question of undoubted fact that they have depreciated in relation to gold. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and only the Treasurer can inform the honorable member where these most attractive golden sovereigns may be obtained. I wish to prove that a Commonwealth fi note is not worth a sovereign to-day, &#39;but that a sovereign is worth a great deal more than a &#163;1 note, by using as an illustration a recent sale of gold on the part of the Gold Producers Association of Australia. With respect to this matter I congratulate the Government and the Commonwealth Treasury upon having allowed the gold producers to obtain world&#39;s parity for their product. </para>

                            <para>- The Gold Producers Association, although it was not permitted a free market for its products during the earlier part of the war, has been free; in the past two years, to market its gold where it can get the best price. We have, therefore,, a method now which is, I think, absolutely accurate, and by which we can gauge the value or our gold in paper money, so measuring the depreciation of our currency. &#39; There is a school of thought in Australia which cannot realize that our highly-valued notes can ever become depreciated in relation to gold. Those who uphold the tenets of this school will not look facts in the face; it is the duty of this House to do so, however; to recognise that our paper money has depreciated in value, and to ascertain the exact degree of depreciation so that we shall not make any move in the dark. It was recently announced that a large sale by the Gold Producers Association had taken place. The precise quantity quoted consisted of 700,000 sovereigns, and the sale was conducted on the basis of &#163;5 16s. 8d. per ounce. This is a very notable sale; and, although negotiations were conducted by medium of British notes, it is a fact that the British and the Australian note currency have remained upon a practically equal basis. A reliable comparison can, therefore, be made. The Gold Producers </para>

                    <para class="block">Association made its sale to the National City Bank of New York. That is probably the greatest banking institution in the United States. As I have just said, that institution paid for fine, gold- at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> 16s. 8d. per ounce. The value of fine gold, if it were paid for in sovereigns, could never be more than &#163;4 5s. per ounce. Our sovereign is equal to nearly one-fourth of an ounce of gold. There are 480 grains troy in an ounce. If a sovereign contained exactly one-fourth of that weight,, namely, 120 grains, gold would be obviously worth &#163;4 per ounce. Dealing now with fine gold, there are not 120 grains in a sovereign, but only 113. The equivalent worth of the gold in a sovereign is &#163;4 5s. per ounce of fine gold, provided that the purchase money is paid&#39; in coined gold. That is, provided one is selling one&#39;s raw gold for sovereigns, fine gold would be always worth &#163;4 5s. per ounce. Thus, it is obvious that if a person can get more than &#163;4 5s. per ounce for his gold he must be getting it in some form of currency which has depreciated in relation to gold. The Gold Producers Association got &#163;5 16s. 8d. in British paper money for every ounce of their fine gold. As I have said, our own notes and the British notes are of practically the same value in relation to one another, though they are both depreciated in relation to gold. The exact measure of this depreciation is shown by this sale to be that the British, and presumably the Australian, note of &#163;1 is worth 14s. 4d. in gold. That is tested by the latest sale of Australian fine gold at &#163;5 16s. 8d. per ounce. As _ for the argument that the British note issue has not depreciated, I quote the following remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dyason, Chairman</inline> of the Gold Producers Association regarding earlier sales: - </para>

                            <para>- No; from a statement made by him at the annual meeting of the members of the Gold Producers Association, at which he occupied the chair, and was reported in the daily newspapers. My comment on it is that not only does it conclusively prove that there is a depreciation of our currency, but it also enables us to measure that depreciation. The position is this: If 6,340,723 &#163;l-notes will buy only 4,975,217 sovereigns, how many sovereigns will a &#163;100-note buy? A calculation shows the &#163;100 bank note to be worth only &#163;78 9s. 31/2d. in sovereigns, which made the &#163;l-note worth about 15s. 9d. when measured in gold, as tested by the large sales spread over seventeen months. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that the case is incorrectly stated. I think that the difference in value is due, not so much to the depreciation of our notes, as to the appreciation of gold in a market that is not free. That is only another way of stating the position, but it conveys a different impression. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know, in no country in the world are there two retail prices for different kinds of money, because nowhere are there two kinds of money in circulation. Sovereigns are not in circulation now, either in Australia or in England, therefore there is no means of ascertaining whether one could buy more with them than with notes. Where you cannot buy or sell a commodity, it is useless to ask its price. The appreciation of gold and the depreciation of bank notes are two terms denoting the same fact. If geld has appreciated in comparison with paper money, paper money has depreciated in comparison with gold. </para>

                        <para>.- Two of the statements made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in his second-reading speech were rather alarming. The first of these was that this is not the time when the National Parliament of Australia should come into conflict with the banking institutions of the country, and the second that under no circumstances should the National Bank of the Commonwealth be shown any consideration in preference to the private banking institutions. Dealing with these in their order, I ask why is it that we must not to-day trespass on the preserves of the favoured private financial institutions of the Common wealth ? Is it because the Government has to go hat in hand to them, begging to be allowed to use the credit of the nation, which they control? Is it because they hold the nation in the hollow of their hand, dictating terms, and doing just what they please? The Treasurer to-day scouted the idea that the banks might refuse to finance the wheat, and I accept his assurance; but what is the fear underlying his statement? Is it that the banks might close the avenues of credit necessary to the proper functioning of this and the other Governments of Australia. Why must we mention only in fear and  trembling the financial institutions, the money-lords of t he country ? I think that this is the time when we should interfere with them, and when the National Parliament should mobilize the credit of this nation in order that we may overcome the difficulties and dangers, both financial and economic, into which the war has thrown us. We shall never do this merely by running the Commonwealth Bank alongside the private banks, and in no circumstances giving it any advantage over them. In my view, the opening of this Parliament was the proper time for the introduction of  a  Banking Bill, to nationalize banking by the extension of the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, so that it might control the banking of the Commonwealth, and take from the private institutions the power which they have too long wielded, and by the possession of which they can almost terrorize Governments, not only in this country but in every country of the world, compelling them to do their will, and be at their beck and call. </para>

                    <para>Some of the remarks of the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Mr. Jowett)</inline> seem to me to conflict with statements made by the Treasurer when moving the second reading. The former almost dogmatized as to the cause of the present excessively high prices being an inconvertible currency of paper money. In Great Britain, in France, and in Australia, we are told that it is because the paper currency is so inflated that prices are high, yet in America it is said that prices are high because that country is. loaded with gold; and I .understand that the second statement is made also in Holland. </para>

                            <para>- How, in countries  like  Australia or in the British Empire, where there are so many private cheque-paying banks, can it be ascertained that the currency is inflated? It is possible to ascertain the ratio of notes to gold in this country, but, as I have pointed out on other occasions, the notes in circulation are not 5 per cent, of our total paper currency; and that is true of the Empire at large. I have seen the -claim made by financial writers that,, in countries like Australia and Great Britain, 95 per cent, of the actual trading and interchange of goods is effected by means of cheques. The Treasurer&#39;s own figures prove that to be so. In delivering: his Budget he told us that the total of the deposits in the private banks of Australia has increased from &#163;247,000,000 to &#163;385,000,000. In round figures, the customers of the private banks of Australia are operating, by means of cheques, on deposits amounting to &#163;400.000,000. Our gold reserve is about &#163;60,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- -That makes my argument the stronger. Against the &#163;400,000,000 represented by the cheques in circulation, there is a gold reserve of only &#163;44,000,000, or about 11 per cent, of the value of the cheques. Whatever may be pledged to support the credit of the cheque-drawers - property or anything else- only &#163;44,000,000 in gold stands behind it; therefore, the withdrawal of &#163;10,000,000 worth of notes from circulation, or even the withdrawal of half our notes, would make practically little reduction in the paper currency&#39; of the country. </para>

                    <para>I think I have shown that the banking institutions of this country, including the Commonwealth Bank, have not more than 6 per cent, of the currency in gold. If you establish the fact that the commercial affairs of Australia, and of the British Empire as a whole, can be conducted smoothly, and without interruption on a circulation of credit, you establish at the same time that the principle of banking on such security is sound. I contend that there is no reason why private banking institutions should be allowed to grow rich on what is really the united credit of the people. The whole of that credit should be operated through the Commonwealth Bank for the benefit of the nation as a whole.

These little pound notes which our friends opposite are despising so much,- and the issue of which they contend must not be inflated, saved the Empire during the war.

That is left to the mercy of financial institutions. I have referred to the huge amount of credit which, apart from gold, represents the security upon which the financial affairs of the nations are conducted to-day. The actual trading between the nations to-day is one of barter. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, no. I see that economic truth is lost on the right honorable gentleman. I shall have to explain the matter to him fully later on. In my view, four of five months of the time of this Parliament has been wasted in endeavours to bring about what has been termed &#34; industrial peace.&#34; With these huge financial burdens upon the people, it can never be brought about. In my opinion, every attempt so far made has simply added to the expenses of the people, and has aggravated the position. Something must be done to meet the trouble. If parliamentary institutions and responsible government are to attempt to solve the huge problems that confront us to-day, we must get to the root of the financial  position  If we solve the financial problem, our other problems will be easy of solution. </para>

                    <para>I ask honorable members to consider the position in which Australia is to-day as the result of the complex banking and financial system we have adopted. There is no attempt made to mobilize the resources of the nation in times of peace to meet our obligations. We have now such a staggering burden of debt to bear that we must try to solve our financial problem. According to the figures given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth TearBook</inline> for 1919, the Commonwealth public debt was then &#163;350,000,000; the&#39; total debts of the States amounted to &#163;396,000,000, and the debts incurred by local bodies to &#163;64,000,000. These figures give a total of &#163;810,000,000. The annual interest charge on the public debts  amounts, roughly, to &#163;35,000,000. That is. to say that to meet the interest on the national debt every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth must raise &#163;7 per year. </para>

                            <para>- No, they do not; and whether they do or not, the interest&#39; is a charge upon every industry, and must be paid before the workmen can get a farthing for their own benefit. It is the same with the interest bill on private indebtedness, to which I shall refer in a moment. A man, his wife, and three children are required to raise &#163;35 annually to meet the interest on the national debt of Australia. I tried to discover as nearly as possible from the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y ear-Book</inline> the amount of private interest-bearing capital in Australia, and it works out at something over &#163;1,000,000,000. That is, leaving out all the small fry If I put down the interest on that capital at the comparatively low rate, at the pre-&#39; sent time, of 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., it will be seen that the interest bill amounts to &#163;112,000,000 annually. If we add this amount to the &#163;35,000,000, which must be paid in interest on the national debt, it will be seen that the 5,000,000 people of this Commonwealth have to raise &#163;14.7,000,000 every year before they begin to obtain the necessities of life or those things which go to make life bearable to the individual. Allowing for possible errors, and estimating the total interest charge at &#163;145,000.000, I find that every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth must raise &#163;29 per annum to meet the interest on Commonwealth, State, and private capital. A man, his wife, and three children must raise an annual revenue of &#163;145 to meet the interest charge, and a family of eight must raise &#163;232 annually. Honorable members may say that they do not pay that money, because they do not receive it. I aim aware of that, but it is paid from the goods they produce. It is paid from their labour, and nothing else. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the Treasurer to say that this was not. the time to come into conflict with the banks. There is very little difference between .that and saying that it would be unwise to interfere with them. In any case, I do not suppose the present&#39; Government would dare to come into conflict&#39; with the banks, seeing that they call them into conference every time they have a financial problem confronting them, and&#39; that every arrangement the banks choose to make they must either accept or reject. But what did the banks do in the time of crisis? If the Commonwealth Bank had not been in existence, if the Commonwealth note had not been legal tender, and if the Commonwealth Bank had not been behind them, the private banks of Australia would not have lasted more than 48 hours. They would hare been in the position of the banks of Great Britain. War had not been declared four days when all the banks in England closed their doors, and they would not have opened them again had it not been that the Chancellor of the Exchequer issued &#163;200,000,000 worth of Treasury bills - which was afterwards, I believe, increased to nearly &#163;300,000,000 worth - bearing no promise of redemption in gold, but simply having behind them the faith of the people in the stability of the British Government and the credit of the British nation. When any nation is threatened by a great crisis its Government always has to come forward and stand behind the banking institutions of the country. Otherwise they would close their doors. </para>

                    <para>The fact that when war broke out every nation in the world was compelled to discard all the bid ideas in regard to the banking world, and open up new fields by. pledging the whole of the security of the nation, making every individual stand side by side equally responsible in financial matters as in military service on the battle-field, proves beyond doubt that we have no need to worry or agitate ourselves about having sovereigns behind our notes, or about calculations as to how much gold makes a sovereign, or about where we are to get the gold, or whether we should permit its export. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It was only the despised paper with no gold behind it, which my friends opposite do not seem to like, that was capable of keeping the armies of the world in the field. If we would only close up all private banking institutions, and have one bank with the whole of the- resources of the Commonwealth behind it, we could finance anything. We could exploit the credit of Australia for &#39;the purpose of developing this young country as we., unfortunately, have had to exploit, it for war. What is credit, about which we all talk so much? In the commercial world, and in an economic sense, it is nothing more than the present value of future profits. We exploit our credit to-day for Government undertakings. We spend &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 on a developmental work, and immediately its construction is completed we have an asset against our expenditure, and the returns steadily derived from it are our future profits. </para>

                        <para class="block">The whole of this confusion and mystery is  &#39; .r.red away by simply observing that a bank merely a shop for the sale of credit, and the quantity of credit a bank will create is determined by the ratio of the demand for payment in money compared with the total quantity of credit created. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">All a bank has to do to create credit is to have enough ready cash to meet immediate requirements in ratio to the credit  created.  If it has, say, a capital of &#163;5,000, and its average immediate requirements work out at about &#163;1,000 per week, it can multiply the amount of its credit in respect of the other &#163;4,000 indefinitely. The balance is never called upon. It was in this way that the Commonwealth Bank building in Sydney was erected. I understand that it cost &#163;450,000, but not a penny was borrowed for the purpose of building it. It actually cost the people of Australia nothing. As the bank had more money in its tills than its clients called for, it simply paid the workmen out of its till money, and now the Commonwealth has an asset worth at least &#163;800,000. </para>

I propose to quote one of the greatest authorities upon banking and financial matters in Great Britain - I refer to McLeod - to show that the banks do create these things out of nothing.

                        <para>The invention of cash credits has advanced the wealth of Scotland by centuries. We have an enormous mass of exchangeable property created out of nothing by the mere will of the bank and its customers, which produces all the effects of solid gold and silver. . And when it has done its work it again vanishes into nothing at the will of the persons who called it into existence. Hence we see the mere will of man has created vast masses of wealth out of nothing, and then, having served their purpose, they are de-created into nothing from&#39; whence they came. They are melted into thin air. But the solid results are by no means faded. On the contrary, the solid results have been vast tracts of barren moor converted into smiling fields of waving corn, the manufacturer of Glasgow, Dundee, and Paisley, the unrivalled steam-ships of Clyde, great public works of all sorts, roads, canals, bridges, harbors, docks, and railways, and many others, and poor young men into princely merchants. </para>

Only, the other day when I advocated the creation of a cash credit for the payment of the wheat guarantee, the Treasurer said that that would mean the game thing as the issue of notes. It would mean nothing of the sort. We may put our paper into circulation, but the actual currency, whether it be gold, silver, or copper, is nothing more nor less than tickets of admission to the economic goods of life. </para>

                        <para>As an example of the power of credit to create new products, we may cite the following instance&#39;. The States of Guernsey, having determined to create a meat market, voted &#163;4,000 to defray the cost. Instead of borrowing this sum at &#163; per cent., the Governor issued 4,000 cardboard tickets, on which were inscribed Guernsey meat market notes; they represented &#163;1 each, and were legal currency by universal&#34; consent. With these notes they paid the contractor, and with them he paid his workmen, and all who supplied them, with materials. They were freely taken by the tradesmen for goods, by landlords for rents, by authorities for taxes. In due course the market was completed. The butchers&#39; stalls, with some public rooms over them, let for an annual rent of &#163;400. At the expiration of the first year of this tenancy the State called in the first batch of notes numbered to 400, and with the &#163;400 of real money received for rent, redeemed the &#163;400 of representative money expressed by the meat market notes. At the &#39;end of ten years all the notes were redeemed through the application of ten years&#39; rental. In this way they built a very good market without paying any interest - on borrowed money, and without injuring anybody. </para>

                            Hill testifies that this was no isolated case, but that it was the usual method adopted in effecting public works. I may mention the abundance of paper money in Guernsey as a great cause of prosperity. The paper money is issued by the island Government in the following way: - When any great undertaking has been entered on by the States, such, for instance, as the opening of new roads, there is immediately an issue of fl-notes. These are sent out as the work proceeds, and as money is wanted. When the undertaking is completed and begins to yield an income, the notes are brought in again, and new undertakings are commenced. The notes are not payable on demand - indeed, the Government has not even an office at which they can be presented. The people find by experience that their representatives do not issue the notes in greater abundance than the demand for them justifies, and consequently no depreciation in their value is to be feared. Moreover, the purposes for which the notes are issued are of advantage to every man in the island, so that every one looks upon them as coming from a bank of which he is a partner. Here, then, in the little island of Guernsey we have, perhaps, the only instance in the world of a really national bank - a bank in which the whole property of the State is the security, and the profit of which is shared by the people at large. By means of this healthy currency undertakings of great magnitude have been executed during the past years.

                        <para>Banks, therefore, which issue the notes may increase their capital by receiving their own notes in payment, by which they turn their own notes into capital. But banks which do not issue notes may increase their capital in exactly the same way. A customer of the bank who has a balance to his credit is in exactly the same position as a note-holder. If he wishes to subscribe to an increase of capital by the bank, he simply gives the bank a cheque on his account. This is equally a release from a debt as a payment in the bank&#39;s own notes, and an increase of capital. If the customer has not sufficient in his account to pay for the stock he requires, he may bring the bank bills to discount. The bank discounts the bills by making a credit or deposit in his favour which, of course, is a negative quantity, like a bank-note. The customer then gives the bank a cheque on his account; that is, he releases the bank from the debt it has  created,  and that debt released becomes the increase in capital. This is the way in which the capital of all joint stock banks increased, and it may go on to any extent without any payment in money, and) consequently, it is impossible for any one who has not had access to the books of the bank to ascertain what proportion of the capital consists of payment lu money, and what portion consists of the bank&#39;s own temporary credit turned into capital. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is another reason why banks fail so often. I now desire to say something about the floating of loans abroad. We have heard much about the difficulty of borrowing in London and abroad. I, for one, hope and  pray  we may never be able to float any more loans in London or anywhere else out of Australia; indeed, my wonder is that we ever floated any. </para>
                    <para>What happens when we float loans abroad ? Our banking institutions being in private  hands, and it being our habit to follow the advice of expert bankers, we really refuse, under the system, to use our own credit, or rather, and worse still, we pay other people interest for using our own credit. Does any one say that the money we borrow comes here? We are told that goods come by way of loan. That is an old argument that was in use many years ago, more particularly &#39;as between European countries. The idea was that when a merchant shipped, say, &#163;1,000.000 worth of goods, instead of payment being made here or in London from the receiver of the goods, the buyer of the goods hero placed the money in the bank to the credit of the Government, and the foreign money-lender liquidated the debt abroad. We were then supposed to have got goods by way of loan. When we turn to the statistics from the colonization of Australia we find that from 1826 to 1918 the imports to Australia were &#163;2,137,141,000, and the exports &#163;2,297,062,000, not including gold. In the year 1917-1918 the excess of exports over imports was &#163;160,000,000, which obviously means that there is that amount owing to Australia. But we have floated loans to the extent of hundreds of millions in England, not from the British Government, or from the people, but from . British money-lenders, very often Jew money-lenders. We sell our bonds on the London market. What are these bonds ? They are pieces of paper, really, bearing a promise to repay at a certain date, and to pay interest- until the principal is liquidated. We sell those bonds through underwriters on the London Stock Exchange, and speculators buy them, and pass cheques to our agents, who, in turn, pass cheques to the bank with which Australia does business. A record is made of the money in the bank, and then, say that &#163;5,000,000 has been borrowed, that amount is cabled to Australia, some bank being notified to lend it to the Government. Whose money and whose credit is involved in this ? It is the credit of the Australian nation, and nothing else. Financial experts may tell us, perhaps, that we have got the credit of Britain; but how can that be when we pledge the credit of Australia to the extent of millions annually? These are some of the things which make an Australian-born sometimes angry. We are too. often told of what we owe to the Empire,, and to people outside, and how thankful we ought to be. I am not here to discuss the matter &#34;from that point of view, but when men, born outside Australia, come here, and have the effrontery to tell us that it is the Mother Country who has been financing us, and. that we owe her hundreds of millions - that we owe everything;  we  have to somebody else - it is time something was said on behalf of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I quite recognise that; but it is because of the false economic system which prevails. The Commonwealth Bank has unfortunately been circumscribed by all kinds of limitations, and has not been able to operate to the full extent which was first desired for it. Consequently, to-day, the circumstances are such that it has not been able to relieve the situation to the full, although it has assisted to do so in some measure. It is the bank that saved this country from financial ruin at the beginning of the war, for it placed the private banking institutions  in the position of having the assets of the nation behind them. I believe the time is coming when the people of this country, if they are to be protected from a financial crisis and even bankruptcy, can be saved only through the medium of their national bank. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member had been  paying  attention to the speech of the honorable member for Werriwa, and had listened to the honorable member&#39;s amendment, he, as a keen business man, would have seen in what way that could be done. The relief I speak of can be secured to the people by the people themselves having the full advantage of the mediums of credit that can be created through the assets that they build-up as wealth producers. This can be best done through the medium of a bank which shall have a complete monopoly of the financial operations of the nation, and be able to relieve the taxpayers of the heavy burdens which accrue from the paying of interest on loans, by providing credits to carry on the Commonwealth and State undertakings, and cash credits for rural industries, in order to release primary producers from the grip of  financial  institutions, by consolidating the national debt, and putting it on a sound footing, and by making proper financial provision for the nation to honour its obligations in full. The financial institutions of the world have fattened on the proceeds of war. </para>

I cannot see any justification for the wide margin between those circumstances. The Western Australian Bank has paid as high as 20 per cent, by way of dividend. </para>

                    <para>The Treasurer has stated that the present unenviable position occupied by Australia in London, in the matter of meeting its liabilities, and securing credits there, is not due to any disrepute in which Australia herself  stands.  but is caused by the banks which have permitted large purchases to be made, while temporarily there has been <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> dearth of credit on the part of the banks in London. It is claimed in London that Australia should export her gold to establish credits there. That is a proposition by means of which the private banking institutions are endeavouring to make a personal convenience of what is a national asset, governing the stability of this country. I am satisfied that Australia does not stand in a position of disrepute, with other countries because of anything for which she herself has been responsible. It is the private banking institutions and other financial mediums that have been responsible for producing these very undesirable circumstances to the detriment of the people of the Commonwealth. It is as well to take into consideration the profits that have been made by the private banks, so that the people may understand just how they are being imposed upon, and  appreciate  the fact that each year sees them in greater difficulties than before, so that, instead of being able to get out of the morass into which they have unfortunately allowed themselves to slip, they are becoming more deeply involved as time goes on.

                    <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, viz. :  - Ordnance and other Defence buildings at Kelvin Grove, Brisbane, Queensland. </para>
                    <para>On the authority of the House we have already erected Ordnance Stores at Leichhardt, Sydney, and are building similar stores at Seymour, Victoria. The House also authorized recently the erection of Ordnance Stores at Midland Junction, Perth, Western Australia, and we are proposing now to enter upon a similar work &#39;in Queensland. These stores at Kelvin Grove have been rendered necessary owing to the inadequacy of the present Ordnance Store accommodation in Brisbane, which is equal to only one-third of the requirements. The stores themselves are unsuitable. They were not designed for the purpose, and are not efficiently equipped. Great quantities of goods are at present stored in drill halls and rented premises. The drill halls are now required for training purposes, and the amount paid in rentals is &#163;1,073 per annum, which expense it is considered  should be no longer incurred. The fact that these stores are housed in unsuitable premises, which are situated in several localities, entails unwarranted expense in administration, supervision, and caretaking. The erection of new, up-to-date, and commodious stores will obviate such unsatisfactory conditions. </para>
                    <para>The site proposed for these stares comprises a portion of the defence area now devoted to the accommodation of the Engineers&#39; and Artillery Depot at Kelvin Grove, and a small area of land adjoining which it is proposed to acquire. The buildings generally will be elected with brick walls, concrete  floors,  and iron roofs, and will be similar in type, but of smaller  dimensions,  to the Ordnance Stores buildings now in course of erection at Leichhardt, New South Wales. </para>
                    <para>The buildings and works comprise the following: - Excavation of site, Ordnance Stores, Small Arms Ammunition Store, Administration Office building, luncheon room  block,  lavatory block, Unserviceable Goods Store, Inflammable Goods Store, machinery room, fencing and gates, formation of roads, water supply, storm water drains, electrical installation, lifts, and fire-prevention services. </para>
                    <para>The total estimated cost of the works is&#163;53,041, and the details are as follow: - </para>
