                        <para>- The policy of the Government in regard to Canberra was stated prior to the last elections, when Ministers declared that they were in favour of pushing on the construction of the Federal Capital, subject to those obvious financial limitations which affect all enterprises at the present time. A substantial sum will be placed on the Estimates, and when these come before honorable members they will have an opportunity to express their opinions concerning the adequacy of the amount, and how it should be expended. </para>

Our vessels are now getting fair cargoes.

                        <para> - Under certain circumstances, the war gratuity, or part of it, is payable to the dependants of applicants; but there are cases in which the dependant has a very strong claim, and the soldier a very weak one, and probably in such cases no application will be made for the gratuity, for reasons personal to the soldier. I ask the Treasurer, therefore, whether he will consider the propriety of enabling the proper authorities to make payments to dependants who establish a good claim, whether the person entitled in the first instance applies for the gratuity or not ? </para>

The circular in question was despatched for the purpose of securing a record of all such property. In all cases where Germans have been resident in the Commonwealth for more than ten years, their property has been vested in the Public Trustee, and will be liquidated only provided that the Crown is able to definitely prove them guilty of disloyal actions during the period of the war. In all cases where Germans have been resident in Australia less than ten years, their property has been vested in the Trustee, and will be liquidated unless they are able to prove that they may be considered loyal subjects of the British Crown. </para>

                            <para>.- Honorable members will probably recall that, last Friday week, I endeavoured to ventilate a grievance in this Chamber regarding the non-delivery of mails to the hospital in Wellington, New South Wales. Upon that occasion, an exhibition of Christian charity was given by the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> who called attention to the state of the House at a time when numbers of honorable members had just departed in order to catch their trains, the result being that the House was counted out, and I was unable to place my complaint before the Minister concerned. However, I now avail myself of the opportunity to place the following facts before the Postmaster-General: - The Wellington district hospital is situated just outside of the postal boundary, although it is within the municipal boundary. For the reason that the hospital is not inside the postal bounds, the Department refuses to deliver mails thereto. The consequence is that when the night nurse comes off duty at 7 a.m. she has to walk down to the post-office in the town, collect the hospital mails, and carry them back to that institution, so that it is often 11 a.m. before she can retire. </para>

                                <para>- This is a case where an exception might well be made to the general rule. If there is one section of the community deserving of sympathetic consideration, it is the nursing staffs of our hospitals. The nurses work exceptionally long hours. I do not think any  honorable member would advocate an extension of their hours on duty, or would favour the maintenance of their present twelve-hour shifts, if those periods could be reduced. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that after a nurse has completed twelve hours on night duty, she should be required to undertake a walk in order to collect mails, and take them back to the hospital. </para>

                                <para>- About  600  yards. In an opposite direction from the hospital, mails are delivered by the Postal Department to Chinese and others, who, although, they are within the postal boundary, are actually further from the post-office itself than is the hospital. This position is aggravated by the fact that to deliver mails to these Chinese and other residents, a road has to be traversed which is at any time bad, and in winter is almost impassable, whereas the road leading to the hospital is an excellent gravel construction practically to the doors of the institution. Altogether, I emphasize that this is a case where an exception should be made to the general practice of the Post and Telegraph Department. There are several other hospitals in New South Wales to which practically the same facts are applicable. Honorable members know &#39; that it has been the practice, wherever possible, to build hospitals at a reasonable distance from the centre of a town. This hospital is in a very nice situation, but simply because it is outside the postal area the mails cannot be delivered to it. It is time that the Department made an exception in this case. If it did so it would give satisfaction to everybody, and would be put to no additional expense. The staff at the hospital numbers ten, including the matron and a domestic staff of four, and there is a daily average of twenty patients. The case warrants further investigation by the Department, which, I hope, will decide to deliver the mails at the hospital. </para>

                            <para>.- 1  am interested in this matter, because for two years I was a member of the hospital committee. &#39; This grievance was constantly before the committee, and has been the subject of negotiation with the Postal Department for a long time. I agree with everything said by the honor able member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle)</inline> except his estimate of the distance of the hospital from the postal boundary. I should say .that the distance is not more than  300  yards. The postal authorities might very well take a generous view of this case. The delivery of mails to the hospital would entail at the most&#39; twenty minutes of the letter carrier&#39;s time in travelling beyond the postal boundary. I hope that the Postal Department will eventually see the reasonableness of this claim. </para>

                                <para>- I think that the last house on the hospital road is within the postal area. All that would be entailed by the granting of this request would be that the letter carrier would have to walk  300  or  400  yards beyond the boundary in order to deliver mails to the hospital; then he would return direct to the post office. Even if the distance be  600  yards, as stated by the honorable member for Calare, I still strongly support the claim. </para>

                            <para>. -  I again direct the attention of the Defence Department to the neglect of soldiers&#39; graves in some Australian cemeteries. A little time ago I asked whether something could not be done to show the same respect to the soldier buried in his own country as is being shown to those who fell on foreign battlefields. I cannot but feel that the matter has not been presented to the Department as clearly as it should be, otherwise some definite action would have been taken. Recently I was asked by a committee that has been connected with the celebration of Anzac Day to visit a big metropolitan cemetery to see what has been done there. The committee showed me a number of graves that were entirely unmarked. They told me that when they first interested themselves in this matter some graves were being walked over by the general public because there was nothing to indicate that anybody was buried there. They showed me some that, owing to the kindness of the cemetery authorities, had been decently turfed, but were still unmarked. In one very pathetic case the widow of a deceased soldier had placed upon the grave some little mark bearing  his name, but because it &#34;was not in accordance with the cemetery regulations it was removed; and the grave is still unmarked. Amongst the graves shown to me was one of a soldier who died a few days after having taken part in the landing at&#39; Gallipoli. I claim that these soldiers are entitled to the same mark of respect from the Department that the Australian people  approve  of being shown to the soldiers buried overseas. I am informed that these are not exceptional cases, and as -the years go by there will be increasing difficulty in identifying the graves. Therefore, the matter is urgent, and should be attended to forthwith. I dope that my remarks will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Defence, and that either the Department itself will undertake to erect some mark over the graves of soldiers buried in Australia, or, alternatively, that those who will undertake the supervision of the work shall be provided with the same design of cross or memorial as is being used on the graves of soldiers buried abroad. I urge that the same memorial be used in Australia as overseas, so that all graves thus marked by the Government shall bear the one form of recognition. </para>

                        <para>.- In the first place I desire to put myself right in respect of an interjection I made yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was speaking. I said that the Bill would practically do away with the Arbitration Court. What I meant was, that the machinery provided by this Bil&#93;, being so much better than that of the Arbitration Court, would be used so frequently that the Arbitration Court itself would fall into disuse. The Leader of the Opposition seemed to think that I suggested that this Bill would wipe the Court out of legal existence. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill does in a way provide means for the variation of an award, but that is not to destroy the Court, which will still exist. I. mention this, because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> seemed to think that, in my opinion, the Bill would wipe out the Court itself. However, I am sure this measure has not been introduced too soon. I do not look on it as by any means a panacea for industrial unrest, but it is a step in the right direction; and if I cannot get exactly what I desire from the Government, I must be satisfied with what is offered. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not; I take the best I can get at the present time, and I regard the Bill, I say, as a move in the direction in which some good can be  achieved. No one can deny the serious position that industrial affairs have reached, not only in the Commonwealth,  but  all over the world. The position is not improving, but getting worse; the ill-feeling between the employing and employed sections of the community is becoming more intense and bitter, and if something is not done to effect a cure, I am afraid that the whole social fabric is in danger of being destroyed. </para>

All they desire is a fair chance - to be in a position where they can feel they are getting fair treatment, and a just share of the product of their labour. The loss of money in wages in Australia during the last few years through numerous strikes - a loss that can never be made up - is another fact that shows the time has arrived when some serious step should be taken to find a remedy. </para>

                    <para>I do not know that the Bill could go much further than it does, seeing the constitutional limits imposed on this Parliament in  matters  industrial. I should have liked to see some attempt made to recognise that great and most important section of the community, the general public, who are so seriously affected by strikes. As industrial affairs have developed of latte years we find three parties concerned - the employers, the employees, and the general public - the last of whom suffer indirectly from strikes more than, perhaps, do the main parties to the disputes. It is the public who have to find the money for carrying on the proposed tribunals, which we all hone are going to improve matters; and in devising machinery to avert these industrial conflicts the general public must be contemplated. A strike in the coal-mining trade in a little time paralyses the whole community by practically stopping all work; and, as I say, the public must be more considered than they have been in the past when legislation of this kind is under discussion. Why are so many people in the community anxious to go on strike <inline font-style="italic">t</inline></para>

                            <para>- I have heard various reasons advanced, some of which, I suppose, are correct. Some honorable members assert that industrial unrest is chiefly caused by the high cost of living; and I think there is a good deal in that idea. During the last fifteen years or so wages have been raised considerably, but the cost of living has risen in a greater ratio. A workman may receive much more money for his week&#39;s work than he did ten or twelve years ago, but he finds that, owing to the increase in prices, he is now really worse off. That, to my mind, is a very serious position, which must lead the worker to believe that his prospects are anything but what they should be; he feels, not only that he is being debarred from the good things of life, but, what, perhaps, hurts him much more, that he is not in a position to do what he would desire for his growing family. If we can remedy that state of affairs we shall have done a great deal. </para>

                            <para>- We have tried price fixing and other devices, but they do not seem to work with much success. We have been asked by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to treat this Bill in a non-party spirit, and I hope honorable members will accept that invitation. We may look, I think, for some valuable suggestions from honorable members opposite for improving this measure, seeing that amongst them are many representatives of Labour organizations, who have spent much of their lives studying these industrial problems, from one point of view, at any rate, if not from all. Such members may be able to propose amendments to clauses which, in their opinion, are not far-reaching enough; and all such suggestions will, I have no doubt, receive fair consideration from the Government and from members generally on this side. Our object is to provide a measure that will keep the wheels of industry going round, so that production, which is now so necessary, may be pushed to its furthest legitimate limits. I can understand people going on strike for some big. principle, but I cannot understand the stoppage of work for causes which of late years have underlain a great many- of these conflicts.&#39; An industry provides a man and his family with his bread and butter and the employers with the means of subsistence; and to cease production is to &#34;kill the goose with the golden egg&#34; for all concerned. One cause of the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to be found in the fact that the machinery of arbitration cannot be set going until a position is created that practically amounts to a strike, and I do not. know why provision has not long since been made whereby a notification of a claim may be submitted for adjudication, work being allowed to proceed in the meantime without interruption, and the award when delivered being made retrospective to the date of the submission of. the claim. Such a provision would have saved the workers millions of pounds in the shape of wages, a loss which they will never be able to overtake. The Bill does not actually abolish the Arbitration Court, but so far as I am concerned, that tribunal could cease to exist to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- The.- Government do not see fit to&#187; go- as- far as-- 1, would go, but they are not- doing anything imdteThaaid. In Australia! we- have tried Arbitration Courts, and- Wages Boards, and ir <inline font-style="italic">i&#38;&#62;</inline> clear that the latter: have proved1 far more effective iu? settling industrial disputes; This Bill, follows somewhat on the lines of Wages Boards, and, as I far as. the Constitution, permits, on. the. lines! of the- Whitley councils,, which&#34; have- done so- much good, in Great. Britain;. _ Our Arbitration, Court does  not provide facilities for the parties ta come together, and. reason with one.- another in order, to arrive, at- a wise decision! in regard, to the matter.- in. dispute. They are treated as- are the litigants in. an. ordinary Court, of law,, and kept at arm&#39;s, length. Advocates appear on. either side,, and work hard&#39; for- the interests of their, respective clients. A professional, man. presides, and deal&#39;s with matters that any ordinary business man- could handle just as; well. He is not called: upon, to deal&#39; with, questions of law, but has to ascertain what -is the fairest thing to do in a certain industry. There really is no necessity for appointing a Judge to do this work. In any case, a great deal of time is- wasted in the. endeavour to acquaint him with the details- of the industry, whose conditions are- the subject of investigation. The parties to a disprajie who- are all drawing their subsistence from the industry in question ought&#34; to be &#34;best fitted to arrive at a decision as; to&#62; the. most workable- arrangement for. carrying on the industry. When <inline font-style="italic">tkm</inline> cards  are   laid, on, the. table, before a. Boaasdi such! as is. proposed&#39;, in. the: BiH&#39;,. both parties, will&#39;, have, common sense as. human beings: to. recognise what is the. best working arrangement to suit, the- interests of the industry,, and&#39;, what, suits, the, best, interests, of the industry is. what will best. suit, both parties. The Arbitration- Court does not), provide facilities for arriving at. a. mutual agreement; on the other hand, a Tot of time&#39;, and&#39; money <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> wasted in doing- something, else which has no relative&#39; bearing on, the crux of the question..  Our  constitutional&#39; limitations prevent us- from- arriving at&#34; as- satisfactory a- position, as- has  Been reached! in Great Britann by the&#39; establishment of Whitley councils-, but- if we&#39; enjoyed; the- same- free- scope in the-  matter of d&#39;ealin&#39;g with industrial affairs&#39; which the Imperial Government has, we1 could! do here what- is now being- done ins the Old: Country. However,  wet  shall&#39; make, a. good! beginning bv- passing this. Bill.. Provision, is made* for: a Commonwealth Council) and District Councils&#39; in-, each State, composed of an equal&#39; number of: employers; and. employees in. any industry which-, is thei subject- of:  ai  dispute.. The chairman  of each, council, is to be appointed by the Governor-General;; but, if the arrangement provided; for. in the Bill is not. satisf actory to- the members of thai Labour-party,, the. Government: maybe prepared to accept an amendment which will enable.&#39; the: councils! to choose) their own chairmen-. To- that I can sees no objection.. The: councils will be empowered&#39; to- go thoroughly into&#34; the- questions involved in a dispute. They may inquire into1 all&#34; industrial matters} and;,  as I  will be seen- by glancing- at the definition of &#34; industrial matters,&#34; that term&#39; has a very wide meaning: </para>

The honorable member: for Hunter.- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> told us last night that the coal miners think that, at the present prices of coal, they should be better paid. Under the definition of industrial matters to which I have referred, an inquiry could be held on that subject. But I am so convinced of the importance of putting an end to industrial unrest that, if there is any doubt about the matter, I shall be willing to support an amendment that will give the necessary power, and I think many other members on this side would do the same. Anything that would tighten up the measure will be well received, at least so far as I am concerned. </para>

                            <para>- There is always an element of fallibility in human judgment. In this debate there has been a great amount of imagining of evil on the part of honorable members opposite, but none of them has put his finger on any definite defect. Apparently, being unable to say anything against the Bill, they have talked away from it, evading the issue. I do not preach to other honorable members on the subject of their duties, but I do not see why the leader of the Opposition and his followers, who profess to be the representatives of the great Labour organizations, should be so anxious to hear what the Trades Halls and other bodies think of the Bill. They, being representatives of Labour in the Parliament, ought to state their own opinions concerning it. I am satisfied that in their hearts they are in accord with the measure. They have been invited to treat it as a non-party measure. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see the force of suggestions that this Bill entails danger to organized labour. &#39; Labour is fairly well organized to-day. I cannot see where this measure is likely to provide an opportunity for a bogus organization to secure representation upon a tribunal and so displace a genuine union. Why should there be such a suspicion? Suppose that some body of employers attempted to secure the appointment upon a tribunal of representatives of employees some of whom were not members of a properly registered labour organization. What would be the use of any decision given by such a tribunal <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Nothing would be gained. Unless an award meets with the concurrence of and satisfies the great body of employees concerned - who would be trade unionists in every instance - the result will be <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> More harm than good will be done. I cannot perceive the danger, but if the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> can suggest some safeguard, can propose an improvement to the Bill which would, actually tend towards the settlement of industrial unrest, then that would be a matter of such consequence that honorable members generally would feel bound to go a long way in the direction of supporting him. By the establishment of advisory councils, which would present recommendations to special tribunals, which, in their turn, would make awards, a very much more speedy settlement of trouble should be secured than by the present method of approaching the Arbitration Court. Under the provisions of this Bill the parties engaged in various industries will meet around a table, man to man. It stands to reason that any decision arrived at by such a process will afford greater satisfaction and last longer than an- award of the Arbitration Court. If it could only be instilled into the minds of the workers that an award given by a tribunal appointed under this measure must &#39;be the fairest thing to all sides - being the outcome of a round-table conference - I feel sure that 90 per cent, of employees would be content. The workers to-day a~&#187; not unreasonable, in the main; they do not look for miracles. These round-table conferences, at -which the workers will be directly represented, should afford employees generally an excellent opportunity of getting into touch, not merely with their own troubles and grievances, but with the difficulties of their employers. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I take the view that, in the light of a recent decision from the Chair, discussion upon this Bill is disorderly. There is already a Federal Statute which deals with the subject of industrial unrest. The Federal Arbitration Court is an outcome of that Statute. There are more than forty cases now awaiting settlement by the Arbitration Court; and these are <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> AH the causes of industrial unrest which will have the attention of the Court in its consideration of those forty cases are being actually ventilated in this Chamber throughout the present debate. I am of opinion that it is not in order to introduce a Bill dealing with the subject of industrial unrest while the whole matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> The recent decision of the Chair to which I have just alluded had to do with the Jerger case. </para>

I regard the present discussion as being out of order, .for the reason that there is already an Act of Parliament in force for the prevention of industrial disputes. Yet you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> are permitting the debate to proceed, despite the fact that there are more than forty cases before the Arbitration Court involving industrial unrest, which are at present <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

The trouble is so deep-seated that the measure is not likely to reach down to its roots. Human nature, with all its faults, is involved. Unless we can change the hearts of the people I do not see that legislation will achieve much. </para>

                            <para>- The only chance I see of effecting a radical, and, therefore, sufficient change, would be to bring in some system of co-operation, profit-sharing, or co-partnership. Under the Constitution I doubt whether the Federal Parliament could to-day take steps in that direction ; but the State Parliaments could do much to inaugurate such a system. Until the working man can be made to feel that he is getting a fair proportion of the product of his labour I do not see that there can be any real cure for industrial unrest. The trouble with many people is that they hold the view that the workers should have all the profits. </para>

                            <para>- If individual cases are to be examined it will be found that there are some workers who will secure mighty little as their share. The man who is engaged in a &#34; go-slow &#34; policy will reap small benefit. However, there is a reasonable course which might be followed. If a system were inaugurated whereby the workers received a proper wage and a fair share of surplus profits from an industry there would be a different state of affairs. Employees would find it to their interest to make the industry in which they were engaged a paying one. They would not tolerate, waste or loafing, for example. They would put their brains as well as their hands into the task of making the industry prosperous, for the reason that the more profitable the business became the greater would be the sum divided. If employees could be persuaded to take up shares in an industry, instead of requiring all cash payment for their services, there would be many more workers in the land who would be conscious of the rights of both sides. They would not take long to learn the difficulties of management, as well as the troubles of wage-earning. In time to come there should be no reason why the workers themselves, by making a beginning along the line of securing shares in an industry, should, not qualify to become directors. They would accumulate so many shares that they would become directors, and men of natural ability and practical experience who had worked their way up from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest would be valuable colleagues for the men who supplied the brains required   in connexion with the distribution of products and the general management of industry. Only when every man is doing his best for the industry in which he is engaged, because he is getting a fair share of what he produces, as nearly as human agency can estimate it, shall we get a contented community. That is a natural policy to adopt. It is in accordance with the teachings of the best political economists; they have pointed out that a certain amount of selfishness is the mainspring of economic action. But there can be enlightened selfishness as well as sordid selfishness. The men who invest their capital in industries do so not for philanthropic motives, but in order to win some reward;but by the success of their efforts they also benefit the community. If we can develop some system of co-operation, such as I have suggested, we shall have discovered a cure for industrial unrest. </para>

                    <para>Our trouble is that this Parliament is limited in its legislative scope. The State Parliaments are not, and the question arises whether it would be wise for this Parliament to have all the industrial power or whether any of it should be left to the States. If it could be shown that with complete industrial authority in the hands of this Parliament awards could be made elastic enough to meet the varying conditions of living and output in different portions of Australia, I would prefer that the whole of the industrial power should be handed over to a central authority. But the States could never agree to any concentration of power which would result in a common rule so rigid that the one wage would apply throughout the Commonwealth in the same industry, regardless of local conditions. I should not care if the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were abolished tomorrow, and all industrial matters were handed over to the control oftheStates. The only difficulty in the way of that course would : be in connexion with maritime, coal mining, and shearing disputes, which extend allover the Common wealth. If we could devise an efficient means of dealing with those industries I would not object iftheCommonwealth Arbitration Court disappeared, but Believe it would be best in the interests of the community to enlarge the industrial powers of this Parliament, provided that we can arrange that awards shall show fair consideration for the peculiar conditions of different </para>

It will bring the parties together in a way which is not possible in the Arbitration Court. They may discuss their troubles as man to man, and I believe that common sense and fair play will prevail. I am sorry to notice the lack of confidence in their fellow-man displayed by some honorable members. They do not trust him to do the right thing in any circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- The worker will not be getting the worst end of the stick under this Bill; both parties will have equal representation. Iamsatisfied that if the employees and the employers were left alone toad just their own differences, 90 per cent. of the industrial disputes that drag on for months, and cause all sorts of suffering to the community,, would be avoided. The disputes are mainly in relation to wages and working conditions in industries., and the men who actually live in and by those industries know more about the conditions than can any judicial tribunal. The present system of having to inform a man on the Bench of conditions of which the parties are fully cognisant, and then relying upon him to give judgment in the dispute, isa hideous waste of time and money. If the disputants are brought together at a Conference a lot of the ignorance and distrust which are fostered by persons who preach class consciousness will  be  abolished. Why in a democratic country like Australia there should bean attempt to raise class consciousness passes my comprehension. The Bill will go a long way towards eliminating the vicious influences which are operating in society to-day, and therefore I have pleasure in supporting it. </para>

Those who are responsible for the introduction of the measure are in much the same condition as were the people of whom the prophet Jeremiah spoke, &#34; They have healed also the hurt of my people lightly, saying peace, peace, when there is no peace.&#34; That is the state of affairs not only in Australia, but in every industrial country in the world to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may say. that, but when he talks about evolutionary processes he must know that revolution is merely the culminating point of evolution. Honorable members are aware that the. complete revolutionizing of the system of wealth production, owing to the growth of the factory system, has accomplished a revolution in the world&#39;s production. To-day the industrial evolution is still in process, and because it does not stop, and because of the failure of society to adjust itself, to the changed methods of produce tion, we have industrial unrest. This Bill proposes nothing more than a glorified system of Wages Boards. </para>

I have no fault to find, and I never had, with the brain-worker or the manual labourer. All those who contribute to the wealth of society by brains or muscle are workers, whether they be managers or &#34; pick-and-shovel &#39;&#39; men. Other honorable members, with the honorable member for Wilmot, in approaching a question of this kind ask, &#34;How can a Judge, who knows nothing about the industry concerned, or the working conditions, and so forth, be able to determine the questions placed before him ? &#34; The honorable member for Wilmot practically held up such a Judge to ridicule, and as incompetent to decide regarding working conditions in any dispute. I agree with the honorable m&#39;ember that a Judge of the Arbitration Court, or any other individual who has no experience of the conditions under which men and women work, whether in the mines, factories, or fields, is incompetent to judge in such matters. Whether we call it an Arbitration Court, a Wages Board, a tribunal, or by any other name, it amounts to the same thing; there are so many representatives of the employers, and so many representatives of the employees, and then the gentleman, whether be-wigged or not, who knows no thing about the working conditions, and does not want to have any closer acquaintance with them, tries to strike the happy medium. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and always in favour of the employer. Honorable members talk about equal representation, but there never has been equal representation, so far as the employees are concerned, on any Board or in any Arbitration Court. By his social position and environment, the  chairman  of such a tribunal is, consciously or unconsciously, biased on the side of the employers, and not on the side of the employees. </para>

                            <para>- It is just what the honorable member has done. The honorable member talked about his having studied political economists, whom he lauded, and then showed that the whole science of economics has been wasted on him, for he spoke of the wickedness of talking about the class struggle or class consciousness. The merest political tyro recognises that the interests of the employer and the employed, however much we may camouflage the fact, can never be in common. </para>

When the railways were taken over by the British Government during the war, the taxpayer was loaded up with &#163;2,000,000 in order to make up the deficit in the railway dividends; but now the employees have obtained a 50 per cent. share in the management of the railways! </para>

                            <para>- I cannot help it if the honorable member is unable to grasp the point. I am showing that the workers to-day are making use of both their industrial organization and their political organization; and the goal they are aiming at is the control of the factory, the workshop, the mine, and every other source of wealth, in order to democratize them. They do not wish to live, at the present day, in a state akin to the serfdom of feudalism, under which men were tied to the land. To-day in most countries the worker is just as much tied to the factory, the workshop, and the mine as was his fellow-worker tied to the land in the feudal times. It is true that to-day the worker does not wear his master&#39;s collar, but if some honorable members opposite had their way he would wear it. </para>

                            <para>- No; there is a suspension of activities at present because the Broken Hill people have determined that the right of the employer to poison men in five years with lead is out of date in a place like Australia-; they have decided that they will no longer allow their children to suffer, as the Commonwealth Sta&#39;tistician has proved they do suffer, by showing that the infantile death-rate at that place is greater than in other centres of population in the Commonwealth. That death rate, according to the medical testimony, is directly traceable to parents working in the lead industry ; and that is one reason why they decline to allow the employers the right to send them to the cemetery at express speed. Any honorable member can make himself acquainted with the facts if he studies the cases put forward by the men&#39;s representatives from time to time. However, that is beside the question, and only said in reply to the interjections of the honorable member for Grampians. The fact remains that in no country in the world can there be industrial peace while the existing system continues. The&#39; workers are organizing, consciously and definitely, for the purpose of socializing industry on the ground that wealth socially produced should be socially owned. It is useless to try to &#34;side-track&#34; the workers by </para>

Working -men and women who hold the same views as&#39; myself - and they are &#39;an increasing num&#39;ber in this country, as well as in other countries - : claim that it is not possible to have industrial rest while the present system &#39;of society exists, with its &#39;Ibwo &#39;conflicting, sections constantly warring with -one another. In  fact, &#34;they . claim that it is a system which only serves, to &#39;breed unrest. Honorable members point out that these Boards proposed to &#39;be created will have independent chairmen, who, &#39;as a rule, T suppose, will know absolutely nothing about the particular industries whose conditions the Boards are investigating; hut even if they should he &#39;fully &#39;acquainted with &#34;the details of these industries, the fact still remains that working men : and women will be db&#39;liged to parade &#34;their poverty before these tribunals and be catechized as to how much food they consume, what clothes they wear, what newspapers &#34;they read, and how much tobacco, and what not they consume. If this &#39;is a non-party -measure, why is the same method not applied &#39;to -the &#39;bosses ? </para>

                    <para>Mr.CONSIDINE.- The whole system of arbitration is not a non-party matter. The <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi</inline> by which the working classes may approach . a Court -or &#39;a Board to &#39;get a sufficient &#39;wage on -which to exist lays it down that the working men and their &#34;women folk must he prepared to he catechized in the way I have described, but those who &#39;lay &#39;down this method do not think of submitting &#34;the employers to : a similar catechism. No one suggests that Iffr. Delprat should he put into the witness-box and asked to disclose the profits that accrue to him from the Broken Hill mining companies, or how &#34;he spends his money, or &#39;whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. &#39;Delprat</inline> could -do with a &#39;few less dresses or a few less motor, cars. But ali these intimate: questions are put to people- belonging: to the working/ classes. As a matter of fact,, some  of the- questions asked before a New South Wales. Wages  Board  are on the border-line of indecency. Yet honorable members- say that this is not a&#62; class matter! Of course it is a  class  matter. All this&#39; legislation emanates from one class, and is designed to protect that class. Such catechism as I have indicated is- only imposed on the &#34; under-dog.&#34; It is those, who control society to-day who determine how the other- class may approach the Courts and who&#39; lay down the procedure to be observed in those Courts. I shall never recommend the working classes of this country to degrade themselves in the Arbitration Court or before Wages Boards by allowing themselves to be weighed as so many machines, so that an estimate may be made as to how much coal and oil, as it were, is necessary to keep them, in good condition in order to make them available for further production. Honorable members have talked about varying awards in different parts of the Commonwealth. They say that an award may be made in Tasmania which may differ from an. award made in, Queensland, but on what, basis will these awards, be made? How will the wages in one State differ from those in another? I suppose the difference will be based, <inline font-style="italic">on the</inline> cost of living. But the working classes of this country will refuse to- allow themselves any longer to- be weighed on the basis- of how much it will cost, to. keep an average family going in good, order and condition, so that the members of it may turn up at work on Monday morning, and continue at. work until midday on- Saturday, with probably a little extra thrown in in order to secure the continuation of the species, and&#39; insure that the- future employer- will not go short of labour. </para>

                            <para>- The wage is not determined by those who  have to  live 6n it, but by a man who is receiving about &#163;2,500 per year, and has not the  slightest  intention of living under basic wage conditions. When it is a question&#39; of &#39;giving a pension to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith or &#34;some other person, who has occupied a prominent position in this country, no attempt is made to. ask questions on the basis of how little a man can exist on ; no, attempt is made to fix the. pension on the, basis of a living wage. Yet a living wage is considered good enough for the working classes, and personally I consider it is good enough for them so long as they are content, to put up with it. Some honorable members talk a great deal about the agitator. They say that he is a vicious individual who goes about stirring up. industrial unrest, strife, and discord  among various sections of the  community  But how on. earth any person, be he  even  so fluent or desirous of stirring- up discord!, can stir- up trouble among people  who have no grievances.

                    <para class="block">The whole course of human history has proved the truth qf those words. Industrial evolution, in common with social evolution, has shown that it is from the discontented men the world&#39;s progress has sprung, and we have industrial unrest to-day because of the discontent of the working classes with the existing social system. The process through which society is now going is merely the birth pangs of the new social order. The world is in a process of reconstruction, and the sooner men and women who claim to represent the various shades of thought and different interests in the community recognise that it is useless to tinker about with such trivial matters as Bills of this description and realize that a change is coining, whether they like it or not, the better it will be for the world at large. It rests with the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> and others like him, whether the change is to be brought about by force or not, or whether recognising that it will come they will facilitate its arrival in order to involve the community in as little trouble as possible. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows full well that I am striving to remove the causes of industrial unrest. Because I realize that these causes are inherent in the existing economic system, I am advocating the alteration of that system, and I am advising the workers of this country to take over the means of wealth production and utilize them for the good of the community at large. I would put the honorable member and his friends on exactly the same level in society as the workers, to produce co-operatively for the good of society as a whole. When society reconstructs itself on the basis of the socialization of industry, then, and then only, will the causes of industrial unrest vanish. Honorable members talk about the third party to industrial disputes, saying that the public as a third party ought to have its interests considered. Who is the third party to a dispute to-day ? If the miners are on strike the parties to the dispute are on the one hand the miners, plus the public, consisting of the rest of the workers in the community, and on the other hand the employers. It is absurd to talk about having a third party to a dispute. There are only two parties in society, the employers and the employed, the exploiters and the exploited, and while these two parties remain in existence social unrest must continue. </para>

                        <para>.- We are discussing a motion for the second reading of a Bill for securing industrial peace; but the honorable member for the Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has made it painfully clear that, no matter what our efforts may be, no matter what provision we may place upon the statute-book, there will not be industrial peace, so far as he is concerned - and I suppose there are many who think with him - until the whole of the economic conditions of the world have been changed, and our present social system is destroyed. If that were so, no legislation, however mature, could hope to be effective, and we should be wasting our time in discussing the Bill. Our experience of the Commonwealth arbitration laws, it seems to me - and there are many thinking people of the same opinion  -  is that they have not been a success. When arbitration was first proposed in Australia, we were told that it would bring about industrial peace, because it would provide an opportunity for the parties to disputes to come together, and by arbitration avert strikes; but that has not been the result. In the administration of the Commonwealth arbitration laws many constitutional difficulties have arisen, and the trouble thus caused has been accentuated by the endeavour to bring before the Federal Arbitration Court disputes which could not be said, except by a great stretch of imagination, to extend beyond the limits of a State. Notwithstanding that there have been arbitration courts in most of the States, created by State legislation, the industrialists have insisted on going to the Federal Arbitration Court, which has been more expensive and more difficult to approach than any of the State courts. When the Labour party was in power in Western Australia, it set up what it declared to be the best Arbitration Court in the  world, and it was satisfied that a panacea for industrial troubles had  been  found. Yet the industrialists of that State, following the example of those of Queensland and other States, have endeavoured to drag their cases before the Federal Arbitration Court. This has made for expense, and has caused a considerable over-lapping of jurisdiction between the Federal, and State Courts. </para>

                            <para>- The processes of the Federal Arbitration Court were soon found to be burdensome, and there was considerable delay in obtaining decisions from it. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has told us that in some instances the bringing of cases before the Federal Court has meant that hundreds of employees throughout the Commonwealth  have had to be served with summonses, and he cited the <inline font-style="italic">Builders&#39; Labourers</inline> case as a glaring example of how far this evil went. I know that when the <inline font-style="italic">Wharf Labourers</inline> case was before the Court witnesses were brought from every part of Australia, with the result that the costs of one party to the dispute came to over &#163;20,000. Of course, it is the public which in the long run has to pay for this expensive litigation. In my opinion, the Bill will accentuate the constitutional difficulties. It is provided that- </para>

                        <para>This Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power. </para>

                    <para>That provision reads like an invitation to disputants to bring cases which might be heard by a State Court before the Federal Court. I do not like the Bill. One feature of it which seems to me bad is the introduction of political influence. For example, the chairmen of the boards are to be appointed by the Governor-General, which means the Government of the day. I have no sympathy with that provision. In my opinion, all the tribunals established for the settlement of industrial disputes should be placed as far as possible outside the political arena. </para>

                            <para>- But the first &#171;are of the Minister is to please Parliament and the public. I hope that in Committee the Bill will bc amended in such a way that these appointments shall not be political. Nearly two years ago we were promised an amendment of the arbitration law which, as was then patent to all, had been largely a failure. Arbitration has done some good, but to my mind the Court, as constituted, is largely responsible for the industrial discontent of the day. I am a believer in an Arbitration Court constituted on the lines of the Wages Board system, and I am glad that honorable members opposite are beginning to think with me on that matter. </para>

                            <para>- The Wages Board system, has always appealed to me. I think that the chairmen of such Boards should be appointed by a Court rather than by a Government. Although an Arbitration Act was in force in Western Australia, there was not until some few years ago an appeal to the Court by the miners of Kalgoorlie, because industrial agreements had been made between them and the mine-owners, and had been registered in the Court as industrial agreements between worker and employer. </para>

                            <para>- The United States Government has at various times sent Commissioners throughout the world to inquire into and report on social economic, and industrial matters. Ten or twelve years ago a Special Commissioner was sent to Great Britain and to. Germany.. His report contained a long account of the industrial conditions prevailing among, the miners of Durham. It was pointed out that,, although there was no law regulating those conditions, a central council had been formed, on which there was an equal number of employers and employees, and that there were similarly constituted district councils. A dispute was referred in the first instance to a district council, and matters on which the district council could not agree were referred to the central council. If the central council could not agree, its points of difference were referred to a Justice of the High Court of England, who was specially appointed by those connected with the mining industry of Durham, and on every occasion his decision was accepted; so that there had not been a strike or lockout in the industry for over twenty years. I think that the Durham system was the basis of the Wages Board system of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- The system I have been describing was being followed fifteen years before. The Prime Minister said the public were not concerned with names but with things, not with shadows but with realities. It is with that fact in view that I wish to speak to-day, for I want to deal with realities. It is my intention to move, later, to the effect that this Bill shall have a life of only twelve months. At the conclusion of that period Parliament should be in a position to review the Act in. order to ascertain how it. has. worked ; and, if it is concluded that the Statute has not proved effective, honorable members should demand an amendment of the Arbitration Act - which, in any case, is absolutely essential. I cannot understand why there has not been a conference between the employers and employees. I believe the Prime Minister has done his best to get the parties to come together. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so.. I merely remind honorable members of the criticism. I am pleased that so many honorable members, including the Prime Minister himself, who for years have been voicing their belief in the Arbitration Court, are now coming round to a belief in the method of round-table conferences - in other words, the Wages Boards system. That is what the Prime Minister now believes in; but it is not what he advocated some years ago. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. I have studied the measure carefully, and I feel dubious of its outcome. I do not see how it is going to help. It may possibly enable certain present difficulties to be overcome, but I have no sympathy with methods recently adopted by the Government in connexion with industrial disputes, and I do not like legislation being brought forward which does not attempt to redress an admittedly bad Act. I do not think it behoves the Government to interfere except by way of taking legislative action, in any industrial matter. I object to the Government appointing boards and tribunals to deal with industrial troubles as they arise. It should not be forgotten that everything done in this direction creates a precedent; and goodness knows what the result of these precedents may be under another Administration . </para>

These things have been patent to the Prime Minister for the last two years; and the action he took on those occasions has accentuated industrial unrest. What we have to consider is whether it is wise to try to bolster up the Arbitration Act in this way, or whether it would not be better to bring forward an amending measure giving the Court different powers and a wider scope. I favour a review of the Arbitration Act; I know that it has been a failure. No matter who is appointed President it will be impossible for him to grasp the conditions obtaining in industries throughout the Commonwealth. A Judge sitting on the Bench knows nothing about an industry, and has to base his award on the evidence submitted to him. Each side has special paid organizers collecting the evidence for -two or three years in advance of the hearing of a claim, and each case costs the country an <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> enormous amount of money, because the costs -of each, hearing are passed on to the people. As the Judge has to rely entirely upon the evidence he hears, those &#34;who swear the hardest and strongest get the best deal. </para>

                        <para>.- There is no immediate hurry for &#39;this Bill. Had the proper course been pursued the Government would have given the industrialists an opportunity to thoroughly study the Bill and suggest the amendments which they think desirable. As that has nott been done, we must make the best we can of the measure. No Bill can be framed that will assure- industrial peace. Various attempts to do so have failed. The Federal Arbitration Court has given justice in many cases, but it has never created that industrial peace for which the community longs. The State Wages Boards have similarly failed. No legislation that does not assure to the workers the full result of their labour will produce industrial peace. Only when the workers are given that reward shall we have continuity of employment, industrial peace, and, perhaps, a better state of society. One of the first steps to be taken is an investigation of the causes of industrial unrest, in order to discover the defects of the present economic system. Give the worker sufficient food and clothing and good environment and there will be no industrial strife. </para>

                            <para>- The worker himself. The man who produces an article should be entitled to, if not the whole, at least a fair proportion of it. This Bill does not assure the worker a fair proportion of the result of his labour; it assures him nothing. It leaves him in practically the same position as he is in under the Arbitration Act and Wages Board system. The one improvement that this Bill proposes to make is that the cases, may be heard more speedily than at present. That is certainly some advantage. I am not condemning the Bill entirely, but I wish to point out the weaknesses in ,it. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> said that the provisions of this Bill would be no menace to organized labour. The measure does attack organized labour, because it gives the same privileges to the non-unionist as to the unionist. That is clear from the definition clause, which speaks of persons &#34;being or not being members of any organization, association, or body.&#34; The Bill gives the same privileges  to the man who is commonly  known  as a &#34;scab&#34; as to the man who is continually contributing to the upkeep of an industrial organization. </para>

                    <para>Mr.NICHOLLS.-It may be, but it is also very logical. Wo provision : at sail should be made for the &#34;scab.&#34; Xf a man is too miserable to contribute to the upkeep of &#39;an organization, let him go away ito ; a . country where  unionism does not -exist. There -are men who have ; a  great  dislike for labour organizations, and who think they can get a better ideal from the employer by &#39;not joining any union. The Government have no right to &#39;make any provision for . such a man. Unionism (has &#39;received legislative recognition. The Prime Minister realizes that it has come to stay, and that it is . a legitimate &#39;organization that should be fostered. Holding  those views, he  cannot at the same time logically -make provision for the non-unionist and (encourage bogus organizations. &#39;But &#39;.the Bill . gives the &#34; scab &#34; and the bogus organizations everything they desire. That is one of my objections to it. </para>

I submit that in ninety-nine cases out o&#39;f a hundred the employee, and not the employer, is the victim., but the employee has always &#39;had to pay the penalty, while the employer has been let off &#34;scot free.&#34; &#39;This state of affairs has -certainly made for the. benefit of the employer, -who could well &#39;afford %o . pay &#163;50 or &#163;100 in  case of a breach of &#39;any regulations, whereas the employee, in the vast majority of cases, could &#39;not afford &#34;to meet : a penalty which to  him was ten times heavier than any . that . could be imposed on . the ^employer.

                            <para>- Yes; but while, it has been stated that this is not a party measure,, I. venture to say we shall find honorable members opposite voting against any amendment proposed by the Opposition. I am particularly pleased that it is sought to make this a non-party question, because if ever there was a time in history when useful industrial legislation was necessary it is to-day, and the only effective way to afford some relief is to keep the whole matter free from party influence. Otherwise, it will simply mean that whatever the Government desire to provide in t the Bill will be inserted, whereas if we are- free to vote according to our conscience, there is a possibility of doing some good. At the same time, no matter- what legislation we introduce, there can be no guarantee of industrial peace in the present state- of society. If we could limit profits we would have a better chance of improving- matters, bus if we allow the employer to exploit his employees as in the past, there is no hope of improvement. </para>

                    <para>As to the appointment of the chairmen of the proposed bodies, while I have no desire to- cast any reflection on the Governor-General, we cannot fail to see that those appointed will- be men whose ideas are identical with those of the Government of the: day. If a  chairman  should be appointed whose sympathies&#39; were with the worker,, and who gave him a. better deal than the Government approved, his tenure of office,. I predict, would not be a long one; These appointments ought not to be. made by the- Governor-General, and in any case they should be filled by men with a thorough knowledge of the working conditions,, and otherwise practically acquainted with, the industry. I have a strong objection to any man being appointed to adjudicate unless he possesses those very necessary qualifications. Judges have, been appointed to Arbitration Courts who were ignorant of the actual conditions of the workers, with the result in many cases that they have, confined themselves to an investigation, as to the least amount the worker could possibly live; on,, and have decided accordingly. I sincerely hope that if amendments are moved from this side of the House in the direction of assisting, the workers, they will receive the wholehearted support of the Government and their supporters. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in favour of taking every opportunity for improving- the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, but in the past the Government have not shown any special, desire to amend the Arbitration Act in order- to give facilities to the unions to approach the Arbitration Court. If Ministers were really sincere in their endeavour to break down the existing prejudice against that tribunal, they had ample opportunity of displaying their- sincerity by amending the Act. Almost all the provisions of the Bill before us to-day are to be found in the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The- measure certainly provides a few moire tribunals for the settle ment of disputes which should relieve the congestion at the Arbitration Court, but their powers are so limited that it is  questionable  whether they will succeed in giving us industrial peace. To, secure industrial peace we must have tribunals in which the whole of the workers- will have confidence. I believe that a. great reform would be effected by amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order that two laymen might be appointed to assist the  President  of the Court, one representing the employers and the other the employees. Furthermore, the elimination of lawyers from the Court would effect a great improvement. The appointment of practical men to assist the  President  would shorten the time occupied in hearing disputes very considerably, because technical matters would not require to be fully explained. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but apart from the hearing of evidence the assessors could give great assistance to the  President  in matters of detail. If all the parties to industrial disputes leave the Arbitration Court, and take their cases to the proposed Commonwealth Council, it will lead to just as much congestion as ever. In my opinion the .best course to adopt is to amend the Arbitration Act, and appoint two laymen to assist the Judge in the way I have suggested. In the early days of arbitration in New South Wales laymen assisted the  President  of the Arbitration Court, and in the first three years that Court did splendid work. The only trouble was that most of the employers doubted its jurisdiction, and so riddled it with Full Court decisions that it was rendered practically useless. However, it was able to do good work in making awards, because it was clothed with the power to call upon the employers who were parties to disputes to produce their books and disclose the capital invested in their businesses, and the profits they were making. Naturally the employers objected to a Court which sought to inquire into their profits and losses, and set themselves up against such methods of conducting inquiries, with the result I have already mentioned. However, unless the tribunals proposed to be created by this Bill are clothed with the power to inquire into the profits of any industry, and distribute a large portion of the wealth made by it among the employees engaged in it, there will be discontent among the workers. Evidence of this nature may be taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> as was done in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows the definition of a mine, that it is &#34; a hole in the ground surrounded by liars&#34;; but we cannot ask  the  men engaged in a mine that is not paying to work for nothing. If an industry cannot pay a living wage we should not endeavour to keep it in existence, because the mcn engaged in it could be better employed in more profitable operations. The Labour party welcome any machinery providing for the settlement of industrial disputes. Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has said, we stand for arbitration, and we are anxious to help the Government to pass legislation that will bring about the settlement of industrial disputes by that means. However, at the same time we ask the Government to pay some regard to what we say, and to any amendments we may put forward. We would like to have the words &#34; and profits &#34; inserted in the definition of &#34;industrial matter,&#34; thus enabling a Board to secure complete information as to the profits made by an industry. No man .will mind what a Board may learn about his profits so long as it is prepared to give him a just return upon his capital, while seeing, at the same time, that every person engaged in the industry gets a fair return for his labour. </para>

                            <para>- The provision in the Bill is already contained in our Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and the Arbitration Court has laid it down that it has not the power to investigate the profits of an industry. It is in order to make sure that a Board would have this power that I suggest the insertion of these words in this particular definition. There are other anomalies&#39; in the Bill which will require attention. Any one without experience of brickmaking could easily inquire into the cost of making bricks. There is not much labour required in brickmaking; it is merely a question of raising the clay, and that is mostly done by machinery. The number of bricks that can be turned* out each day can be easily estimated, and under the new process known as the Hoffman kiln, the burning does not require much skilled labour. But the point I wish to make is that any tribunal inquiring into the brickmaking industry with a view to fixing the wages of the employees should also have the power to fix the selling price of bricks. </para>

                            <para>- I believe so. &#34;We have the power to settle the conditions of labour, and they cannot be settled satisfactorily unless we are able to fix the selling price of commodities. A tribunal may fix the wages of employees in the brickmaking industry on the present selling price of bricks, but when an award is given, up goes the price of the bricks, and the public begins to complain about the high cost. The New South Wales Arbitration Court gave an award in the cement-making industry. It examined the pay-sheet of every man engaged in the industry, and knew exactly the cost of producing each bag of cement. In making its award it estimated that the extra cost of labour would amount to about 3d. per bag. But  the employers immediately advertised that the price of their cement would toe increased by 9d. per hag because of the increased wages they had been called upon to pay. The Court, having based its award on the profits made in the industry, knew well that they would permit of an increase of wages being paid equal to about 3d. per bag of cement, but it had no control over the selling price of the commodity. This is a power the Court ought to have in order to protect the public from profiteering. A Court can ascertain quite accurately the average number of pairs of boots each person engaged in the bootmaking industry can turn out per day, and can also inquire into the cost of material and supervision, and make allowance for a fair amount of interest on capital invested, but it should also be empowered to fix the price of boots to the consumers. Thus, the interests of the consumers as well as those of the workers will be safeguarded. I think that the parties should be given the right to nominate the  chairman  of a Board. Of course, if they cannot agree among themselves, the Government should step in and make the appointment. I strongly urge the Government to consider the advisability of amending the Arbitration Act, and not let it get into the minds of the employees that this Bill has been brought down with a view to undermining that Act and getting rid of the  President  of the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the Government will push on with that measure. There is a feeling outside that the purpose of this Bill is to do away with the Arbitration Act. Some persons say that the object of the Government is to get rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. I have no particular axe to grind for that gentleman, or for any one else; I believe that he has done good work, and he has won the confidence of the employees up to a certain point. But in some instances he has failed to grasp the real issue. For example, the engineers applied to him for an increase, which he declined to grant, although there was ample justification for it in the high cost of living. The result was a strike which tied up all our shipping. Had he had a layman to assist him, that strike would not, I think, have taken place. I hope that in future we shall have laymen as members of the Court whose powers will be, equal with that of the Judge. The members of the Commonwealth Council should hold permanent appointments, and should receive salaries which would put them above the temptation to accept bribes, and beyond suspicion. I have known men connected with important tribunals who have been thought weak, and have been under the suspicion of leaning to those who have done them some favour. </para>

                        <para>.As the Bill is called the Industrial Peace Bill it is to be supposed that its object is the. securing of industrial peace-; but I have the feeling that it will prove a failure. The manner, in which it. has been brought forward, and the attempt to for.ce it through this Chamber, do not guarantee to the people the securing of the object aimed at, and the industrial organizations which have not been given time to consider its provisions, must view it with suspicion. No doubt, we all desire industrial peace and the smooth working of the affairs of the country. No. one but a crank wishes the dislocation of industry through the fighting of sections of industrial employers and employees-. But the Bill attacks only one side of the problem. The Prime Minister admitted in his opening speech that industrial unrest seems to be inherent in the present system. It behoves us,, therefore, to radically alter what has been done in the past. The Arbitration Court has done good work ; but the congestion of business there, and the difficulty of getting before the Court, have perhaps more than anything else been responsible for industrial unrest. If in the Billbon&#226; <inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> trade unions and organizations are not recognised and given preference, the desire must be to divide the industrial workers into sections, and to strike at the root of trade unionism, in which case the measure is doomed to failure. It is common knowledge that a large section of the coal-miners of New South Wales have declared that they will not have the Bill. Their reason for saying that is that it makes provision for ascertaining only whether men are being paid sufficient to live on.. My experience is that industrial inquiries resolve themselves into an inquiry whether the wage that is being paid will suffice for the bare existence of the individual, and keep him in sufficiently good condition to continue at work, without getting ahead in the world. Tribunals that will make only such inquiries are useless to the coal-miners. The Prime Minister has spoken of the threat of grave industrial trouble in the coal-mining industry. I do not know what the Government would do if the Bill became law and the miners did not recognise its provisions. They have said that unless a tribunal is appointed to inquire into the profits made by the coal-owners they will have nothing to do with any inquiry. Why? The miners&#39; pay depends largely upon the selling price -of coal. We -know that the &#91;price  of  &#39;coal is going up. The miners claim that the industry can well afford, out -of the profits being made from the sale -of &#62;coal, &#39;to &#39;give -them increased wages, &#34;without calling upon coal consumers to meet the increase.  If  we cannot -get beyond the &#39;point of &#39;merely stating what wages employees &#39;shall receive; if we -cannot go further in the direction of preventing -the passing on of increases in wages, and so piling  sup  the cost of living., &#34;then all our efforts will have been in -vain. Industrial peace will never  be  achieved.. Dlt is of no use  ito  say to the men, &#34; Sou .shall have such-and-such wages.&#34;&#39;&#39; Under the system to-day., profiteering &#39;companies &#39;:can charge the public -whatever they like for commodities. So .long  ms the  &#39;system exists the means of life -cannot be measured by monetary payments. A wage&#39; &#39;-that is sufficient to-day will not be enough &#39;tomorrow. The &#34;Bill under discussion  can  only bring about -a, -further inquiry into existing conditions, and possibly award increased wages  to  &#39;an industry &#39;here and there. But the effect &#39;will be merely to aggravate the position &#39;by further -sending up prices of necessary &#39;commodities, so making the cost of living higher than ever. While -I -hold strong views regarding the necessity .&#34;for bringing about radical .changes to-.day,, still, .1 will welcome any course of action tending to .ease the threatening industrial -position. &#39;The Government have indicated this much, namely,, that they will be prepared to consider modifications of the &#39;Bill. Some degree .of .satisfaction, therefore, may be gained ib v  the  passage of -this .-measure; but, really, .all it  ,can  (do will -be to aggravate the .general (situation. .It is of no use to say that the Arbitration Court has failed -.because industrial unrest &#39;has (continued. The Arbitration (Court has failed  -for  the season that its .powers have been so limited. It &#39;has been -im- ^ possible to .secure a hearing for the many urgent  teases  requiring attention. The only way in which to get before  the  Court with anything like speed is to threaten to &#39;strike. By &#39;so doing, an industry can force itself upon -the -attention of the -Judge in preference  to others which ;are taking &#34;their legitimate turn. It is  of  no .use to set up  a  &#39;tribunal merely to deal --with the question of -wages. I &#39;do -not &#39;believe that industrial unrest has to ;do with wages aft all. What is -required is to create machinery for the reduction -of mhA cost &#39;of living, and to make the ruling wage -sufficient to meet the cost. In that case wages might remain where they stand at present. N&#39;o good purpose would &#34;be served by making them hig&#39;her. The reason why this &#39;Bill must prove  -a  failure is that the great problem is how -to attack the cost of living, -and, at the same time, to leave wages where they are. There &#34;is no need for further increases. The .great need is to bring back prices of necessary commodities to to-day&#39;s wage standard. </para>

                        <para>..- The opinion frequently expressed in .this Chamber, and as -often .heard outside,, is that ,the problem of settling industrial disputes is one of the greatest confronting Australia to-day. The problem is certainly being faced by the &#39;Government.; and &#39;this Bill, although it -.may not provide a .satisfactory isolation, and is not expected by the Prime Minister to &#62;do so* still .-represents  ian  honest endeavour in that -direction. If we are to make this measure everything -that .the wisdom <inline font-style="italic">soS</inline> the &#39;Chamber van -make it, there must be good-will and co-operation  by  rail -panties. 1 regretted to note the .atmosphere which was -created when the Prime Minister moved,  ion  Wednesday, that the Bill should  lb  -regarded .as an urgent measure. I do -not propose to .say who was ito blame for the .creation of that hostile atmosphere, or whether .any one was to blame ; but I regret .that .a  certain amount of annoyance should have been -displayed by the Opposition, and that it should have .regarded &#39;the action -of the Prime Minister &#39;as an -endeavour to place .unnecessary restriction -upon (debate. However, I .do mot, even .at this stage, regard it as beyond .reasonable .&#39;hope that the help .of .all honorable members -will be -given -to the -perfecting and eventual passing of the Bill. I listened to the speech :of the -honorable member :Tor.Hunter  ;(Mir.  &#39;Charlton) with considerable &#39;interest., ;and I appreciated both the matter and the .manner of its presentation. The help -which the honorable member has given, land proposes to (give, should be -of distinct benefit. I also listened with .appreciation to the -remarks of the honorable member for South -&#39;Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley).</inline> .Although I cannot agree with some crf his ^utterances, the &#39;tone of &#39;the honorable member&#39;s speech was such as to  arouse hope that the measure will be considered in a spirit of conciliation. </para>

                    <para>It has been stated that the object of the Bill is to abolish the Arbitration Court. I do not think that is its object. Had the Government desired to abolish that Court it could have gone about its purpose in more direct fashion. Personally, though, I do not see how it will be possible for the two sets of tribunals to continue in operation side by side. I would have preferred that the Government should have first, introduced the Bill to amend the Arbitration Act. Had it been my task to introduce a measure aimed at the securing of industrial peace, I would have endeavoured, first, to call a conference of employers and employees to discuss the whole situation and suggest remedies. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has assured the House that he invited such a conference. Unfortunately, however, he has not had the benefit of. recommendations from such a gathering. During the recent election campaign, I said, when discussing the problem of industrial unrest, that representatives of labour and capital should be brought together. I held the view that they were bound to agree, along broad lines, upon some form of legislation in order to solve the great problem. And, if there were such agreement, it would be reasonable to expect that both sides would abide by the decisions of whatever tribunal might be created. Unless there is hearty good-will and co-operation outside, no industrial legislation can be expected to prove successful. I was disappointed by the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline> He did not offer any useful criticism, .or suggest any amendment of the Bill, in order to make it more perfect. The honorable member, however, has since given indications in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- I hope such suggestions will be made in Committee. The main point of the criticism offered by the Leader of the Opposition seemed to be that bogus organizations would be represented on the special tribunals. The same fear was expressed by other honorable members. I do not know what is meant by a bogus organization. One honorable member of the Opposition said emphatically that non-unionists were not entitled to any consideration. I am afraid that is the rock upon which we split. I claim to have as much sympathy as any honorable member with the working man, and I represent thousands of genuine workers. If they had not voted for me I would not be a member of this House. But while I do not deny that unionism should be encouraged, and that it has done a lot for the working man, I will not go so far as to say that if a man does not belong to a union he is not entitled to consideration by the Legislature. </para>

                    <para>The method of appointing the chairmen of the tribunals is another point in regard to which objection was raised by critics of the Bill. I agree with the suggestion made by the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley).</inline> It appears to me logical that the representatives of employers and employees&#39; should, if they are able to agree, appoint their own  chairman.  I can quite understand that a  chairman  appointed by any Government would be viewed with suspicion by one side or the other. If it is not possible for the members of the tribunal to agree as to a  chairman,  it would be better to leave the appointment to be made by a Judge of the Arbitration Court or some other independent person outside the Government. </para>
                    <para>The Bill provides for the appointment of a Commonwealth Council, district councils, and special tribunals. I assume that these will not be permanent bodies, to the members of which fixed salaries will be paid. My idea is that the tribunals should be appointed to deal with any particular dispute, and immediately a settlement has been arrived at the tribunal should be disbanded. I see no necessity for the creation of permanent bodies. Neither does it appear to me to be necessary that, in addition to existing &#34;Wages Boards and the&#39; Arbitration Court, there should be the three bodies proposed to be created by the Bill. One body on which employers and employees are equally represented should be sufficient to deal with any dispute. If this legislation is to be a success there must be a cooperation between employer and employee, and I understand that to be the desire of honorable members on both sides of the House. The necessity for such cooperation is recognised, particularly by the representatives of organized labour in the House. Of course I except the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> who has advanced ideas as to the best method of remedying industrial unrest. I totally disagree with his views, and&#39; I do not think he represents the opinion of organized labour. </para>
                    <para>An  important  question is how the tribunals are to arrive at what is a fair wage. Unquestionably the worker is entitled to a full reward for his labour. Some honorable members claim that he is entitled to all that he produces, and that, indeed, the miner should own&#39; the mine. If that policy were adopted a certain section of labour in the community, the workers in a profitable mine, would enjoy great prosperity provided they would work; but I am afraid that hundreds of unprofitable mines would not be worked at all, many men would be thrown out of employment, and there would be an end to prospecting and development. If a fair wage is to be based on the profit earn&#39;ed in an industry we shall have in the one industry, and in the one district, different sets of wages. Obviously one mine may return a handsome profit whilst another mine in the same State may return no more than a living wage. It would be difficult indeed to arrive at a fair wage on that basis. </para>

                            <para>- Just before the dinner adjournment I was saying that it is difficult to understand how we are to adjust wages on the basis of the profits derived from each and every industry. I agree that the basis of the wage might be  profits  derived from any particular industry, such as mining, but it is obvious that, if we fix all wages on the basis of profits, we must have -different rates of wages in different industries. I can think of nothing more likely to bring about dissatisfaction or instability than different rates of wages in different industries in one State, or in one locality. It has been said that the workman is entitled to the full reward of his labour, but if we fix the wage on profits and on the cost of production in any primary industry, the price of many commodities must be increased, and the cost of living soar higher and higher. If wages are on this basis it is inevitable that we must give the men in every industry the same chance. Not without &#39;a great deal of knowledge of the primary industries I contend that, if the men who work in the dairying industry or on the farm were to get anything like the wage of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> or &#163;6 per week mentioned by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls),</inline> butter would be 4s. per lb. every day of the year, and wheat would be much more than 7s. 8d. per bushel. </para>

                    <para>I sincerely hope that we shall have the honest co-operation of those who represent organized labour in framing this Bill, and amending it where necessary, so that it may be acceptable to both employer and employee. It has been said that no legislation will bring about permanent industrial peace, and on that, I think, we are all agreed. It is not expected, I take it, that this Bill will bring about the millennium in the industrial sphere, any more &#163;han we can have universal peace through the agency of the League of Nations; while human nature remains what it is, there will be industrial disputes, and, I fear, wars, small or great, so long as this world lasts. This, however, .is no reason why we should not frame legislation and devise machinery in an honest attempt to repair the shortcomings in our existing industrial conditions. The idea of the Bill is to. attain that end; and with the co-operation of those who are honestly desirous of giving the workman what is his due - giving  a fair deal to both employer and employed by bringing the two together - we can expect to some extent to gain the end in view. I assure honorable members opposite that any amendment introduced, no matter by whom, which appears to me to be for the betterment of the measure, will have my support. </para>
                    <para>As to the time allotted for the discussion of the Bill, a fortnight, as we know that period in parliamentary work, should be sufficient; but if, at the end of that time, it is found that there is still a desire to discuss certain amendments, and there is no evidence of a desire to obstruct- </para>

When we look at the figures, and take into account also the dependants of these men and. women,, we must be led to the  conclusion  that when, united labour speaks it must speak, with a thunderous voice audi with reason,,  for.  it speaks- in the name of some 7.00.,000 unionists,  and  those in. sym.path.jj with unionist principles.

During, the dinner hour I saw from a newspaper that in- Germany, which was. engaged in war for nearly five, years, trade, unionism, has extended,, during the, last eighteen, months, by leaps; and&#39;, bounds, and the total, number of unionists in that, country now is nearly four times what, it was prior to the, war. In every country, hu the. world, whether Britain- or what may be, termed foreign, trade, unionism, is marching. on-;.- and. one of the basic principles on  which it is founded is- that, for the future the- associated, workers must demand, greater participation in the benefits of industry than they have enjoyed in the- past, and they will not be hoodwinked or denied. The- honorable- member for Darwin&#39; (Mr: Bell)&#39; may speak of. pay&#62; ing: mines and non-paying- mines&#39;, of paying, industries and- non-paying, industries, and suggest&#39; that&#39; the- workmen should! take- some of the responsibilities and risks;- but the workmen take more of.&#39; the responsibilities&#39;, and&#39; a great part of: the risks, all-round to-day, while enjoying; comparatively few of the benefits&#39;. The idea of the workman enjoying the full&#39; benefits of his labour is not a new one. Abraham Lincoln,, fifty years ago, said&#39; that-&#39; it was only by the sweat of his brow that man ate - that it was incumbent on all to work in some form or- other - and concluded, &#34; The worker is entitled to the full result, of his labour, or as nearly the full result as possible^&#34; Before the Labour party was known, as such these word&#39;s, were, given, utterance to by Abraham. Lincoln,, and- if they were true in those. days*, they are. a thousand time&#39;s more true to-day,, when, with the use-, of machinery the worker contributes so much  to,  the well-being and general  progress of industry. The whole world is now in&#39; a state of unrest, conditions generally will not be normal for a long time to come, but they will never be normal so long as we deny the worker a full share of the wealth he helps to create. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> Diggle,  Bishop of Carlisle, has said - </para>

I agree with the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> that by passing this Bill we shall be creating a number of Boards, authorities, and councils, which will only &#39;serve to make confusion worse confounded. There are already 498 &#34;Wages Boards operating in Australia under State Acts, and when the provisions of this measure are in force there is a possibility that we .shall have at least 500 Boards at work.

But mining in the Maitland district may not be conducted on the same lines as are employed in the Hunter district; and, again, different methods may be followed in Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia, so that there is a possibility that each State and each district will claim a Board for the coal-mining industry alone. Thus conflicting decisions may be given, creating confusion. We have at least 200 unions in Australia, with various subsidiary branches, some of which will demand the appointment of Boards. All this duplication of&#39; existing machinery cannot lead to industrial peace. I am afraid that the history of this .measure, which has been -introduced in : storm. will be &#39;one of storm, and that it will .finally pass out in storm, because the .multiplicity of  (decisions which will be given will be .more likely to create turmoil, unrest, and distrust than bring about industrial peace. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr,.

No .doubt it will be a difficult matter to adjudicate in regard to the conditions which apply to workers in the Northern Territory, .and also to workers in the south-east of our vast continent.

For .all these things allowance must .be made, Hut it can only be done by one central authority ; and I believe .that, if we create one authority, we shall be doing a great deal towards solving many of the difficulties confronting .us to-day.

                            <para>- That  is not -the Labour party&#39;s platform. Excepting, &#39;perhaps, a few members of &#39;the Corner party, none .are more in favour  of  true local government for Australia than are the members of the Labour party. Our platform would provide a more perfect system of local government than any other that has been suggested, and the sooner it can be brought about the better it will be for the people of Australia. This is an inopportune time for the introduction of amending industrial legislation, &#39;because, as the Prime Minister announced to-day, a Bill is to be introduced very soon to provide for the calling together of a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution. Personally, I do not think that there is any need for such a Convention, but the Convention is to be held, and it will discuss, among other things, the control of industry. I believe that there will emerge from that discussion the view that has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman-,</inline> of New South Wales, and others, that industrial legislation should be entirely a Commonwealth power. Under these circumstances, why patch up our arbitration, law in the manner proposed by this Bill <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It would be preferable to wait until&#39; the Convention has met. A majority in this House evidently favours the idea of a Convention, and, therefore, why not wait until that body has stated its views on the subject of industrial legislation? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, the  Deputy President  of the Arbitration Court, has published a pamphlet of six pages, of which honorable members have received a copy, in which he shows that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been a success, and that arbitration has not been the disastrous and awful failure in Australia that some persons have declared it to be. The Labour party is pledged . to the amendment of the Arbitration Act. We have not thrown arbitration overboard, but we wish to&#39; have the Act amended to avoid the Serbonian bog of technicalities once spoken of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. Before blaming the Arbitration Court for its short-comings, we should consider the constitutional limitations upon its powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers mentions a few of them. The Court has jurisdiction only for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State - it cannot settle all disputes - and at least 95 per cent, of the disputes that have arisen are State disputes, with which it cannot deal. I think that the Court has done very well. In five years, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, 729 agreements between employers and employees have been filed in the Court in settlement of disputes of which the Court had cognisance, some of them being agreements with individual employers, and others being agreements with groups of employers. That was the work of the conciliation branch of the Court&#39;s activities. The Prime Minister has made a great deal of the fact that he is now introducing what has been termed the round-table Conference; but I would remind the House that the round-table Conference is already provided for in our arbitration law. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers has been assisting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Arbitration Court for a number of years, and he says that one of the first things they do when an InterState dispute arises is to try to bring the parties together and have the matters iti dispute discussed at a round-table Conference at which employers and employees are equally represented. Trouble has arisen because, owing to- constitutional limitations, the Court cannot deal with disputes which are wholly within a State. That, I understand, is the ruling of the High Court. What I am about to say may not obtain the approval of legal gentlemen, but personally I think that we should not pay too much regard to a ruling of the High Court given six, seven, or ten years ago. To-day the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the High Court is quite different from what it was then. Not one of the Justices who originally constituted the High Court i3 now on the Bench. Furthermore, times have changed, and I believe that many of the earlier decisions of the Court would be upset if the questions were brought before the Court as at- present constituted. At any rate, there is no reason why we should not test the opinion of the present Court on many questions. I think that it would be a good thing to pass- the industrial legislation that we think needed, and try to enforce it with _ a view to obtaining from the present  High  Court a decision as to its constitutionality. The Court has varied some of its earlier decisions, and I see no reason why _ its opinion on certain constitutional questions should not be tested again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers says - </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members are forced to express their opinions about this Bill hurriedly, because the Prime Minister has given the order that its consideration must proceed quickly. My complaint is that we have not had sufficient time to consider it properly, and the speeches of some honorable members opposite have shown that they have not thoroughly studied its provisions. The old cry has been raised that it is a Bill to be dealt with in Committee, and that it can be amended there. During some of the speeches from this side, and particularly during the speech of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> honorable members opposite appeared to indorse opinions which were being uttered, and stated that in Committee they would support amendments which would better the Bill. I hope that those honorable members will stick by their guns. It has happened too often that honorable members, after declaring themselves in favour of a certain course, have, when the whip has been cracked, gone back on their utterances, and voted contrary to them. The Prime Minister has said that this is not a party measure, but one to be framed in Committee. Personally, I do not expect any good results from it unless it can be amended almost out of existence. I question whether those who belong to the industrial unions of the country will seek relief under its provisions. If they do not, the measure will be an absolute and disastrous failure. The request for delay was a fair one, and had it been backed up by honorable members opposite, the Prime Minister would have been forced to yield, as  he has yielded on other occasions, to the majority. I believe that all the amendments that will be proposed in Committee will be. reasonable, and have in view the improvement of the Bill, and I trust that they will be supported from all quarters. The Bill is a bad one; but, if we can, let us make it a good one by amending its provisions, and inserting others, so that the measure may be acceptable to the unions. If this is not done, failure must result. </para>

                        <para>. - It has been said during the debate that this measure is probably one of the most important that has been brought before the House, and any one who recognises the conditions of the world to-day must agree that the Bill calls for the earnest cooperation and assistance of every member - not as a party measure, but as one on which the destinies of Australia may possibly depend. The problem of industrial unrest is world-wide. Any one who has been out of Australia recently knows that our &#39;industrial problems and troubles are small in comparison with those of nearly every other part of the world . Early last year I visited Great Britain, the United States of America, France, and Canada. On my return I was surprised by what I heard said on public platforms and in private conversation, and by what I read in the press, concerning the conditions in Australia. The impression was abroad that this country was a seething cauldron of unrest, and that it might &#34;be better to seek some peaceful land where industrial conditions were more stable. There never was a more absurd impression. We have our industrial troubles; but, as I have said, compared with those of other countries, they are small. We possess a priceless asset in the fact that, generally speaking, Labour here is organized and controlled. Much has been said against trade unionism and. trade union acts with which I entirely disagree. There can be no better thing for industrial peace than the existence of good and efficient Labour organization, provided that Labour takes its responsibilities seriously, and sees that its organizations are controlled by the best minds in the industry, and by men who truly represent the orderly, decent worker whom we all know. </para>

                            <para>- I think that they should be- recognised, though whether they are or are not may be open to question. But if by the recognition of unions you ask me to drive into outer darkness the man who does not belong to a union, I shall not do it. I am willing to do everything in my power to get men to join unions, because I believe that organized unionism is the best thing for industry that we can have ; but if I am to be asked to impose on those who do not join some form of compulsion, I decline to do so. The position in France is really  terrible to-day. There is no more potent force for the creation of industrial trouble than an enormous increase in the cost of living. The people of Australia have been subjected to a heavy increase in the cost of living, but, compared with what France has had to undergo, our experiences are nothing at all. The cost of living in France has advanced nearly 300 per cent. In Australia, the increase is estimated to be nearly 60 per cent. From enjoying the privilege of being one of the cheapest countries in the world in which ,to live, France to-day has the unenviable reputation of being one of the most expensive. This fact has reacted heavily upon the people, and France is seething with industrial unrest. It will take the best brains of the Republic, and the united efforts of all parties, to .steer France through her .troubles. In , Great Britain, a similar .condition of affairs exists. The cost of living is &#39;.estimated to have .risen about 150 per cent. .To-day, the British people .are grappling, not -only with that problem, but with another, with which the people <inline font-style="italic">-o&#163;</inline> Australia, happily, are not faced. Prior to the war, ,the .great majority of the working people were treated like dogs. They never had -&#39;a fair chance, and those who were on top saw to it that they did not get a fair chance. Naturally, to-day, as &#39;the workers are finding themselves upon &#39;a &#34;basis where there is time to think and opportunity for making comparisons, &#39;they are dwelling upon the injustices to which they were subjected not long ago. The attitude of the working masses of England is going to provide a very difficult problem.; indeed, .so difficult will that problem  prove  that it will only be by extraordinary efforts that a solution is likely to be found. The efforts already being made to .solve the problems of peace, however, are only comparable with those of the British people to solve the problems of war; and honorable members are aware of the nature of those tremendous and successful efforts. </para>

                        n condition may break out at any hour. The industrial unrest and the general attitude of labour towards capital constitute a grave menace.

                    <para>Turning attention to the situation in Australia, we find that our troubles .are very loudly proclaimed; but that is where our safety lies. There is a great deal of noise surrounding our troubles, for labour here has a voice and makes itself emphatically heard. In the voicing of labour&#39;s troubles, however, our salvation may be found. While .our troubles are considerably less than those of other people, we must nevertheless make a determined effort to solve them; and, if we can do so, we will have placed ourselves well ahead of any other country in the world. </para>
                    <para>It has been mentioned in -the course of this debate,, I .think, that there is .a specific sum of &#163;5a000,600 waiting to be invested in Australia, tat that, owing to Australia&#39;s terrible industrial situation, that amount of capital will not be coming here. Such a statement is immediately challenged by the suggestion, &#34;Where &#39;else would that money &#39;go for investment ? &#34; There is no better place than Australia to take it. But here another fact arises for consideration. The world does not know what we know about Australian industrial conditions. We have ,never inaugurated adequate propaganda in London to counteract the derogatory statements made and published regarding this country. One never sees .any reference to Australia in the London press unless it has to do with .droughts or &#39;.strikes, or other such calamities. Surely, with our resources, there should be something of a different character in the &#34;London newspapers by way of presenting Australian news. &#39; &#39;There &#39;.should be something done in the matter of presenting to the people of England a true statement regarding prevailing conditions in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>This Bill represents an effort, made in all seriousness, to help regulate the relations existing between employer and employee, and to contribute towards industrial peace. But the effort was inaugurated under unfavorable conditions. There has been a suggestion from honorable members opposite that there should be delay in order that the proposals contained :in the Bill may be fully and carefully considered. I do not share &#39;in that view. Tie- Prime. Minister- (Mr:. Hughes) has mad&#39;e. an effort&#39; to- bring- together the two. classes chiefly concerned&#39;; but his activities have proved abortive. The.

In such a course of action, I entirely concur. </para>

                            <para>- I am&#39; sorry that the honorable member is not prepared&#39; to give me a fair opportunity; but one has certain public duties- to perform, and,, rightly- or wrongly, I&#39; feel that. I ought to speak- upon this measure. The demand for delay in dealing with the Bill&#39; is, based&#39; upon a. proposition, not that there shall be a conference between employers and employees, but that there shall be&#39; separate&#39; discussions. For- conferences of that character, I have no- use at this1 stage. IF the proposal of honorable&#39; members, opposite&#39; were- to call a joint, conference-, there might-, be something in- their- argument-; but. the outcome* of each side of industrial life meeting <inline font-style="italic">ism</inline> separate conventions upon, the subject-matter- of this Bill&#39; would&#39; be merely to inspire the various delegates with a: feeling that they must, make out the. strongest possible case&#39; for- their- interests;,  30.&#39;  as to. permit, of: their claims; being bargained&#39;, down, and! whittled! off to at. fair andi reasonable level. Procedure of : that; character- is&#62; quite undesirable at this* stage., for Parliament would, become little, more than an arbitrating- body between contending, factions If there, were to. ben delay in order: to. give employers and employees an. opportunity- to meetand&#39; debate separately, many valuable: weeks, might be lost. First, the delegates&#39; would take time -in coming together.;-. then they- would occupy more, time- in: debating, and would, waste, still more time, in returning to the bodies which had selected* them and reporting upon their deliberations. By the time the Government or Parliament had been made acquainted with the views of the parties chiefly; concerned, the- delay might prove tragic... I. take- the. view that, honorable members having been: elected to sit. in this&#39; Parliament, as- the representatives of the people, the latter: - rightly on wrongly - have decided that we are their- leaders.

I take, it that my- job is- not to wait for such a lead&#39;,, but to suggest in this Chamber what I consider the right course for the. people to follow - not in the interests either of employers or employees&#39;, but with- a view to bringing- about-- the. greatest good&#39; for- the people ofl Australia as a whore. Honorable members- would be. well advised&#39;- to: take&#39; a bold- and strong- course ; for- there has- been- ample opportunity to consider the- whole grave problem&#39;.

                    <para>Honorable: members: should! consider opinions expressed upon the subject of industrial unrest,, and should examine the- actions taken in Great Britain, where the. matter has been dealt with in every detail-., Most honorable members are aware: of the history of organized Labour in Great Britain throughout the war. I propose-, however, to remind them, of what happened. Very soon after: the outbreak of the war, namely,, in March,, 19-15, it. became strikingly apparent that the fullest necessary production of munitions and&#39; supplies, could&#39; not be secured unless some alteration were made in existing methods. The Government, by the grace of God, bad the good&#39; sense to take organized Labour into, their confidence and to. explain the whole situation. They asked for cooperation and willing assistance. And it. is  to be said to the credit of leaders of organized Labour in the Old Country that they rose to the opportunity afforded them and played their part in a way that will ever reflect credit upon those who had the handling of British Labour in those early days of the conflict. The Labour leaders agreed to forego many of the rights that had been fought for for many years and had been secured only with the greatest difficulty. They agreed to the dilution of labour. That was the first great point, and, probably, it involved a principle which had been placed by true unionists on the very highest pinnacle of their beliefs. The leaders agreed to the employment of women and boys in the stead of skilled labour. They agreed to the number of boys in proportion to skilled labour being increased; they agreed to a working week of seven days, and to the institution of unlimited hours of work. In exchange for these great concessions, however, they demanded a pledge, which was given, that those privileges which they were forgoing were to be withheld for only so long as the war continued. After a time the realization became acute that, as the war drew to its conclusion, tremendous problems would have to be dealt with if that pledge was to be honoured. A committee was appointed, with the  Deputy Speaker  of the House of Commons as its  chairman.  That body is known as the Whitley Committee. After months of deliberation, it reported in March of 1917, upon what it considered the best means of honouring the pledge and of bringing about, for the first time in the history of Great Britain, true industrial peace. The Committee&#39;s recommendations were, I believe, wonderfully wise and prudent. They were&#39; accepted by all classes in Great Britain. One point has struck me forcibly, and that is with regard to the spirit with which the Whitley Committee approached its task. T should like to read to honorable members a paragraph from the preface to the recommendations- of the Committee - </para>
                    <para>This said that failure to utilize existing opportunities for securing a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employed might involve the nation in grave industrial difficulties at the end of the war, and proposed the establishment in each of the main industries of the country of an organization representative of employers and workpeople, having as its object the regular consideration and determination of matters affecting the progress and well-being of the trade from the point of view of all those engaged in it - as far as that might be consistent with the general interest of the community. </para>
                    <para class="block">That was the basis upon which the Committee worked, and I shall indicate to&#39; the House briefly their recommendations. At first sight 1 thought that this Bill reproduced the Whitley Committee&#39;s scheme, but I find that it is considerably different.&#39; The underlying principle in the Whitley Committee&#39;s report was the fact that they recognised that industrial troubles generally start from some very small beginning, add in order to avoid the genesis of trouble they started their scheme with a works committee to operate directly in every big establishment in which the scheme is adopted. Then there is the district committee, which deals with questions affecting the whole district, such as a coal-mining district like that represented by the honorable member for  Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> Above both those organizations, there is a national council, which deals with the problems on a national basis and considers all great questions arising in any trade. But I would emphasize the point that the Whitley Committee recommended that each council or works committee should deal with only one trade ; that each trade should have its own complete organization. I shall indicate some of the other recommendations, because I think that if we can realize what was the considered opinion of the best&#39; brains in England, after many months of investigation and study of this problem, we may derive some help in arriving at the solution of a very similar difficulty in Australia. The powers given to the -bodies which the Committee suggested should be created for each trade are very wide. It is  contemplated that the various works committees and district councils shall not only deal with questions of labour, hours, and payment, but also assist in bringing about greater efficiency. The- committee&#39;s plan was based on the principle that each industry must have its own  organization running right through the industry, from- the earliest point at which troubles might arise, on to a national council which would deal with the problems of an industry as a whole. The principles of the Whitley Committee&#39;s report have been adopted in a great number of industries in: Great Britain. The first industry to take up the scheme was the pottery trade, and amongst the others which followed were furniture-making, silver and gold, horological and allied trades, match-making, rubber manufacture, silk industry, baking, china clay, tramways, water works, woollen and worsted, electricity, bedstead making, boot and shoe manufacture, table making, carpet making, and many other trades. I have already said that the first industry to adopt the Whitley Committee&#39;s report was the pottery trade, and I shall read to the House some of the objects set out in the memorandum of the national council for that industry. The first and&#39; most obvious is the advancement of pottery making, and the consideration of  means whereby all manufacturers and operatives shall be brought within their respective associations. I quite agree that we should ever try to employ men who belong to industrial organizations, provided always that when they become members of a union they shall take a live interest in its affairs and extraordinarily good care that it is controlled&#39; by the best men in it, and not by a clique of disgruntled and troublesome people who were never particularly keen on work. One point I would like to emphasize is that the Whitley system is not only going ito help the employer and the employed, but also the industry itself, because amongst the other objects are - </para>

                            <para>- That is the sort of wild statement that is continually being made. The Inter-State Commission and the Fair Profits Commission are in possession of every figure and fact in relation to the operations of firms in Flinders-lane. These grossly unfair statements are made with no honest purpose. They emanate from a type of poisoned mind that is trying to poison the minds of other people, and if that atmosphere is to permeate the affairs of Australia, God help the country. I do not believe the average man in Australia has that warped and poisoned mind; when a large number of people have such minds, the country will not be fit to live in. Thank God, there are few men like the honorable member opposite. </para>

                            <para>- If it can be done, I see no objection to it. The day has gone by when the employing classes object to the fullest investigation of trade conditions in order to discover what profits they are making, for the purpose of determining what is a fair proposition as between employer and employee. If the Commonwealth Council which this Bill proposes to create is comprised of decent men, there can be no possible harm in the information which the honorable member seeks being made available with a view to determining fair rates of wages and rewards for labour. But I think it is the view of most decent people engaged in trade that there should be a limit to the number of these inquiries. They are an interference that is becoming an absolute menace to trade to-day. If we can incorporate in this Bill some such power of investigation as the honorable member has suggested whereby a check may be made and kept, in the interests of all concerned in the trade, as to what profit is actually being made, we may get rid of the abominable suggestion we continually hear that there is no honest trader in this country. Knowing nothing; some honorable members yet brand everybody in business as a blackguard, when, as a matter of fact, there are in trade a great number of honest and fair-minded people just as there are very many honest and reasonable employees. I have indicated to the House what Great Britain has done. It seems to me that the Whitley system is based on right principles, and it is for us to consider how far we are following in its lines and to what extent this measure will be of assistance. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but surely the report I have mentioned is good enough for us. This problem has been carefully considered, and clear judgment given upon it already. That, judgment appears to me to be a very helpful one, and should assist us in our deliberations. There is, however, one point that stands out, and that is the question : Have we the power to do all of these things? Personally, I would sug-&#39; gest to honorable members that we are not going to get very far if we spend our time trying to determine, in connexion with every provision, whether under the Constitution we have or have not the power to do all these things. The framers of the measure seem to have been suffering from a similar suspicion, because they took the precaution in clause 2, subclause 2, to provide - </para>

The first principle of the Bill is that there shall be a Commonwealth i Council, which, apparently, will perform the same duties as the National Councils under the Whitley scheme, save that in  the latter scheme each national council is for one industry only. I think we shall have to consider the position that will arise under this Bill, for apparently the Commonwealth Council will have to consider matters affecting all industries in which questions may have to be determined on a national -basis. This council will have to deal with matters relating to all industries, covering a wider field than the Arbitration Court, with one, and even two, High Court Judges, has been able to cover without intolerable delay; but if it confines itself to wide questions of national importance it may  be possible for it to do the necessary </para>

                            <para>- I agree with honorable members that the Arbitration Court has been hopelessly overloaded, though it has done a lot of valuable work, and obviously something must be done to relieve the present situation. I shall say something further about the Arbitration Court in a few moments. The great benefit which one can imagine to be the outcome of the scheme for a national council will be that employer and employee will meet together and then come to quick decisions ; but I am afraid this object will be defeated if men who are engaged, in a mining industry are called upon as members of the. council to deal with shipping troubles or any other disputes in allied industries. I do not go so far as to say that it is a hopeless proposition, but I think it must be recognised that the work of this national council will, after all. be limited, though, as I have said, it may be possible for it to discharge its duties operating in conjunction with the district councils. The district councils, which are provided for in clause 9, appear to be analogous to the district councils under the Whitley scheme, save that here also the same set of representatives would have to consider questions bearing upon different industries, while the Whitley district councils are for one industry only. The powers&#39; of the district councils are very wide, and therefore the danger of overloading seems to be apparent. </para>

                            <para>- No, the local Board will really be the child of the special tribunal, and I think the position of this special tribunal might be cleared up. As I read the Bill the special tribunal appears to be designed for the -purpose of dealing with major disputes, or for clearing up the stray ends of some other dispute that has been dealt with . by the district councils. </para>

                    <para>The Arbitration Court is &#34;in the air,&#34; in a state of&#39; suspension; and we do not know what . is going to happen. There is a Bill foreshadowed to deal with the Court, by which it may have the ground cut away from beneath it, or it may be glorified or magnified ; but we do not know what is to be proposed. In view .of this, and with, such a clause as I have read, it will not be possible to get a man of any standing .or any pride to take the position of Judge. If the Court is to remain a live thing, and to discharge any function that is to be of any value in the settling of industrial disputes - if this Court is to carry any weight or respect- it must be presided over by a man of considerable position and attainments. Under the circumstances, however, no .man with any self-respect could take the position. Until such time as. we know what is proposed in regard to the Court, I personally cannot vote for clause 17. </para>

                            <para>- Then it is nearly time that it eventuated. According to clause 18, any award made by a special tribunal will be binding on the parties, / and may be enforced as an award of the Court. The question has been raised from time to time, &#34; What is the use of having awards unless there are some penalties attached, so that if any person breaks an award there may be some punishment?&#34; The Bill before us is for the settlement of industrial troubles, and it cannot possibly be a success unless there is the earnest co-operation of the two classes involved, and the determination by them to make it a success. If there is not that co-operation, the Bill will be a failure, though we put all conceivable penalties into it. On this point I should like to read the view of the Whitley Committee, which seems to have shown extraordinary sanity and wisdom in its conclusions - </para>

                    <para>I, personally, take that view. I regard the Bill as not worth the paper on which it is printed unless it is carried with the co-operation and goodwill of both sides of industry in the country. I appeal very strongly to every member here, whatever his views , may be - whether politically he be of the Nationalist, Labour, or Country party - to endeavour, when we get into Committee, to make this Bill, which is of paramount importance to Australia, a sane measure, productive of good -in&#39; this great country by smoothing out its industrial troubles. If we do this, we will be able, truly, to develop this country which is ours, and has greater possibilities than any other in the world. </para>

                        <para>.- We are all indebted to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> who spoke on behalf of the workmen, and to the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who has spoken from the employers&#39; stand-point, for their excellent speeches on this measure. This is a Bill which concerns not merely one section of the House, hut all sections - which concerns every member of the community. I had not intended to speak on the second reading, regarding such a measure as obviously necessary to avert the evils of industrial unrest. The Arbitration Court is apparently incapable of meeting the needs of the time. We are told that some  forty-two  cases are awaiting decision, and that though the Court has settled some strikes, it has, in other cases, not had the effect of preventing them. An honorable member opposite, referring to the broadmindedness of his party, says that it stands for a fair deal for all; that is a claim that can be made by all of us, and a Bill to settle industrial troubles surely concerns every person in the country. I wonder if that honorable member thinks that the farming community is not concerned when the ship-owners and seamen have a little disagreement, and it is impossible for farmers to get their produce to market. Does he think, when a railway dispute arises and the  railway  system is held up, that the producers who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> tellsus, produce three-fourths of the wealth of the country, are not concerned? These industrial troubles are a serious matter for the man on the land. </para>

                    <para>There seems to be a great deal of clamour against the haste with which it is desired to pass this measure; but I should have thought that that haste would be regarded as evidence of its paramount importance. There are many other important measures awaiting consideration. The Navigation Bill has not got half way through this House, and there are other measures awaiting completion ; but this Bill has been given precedence.It should give great satisfaction to the extreme Opposition- </para>

                    <para class="block">Charlton), which commanded close attention from the House, showed deep concern for the principle of the Bill, namely, the prevention and settlement of disputes. That honorable member expressed himself as willing to submit his proposals in Committee, and to consider any suggestion from other honorable members, in order to make this Bill satisfactory to all concerned. If we, as a House, approach the consideration of the Bill in that spirit, I am quite sure that we shall produce legislation which will, at any rate, tend to the permanent settlement of disputes and so avoid many of those strikes which cause such inconvenience and loss to the country. Surely it is possible for seventy-five representative men to devise means to that end. This may not be a perfect measure, but seeing that the Arbitration Act is highly imperfect, we ought to do what we can to make it effective. Personally, I should not object to amend the Conciliation andArbitration Act sufficiently to provide what is sought by the Bill; but since that is not proposed, let us deal with the measure before us. &#39;I am a believer in industrial arbitration; and I have been disgusted at the fact that awards given by the Court have not been adhered to, simply because they were not quite satisfactory to certain persons. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. All I desire is to get honorable members opposite in a frame of mind to realize that in these matters they are not the &#34; only pebbles on the beach.&#34; I can only repeat that this is a Bill which concerns the whole . of Australia, and not only one or two sections of the community ; and I  cannot sit down- without saying how impressed I was with the calm, collected, and sane manner in which the honorable member for Hunter presented his case. Taking that honorable member&#39;s statements to be correct, the men whom he represents are not sufficiently paid; and, therefore, it becomes our duty to provide some means ! of ascertaining the condition of the coal industry, not only in  the  eastern States, il it right through to Western Australia. Coal-mining is a key industry. Almost every other industry, and the comforts of the community generally, depend upon it. The difficulties surrounding the carrying on of that industry should command the attention of this House until they are solved. We should not delay attempting a solution of  them  until the country is plunged into the turmoil of a strike. The honorable member for Hunter pointed out that they could be readily dealt with at the present time. The wages which the coal miners earn, according to his figures, are absolutely inadequate for them to live upon, in view of present prices df commodities. It, therefore, becomes us to try to discover what profit, if any, is made on coal; and, if it is found to be necessary in order to pay better wages in the industry to increase the price of coal, the public must be called upon to put up with that increase as they are called upon to pay the increased prices necessary for the production of other commodities. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has expressed himself in a way in which I venture to say he has often expressed himself &#39; outside this House. Honorable members sitting with him on the other side have also expressed themselves in a similar manner. The honorable member made a rough-and-ready statement in condemnation of arbitration. He told us that workmen in Australia are not accustomed to abide by the decisions and awards of the Arbitration Court, and so he condemns arbitration in general. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing now with a &#39;definite statement which the honorable member made in the course of his speech, and which I challenged. As a matter of fact, the obedience of Australian workmen to awards of the Arbitration Court is probably unique in the history of industrial disputes in any part of the world. I cannot stand here and permit a charge levelled against Australian workmen to pass without challenge. </para>

                            <para>- I was saying something about the speech made by the honorable member for Flinders. He dealt with the matter under consideration in a very superior way, from his own point of view, but I repeat that I never listened to a speech that was so full of contradictory statements. He went to no end of trouble to tell us that every other part of the world is more afflicted with industrial turmoil than is Australia. He told us that as the advice of a man who had recently been round the world. He told us that England is a seething cauldron of industrial trouble, and that France and America are in a similar position. This, according to the honorable member, is the one country that is free from all this turmoil. Then he went on to say that, in dealing with this Bill, we ought to adopt the measures that have been adopted in Great Britain. He talked* by and large about the Whitley Committee. It. was nothing new to honorable members on this side to hear about that Committee. One of the principal reasons why I consider we should have plenty of time to consider this measure is that I should be very doubtful about the wisdom of inserting in it any of the recommendations adopted in the legislation of a country that, on the statement of the honorable member for Flinders r is seething with industrial trouble to-day. That is the country to which the honorable member advises us to go for ideas if we wish to save Australia from industrial turmoil. </para>

                            <para>- By the employers and their representatives. The honorable member for Flinders says that he is in a fog about this Bill, and does not understand it. I say that if the money proposed to be spent in bringing about a revolutionary change under this measure were expended in providing another Judge, for instance, for the Arbitration Court, it would be infinitely more to the advantage of Australia. &#39; </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, we are to believe that because this is the most important measure ever introduced here the Government took a step to kill the Bill in its infancy. If this is an important measure, why the haste and hurry in discussing it? Why should honorable members be placed in the position of honorable members on the other side who have admitted that they do not understand the Bill, although I venture . to say they had ample opportunity upstairs at the precious Caucus meeting to learn all about it. Notwithstanding all that the Government have done, we find that even their own supporters do not know what is contained in the measure. To refer to another of the contradictions &#39; of the honorable member for Flinders, he told us that we cannot have arbitration without industrial unionism. He said, further, that the kind of unionism&#39; he would devise himself would be the best thing this country could have. He said that without unionism we cannot have arbitration. But when he was asked whether he would agree that under this measure recognition should be given only to recognised industrial unions, he said, &#34; I would not shut out into outer darkness those who d.o not choose to join a union.&#34; He told us that it was necessary for men&#39; to be in a union before they could be brought before the Arbitration Court, yet he would not make it compulsory for men in any industry to join a union. The honorable member made one statement with which I agree. He said that one of the principal causes of industrial unrest in this country to-day is to be found in the increased cost of living. Then he gave us his principal lecture of the evening. I fully expected it from him. I have heard it from him before. He would smite hip and thigh every one on this side or anywhere else who would dare to suggest that the large profits made in Flinders-lane might be quoted as a reason for any unrest. People who would make such a suggestion are, in the opinion of the honorable member, enemies of their country. He says that such a condition of affairs does not exist. I heard the honorable member say that before, and I make this definite Statement now to him, and challenge him to contradict it. </para>

He made the definite statement that there is no justification for saying that because prices are manipulated in Flinders-lane, that that constitutes a reason for unrest in this country to-day. I tell the honorable member that I recently visited woollen mills at Geelong, and had a definite statement from a gentleman at the head of those mills that cloth was being supplied through one end of Flinders-lane at 12s. a yard, and came out at the other end at 30s. a yard. </para>

                            <para>- I &#39; am satisfied with the statement made to me. The honorable member for Flinders told us that the profits of firms in Flinders-lane never exceed 50 per cent. If the honorable member can prove that the difference  between  12s. &#39; and 30s. is only 50 per cent, he should be wearing the mantle of the Treasurer. It was rumoured that he was to be appointed Treasurer, and he certainly would be an excellent man for the position if he could so manipulate figures as to . make the difference between 12s. and 30s. only 50 per cent. An honorable member reminds me of another of the honorable member&#39;s inconsistencies, but I have no intention of proceeding further in this direction. . I content myself with this definite statement from the head of one of the principal woollen mills in Victoria, which is an indication of how a commodity of this kind is manipulated when passing through Flinders-lane. It is but one out of many instances which I could -quote in answer to the statement of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> that Flinders-lane is a . place where nothing but innocence reigns, and where nothing is done which is capable of causing industrial unrest. </para>

I have no enthusiasm for it, and cannot conceive cf any good coming out of it. In the- beginning -we asked the Prime Minister (Mr.&#39; Hughes) to allow us time to consult with1 those concerned outside, namely, the industrialists of this country; but he told us that that could not be done, and that as those who- represent organized labour would have every opportunity of putting their point of view, the necessity of consulting organized labour outside was not apparent. There are honorable members in this House- who certainly can -speak for organized labour outside  but it appears to me that the Prime Minister does -not wish to learn what is the voice of organized labour in the &#39;matter, for the next thing he- did&#39; was- to &#34; gag.&#34; the discussion on- what  he- admits  is the- most important -measure ever- introduced &#39;in this House.&#39; </para>

                            <para>- Having said it, I withdraw it. The measure is a sham, pretending to give something when, as a matter of fact, it gives nothing. Judging by his own remarks, the Prime Minister has lost no opportunity of ascertaining the views of those opposed to labour, and in this, as in other matters, I believe it is his principal concern to do that which is agreeable to the forces that keep him in power, while at the same time giving very little opportunity to organized labour to put forward their point of view. I agree with one thing which the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has said this evening. The honorable member spoke as one representing a country constituency, and told us of the wheat he grows; but I remind him that there are honorable members on this side of the House who are just as capable of speaking for those who grow wheat, and who possibly grow quite as good wheat as that grown by the honorable member. </para>

There are here men quite as capable of speaking for the primary producers as is any honorable member sitting in the Corner. Furthermore, let me add that if honorable members in the Corner continue to vote and speak as they have been doing since they have come into this Parliament, they will not convince many producers outside that they have their interests at heart. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to reply to the remarks of the honorable members for Dampier and Eden-Monaro. I did not hear the latter honorable member speaking; but according to the report of his speech in the newspapers, he seemed to attribute all the industrial unrest in this county to the go slow policy of the workmen. To a charge of that character, one whose duty it is to have regard for the interests of the workmen of this country cannot turn a deaf ear. These honorable member  who talk about the go-slow policy of the workers have not a word to say about the go-slow policy of those who have sent them here. </para>

In other words, because the men engaged in the boot trade had been giving effect to what the Prime Minister has urged - that is to say, they had been &#34;producing, producing, and producing,&#34; which, the right honorable gentleman says, alone will bring about the salvation of the world- an oversupply of boots has resulted. Are we getting boots any cheaper? No. But because of this over-supply, brought&#39; about by the men who have accepted the advice of the Prime Minister to &#34; produce, produce, and produce,&#34; they have been obliged to remain idle for about three days a week. Such is the go-slow policy practised by those who send here honorable members who support the Government; and, as a matter of fact, the real go-slow policy which is killing industry in this country, and causing industrial unrest by forcing up prices, is that which is adopted by the very people who are the opponents of organized labour. </para>

Both he and other witnesses affirmed that the price of commodities was regulated by the cost of their replacement, so that if there has been a terrific fall in the price of leather we ought to be able to purchase boots at a reasonable price to-day, although, as a matter of fact, we are unable to do so. Upon the other hand, our boot factories are closing down. They are adopting the &#34; go-slow &#34; policy. </para>

                            <para>- When the Treasurer was absent from the chamber the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> stated that the principal cause of industrial unrest in Australia was the high cost of living. That was the only statement he made with which I agreed. I come now to my principal objections to the Bill. In the first place, it provides that tribunals shall be appointed consisting of three representatives of the two parties to any dispute, and a  chairman  who, in the event of the parties being unable to agree upon his selection, will be the nominee of the Government. This measure, therefore, offers no hope for the settlement of industrial disputes. I do not know that there is the slightest chance of getting three employees and three employers to agree upon the selection of a  chairman.  If they cannot do so, they will be obliged to accept as  chairman  the nominee of the Government. A council thus constituted, is expected to effect the settlement of any industrial dispute which may arise. Its  chairman  will naturally take the side of the employers. There is nothing in the Bill to show whether the Government nominee will be on the council for an hour, a week, or a year. It is because we are hopelessly in the dark upon these matters that we require a longer time to consider the measure. The Government have really strangled the Bill in its infancy. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad that you, sir, have at last observed the honorable member. It has been stated by honorable members opposite that the party to which I belong have offered no panacea for industrial unrest in these States in which Labour has been in power. May I remind them that there waa published in yesterday&#39;s newspapers a complete answer to that statement . I propose to show, upon the authority of the Commonwealth Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> that in the State in which a Labour Government has been in power for some time, there has been less industrial turmoil than has obtained elsewhere, for the simple reason that the cost of living has been cheaper and the. purchasing power of the sovereign greater. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the amounts necessary to purchase what would have cost &#163;1 in the various State capitals in 1911 were as follows: - Sydney, in December, 1919, 33s.1d.; June, 1920, 36s. 5d. ; Melbourne, in December, 1919, 31s. 4d.; June, 1920, 35s. 2d.; Adelaide, in December, 1919, 30s.8d. ; June, 1920, 35s. 1d.; Perth, in December, 1919, 38s. 9d.; June, 1920, 33s.1d. </para>

                            <para>- In the other States the Nationalists have been in power all the time, but the cost of living has not been reduced. In the one State in which Nationalists and Labourites have been in power, the cost of living has been cheaper than it has been in the States in which Nationalists have been in office all the time. Let us take the decrease in the purchasing power of the sovereign between December, 1919, and June, 1920. In Sydney that decrease was. 3s.4d. -there was a Labour Government in power in New South Wales during that time - in Melbourne it was 4s. 10d., in Adelaide 3s. 5d. and in Brisbane. 2s. 2d. Both in Queensland and New South Wales during the past six months the cost of living has been reduced to a greater extent than it has been in any other State.. I have no faith whatever in this measure. The only real remedy for industrial unrest is to abolish the cause of it by dealing with the profiteers of this country. The only way of doing that is to place upon the Treasury Benches a Labour Government similar to those which have done such effective work in some of the States. </para>
