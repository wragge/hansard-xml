                        <para>- Large auction sales  of sheep-skins are announced to take place in Sydney and in Melbourne to-morrow  and on Friday. The skins that will be offered have mostly accumulated because the owners have been awaiting some definite statement from the Government on the subject of export conditions. In view of the statement made by the Prime Minister, and published in last Thursday&#39;s newspapers, I ask him if he is now in a position to inform the House what steps the Government propose to take to permit the exporting of sheep-skins and wool from sheep killed after the 30th June last? </para>

                        <para>- I have said, in the plainest terms, that all skins and wool from sheep killed after the 30th June last may be exported, but as an Executive meeting has not since been held, the embargo has not been formally removed. I assumed, however, that every one was acting in accordance with my public declaration of the Government&#39;s policy. A meeting of the Executive will be held at the earliest moment possible to remove the embargo. </para>

If that be so, I ask whether the Acting Treasurer will make a similar arrangement for the advantage of soldiers who insured prior to going to the war, so that they may get cash for their bonds on paying three years&#39; premiums? </para>

                                <para>- It has been ascertained that in many cases the payments referred to, viz., to discharged members of the Australian Imperial Force in military hospitals on 25th February, 1919, and subsequently, of amounts which, together with the pension and repatriation allowances, will be equal to the military pay of rank, have not been made. There has been considerable difficulty in obtaining the information required by the Pensions Department for broken and retrospective periods. It Is expected, however, that most of the payments will be effected shortly. </para>

I am having inquiries made into the matter as promised, but, in fairness to the league, I wish to inform the honorable member that I have received a telegram from the  president  of the league in Sydney, in which he asserts that the allegation of discrimination by the league in charges for tweed to members and nonmembers is untrue so far &#34;as his State is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- On the 7th July, the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> asked me a question as to whether I would lay on the table of the House, a copy of an agreement between the Broken Hill mining companies and the British Board of Trade. I then. re-, plied that I was under the. impression that I had previously informed the honorable member that the terms of the agreement which he has in mind were not completed, and, therefore, a copy could not be laid on the table. I have since made further inquiries and ascertained that my memory served me right when I replied to the honorable member on the 7th July. I desire to further inform him that the details of the contract, to which the parties are the Zinc Producers Association and the British Board of Trade, have not yet. been finalized. When the agreement is received, the question of tabling it will be duly considered. </para>

                    <para>The essential point in the ruling which I gave on Thursday is not mentioned at all in that motion. My ruling was that the case of Father Jerger could not be discussed in Parliament while it was <inline font-style="italic">sui judice.</inline> I mentioned that fact to the House on Friday in order that the honorable member might have an opportunity to amend it. Perhaps the honorable member wall now ask the House for leave to amend his motion, so that it will state accurately the ruling I gave. </para>

                            <para>- The motion will be in order if you, sir, will obtain the notice I actually gave, and which set out the position correctly. I moved to disagree to the ruling which you gave when I was speaking on Thursday evening in reference to an inquiry, which I referred to as a make-believe inquiry, before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran at the instance of the Executive Government. I&#39; was proceeding to make some condemnatory comments upon that inquiry, and the action of the Government in connexion therewith. As a rule, I am very reluctant to move that the Speaker&#39;s ruling be disagreed to, but I think that in this matter it is imperative that something be done by Parliament itself to vindicate the right of honorable members to fully and freely discuss all matters of public importance, and, particularly, abuses of. the power of the Executive Government. At all times, honorable members should uphold the right of Parliament to freely discuss such matters, and it is rather significant that this ruling was given while a motion of censure on the Government was being discussed. Of course, discussion must conform to the Standing Orders; but usually, when speaking on a motion of want of confidence or censure, honorable members are allowed a wider range, and greater latitude, than in ordinary debates. It is in order that Parliament itself may affirm the right of honorable members to discuss these matters ot public interest, and particularly misfeasances of the Executive Government, that I move this motion. That is the first reason. But I have a second reason, and that is to protect the Courts, and in this particular case the High Court, from having any responsibility shifted from the Executive Government on to it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling stands, and Parliament is precluded from discussing this matter, the impression will go forth to the public that the High Court had some jurisdiction to decide whether or not the Father Jerger inquiry was properly  conducted, whereas, as a matter of fact, the question submitted for decision to the High Court was whether the Executive Government had power to deport the Reverend Father Jerger, or anybody else. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke had no jurisdiction to inquire whether or not the Executive Government had abused its powers. Of course, it would be very convenient for the Executive to shift on to the shoulders of the Court responsibility for misfeasance of the Executive. What are the grounds upon which it is out of order to discuss matters that are pending in a Court of law? In the first place, it is considered improper, or unfitting, that matters should be discussed in Parliament that might have the effect of prejudicing the trial of persons against whom a charge is pending. The other reason is the protection of Judges from unjust attacks or attempts to influence them in the performance of their judicial functions. For those two reasons, discussion in Parliament of cases which are <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> is held to be improper, and sometimes out of order. I refer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to the ruling given by the  Speaker  of the House of Commons on the 6th May, T889. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Atherley-Jones  was addressing the House in regard to certain prosecutions in Ireland, and a point of order having been taken as to the propriety of his remarks, the  Speaker  Sal/ <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> page 1255, vol. 335 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of the House of Commons) - </para>

                        <para>Nor am I aware of any distinct and definite ruling from the Chair, though I am aware of frequent expressions of opinion, both from Ministers in this House and other members, with regard to the impropriety of alluding to pending trials in such a way as to prejudice a fair trial of the case. </para>

                    <para>That sets out the grounds on which in that particular case the  Speaker  thought that the remarks that were being made were extending beyond the bounds of propriety. Are any of those conditions present in this case ? Is it not extraordinary that instead of my proposed remarks tending to prejudice the fair trial of an individual, they were in demand of such a trial? That being so, the case cannot be within the rule that I have read. And it cannot come within that rule on the ground that what was said was intended, or calculated, or could be construed&#39; in any way, to reflect on a Judge when no specific motion to deal with him was before the House. On the contrary, the observations which were ruled out of order were based on the assumption that the decision of the learned Judge who decided the case was right. They were comment upon the action of the Executive in abusing a power which the Court said that it had. It is perfectly obvious, I submit, that comments, or observations, or discussions about the matter of that inquiry could not in any sense tend to .prejudice the fair trial of anybody, nor could they reflect upon the learned Judge who tried the case, or upon the Courts generally. On the other hand, they tended to make , for the fair trial of persons generally. I should be sorry to confine my remarks to any one particular individual, and-, not now only, but for years, I have contended that no one should be deported from these shores, because we should be able to deal with offenders within our own borders; certainly no one should be deported until a specific charge had been made against him and he had been fairly tried before a jury of his countrymen - a right that was wrung from King John over 700 years ago, and one that is being violated almost every day in this country at the present time. </para>
                    <para>I now wish to examine the facts of the case in order to show honorable members that the matter to which I was referring is not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> It is not the subject-matter of a decision by a Court, and it is not under appeal from a Court. In order to understand that, we must know what the matter was that was brought before the High Court of Australia in the Father Jerger case. That case was a challenging of the authority or power of the Executive to deport persons, with or without trial. The contention was put forward by the. counsel for the Rev. Father Jerger that the War Precautions Act had&#39; come to an end, and that certain provisions of it were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of this Parliament. It cannot be suggested that the matter of the inquiry held before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran had anything to do with the case. That inquiry took place before the case was brought before the Court, and was not referred to in any way while it was before the Court. It was not brought before the Court as part of the subject-matter upon which the Court&#39;s decision was asked. </para>

However, you were misled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> because I contend that there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt but that your decision was wrong. I am one of those who believe in supporting the  Speaker,  whose authority must be upheld. I would be the first to object to any challenging of your authority. But I ask honorable members to note the difference between upholding your authority and dissenting from your ruling. You remarked, the other day. that the  Speaker  is never wrong. He is never wrong until Parliament has dissented from his ruling. While the ruling stands it must be upheld. If, on Thursday evening, I. had defied your ruling, no doubt, certain things would have occurred, and, whether in the final result your ruling was determined to be right or wrong, honorable members would have been justified in taking, on the motion of the Prime Minister or other Minister in charge of the  House, certain action against .rae. Defiance of the Chair is entirely different from asking the House to declare its rights iri the discussion of public matters. la this case honorable members should be actuated only by the desire to arrive at the right conclusion. It should be no offence to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that a majority of honorable members declare a particular ruling to be wrong. What is the position ? I am precluded, by your ruling, from discussing the matter of the inquiry, and shall not try to do so by a side-wind. I wish to confine myself to what is strictly relevant to the motion I have moved. I was prevented from saying anything about that inquiry, strongly as I felt upon it. I cannot say anything regarding it now, strongly as I feel about it. But the daily press can discuss it. Public meetings can be held throughout the country to discuss it. Parliament alone, the ruler of the country, is gagged, and members can say nothing about it. The Parliament that controls the Executive cannot say anything about it. In the train I read the </para>

But it can be discussed by every one else. Even a Minister of the Crown can repeat here by interjection what he said elsewhere. If the matter were <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> the rules preventing its discussion would prevent persons outside Parliament from discussing it now. The Minister says that the Reverend Father Jerger is a traitor, but he is afraid to submit the matter to the trial of a jury. </para>

I point out that if this ruling stands it will rob honorable members of their right of discussion; and it is only in that sense that I am using the illustration with respect to the Minister for the Navy. I suppose, however, that he is so thin-skinned because he knows that the Executive has been guilty of such a; gross travesty of justice. </para>

If the honorable member were permitted to revive matters other than that which is embraced within the motion, there would be no limit to this discussion. </para>

                                <para>- There is only one point raised, and that is whether the Commonwealth Executive has power to deport persons, or not. This matter regarding the inquiry held before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran was not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and is not now <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Responsibility rests upon honorable members to. say whether or not they will prevent a discussion on this matter; and it is an individual responsibility. Are honorable members going to stand  for  this, namely, that they will not allow the matter to be discussed upon the floor  of  the House, seeing that a notice of appeal has &#39;been given regarding the power of the Executive to deport people from this country? If they -are going to do so, discussion can be held up in this Chamber, not only pending the final decision of the High Court, but until a decision has been sought from and given by the ultimate tribunal of appeal of the British Empire; that is, the Privy Council.&#39; It would be absolutely ridiculous, but that would be the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling, and of honorable members supporting it. </para>

                        <para>Now, I desire to give an illustration of a matter which may be referred to in debate in this Chamber, which is not the issue in a trial. I am referring to volume 335 of British <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Parliamentary Debates, third series (page 1251). The member of the House of Commons whom I shall quote is. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atherley-Jones,</inline> whose knowledge of the Standing Orders of the Imperial Parliament no honorable member will doubt. He was speaking in reference to the prosecution of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare</inline> and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison,</inline> and was called to order for referring to matters that were in issue at the trial. He desisted, but went on to make other statements, which I shall read in order to illustrate what was held to be in order as not being part of the subject-matter of the trial - </para>
                        <para>Now, what I want to ask the House is what offence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> committed in handing in these loaves of bread, and, secondly, what is of more importance, assuming that he had committed an offence, which might be the subject of some civil remedy, what justified the police in arresting him ? In amplification of this question, I wish to ask the right honorable gentleman what are the functions of the Royal Irish Constabulary in respect of evictions? I have followed with great care and interest the information we have at various times received in regard to the conduct of the Irish Constabulary at evictions, but, as an English lawyer, and speaking, as I know I do, the confirmed opinion of every member of my own profession, I say without hesitation that the duties of the police at evictions are confined within these limits. </para>
                        <para class="block">And so on. Those&#39; statements were not held to be out of order. Later on, as reported at page 1258, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> AtherleyJones,  dealing with the conduct of the police with regard to Mir. Conybeare, said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Although these gentlemen were under a charge that had yet to be dealt with, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Atherley-Jones  discussed in this way the manner in which the police had dealt with them. That being so, surely I should have been allowed to refer to the manner in which the Commonwealth Executive dealt with this internee. Here was an actual trial, and the matter was discussed in the House of Commons by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atherley-Jones,</inline> whose knowledge in such matters no one will doubt. He referred in the way I have set out to the conduct of the police connected with the case. Could I not, then, refer similarly, even if the matter were <inline font-style="italic">sub judice -</inline> which it is not - to the manner in which the Commonwealth Executive had abused their powers 1 Was it not open for me to refer to the way in which they had hounded down this internee and persecuted him at every turn?

I would point out, however, that the specific motion before the Chair is merely one to diss.ent from my ruling, and advantage should not be taken of such a motion to make charges against Ministers or any one else. The honorable member should simply deal with what, in his opinion, are the merits or demerits of the ruling itself. I ask him to confine himself to that aspect of the. matter. </para>

                                <para>- It is necessary to. show what would be the consequence of giving effect to the ruling from which we ask the House to dissent. I have quoted from a speech- made in the House of Commons in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atherley-Jones</inline> was allowed to use some very strong language. He asked, when dealing with the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conybeare,</inline> why the police were allowed to go about taking notes of private conversations of a person who was to he tried ?&#39; That surely was a reflection, and a very justifiable reflection, upon the action of the Executive Government of the day. </para>

                        <para>I am not going to detain the House any longer. I have set out what, in my opinion, are the considerations upon which honorable members ought to act in coming to a conclusion on this question. It is not, so far as you are concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> a personal matter. It is a matter not of upholding your rights OV authority as  Speaker,  but of upholding the rights and authority of this House. Every member has to shoulder . a personal  responsibility for the vote he casts. The -responsibility for the ruling given by you when you called .me to order was yours, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker;</inline> but every honorable member who, when we divide on this question, votes to say that you were right in not permitting me to make &#187;i comment upon this Executive action on the part of the Government must accept the responsibility for your ruling. That responsibility, I am sure, honorable members are prepared to take. I am prepared to take my responsibility, and I have no doubt that every honorable member is prepared to shoulder his own. But I would remind honorable members who contend that they come here to stand for the upholding of the authority of Parliament, and for the restoration of constitutional government, that one of the first things they must do is to see that there shall be no curbing of  the rights of honor-able members in this House to speak in public upon all matters, and to take the consequences of what they say. If I said something that was not in conformity with public opinion I should stiffer accordingly. After all the final arbiter, the final judge of us all, is .public opinion. We all know that during the years of the war the Executive Government were given extraordinary powers. It was said that because of the war it &#39;was necessary that they should have them. Those powers were used tyrannically. But in addition to v&#39;est- <inline font-style="italic">ing</inline> them in the Government and to setting up a class of tin-pot tyrants in this country, are honorable members opposite going to allow us to be prevented from expressing in this House our views upon every action of the Executive? I repeat, sir, that the responsibility passes from you. -No doubt you came to your conclusion as the result of being misinformed by some responsible Minister. The responsibility passes from you to the shoulders of honorable .members generally, and I hope that they will do their duty. </para>

                        <para class="block">It will thus be seen that the question of a man&#39;s personal liberty, which is involved in this writ, was raised by the honorable member. During the debate he sought to create, and might have been successful in creating, in this House a political opinion upon the case while it was still before a Court for decision. That was the atmosphere which the honorable member intended to create. Our functions as a legislative body are clear, and there can be no doubt that the House is perfectly justified in criticising freely the actions of the Government and in calling upon it to answer for its conduct. Such criticism is clearly within the functions of Parliament. The Courts of law, however, stand in a different position. They are created to deal, amongst other things, with questions relating to the liberty of individuals and to take into account the circumstances concerning such matters. The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> will no doubt have a clear recollection of the ruling that he, as  Speaker,  gave when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, then the honorable member for Flinders, sought to discuss something relating to the Australian Workers Union, which at that time had a case before the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- Such allegations may be true or they may not, but it appears to me to be quite irregular to discuss that question in this House. Supposing an election petition had been lodged, very clearly it would be out of order to ask this House to discuss or pass judgment upon a matter which is under consideration in an election Court. The same reasoning must apply if the twenty-one days, which is the period within which a petition may be presented, have not lapsed. I think it would be quite out of order for the honorable gentleman to enter into , a discussion as to whether corruption took place at an election when the twenty-one days have not expired within which a petition may be lodged. </para>

                        <para>So careful was the  Speaker  to preserve proper relations between Parliament and the Courts that, although in the&#39; case in question an &#169;lection petition had not been presented, he held it to be absolutely improper to discuss in the House matters relating to the election which might come before the Court for determination. It is a decided principle, and I am showing the extent to which the  Speaker  carries it out. The facts in the case were clear as they presented themselves to the House at the time, the ruling was given. The matter was before the Court, and the extent to which&#34; the circumstances of the case were to be brought forward could not be known. </para>

                                <para>- It was a step towards ascertaining the facts, and while the matter was being dealt with it was- an improper thing to attempt to review them and discuss them in the House, seeing that a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> had been applied for, and an application for an injunction made, giving ample opportunity to the Court to deal with the case. The case is still going on. In Adelaide, an application has been made to a State Judge for a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus.</inline> In every way the matter is being attacked. It is certainly true that a man is entitled to take every legal remedy at his command, but that is not the point at issue to-day. The question is whether it is right or proper to bring political influence to bear in this House in such a way that it might interfere with the administration of justice. </para>

                            <para>. - I rise to support the motion; and I hope that members will be very jealous of the right of the House to discuss matters of public importance. On a motion of this kind there is always a danger, as there is in regard to all public questions in Parliament, of its being decided, if not on party lines, at least under the influence of party considerations. It is a pity that this is so ; but I hope that it will&#39; not be the case to-day. When I was discussing this matter on Thursday last, I received  from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> a very explicit assurance that I must not discuss the Father Jerger case in any aspect whatever. That was nearly an end for me; but I went a little further under very great difficulties indeed, until I was ordered to cease my remarks. Some of the features in connexion with the Father Jerger case are purely political; others are purely legal. One of the questions before the Court was a complicated legal one as to whether, on the facts before the Court, Father Jerger could be declared an alien. The question involved the examination of British law, and a comparison with Australian law, and also involved the whole ambit of the law concerning nationality. In fact, it was a question which might very well have gone from a single Justice to the High Court, and then to the Privy Council, and before a final decision might be given the time could very well extend to at least twelve months. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is correct; that pure question of law was decided by the Full Court, and, therefore, we are bound to assume, although it is not material to the present discussion, that it had been decided that Father Jerger was not British, and was an alien. But is&#39; it proper, when the Counts are leisurely considering a pure question of law involving an inquiry as to whether a man is an alien or not, that we in this Parliament should not he able to consider a purely political question - the propriety of the Executive in taking a certain course of action in regard to deportations? That matter does not involve, the jurisdiction of a Court.. The, object of our Standing Orders was to protect persons upon trial, and to protect the Court. It was conceived for the purpose of guarding any person whose interests were at stake; hut it was not designed with the object of preventing the discussion of public questions which are not in issue in the Courts. For example, on Thursday last I was desirous of raising what I regarded as great impropriety on tie part of the Government in preventing counsel from having access to Father Jerger to get his instructions ; hut <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> prevented me from bringing forward that aspect of the matter, although it had nothing to do with the Court. I was about to submit that Father Jerger could not have a fair trial unless he was allowed to see counsel and give instructions for his defence. The matter was quite anterior to the trial, and I thought it was something that demanded the greatest publicity in order that the community might learn that the course of justice was being interfered with in every way. This was a purely political question, and not a legal matter at issue in this particular case. I also wanted to raise a purely political, or perhaps ethical, or even religious, question as to whether  it was proper on the part of the Government to prevent Father Jerger from being interviewed by his confessor, also a matter that had nothing whatever to do with the Courts, and the discussion of which could not possibly affect the judgment of a Court. There is one- question of law as to whether the War Precautions Act is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> that should be discussed in this House, and the Government ought to be subjected to caustic criticism for their attitude. But it is suggested that, because some proceedings have been taken under, say, Order 2 j or some other section of the War Precautions Regulations, it is incompetent for honorable members here to point out that long ago the Government should have removed from the statute-book the whole of the war precautions legislation. Surely the House will be with those who declare that every honorable member should have the right to discuss the purely political question as to whether this legislation should be repealed or not. It has been a burning question with us, and every day it is becoming a more pressing political matter. Many of us consider that the administration of the Act is wrong, oppressive, and improper, and as it becomes more so every day, and is purely a political question, we should not be prevented from discussing it merely because some section of the Act is under consideration in connexion with the proposed deportation of Father Jerger. I am sorry that there is now some doubt as to the question we are to decide. If the question is whether or not&#39; a case which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> may be properly discussed in this House it should be easy to decide. I do not wish to discuss in this&#39; </para>

                        <para class="block">House any particular matter which, is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> But that is not the issue. The question before us is whether we may discuss political questions relating to the War Precautions Act and deportation, which were not in any way in issue in the case which was before a Court, and for our purpose and argument cite the case of the Rev. Father Jerger. I cannot understand the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> with his standing at the&#39; Bar and his responsibility in this House, defending the position of the Government in this regard. The question of the propriety of such a discussion would not have been raised but that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cock),</inline> when he saw that I was touching on ground that was delicate - not from the point of view of the Court, but from the point of view of the Government - in order to protect himself from the unlimited resources of his intellectual vacuity, raised a point of order that I,&#39; by my own admission, proposed to carry this matter further. I did say that we proposed to carry it further, but I did not say whether it was to be carried to the platform or to the Courts, or merely that the indignation which was felt by the public would find expression in some way or other. I hope the House will display sufficient self-esteem and regard for its paramount public duty to vote for the motion, and thus assert its own right to examine urgent public problems carefully. </para>

Beyond that I could not go. I did not profess to decide whether it was or was not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> but acted on the assurance of the Minister that it was. </para>

                        <para>I might draw attention to another fact, and that is that the point of order was not raised for the first time when the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> gave notice of his intention to move to dissent from. my ruling. Altogether, it was raised no fewer than four times during last Thursday&#39;s discussion. I was temporarily called from the Chamber to attend to some urgent business, and the  Deputy Speaker,  who relieved me, informed me that during my temporary absence he had ruled that the matter could not be discussed. Then, when the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was speaking, my attention was called to his remarks by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> I ruled that if the matter he was discussing was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> he could not continue to discuss it. The honorable member for West Sydney raised a point of order affecting another phase of the question, and I ruled that my original decision still stood. Later in the evening, when the honorable member for West Sydney was speaking on the censure motion, he attempted to argue this particular case. </para>

                        <para>I feel sure that the House will see the unwisdom of discussing matters which are pending before the Courts. Had this matter been finished with by the Courts, there would have been no objection to a full and thorough discussion of it, and I should not have attempted in any way to interfere with such a discussion of it. It was only because, in my judgment, it was not right to discuss it, and not in accordance with our own practice and the traditions of the British House of Commons, and the decision of the House on a previous occasion, that I ruled that the discussion could not continue. My ruling was grounded on the practice of the House of Commons as I understood it, on the practice of this House, and on an actual decision of this House on a previous occasion, to which I have already made reference. </para>

                                <para>.- I shall be brief, because other members desire to discuss the motion ; but there are one or two points which should not be lost sight of. You stated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that your ruling was based on the principle which had been accepted by the House of Commons that nothing should be said in debate that tended to prevent men from getting a fair trial. Now, surely what was said on Thursday last did not tend to prevent any man from getting a fair trial, seeing that it was  a demand for  a  fair trial. We have been told that the case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> If so, it is extraordinary that there should be an attempt to send Father Jerger away while he is still awaiting trial. The Government informed you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the case was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and yet they have moved heaven and earth to send the man out of the country while his case is before the Courts, and had it not been for the action  of the British seamen on the <inline font-style="italic">Nestor</inline> he would not be in the country &#34;to-day. What was said was not tending to prejudice the granting of a fair trial. It is not right for the Government  to  prevent a fair trial, or to prevent members from speaking on this case. On Wednesday last, before I rose to move my motion of censure, the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> asked a question of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> about Father Jerger&#39;s case, .and the right honorable gentleman&#39;s reply was that the honorable member would have an opportunity to talk as much as he liked about it during the debate on the censure motion. The honorable member was, however, prevented from talking on the motion because of the arrangement to take a vote on it- before 4 o&#39;clock p.m. on Friday last. I do not think the Prime Minister endeavoured to mislead the honorable member. He, no doubt, thought that on the censure motion we should be able to discuss everything connected with the case, because it was not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> in the ordinary acceptation of the words. When a case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> no one is allowed to say or publish anything about it. The press, however, is not treating this case as <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> It knows tha&#62;t it can say what it likes about it, and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> comments upon it freely to-day. If the press can comment on it, why should not members on this side be allowed to do so? The newspapers have gone so far a.s to declare that this is the first time that an objection to deportation has been raised by us ; but that statement is a deliberate lie, because on the 17th August last the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> who was then  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party, moved a motion protesting against it, as honorable members will see by reference to our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record.  Outside the chamber any member may say what he likes about the Father Jerger case; the War Precautions Act does not prevent its discussion. Many of us have said a good deal about, not only this case, but other cases of the kind. Every person in the community is- entitled to a fair trial, and to be told who are his accusers. We have no right to assume a man to be guilty without trying him. What we say now in this matter is what we said twelve months ago. The honorable member for </para>

If the statement that this case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> means anything, it means that the trial of Father Jerger is not concluded, or that he is going to be tried. We say that he is being deported without a trial, and, therefore, the case is not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> If the case were <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> surely the Government should not be moving heaven and earth to get the reverend gentleman out of the way before a trial could take place! </para>

                                <para>- I am discussing the right of every man in Australia to fair and open trial; and it is a right and not a privilege. I regret that we are about to cast a party vote. Every honorable member who stands for liberty, for the right of every citizen to fair and open trial, should be ranged on this side when the vote is taken. It is all very well for the Honorary Minister to seek to cover his unenviable position; and it is quite fitting, from his point of view, that he should drag in the racial aspect. </para>

                            <para>.- I shall state very briefly the reasons why I intend to vote for this motion to dissent from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling. I had the pleasure of introducing to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> the town clerk of Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nesbit),</inline> who asked for an inquiry into Father Jerger&#39;s case. The right honorable gentleman promised us that he would grant an inquiry, but it merely took the form of a departmental investigation by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran. . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran is a public servant of the Commonwealth, and while I do not wish to reflect upon him in any way, it cannot 6e said that an inquiry by him constituted a hearing before a legal tribunal.  His  decision in this case does not carry with it the authority that would attach to a decision by a Court of .law. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> when he was called to order, was endeavouring to point out that when representing Father Jerger before this departmental inquiry, he was deprived of his right to put questions to witnesses. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> raised the point of order that the matter could not be referred to since the case was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and had actually been before a Court. My contention is that the inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran was not an inquiry by a Court, and that even if it could be so construed, since a decision had been given and the case had not been carried on to any legal tribunal, the honorable member for West Sydney was entitled to discuss the whole matter in the House. By means of this point of order, we had&#39; put into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> mouth the statement that the case was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and therefore could not be discussed. I am only a layman, but I have come to the conclusion that the honorable member was perfectly within his rights when he was called to order. We, as representatives of the ,people, have certain rights in this House. Surely it is open to us to criticise departmental inquiries, particularly when the proceedings have been completed. I am very friendly with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and regret exceedingly that I shall have to&#34; vote against a ruling given by him, but I am convinced&#39; that his ruling in this instance was wrong. It cannot be said that this Parliament does not stand above all Courts. The Justices of the High Court are our servants. We pay them to carry on the machinery of the law, and we ought not to be precluded from discussing any question  brought before them. No one could be injured by a discussion in this House in relation to an inquiry that had actually closed, and in which a decision had been given. It is now argued that since notice of appeal against that decision had been given the case was clearly <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> We are told that we are in duty bound to respect the decisions of the Courts. Is there not a greater obligation on the part of the Government to respect the orders of the Courts? When action is being taken before a public tribunal to restrain the deportation of Father Jerger, the Government should refrain from any attempt to deport him until the decision of the Court has been given. Our position, I contend, is unassailable. The honorable member for West Sydney, in my opinion, was quite in order. He was looking after the interests of his client, and the people of the country generally, when he was ruled out of order; and I shall certainly vote to dissent from the ruling. </para>

                            <para>.- Little remains to be added to the statement of the case against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has already fully covered the ground, and there has been no answer to his arguments. In reply to him, other matters have certainly been discussed ; but if I were to conclude that those who have followed my honorable friend were unable to distinguish between the point raised by him and that raised by them,. I should have but a very poor opinion of their intelligence. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has had a legal training, but it would be utterly absurd to dignify the remarks made by him by describing them as a legal argument. If he were not dissembling, then his ability as a lawyer stands on a very low plane. As a matter of fact, there is on the Government benches a majority who are determined1 that the Executive acts of the Ministry shall not be discussed. </para>

There has been a lot of misrepresentation, either wilful or otherwise, and I desire to show that the point for which we are contending is that the rights and privileges of honorable members must not be taken away from them. We are not now proposing to discuss in detail the Star Chamber inquiry, hut we are seeking to show what it is that the Government are cloaking under the vile pretence that the question is pending in a Court, and is, therefore, <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

                            <para>:- I support the arguments put forward by honorable members. Mr. Speaker is placed in a difficult position between two diverging statements, the claim of legal gentlemen of the Opposition that the case of Father Jerger is not <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and the assurance of the Minister who acts as legal adviser to the -Government that it is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Naturally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> cannotbe Blamed for accenting . the . legal opinion given by a Minister of the Crown. Surely in this House, which is, for the present moment, the . highest Court in Australia, our lips ought not to be . sealed . upon : this matter when nearly &#39; every -one outside and . the press are .;pesmitted to comment on it, as freely as they choose, without being penalized . for -so doing. If the gentleman whose name has been mentioned had committed some wrong, it should be proved in open Court, and, if proved, there would be no claim from honorable members such as that now put forward. I merely wish to add that, although this Parliament may be the highest Court in the country, what has been allowed to take place would not be permitted for one moment if the people, the creators of this Parliament, had the power of the recall. They would use it freely, indeed, too freely and very awkwardly for some honorable members here to-day. </para>

                        <para>Mr.FENTON (Maribymong) &#91;5.56&#93;. - Every honorable member should be vitally concerned at any attempt to filch his privileges. The usefulness of this Parliament and its opportunity to debate a great many questions that ought to be fully discussed will surely be denied to it if, oh this occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling is supported. Any honorable member who votes in favour of the ruling will be setting himself up as one who desires to curtail debate. There has been no Court proceeding in connexion with the Father Jerger case except last week, when an appeal was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke in. chambers. I do not regard the inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran as Court proceedings. Yet honorable members have been pulled up at once by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> for attempting to discuss what occurred at that inquiry. </para>

                            has said.; but, like the flowers that bloom . in the spring, his remarks &#39; &#39; have nothing to do with the case.&#34; I quite agree that there might be some impropriety in discussing a matter in Parliament if there was a likelihood of prejudicing the fair trial of any person or of unduly influencing judicial functions; hut the real issue in this case is as to whether the matter to which I was referring was
                            <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline>
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                            has stated that this question has been the subject-matter of several rulings, and I can quite appreciate the manner in which he has been misled on the point as to whether this particular case was
                            <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline>
                            The blame rests entirely on Ministers of the Crown - in the first place, the Minister for the Navy
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline>
                            and in the second place, -the Minister for Works and Railways
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline>
                            However, in-order to make perfectly clear what was the issue I had raised, I cannot -do better than refer to the report of what took place on the occasion on which the ruling was given.

                                <para>- The debate is on the same subject-matter. If we are at one in regard to the facts there is nothing to argue about; but if there is a difference of opinion as to what are the facts, the most reliable source to which we may refer is the gentleman who sits at the table reporting for <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> who has no reason for misreporting what is said. </para>

In effect, your ruling went so far as to say that because the Reverend Father Jerger had a case in the Courts I could make no reference to him or to his deportation. </para>

                                <para>- I stated earlier this afternoon that I was quite prepared to have my motion discussed in the light of the circumstances in which the notice was given; that is to say, it must be read into the context of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceedings on Thursday evening. I do not think I should alter the terms of the motion, because it expresses very well what was in my mind, if it is read into the context of the report of Thursday&#39;s proceedings. If honorable members vote against this motion they will be voting for the curtailment of the right of parliamentary discussion on matters  of  public importance, and they will not be able to escape personal responsibility for their action. </para>

                                <para>- I must do so; but I am concerned about the people. The electors will see. recorded in black and white how honorable members voted on this motion, and it will be to the discredit of this House if the majority vote to curtail the rights of Parliament in regard to free speech. I have an idea how the vote will go this afternoon, but the day will come when another Parliament will reverse this decision, and the majority of members will declare that the ruling was wrong, and that those who supported it voted for the suppression of free speech and fair public criticism of the Executive, which they desire to keep in power. </para>

The notice of motion, as printed, makes it appear that I ruled that reference to the inquiry before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran in the Father Jerger case, and the conduct of the Executive in connexion with that inquiry, were not proper subjects for discussion in Parliament. I did not say that, although I did say that, while the case was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> it could not with propriety be discussed in Parliament. The motion, as handed in, is really an. expression of the honorable member&#39;s opinion upon my ruling. &#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members are familiar with the procedure that is usually adopted in cases of this kind. Upon a previous occasion I explained the nature of the proposed work, which was then referred to the Public Works Committee. That body has since investigated it, and has presented a report in favour of the work being carried out. Honorable members will recollect that the undertaking forms a part of the scheme of demobilization. Our  troops having returned to Australia, there has come back with them all the military equipment of a modern type that is necessary for our own&#39; defence purposes. This equipment, which represents an expenditure of several million pounds, is to be located in different parts of the Commonwealth. The stores at Liverpool, . which are designed to . house the New . South Wales portion of it-, are well on their way to completion, and the proposed stores at Seymour, which form the subject of this . motion, are intended to&#39; accommodate the Victorian quota of thir equipment. It is absolutely necessary that the works shall be undertaken immediately for the simple reason that the equipment is now coming tohand. </para>

                    <para>- I am mot quite sure !how many times -this Bill has been before the House, but certainly we have considered it more than once.It has already been passed by the Senate, but such important alterations -have been made in the form  of  the measure as originally introduced, that Professor Orme Masson, the  chairman  of the Advisory Council, has . resigned.  His  resignation was announced in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of &#39;the8th. inst. According to the report of that journal Professor Masson states that- </para>
                </talk.start>
            <para>The present Bill has, however, departed from the scheme in two important respects; omitting a provision for the appointment of advisory councils and substituting one single director for the three directors originally proposed. </para>
            <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s view is that these two alterations are not vital, and do not substantially affect the position; but, even if that view be correct, it is urged that he was not justified in making alterations without consulting the members of the Committee. </para>
            <para class="block">In explaining the reasons for his action, Professor Masson expressed the view that the alterations made by the Government would utterly ruin the entire scheme. He said that late in 1915 the Government had started upon this work. He then proceeded - </para>
            <quote>
                <para>The movement for the establishment of an Institute of Science, and Industry was the outcome of the formation of a similar body in Great Britain in 1915. The then Victorian Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hagelthorn)</inline> sent on to the Melbourne University Council the papers in connexion . with it which he received- from the Colonial Office, with . a suggestion that the scheme might be widened so as to benefit Australia. The Council; however, took the view that- Australian&#34; problems should be attacked in Australia, and that the English action should be followed on Australian lines. At about the. same time the InterState Commission made a similar suggestion. </para>
                <para>At the end of the year the University Council urged the Prime Minister,&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;,</inline> to bring together representatives of science and of industry, and such a Conference took place in the following January, when a Committee was appointed to draft a scheme of operations. </para>
                <para>There were in this scheme three essential features - entire freedom from&#39; political control (a provision with which the Prime . Minister expressed ready agreement) ; the placing of the direction in the hands of three men, of whom two were&#39; to be men of scientific attainments and one a &#34;practical&#34; man (a provision with which also, after some discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> expressed agreement) ; and the establishment of an advisory council to consist of representatives of various branches of science and of industry. The only important variation afterwards suggested by the Committee in the proposals then put forward was in the direction of replacing the single advisory council for the entire Commonwealth by a number of such councils, one for each State. &#39; When, however, after 4&#189; years, the Government had brought down a measure for the formation of a permanent institute, these provisions, deemed essential by the Committee, had been thrown aside without the Committee being in any way consulted. </para>
                <para>I look on&#39; the alterations made as vital. That such a step has been taken . without consultation with the Committee is typical of the whole trend of action on the part of the Government. As a net result of four and a half years&#39; work, I have no faith in politicians. During that time, the Committee has met once a week or oftener, . and, as an outcome of its labours, it has advised &#39;the Government regarding various developments; but the treatment of its recommendations has been such as to induce and increase the conviction that the politicians are not in sympathy with the Committee in its desire to lay down lines along which science can profitably be applied to industry. &#39; </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">Those are Professor Masson&#39;s comments on the alterations which have been made in the Bill as originally introduced. I do not entirely agree with the view which he has expressed. I do not believe that the proposed Institute can be entirely divorced from political control. If Professor Masson is of opinion that all we have to do is to find the money for the Institute, and that the Advisory Council is to spend it just as that body likes, or that it is to appoint whom it chooses, and to conduct as many investigations as it thinks fit, I do not agree with him. But I do believe that the Commonwealth Government should have utilized the machinery at present existing in the different States which are already doing work along somewhat similar lines, and that it should have placed the Commonwealth laboratory at their disposal, so as to aid them in that work. I do not think that we are justified in building up another institute, which, if divorced from political control, may become a spending department. When speaking upon this subject, upon a former occasion, I was asked by the honorable member for the Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> whether the Institute was intended to undertake the destruction of such pests as the prickly pear and the blowfly. Certainly we should accomplish a great work if we rid Australia of the prickly pear, and I have no doubt . that many honorable members are- in a position to give us a similar assurance in regard to the blowfly, which has inflicted enormous injury upon stock in this country. Does any honorable member think that the work of the Institute has brought nearer the solution of the problems caused by the existence of these pests ? I have, from the start, objected to the unpractical nature of what has been done. I have nothing to say against &#34;University men, but theorists have been put into positions which should have been held by practical men. I do not advocate the claims of any particular person, but Parliament should hesitate before giving to anybody power to appoint as many officers as he pleased, without control. The Bill does not fix any amount as the cost of the Institute. </para>

                    <para>- That is so; but there is a tendency to keep on men after the work for which they were appointed is finished. There is nothing in the Bill to say that the Institute shall cost &#163;50,000 or &#163;500,000 a year, and, therefore, the only opportunity for discussing its cost will be when Estimates are under consideration. But honorable members know that, perhaps, several days may be occupied with the earlier departments of the Estimates, arid the remaining departments may be then passed almost without discussion. Of course, votes will come up on Supply Bills, but then, other things will be mentioned. Some honorable members may call attention to the fact that the South Australian Government has not paid for the Port Pirie grab, which it promised to pay for, or there may be a long debate on the administration of the Northern Territory, or concerning the trans-continental railway. </para>

                        <para>- No. The point I make, is that Parliament ought now to determine what shall be spent on the proposed Institute. If it does not, there will be -little opportunity to control the expenditure later. Although there has been no Act to sanction the creation of the Institute, officers have been  appointed  and for several years we have been voting money to pay their salaries. I am never averse to&#39; spending money, from which a good return is likely. I have been denounced as responsible for&#39; the establishment of the Commonwealth laboratory at Royal Park, and the bringing to Australia of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Penfold,</inline> a man of eminent scientific attainments; but the cost of equipping and working that institution has been recouped over and over again by the sale of meningitis and influenza serum, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of pounds saved to the community by the distribution of influenza serum during the epidemic last year. But we are starting the Institute of Science and Industry on wrong lines. Last year I was informed that the journal which is issued by it, and of which a couple of hundreds of copies are sold at ls. each, was costing ls. 8&#189;d.  to produce. It is certainly not costing less now. Many of its articles have already appeared in other scientific publications, and are merely reprints. Here is one which is  reprinted  from the <inline font-style="italic">Veterinary Journal,</inline> without any statement of the place where that journal is published, though the name of. the&#34; writer is given. </para>

                        <para>- Eleven or twelve pages are devoted to the subject of rats and rat fleas. I do not think that the journal serves the purpose for which it was established. If there were co-operation with the existing State institutions, Better work would be done. As to whether there should be three directors or one,  possibly  as good work could be got by having &#39;one man at the head of affairs as by having three; but he must be a practical, not merely a theoretical man. I objected to the appointment of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly,</inline> who was a journalist, on that ground. Following the article on rats, come two pages on sharks, which, we are told, are good for food. </para>

                        <para>- Experience has shown that the States are very reluctant to hand over to the Commonwealth any of their functions. It was my privilege to be a member of a deputation that waited on a member of the Victorian Ministry the other day on the question of venereal disease. When I was speaking he suggested that it would be a good thing for the Commonwealth to take on the work, and I told him that the Commonwealth had already voted money to help to eradicate the disease, in view of its danger to the community. In spite of what the Commonwealth has done, no State Government will give up the work. When we took over lighthouses and quarantine, which were spending Departments pure and simple, the States raised objections. It has to be set down in the Constitution before they will agree to our taking control. I guarantee that if we propose to undertake anything outside the Constitution the States will not give it up. The men who fight any such proposal most bitterly are some of the State officials in the Departments concerned. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite possible; but, after all, if there is any force in the honorable member&#39;s suggestion that we should co-ordinate the work with the States, we must remember that we cannot do it by setting up another expensive Department where six exist at the present time, or where we are not going to do a scrap of new work. That is why I object to this scheme. The Minister has not given sufficient information as to how the States will co-operate with us in this particular matter. I believe the Bill will cause unnecessary expense by duplicating the work that is now being done. </para>

                <para>Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 9 gives power for &#34; the making of grants in aid of pure scientific research.&#34; I believe that is a thing we should do, but we can do it equally well by other means. When I was a Minister, a man came to me and showed me how much lanoline was being wasted every year in the wool, and how it could be utilized. We could have a little experimental plant at each of our Commonwealth laboratories, of which there is one in every State, to do that sort of work. If one. manufacturer wants the work done for himself he should pay the whole cost of the experiment, but if the whole of the manufacturers, or the whole of the public, are to reap, the advantage of the services of our technically-trained men, whose salaries we are paying all the time, then all the manufacturers or all the public should meet the cost. That would be a far better way to do this than setting up an expensive Institute such as is being proposed. There is no limit -to the amount that may be granted under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 9. The Institute, if it is under no direct political control, as some desire, can spend any amount of money. </para>

                <para>Clause 12 provides that the employees shall not be subject to the Public Service Act, but shall be engaged for such periods and subject to such conditions as are prescribed. That means that those in control can employ any and as many persons as they like, and keep them on as long as they like. If there is any evil in connexion with public Departments, it is the existence of &#34; temporary-permanent &#34; men.- They are under the control of no one, and frequently, in order to keep sweet and make themselves good fellows, they do things they ought not to be called upon to do. What has been the trouble iri this building? Have not you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> been asked frequently whether the employees of Parliament are being treated properly? These complaints occur simply because those employees are outside the purview of the Public Service Act. We come in contact with the men; we know them well, and they do little services for every member. Directly you take men outside the Public Service Act, you establish conditions far worse than anything which occurs under the -Act; I know the difficulty of getting rid of a man once he is in the Public Service. He&#39; is there practically for life.  That might not be desirable in the case of the new Institute, but we should have some system- of control over its employees, independent of whoever happens to be the head of it for the time being. Under sub-clause  1 of clause 12 the Director may appoint as many officers as he thinks necessary; </para>

                        <para>- How many outside the Minister concerned actually know one-hundredth part of what&#39; is going&#39; through ? It takes Ministers all their time to control their own Departments, without having any to spare to fool round to find out what is going on in others. The Minister is quite convinced by the advice of the head of -his Department that a proposal is absolutely necessary, and of &#39; course it will go through unless &#39;there is financial stringency such as exists now. In that case the -Institute may - not be extended very far, but in times of plenty it may grow and be found very expensive when lean times come again. </para>

                <para>By clause 1-4 power is given to the  Director to pay to successful discoverers or inventors working as officers of the Institute, or under the auspices of the Institute, such bonuses as the Governor-General determines. It is quite right that an energetic officer who makes a valuable discovery should be fairly rewarded, but when that reward is paid the discovery should become&#39; the property of the- Commonwealth Government. Some of the bounties which we have passed to assist industries have proved inadequate. Others have turned out fairly successful. Perhaps the most successful have been the iron and steel and wool tops bounties. We agreed to a bounty for the discovery of a phosphatic rock to turn into marketable artificial manure: Some of  the bounties would not tempt people to  take  up a new industry. A  bounty was&#39; offered for flax, but very little flax was&#39; produced. I think more is being grown to-day on account of the high price. In fact, war conditions have brought&#39; about far more discoveries and new products in Australiathan anything else. Some of the discoveries have been made by scientific men, and some by workmen engaged in the industries. The theorist has gone around and used the brains of the employees. In many cases the men engaged in the industries have given the information to smarter men, who have reaped the advantage. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member speaks out of a full knowledge of the ways of Departments. I do not think the Institute will be very prolific in advantages to the Commonwealth, to judge by the work done so far. The Bureau has been in existence now for some time - perhaps four and a half years, as Professor Masson says - although the Bill has never been passed. Every year an amount has appeared on the Estimates for the purpose, rising to, I think, &#163;30,000 in the last Estimates, of which nearly every penny was spent. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know where they have done it. What I am most concerned about is the type of man who is to be chosen as Director.- . He should be a practical man, and not a theorist, if the people are to obtain the advantage which the Bill is designed to give them. If we do not see to that, we shall be throwing the money away. It would be better to postpone consideration of the Bill unless we can obtain a definite statement from the Government as to the type of man they intend to appoint as Director. I am sorry that, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who is responsible for the Bill, has not been in the best of health. lately, but we should hear before we embark on the spending of this money a definite statement on that point. After all, this is not a party measure. If the passage of this Bill can be postponed for a few years until some concrete scheme is laid before Parliament, by which time the Government may have decided upon the right type of man to place at the head of the Bureau, the best course will have been followed. </para>

                    <para>.- As a Labour man, I welcome the introduction of the Bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr.&#34; Tudor) pointed out directions in which the Bureau has been already at work. Those attached to it have been working in an honorary capacity for more than four years,&#39; and have been carrying on in conjunction with the various States, which are anxious for the establishment of the Bureau upon a sound basis, so that finality can be arrived at in regard to certain matters which have for some time claimed attention. One important thing, which the Bureau has been able to achieve is in regard to the standardization of iron and steel.&#39; In that direction alone its establishment has been more than justified. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member should know that if a man refuses to believe good of a thing there is no argument that will shake his views. The whole trend&#39; of civilization to-day is to link up science more and more closely with industry, and the outcome has always been to lighten the burden&#39; of the worker. I have seen the effect of that during my own life-time in relation to the building industry, with which I have been concerned. The same illustration applies, for example, to boot manufacture. Machinery has completely revolutionized the boot -industry, and one man to-day turns out as much work as did twenty formerly. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member knows, that has nothing to do with science. I invite his attention, rather, to the linking up of science with agriculture. Science has come to the aid of the farmer, and to-day he can carry on ever so much more cheaply and more easily than in the days when there was only the crudest machinery to help him. Despite all the great inventions and the tremendous advance of the past few years,&#39; we are still but touching the fringe of scientific exploitation. This Government should not hesitate to spend money in the encouragement of scientific research. At the present time the Bureau is studying the economic application of a &#39;by-product of molasses to lie creation of a motive spirit. Activities along this particular line have practically come to a head, but the authorities are hampered by the lack of money in placing the discovery on the market. An attitude of ridicule or indifference in respect to scientific research will not help the world along the path of progress. If Australia is to take her place among the leading nations she must encourage the linking up of science with our young industries. Here, for once, we can copy Germany. The German nation has taken a pride in encouraging scientific research and discovery. </para>

                <para>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It is a subject which should be above party. With respect to detail, I would prefer to see the appointment of three directors rather than one. The selection of one man might mean that we would secure an excellent scientist in relation to one particular interest ; but there are hundreds of branches of scientific activity, and we want to make the directorate as broad as possible. It would be wiser to appoint three men of an all-round high standard. However, if tha Government deem it wise to choose one director, I shall not oppose it. I hope that, as an outcome of this legislation, a Board will be established which will call to its aid the best men in every State, thus creating one great and important body for the whole of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not offer opposition to the Bill, but am somewhat in disagreement with the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> in his desire to bring about full political control over the working of the Bureau. We cannot get rid of political control altogether. So far as finance is concerned, we must control operations; but it will be far wiser to appoint three directors than one, giving them the full power of commissioners. One of the three should be a good sound practical man with scientific attainments, while the. other two should he distinctly scientists. The tendency in this Parliament has beep to reduce rather than enhance the powers of the States., In this measure that tendency is not marked, but I cannot overlook the fact that members of this Chamber, generally, seem to have a natural leaning towards ignoring State organizations, and securing the domination of Federal control. If that should be the case with the Bureau, it cannot expect to become as valuable as it should be. As for the theory of the honorable member for Yarra that if the director, or directors, were given full power outside of the Public Service Act to make appointments to the Department, and to spend whatever amount of money was deemed necessary, the- cost would he altogether too great, it is a very good thing that those who are to be in charge should he able to make appointments. Then, if they -can see that they have made an unsuitable selection, they can get rid of the officer concerned, and endeavour to replace him with a worthy man. It would be impossible under this Bill to provide a fixed sum for the cost of the Bureau. Probably it would cost comparatively little at its initiation. It will he the duty of Parliament to watch its growth, and to see that, the Commonwealth -is getting full value for whatever money may be expended&#39;. To say, for example, by inserting a clause in the Bill, that the Bureau should not cost more than &#163;30,000,: would be almost tantamount to,a&#39;n invitation to spend up to that amount per annum. We should record our objection to money having been expended on the Institute, year after year, without parliamentary authority. I have always objected to any Government spending public money without the authorization of Parliament. I hope the Government will appoint three directors instead of one. These officers must be,&#39; to a certain extent, under the control of the Minister, and, thus, of Parliament. But I want some assurance that the Government will do all that is possible to work hand in hand with the various States in the matter of research. The Minister should have power under this - measure to appoint advisory committees in every State. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingsmill,</inline> a member of the Western Australian Parliament, is now in Melbourne as a member of , the Advisory Board in Western Australia, and I have been discussing the matter with him. He has informed me of the magnificent work done by the Board in Western Australia in connexion with forestry research during the past few years. They have received very great assistance from the State Government and outside individuals. The State Government expended a large sum of money in connexion with a laboratory, and hae given a grant of land worth &#163;20,000 for this special work. Recently the Board felt that there was a possibility of utilizing local timbers for the manufacture of paper-pulp, and approached several of the principal printing houses in Perth on the subject, with the result that they subscribed a grant of &#163;500 for research work. Surely the same kind of work can be done in the other States, and if, say, in Queensland, special investigations carried out by the State Advisory Board, under the control of the Commonwealth Director, were successful, the results would become the property of the Commonwealth instead of any individual State, and thus prove invaluable to Australian productions. I &#39;find that there is no provision in the Bill to indicate under which Department the Act will be administered. </para>

                    <para>.- I was somewhat astonished at the concluding remark of the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley),</inline> who said in effect that if the Institute were established any person of an inventive turn of mind would be able to have his proposals elaborated and perfected. I remind the honorable member that we are. not absolutely destitute of such facilities already, for in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> whose laboratory is situated at .the rear of the Customs Office, we have a gentleman who is always ready to render assistance to anybody with a decent idea worth consideration. It is his complaint that hitherto his Department has been, somewhat neglected: In addition, we have in practically every State of the Commonwealth universities, technical schools, schools- of mines, agricultural colleges, and such  institutions. I do. not know of any branch of primary or secondary industry that is not in some respect catered for, and, so far. as I can see, this proposed Institute will simply be a duplication of- existing State institutions. </para>

                <para>One of the most important items of discussion at the Premiers&#39; Conference which recently concluded its sittings in Melbourne, was a proposal to have one tax-gatherer and one form of return for the Commonwealth, and I understand some good result will be the outcome of the deliberations, so that probably next year tax-&#39; payers will be required to make up only.  one return, and pay one tax-gatherer instead of two, as at present. This will mean the saving of thousands of pounds of the taxpayers&#39; money, and do away with a lot of inconvenience. Why, therefore, should we now be called upon to consider a measure which will mean, duplication of existing services? This proposed Institute will cost a&#34; great deal of money, whether we appoint one, or three, directors. A leading member of the Country party has given the scheme his indorsement. The measure has been watered down considerably, and some of the objections raised by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> have been met; hut although the pill has been sugar-coated, its effect wi:l be the same. Once an opportunity is allowed any person to establish a Department, it grows and eventually becomes a most expensive concern. In my opinion, if any member of the Economy party sanctions expenditure on this Institute, he is a very poor economist indeed. </para>

                <para>When one &#39;looks at the list of men who have done most for our more important industries, one looks in vain for the names of trained scientific men. They may be good in theory, and able to deliver interesting lectures to students ; but when the acid of a practical test is applied to them they are, very often, found wanting. Although these manufacturers have done well for themselves through their inventions, they have also conferred great good upon the community. I may mention one who happens to be an elector of mine, but is, nevertheless, a strong political opponent: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay, the inventor of the combined harvester. He is not a graduate of any scientific school. So far as I know, he made a very humble beginning as a farmer, but undoubtedly is a man with a touch of genius. And he has been reminded that some of the most important improvements to his combined harvester have been made, not by trained scientists, but by farmers&#39; sons. I may refer, also, to the achievement of a well-known South Australian manufacturing firm, Hume Brothers, who have perfected what is known as the reinforced concrete pipe. This, again, is the product of a practical, and not a scientific, man. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume</inline> has evolved a pipe that has been put to varied uses in every part of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it is being universally used now in South Africa, Great Britain, America, and other parts of the world. It is displacing cast-iron pipes in many water schemes and in Queensland, where recently great difficulties were encountered when boring for water owing to drift sand, the authorities are now using great reinforced concrete cylinders, 8 feet in diameter, in order to overcome the trouble. These pipes are also being used in connexion with many domestic water supply schemes. </para>
                <para>At the outbreak of the war, I strongly advocated the encouragement of chemical research. In many directions industry has been revolutionized in Germany as  a  result of discoveries made by chemists. One of the most serious obstacles in the way of the progress of manufactures and industry generally in Australia is the lack of commercial chemists. In Germany, thousands of such men have been employed by private enterprise, and have made many valuable discoveries. It often happens that an analytical chemist in the course of his experiments makes a, more valuable discovery than that on which he was bent. Reference has been made to what has been done by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Its chemists and other experts, many of them intensely practical men, have done many wonderful things in regard, not only to the main product, but many of the byproducts of the Broken Hill mines. I fail to see in what respect the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry will benefit Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that the same taxpayers that are paying for our State experts will have to pay for this Institute. We have a large number of experts in all the State Departments. Why should we add to the national expenditure by multiplying them in this way? Members of the Country party will agree with me that in Victoria we have no better wheat expert than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson,</inline> who is associated with the Department of Agriculture. </para>

                <para>Mr.FENTON.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pye</inline> has done a great deal for wheat production, by his work at Dookie. In every State we have our Schools of Mines and Agriculture. I have been recently in touch with the Agricultural Departments of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, and have found that they are able to supply excellent information as to the purposes for which various areas are best suited. I am not going to say that the establishment of this Institute will lead to no improvement, but I certainly do not think it will improve very much upon the work now being done by the State experts. It must result in a considerable increase in Commonwealth expenditure. I do not think we should be expected to do more than obtain a little extra plant and a few additional appliances, and place them under the control of either one or two Universities, or the present Federal Analyst. </para>
                <para>I shall certainly vote against the second reading of this Bill, because I see no necessity for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry at the present time. Various arguments have been advanced as to the class of man to be appointed as Director. He will have to possess considerable organizing capacity. If he is to fill the bill he will need to be a man of scientific attainment - one of those splendid men who are few and far-between. </para>

                <para>Mr.FENTON.- We could employ such a man in the Commonwealth laboratory, without incurring the expense attaching to the creation of a new Department. There is no reason why we should not call to our aid some of the best experts, but to do so it is not necessary to create this Institute. The Minister responsible for it will have various branches to engage his attention, and instead of his controlling the Director the Director will control him. The Minister will not be able to keep the expenditure of the Institute within reasonable bounds. Everyone knows that at the present time taxpayers are groaning under the load of taxation, and public expenditure, which they have to bear. The Government which appointed a Commission to deal with the whole ramifications of the Commonwealth expenditure, with the object of suggesting economies, now asks us to agree to this additional expenditure. I do not wish to assume a dictatorial attitude, but I remind honorable members that, in supporting this Bill, they will vote for a considerable increase in our expenditure, and that the results accruing from it will not be worth while. We have the Hawkesbury College, in New South Wales, and the Dookie College and various experimental stations in Victoria and other States, all engaged upon matters relating to primary production. Coming to the secondary industries, we find that Victoria is dotted with technical schools. A boy on leaving the State school may go to one of the many technical schools and acquire much information in regard to primary and secondary industries. If he wishes to forge still further ahead, he may go finally to one of our Universities. With all these opportunities offering, surely- it is not worth while overlapping the work of the States by the establishment of this Institute! </para>

It means only a duplication of effort. The existing agencies can do all that is expected of them, but if it is considered necessary to bring new mem into the field and to conduct fresh investigations that can be accomplished without the creation of a big Department. If we agree to the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry, the Estimates relating to it four or five years hence will have enormously increased, and the people will find themselves grievously handicapped. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with great interest to the remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> He has asked us to bear in mind that we shall take upon ourselves a great responsibility if we vote for this Bill. I hope that the  honorable member will realize the responsibility which must fall upon the shoulders of those who vote against the measure, should they be successful in wrecking it. I am very glad that the Government have determined to proceed with the measure. Other countries of the world are far beyond us in the support given to scientific research. In Great Britain over &#163;1,000,000 per annum is being expended on a Department of Science, Industry, and Research. In France &#163;250,000 a year is expended in this way. In the United States of America and Canada millions are expended in this direction. In Japan the expenditure upon scientific research amounts to &#163;500,000 a year, and in Italy to &#163;250,000 a year. In New Zealand; South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, and other countries institutions to promote scientific research are established. </para>

We are some 12,000 miles from the principal centres of the world, and we require such an institution as is provided for underr this Bill to keep us in touch with the results of scientific research in other parts of the world. This great continent is capable of sustaining  a  larger population than is the United States of America. The area of Australia is greater &#39;than the&#39; area of the United States of America, and its under-  veloped&#34;: resources ..are equal, if not superior, to those of America. It is probably more toour&#39; interest than to the interest &#34;of any other people in&#34; the world that we should be brought . into touch as rapidly as possible with the latest developments of science. Of what use is it to establish industries on wrong premises ? We should be up to date inall &#39;these matters. If we can be made so by the expenditure of a few, tens of thousands of pounds, the money will be, well expended. </para>

                <para>One&#39; of the principal obstacles . to settlement in many parts of- Queensland is the rapid spread of the prickly pear. We have in that State 419,000,000&#39; acres of land,ofwhichquite:400,000,000 acres are still unalienated!- Upon.. the best &#39;information we can obtain, it is estimated that at least 1,000,000 acres of land in &#34;Queensland-&#34; is being - infested with the prickly pear every year. Many attempts have beenmade.to destroy the pest, but, so far,theonly . really successful means of dealing with. -it is by close settlement. -With so sparse a population covering such an enormous area, it is unfortunately not possible to do very much in that way. Before the war a company formed, I think, in Melbourne entered into an arrangement with the Queensland Government by which they were to be given 100,000 acres of land, provided they cleared it of prickly pear, and kept it clear of the pest. The means this company proposed for the destruction of &#39; the prickly pear was the application of a gas. Two expert -chemists from Germany were employed by the company, and their operations at Dulaccawere eminently successful.- : As soon as the war was spoken. of, -these two experts cleared out of Australia. The company tried to carry on &#39; the destruction of the pear by the application of a gas which they mistakenly assumed was similar to that manufactured by the German scientific experts; but they largely failed in the experiments they made. As the&#39; experts at first employed were successful, it should be possible to discover the exact nature, of the gas they applied, and such a discovery would alone be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds . to Australia. &#39; </para>
                <para>Before long the Commonwealth, and more especially Queensland, will have to undertake the . establishment of the cotton-growing industry. I can go back to the time of the Civil War in the United&#39; States of America; when it &#39;.was -found necessary that some attempt should&#39; be made to grow cotton in this country. Cotton was grown here successfully&#34; at the. time. . I know of many, plantations in&#39; Queensland upon which it was profitably grown; but when the American Civil War had. terminated those engaged, in. growing cotton in Queensland could not continue in competition with the coloured labour in the industry in the United States of America. To-day the price of cotton has gone up to such an extent and the cost of its production elsewhere&#39; so nearly equals the cost of its production by white labour in Australia, that I believe there is a great future for; the cotton -growing- industry? in Queensland. Many people are growing cotton there now: To give&#39; honorable member&#39;s some . idea of the extent . to which cotton was grown in that State fifty , years ago, I recently took up a Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> of the 2nd July, in which it was stated that fifty years ago a large sailing vessel, named the <inline font-style="italic">Maryborough,</inline> left Queensland for London half , full of cotton, the balance of her cargo being tallow. Many people are now going in for the cotton-growing industry, and it has been proved up to the hilt that it can be grown there profitably. One of the problems to be solved in connexion with the industry is the discovery of an effective machine for picking cotton. Some means must be discovered which will save labour in the picking of the cotton. The requisite machinery for the purpose has been developed up to a certain stage, and it is hoped that before Long an effective machine will be available. </para>
                <para>The best method ,of dealing with the tick pest is a matter which must be the subject of scientific research. Unless science is brought to bear upon the  solu-tion  of this problem very grievous errors may be committed. I have heard cattle growers, and  amongst  them very capable men, advocating as a means of dealing with the tick pest that certain areas of country should, be completely cleared of ticks. l,have heard others, equally capable, say that that is the worst thing that could possibly be done.- They urge the continuance of dipping, which is the present means adopted to keep down the pest, because they say that only cattle reared in tick-infested country become gradually immune to tick fever, and continue to be immune while the country has a few ticks, and that it would only lead to the spread of the disease if portions of the country were absolutely cleared of ticks in close proximity to tick-infested country. This is a question which should he taken up and finalized by a Bureau of the kind to be established under this Bill. </para>
                <para>Another pest with which we have to contend is the fruit fly. So far we have riot been very successful in dealing with it, and as we are starting a large number of returned soldiers on orchards in Queensland it is to be hoped that nothing will be left undone to effectively deal with this pest in the interests of these returned men. </para>
                <para>I have dealt with the necessity for coping with the advance of the prickly pear, and it might be as well to mention that no less than 23,000,000 acres of good land in Queensland is infested with this pest, and the Government of the State are only too pleased to part with the land for next to nothing to persons who will undertake to eradicate the pear upon it. </para>
                <para>I have already said&#39;, in reply to objections by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> that State institutions of this kind desire that this Bill shall be passed, and are ready to co-operate with the Federal Bureau. I know that the Australian Industrialists Association of Queensland have written very strongly  in favour of the establishment of a Federal Bureau, and urging the&#39; passage of this measure. Their only objection to it would appear to be that sufficient provision is not made for consultation with scientists in the different States, but that is a difficulty which might be easily overcome. </para>

                        <para>- We have led the world in some ways, and the world may lead us in other ways. Each should profit by the experience of the other. Mercantile men who believe that it is possible to gain further information of advantage to their concerns do not sit down and say, &#34; We are satisfied with the things of to-day,&#34; but despatch men of ability to other parts- of the world to acquire it. It is this which leads to their success, and the methods they apply ought also to be applied to the industries which, when the Tariff is passed, we hope to have firmly established in Australia. These concerns will require the most up-to-date machinery, and the assistance which an Institute of Science and Industry can provide for them will most certainly be welcomed by them. We are told that the States are co-operating in every way with the Federal Institute, and that they are most anxious to see the latter placed upon a firm and up-to-date &#39; basis. I have no word to say in detriment of what the States are doing in this direction, -but I claim that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to furnish the money for a central Institute which will keep in full touch with the State Bureaux and supplement their work. Now that the Bill is before the House, T hope that honorable members will realize the necessity for it and feel the responsibility that is cast upon them. </para>

                    <para>.- -I approach the subject covered by this Bill with all the seriousness it involves. We must realize the bearing that science or knowledge will have on our future undertakings, because if knowledge is not applied to production, which alone, we are told, can enable us to meet our obligations, there will not be much prospect of our solving the grave situation confronting us. I do not care whether the word &#34;science,&#34; which seems to terrify a great many people, is applied. I prefer the words &#34; better methods.&#34; Australia is twenty-five years behind those countries which have applied science to their undertakings. As a poet has said - </para>

                <para class="block">Those who seek to apply knowledge to our undertakings we at first doubt, then tolerate, and then accept. However, as it is applied in Australia to-day, the process is too slow. We can only make this a great country and fill its great spaces by the application of knowledge, thus magnifying our undertakings which alone will serve to attract the population we need. No country in the world is better provided with the gifts of nature. No country is more dependent on what nature has given, and does less for itself. For many years I have had the great privilege, and, at the same time, the great responsibility - for there is no greater responsibility than the sacred task of dealing with human nature - of having under my keeping, at it were, as many as 400 tenant farmers, 95 per cent. of whom I eventually made their own freeholders. To-day they are the most prosperous men in New South Wales. This result was achieved because for years I have been successful in my endeavour to get them to apply the very best knowledge and the most up-to-date methods to their undertakings. I was associated with many  of these men from the very beginning of things - the clearing of the land, the fencing and housing, the financing, and so on to the end, until the tenant farmer became a prosperous freeholder. Twenty years ago I visited Denmark in order to ascertain the methods adopted there which made those engaged in primary production a prosperous people, and I had their methods applied by those whom I was controlling. Thus it was that I was the first person in New South Wales to apply the methods adopted in Denmark in the manufacture of dairy products. I introduced the system of pasteurization. The knowledge gained in this way was not confined to our tenants alone. All who could might enter; none were denied the privilege of the knowledge we gave them. As a result of the application of this knowledge our farmers were able to get for their produce &#163;5 per ton more on the local market and &#163;10 &#34;more in London, and had that principle of knowledge been applied universally in the State of New South Wales, the dairy section of our producers would not have lost about &#163;5,000,000, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> statistics of production, would about represent the difference between the price realized and what would have been gained by them had science been applied to their efforts. After many years of endeavour to have science applied to industry, it is a matter of sorrow for me to note the indifference of our people towards the adoption of better methods. I shall give a little instance of my effort to have science applied to production. The late David Berry, of the South Coast in New South Wales, in his will bequeathed the sum of &#163;100,000 for a hospital in the district in which he lived. But the area benefiting by the bequest was so circumscribed that the income from the trust was more than the local conditions could absorb, and in order that the district should benefit in another direction, I, as trustee for the bequest, had a Bill passed through the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1906. While providing in the Bill for those who were sick and dying, I thought it right that the surplus income should be applied to those who were to be the future producers of our country. I believe it is the only instance - at any rate, in New South Wales - whereby a will has ever been altered by an Act of Parliament. The Bill provided that the income not required for hospital purposes should be used for technical and agricultural colleges, and for the promotion of agricultural and veterinary science. </para>
                <para>The primary producers of Australia suffer more than any others, as they have to contend with pests, blights, and bugs, as they are called in America; but they suffer more from legislation. The men engaged in producing should not be placed on the same basis as those employed in the ordinary affairs of &#39; life. They have to pay taxation on all . they require, and,  in addition, are heavily taxed on the implements used in production.The farmers of Australia must not be regarded as individuals who work merely to produce cheap food for those who require it. The farmer of the future must stand on his dignity and seek knowledge, which is the greatest asset of all. A person may lose his money but he never loses knowledge. The children of those engaged in primary undertakings, particularly in a small way, do not acquire the information that the children of the industrialists . in the city acquire. TheartisansinMelbourne,orinany other largecentre,cansendtheir children, from, the State, schools to the highest seat of learning ; but the children of the men on the land have to submit to conditions which do not permit them to obtain that instruction which is absolutely necessary for their future success. Unless he isa prosperous settler, which is not often the case,hischildrenhavenot the privileges of attending the large educational institutions , in the cities that are open to the children of city workers. The natural result is that, when the average boy reaches the age when he begins to think for himself, he realizes that his prospects in the cities are brighter. Thechildren of settlers drift towards the populous centres, and the parents follow to look after them. </para>
                <para>At present there are only three classes of settlers who can live on the land and prosper, and these comprise - the man with special knowledge, the one who inherits his property free of debt, and the one with a large family, who is prepared to stay on his holding and work for nothing. These are the people to whom we are looking to relieve us from our present position. Are we going to shirk our responsibilities tothem? </para>

                <para class="block">Two yearsagoIhadthepleasureand privilege of visiting the Wisconsin University, intheUnitedStatesofAmerica, to inquire into the methods adopted there for equipping those engaged in primary production. Twenty five years ago America was approaching the situation of declining production, that Australia is in to-day. It is an undeniable fact - it is not caused- by the war; but the fact remains that, the producers of Australia are growing stale on the job. Twenty-five yearsagoMr.J.J. Hill, a great American philanthropist, discovered that American production was decreasing and he roused that country by the bald statement that, if she did not pay more attention to her primary undertaking&#39;s, the day was not far distant when the American people would go to bed hungry. This statement roused the nation into activity.We cannot close our eyes to the fact that we are approaching a similar crisis, but nothing is being done by legislation to encourage production. The, Bill in its present form is a bowelless measure. When I visited the Wisconsin University, I inquired into the best methods of, stimulating production and of making the work of those engaged in. the industry attractive.The activities foreshadowed in the Bill should not come into conflict with undertakings by agricultural colleges of the States. I believe it is the intention and desire of the Government to provide for co-operation with the different States, and to harmonize their work in every direction. I have had the opportunity of discussing this question with men associated with our agricultural colleges, and from my conversations with competent authorities I have gathered that they would; hail a measure such as this with delight.If the Government are not prepared to confer with Stateeducational authorities the measure is doomed to failure.I do not think, however, that I will join forces with the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> unless heispreparedtochangehisviews.In theStateofWisconsin,whichisnota very large one, seventy University specially selected graduates- men who had done a four years course at the University - are located in different parts of the State in the interests of production . They are paid, not only by the farmers in the different sections over which , they operate, but, there is also an. appropriation from State and Federal funds for the purpose. They each receive an annualremunerationof&#163;400andare provided with automobiles. To defray , the annual expenditure the farmers contribute&#163;200, the State authorities &#163;100, and the Federal Government , &#163;100. The difficulty we experience, in Australia is that men who are engaged to perform similar work are only half qualified, and the ordinary man knows by experience more than the man so circumstanced. That is one reason why scientific methods have not&#39; been adopted. The graduates employed in the State of Wisconsin commence with the soil and advising the proper methods of cultivation. They also recommend as to selection of seed, methods of harvesting, transport, and marketing. The intrusion of these officers was resented at first, but later there was an outcry when they were not on the job. In the sameStatenoless than fifty women, who have taken a two years&#39; course in domestic economy, are employed to visit the houses and schools to teach the children how to bake bread, cook a joint, cut out a dress,preservefruit and vegetables, and how to prevent wastage.The greatest economy is the prevention of wastage, of which there is more in this country than, in many other countries. </para>

Joseph Cook)</inline> by a question to-day the intention of the Governmentin. regard to the naval, stores at Williamstown. According to the Minister&#39;s reply &#39; the Government intend to close those stores, because they are only a duplication that grew up during war time. I do not ask the Government to duplicate any work at the risk of, economy, but I do not think that we should sacrifice -efficiency to economy. The stores at Williamstown, and the ship repairing yard, have done excellent work for which; they have been eulogized by the Department. The ship repairing yard has been a paying concern. Is it the intention of the Government to break up the whole of that Department ? Do they intend to send the stores to Sydney and arrange for the repair work to be done by private firms, or will provision be made in the shipbuilding yards for such work? Naturally the employees at Williamstown stores and repair yards and the people of the ; district are- concerned as to the Government&#39;s&#39; policy in this regard. There is a. further rumour that the Government intend to sell the shipbuilding . yards to some private firm, and it is noted, as some, proof of that, intention, that representatives of big British shipbuilding firms, are in Australia spying out the, land, and inquiring particularly ;into the shipbuilding yards&#39; now operated by the Government. . It may be said that I am asking too much in requesting the Government to disclose their policy but I submit, that, there can be nothing in regard  to this matter which the people should not know. At any rate, I hope nothing will be done by the Government before the House has had an opportunity to consider the proposal, and the people of Australia have been given a chance of expressing their views about the abolition of a Government enterprise that has developed there. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know where the firm can establish itself; but so far as I know there is no truth in the rumour that Vickers and Company intend to acquire Cockatoo Island dockyard. &#39; I do not think that firm is likely to take the dockyard. It is not such a catch for a private firm as the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> seems to suggest. In regard to Williamstown shipbuilding yards, I do not know what the firm contemplates. But the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has got hold of the germ of something that is contemplated. For instance, it is proposed to reduce the huge swollen stores at Williamstown. I visited, them the other day, and saw thousands of pounds worth of stores, yet nobody there or in the Navy Department could tell me for what they . are required. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever may happen to the Williamstown people, I cannot continue to spend public money to maintain stores there or anywhere else unless there is need for them. I hope that the stores will be divided, and that a good portion of them will be transferred to the shipbuilding yards at Williamstown, and that in the end no detriment to Williamstown will result. As to the shipbuilding section at Williamstown, the position is that, notwithstanding that  there is a huge shipbuilding yard at that  port,  the Navy is building boats for the  various  Departments. The question of whether  or  not the boats are being well built  is  immaterial. The outstanding fact is that, although  an  expensive and well-equipped shipbuilding yard  is  right alongside, the Navy Department  is  busying itself with the building of small ships for the Departments. Surely the big shipyards can undertake that work quite as well as can the Navy. The present practice involves  an  unjustifiable duplication  of  public expenditure which must be stopped at the earliest possible moment. Again I express the hope that the adoption  of  the course outlined will prove  no  detriment to Williamstown whatever. </para>

                <para class="block">The Postal Department should endeavour to expedite the delivery  of  these mails, because even in ordinary times there is great delay in the transit  of  mails to the back country. I believe the Postmaster-General will be able to arrange for  a  special method  of  delivery, pending the  re-establishment of  the train service. It is asserted that three  or  four weeks  may  elapse before there is railway communication to Pokataroo. which, is the - nearest station to Collarenebri. I should like  an  assurance from the honorable gentleman that he will  do  everything  in  his power to insure the deliveries  of  these delayed mails. </para>
