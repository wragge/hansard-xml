                        <para>- Show Day is generally observed in this city as a public holiday, and to-morrow all State Departments will be closed. I understand that it is one of the four permissive holidays which Ministers may grant in addition to the statutory holidays, and that hitherto Commonwealth public servants have been allowed to have the day free. I am informed, however, that the Service has been notified that since a public holiday was granted them on the day of the arrival of the Prince of Wales in Melbourne, they will not be allowed a holiday tomorrow. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is too late for him to take action, so that Commonwealth employees may have meted out to them to-morrow the treatment accorded State employees ? </para>

                                <para>- I have not tried the recall, but I am bound to say that I am full up of the referendum. If the honorable member is serious in his threat to tackle me with another referendum I may have to reconsider the previous decision of the Government to ask the House of Representatives to sit tomorrow afternoon at 2.30 p.m. The honorable member quite understands the circumstances which induced us to adjourn over this afternoon. That adjournment in those circumstances was entirely proper, as it enabled us to bid an official farewell to their Excellencies the Governor-General and Lady Helen Ferguson, who have played a most distinguished part during the most critical time in our history, and who have been six and a half years amongst us, during which they have earned the respect and esteem of, and endeared themselves&#39; to, the people of the Commonwealth. The honorable member says that to-morrow he desires to see the sheep and the cows. </para>

I was asked by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> to consent to the adjournment of this House until 7.30 p.m. to-morrow. I think it is not altogether &#34;cricket&#34; now to use my consent to that request as a reason for asking for a holiday for the public servants. If this later request is pressed, I shall have to withdraw my statement to the honorable member for Melbourne, and we must meet as usual at 2.30 p.m. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will have regard to what I might describe as the special pleadings of a very large section of the press, and the regrets and disappointment expressed by a very considerable section of the community, at his decision not to proceed to Geneva to take part in the deliberations of the League of Nations. Will the right honorable gentleman reconsider his determination, and proceed to the Conference in order to defend the principles which so vitally affect Australia, and for which he so ably fought at the signing of the Peace Treaty at Versailles ? </para>

                    <para>Mr.HUGHES. - In coming to a decision in this matter, the Government, having all the facts at its disposal, considered, on my recommendation, that the Commonwealth would be adequately represented by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> in whom we have absolute confidence. If I thought for one moment that the interests of this country would be jeopardized by my absence from the Geneva Conference, I should not hesitate to proceed there. </para>
                    <para>I have noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the reason I gave for not going was that the Imperial Conference would not be held next year. That statement is in conflict with the information in my possession. The press, perhaps, is confusing two quite different things. It may be true that the Imperial Conference may not be held next year, but we are assured by the British Prime Minister that the Prime Ministers of the various self-governing Dominions will be asked to meet in London next year, in order to consider the very many and complex problems that call for their adjustment. The urgent need for the careful consideration and settlement of the principles upon which the new constitutional relations between Britain and the Dominions are based is obvious. It would be dangerous to delay the attempt at settlement. As it would be obviously most undesirable that Australia should not be represented by the Prime Minister at such a Conference, and since there is no reason to believe that those vital interests of which the honorable member has spoken are likely to be jeopardized by my absence from Geneva, I have decided not to proceed there; but if I have the honour then to represent this country in my present capacity, I intend to take part in the deliberations of the Conference of Prime Ministers to be held in England next year. </para>

                            <para>- If I thought the principle of a White Australia was likely to or could be decided by the Assembly of the League of Nations, my answer to the honorable member&#39;s question would be in the negative. But the Assembly of the League of Nations cannot override the decision of the Council of the League of Nations, nor abrogate the terms of a treaty to which practically all the delegations to the League are parties, and, therefore, the answer to my honorable friend&#39;s question is in the affirmative. The honorable member, perhaps, is not aware of the actual position. The Council of the League of Nations is, in effect, at least, until America decides to adhere to the League, the Council of the&#39; Four - Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. There are other minor nations, but for all effective purposes those I have mentioned are the deciding factors. The Council of the Four, as I stated in outlining the Defence policy last week, decided that Australia was to have the mandate, and the whole of the nations that form part of the Assembly, and part of the Council, are signatories to the Covenant which lays down the conditions under which we should have the mandate. Therefore, unless the Assembly of the League of Nations begins its work by tearing up the Treaty, it cannot disturb the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> The honorable gentleman need have no fear of the position. If I thought there was any danger of such a catastrophe as his question suggests, I should leave no stone unturned to see that the foundations of Australia&#39;s existence were not shaken. </para>

                            <para>- In answer to the honorable member I may say that the Defence Department has already taken steps in connexion with those men who have been stranded in England. As a matter of fact, the Department has arranged with the Imperial authorities and with the members of the Australian Imperial Force still remaining in England to extend the time allowed them within which to make application to be repatriated. . Every consideration will be given to these men. Everything will be done to repatriate all those who are deserving of such consideration. There are some, unfortunately, who, I understand, are not deserving of it; but everything possible will be done to repatriate deserving men. </para>

                            <para>-The result of my inquiries in this matter indicates that outward freights on full cargoes of coal from Great Britain to Mediterranean ports and the Argentine or River Plate have recently fallen materially; but that there is no prospect of a reduction in the liner general cargo rates. On the contrary, the liner general cargo rates have increased this year to all countries excepting Australia. The rates to Australia would have been increased had not the action of the Commonwealth Government </para>

                    <para class="block">Line prevented such a step. Some time ago I urged upon the British Government that the request of the Conference lines for an increase in the rates for refrigerated space should be refused, and a despatch has now been received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, intimating that the question had been exhaustively examined; but that, in view of the heavy increases in running expenses that had taken place since the rates were agreed to in April, 1919, it had not been found possible to resist a claim for some increase of charter rates. The British authorities have, therefore, agreed to the rate being increased from 132s. 6d. to 144s. per 40 cubic feet, the increase to take effect from the 1st March, 1920, at which date, the British. Government state, the Conference lines were entitled to, and claimed, a revision. I am advised that there is no prospect of a reduction in the rate for insulated space, particularly in view of the recent attempt of the shipping companies trading from Australia to increase the rate on scoured wool to the United Kingdom, which was also only prevented by the attitude of the Commonwealth Government Line. As regards the reference to scoured wool, I desire to point out that the action of the Commonwealth Government Line, in refusing to agree to an increase above1d. per lb., is directly responsible for a saving of id. per lb. in freight to the shippers of scoured wool from this country. </para>

These were allotted by that Department to blinded soldiers in lieu of a rental allowance of &#163;1 per week, when the pension rate of this class, excluding the pensions payable to dependants, and other allowances, was &#163;1 10s. per week. This rate was increased to &#163;4 per week on the 1st July, 1920. The weekly income of a blinded soldier prior to this date, exclusive oi pensions payable to dependants, and other allowance, was,  therefore,  &#163;2 10s., or &#163;1 10s. and a rent-free dwelling, as against &#163;4 from the 1st July. </para>

                            <para>The practice followed to give effect to the policy of preference to returned soldiers is as follows: - When workmen are required, those returned soldiers who have registered with the Commission are communicated, with, and close touch is kept with the Repatriation Department, and, where established, the employment bureaux attached to soldiers&#39; organizations. These sources cannot provide more than a small quota of the total workmen required, and recourse must then be had to the industrial organizations to supply the balance, which have undertaken to give preference to the returned soldier members of their respective organizations. The labour obtained through the latter avenue comprises a certain percentage of returned soldiers who, for reasons of their own, prefer to register in this way rather than with the Commission. In all contracts let by the Commission, a clause is inserted providing for preference of employment to returned soldiers, and if a contractor does not observe all or any of the terms of the contract, prompt and proper action is taken. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Treasurer, in delivering his Budget speech, having announced that as part of their financial proposals the Government intended to raise revenue by increasing postage, telegraph, and telephone rates, this Bill is introduced for the purpose of making the  necessary  increases in postal and telegraph rates. Telephone rates are increased by regulation. It is unnecessary for me to say anything to justify these increases from the general revenue point of view, the Treasurer having done that ; but I propose to show that they are perfectly justified from a departmental point of view. </para>
                    <para>It is hardly necessary for me to point out to the House that the working costs of the Postal Department have inevitably increased during recent1 years, but it will be of interest to indicate some of the main items in which this increase is most apparent. Since 1914 the expenditure on salaries of permanent officers of&#39; the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department has&#39; increased by leaps and bounds. In common with other countries throughout the world, it has been necessary in the Commonwealth to increase rates of pay to meet the increased cost of living resulting from war conditions, and in addition to this many grades of officers have had their work re-appraised by the Arbitration Court at rates higher than those prescribed by the Public Service Commissioner prior to 1914. </para>
                    <para>During the years of the war the actual expenditure &#34; on &#39;salaries &#34; as shown in the Treasurer&#39;s statement did not reveal the full effect of this increase, owing to the &#39; &#39; savings &#39; &#39; arising from the absence of some thousands of officers on- active service, and whose places in the Service were filled either by the employment of temporary hands or by a re-apportionment of their duties among the remaining permanent staff. Even during the financial year just closed there was still a large number of officers who had not resumed duty in the Public Service, and the record of salaries during that year does not, therefore, make the position clear. </para>
                    <para>A fair basis of comparison would be to take the year ended 30th June, 1914, as compared with the year 1920-21. The following table shows the position : - </para>
                    <para class="block">These are remarkable figures - the number, of permanent officers has actually decreased by 116, but the annual rate of salaries has increased approximately by &#163;1,200,000. The figures for the Central Office and the Radio Service are not included. This comparison indicates very, graphically the increased cost which has to be met, and with the still rising cost of living it appears inevitable that further increases will have to be provided- by Parliament to meet Arbitrationawards in this matter. These awards have increased the annual cost of Com-&#39; monwealth salaries by &#163;913,347, four- fifths of which are paid by the Postal Department. </para>
                    <para>At the present time a large number of Public Service Associations have claims pending before the Arbitration Court, and the great bulk of the increased expenditure which may be involved will have to be met by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. In this connexion it is well to bear in mind that out of a grand total of approximately 25,000 permanent officers in the Commonwealth Public Service about 20,000 are employed by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. </para>
                    <para>Another heading of expenditure, in which honorable members have evinced an active interest, is that of the cost of conveyance of mails on inland road services. Quite recently the Government approved of a special concession to mail contractors on account of drought conditions, and, apart from the heavy increases arising from that cause, there has been, for a series of years, a noticeable increase in the expenditure under this heading. The following comparison of the actual expenditure for the year 1913-14 under pre-war conditions with the estimated expenditure for the year 1920-21 shows the position: - </para>

                    <para>The policy of the Government, as already announced, is that wherever practicable postal facilities, in the form of mail services, shall be given to outback and isolated districts, and the pursuance of this commendable policy may lead to expenditure in excess , of the figures I have quoted for 1920-21. In estimating the cost of new services which will be established under the liberal policy adopted by this Government it is difficult to forecast, even approximately, the amount involved. Many of these inland postal services do not nay, and many will never pay </para>

                    <para>The outstanding increase proposed is in the basic letter rate, which is being raised from1&#189;d. to 2d. per letter, an increase at the rate of 33 per cent. In the United Kingdom and New Zealand the rate has been similarly increased, and in South Africa an increase of 50 per cent. has beenimposed. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the rates proposed for newspapers, the only alteration in this connexion is the incorporation as postage of the amount now charged as war tax, and which has been charged since October, 1918. In this connexion I might point out that in the United Kingdom the rate of postage on newspapers has been increased by 50 per cent., in New Zealand by 100 per cent., and in Canada during the past two years by 300 per cent. Other Administrations outside the British Empire have also increased the rate of postage on newspapers. A slight alteration is, however, being made in the definition in regard to bulk postage of newspapers. I shall go farther into this particular phase of the matter when the Bill is receiving the consideration of honorable members in Committee. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer intimated during his Budget speech that it was proposed to increase the charges for telegrams in the Commonwealth by adding 3d. to each of the present rates. The Bill which is now before the House provides for an increase on these lines, and also for a proportionate increase in the telegraphic rates for press messages. With regard to ordinary telegrams, the objection may be raised that the increase proposed is, on a percentage basis, heavier on suburban and city telegrams than upon Intra-State and InterState messages. In reply to this, I desire to say that the main purpose of imposing the extra charge is to get additional revenue, and it was considered that this end would most readily be attained by making an extra charge of 3d. on each telegram, irrespective of the length of the message or the distance over which it was to be transmitted. In comparison with other countries, there should be little ground for complaint in respect to the charges for telegrams. In the United Kingdom the rates have recently been increased from 9d. for twelve words and &#189;d. for each additional word, to1s. for twelve words and1d. for each additional word, which represents an increase of 33 per cent. on the initial rate, and 100 per cent. on the rate for extra words. </para>
                    <para>When the immense length of lines which have to be maintained and operated in the Commonwealth is compared with the comparatively short circuits in the United Kingdom, it will be seen that even the new rates proposed are exceedingly liberal. In South Africa the rates were recently increased by approximately 33 per cent., the maximum number of words for the initial charge being twelve, as compared with sixteen words in the Commonwealth. In New Zealand the rates have been increased from . 8d.  for  twelve words and&#189;d. for each additional word to1s. for twelve words and1d.  for  each additional word, an increase of 50 per cent. on the initial charge, and 100 per cent. on the secondary rate. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with these matters it is well to remember, in addition to the great increases in salaries, the great increase that has taken place in the cost of material. This also has to be borne in mind in connexion with the telephone rates. I may say that the cost of galvanized iron has increased by 600 per cent., that of cable by 100 per cent., and of telegraph equipment by from 50 to 250 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The proposed increase of 3d. per telegram on ordinary telegrams is estimated to bring in annual additional revenue  of  &#163;200,000. The total present revenue from such telegrams is approximately &#163;753,000 per annum. Therefore the increase is approximately at the rate of 27 per cent. The increased rates for press telegrams are designed to bring in approximately 27 per cent. extra revenue on this class of business. Taking each rate individually, the 27 per cent. increase is not apparent, but, in designing the new rates, the press message business had to be taken as a whole; the bulk of press messages fall within the category &#34;exceeding 100 words.&#34; For instance, on a message containing 150 words, the present and proposed rates would be as under: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="093331192009226_9_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>It might be added that the percentage increase would vary in each instance according to the number of words contained in the message transmitted. Further, the incidence of the previous rates has been observed, as far as practicable in framing the increased charges. </para>
                    <para>Telephone rates are not dealt with in the Bill, but, as I said before, by regulation, and it is proposed to increase the charges by 25 per cent. on all exchanges of 601 subscribers and over. On exchanges where there are only 600 subscribers there will be no increase. The increased rate will also apply to the charge for calls, which will go up by &#188;d. each, but there is no increase in regard to calls where the subscribers number only 600 or under. Where there is a fraction of a penny in the accounts rendered the fraction will be struck off. There will be no increase in the charge for the use of public telephones, which will remain at 2d. In connexion with the telephone services, we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears, but it will be a matter of time. There was the difficulty of getting material at almost any price during the war, and there was also the difficulty of raising the necessary funds; but since February last the Treasurer, as I stated, has given me authority to call for tenders, and there are at present orders out amounting in value to &#163;544,052, made up as follows: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer has also given me authority to invite additional tenders amounting to a much larger sum, but those contracts cannot be carried out until the beginning of the next financial year. I mention these facts to show honorable members that we are doing our very utmost to overtake arrears as quickly as possible. </para>

                            <para>- I thought it was departed from during the war. At any rate, it is a wholesome custom. However much delay there stay be over the consideration of the Budget, there should be no unnecessary delay over the public works. Australia is a very large place, and until money is voted the Works Department is more or less paralyzed. The sooner these estimates are put through the better. I do not mean that there should not be reasonable discussion on any items honorable members may select, but I hope that these will be few. </para>

                            <para>. -  A sum of &#163;2,0*&#62;0 is asked for work in connexion with this building. The honorable member knows what a lack of accommodation there is here in the way of small rooms, especially for the use of Ministers. There is no place where they can see members or others. It is proposed to erect a set of rooms at the back of the Ministers&#39; room, including four rooms for Ministers and certain accommodation for members in the way &#39; of ante-rooms. There will be five or six additional rooms altogether. </para>

                                <para>- The fact that we have done without them for twenty years does not justify us in not providing this accommodation for the next two or three years that we shall be here. There is also a great deal of pressure on the accommodation in the building for the members of the staff. Extra room is badly needed for the officials. We have occupied this building for twenty years without a penny charge being made to us by the State Government for the . privilege. The proposed expenditure is comparatively small, and the accommodation is most urgently needed. </para>

                            <para>.- The sum proposed is entirely inadequate. While we are about it, we should make extra provision for members as well as for Ministers and the staff. We might just as well make the proposed vote a couple of million pounds. We should not be too parsimonious in these matters, but should provide ample accommodation for all of us. We should remember that we may not be here for ever, and while we are here we ought to be comfortable. Would it not be advisable to increase the number of rooms in the building so as to allow one for each of the 111 members of this Parliament, and let each member have a typist and an assistant ?  The privileges and advantages which are to be accorded to Ministers and the staff ought not to stop there. At Washington every member of Congress has a room. Every member of this Parliament ought to have a room here and a bedroom, and, perhaps, a private dining-room of his own. I merely throw these out as suggestions, to which I feel sure the Ministry will accede. The amount of accommodation which will be provided for the &#163;2,000 now asked for will not fit in properly with this building and its surroundings. While they are about it, the Government might well put up another building similar to this, which would harmonize with it and add to its beauty. </para>

                                <para>- Then the estimate cannot be correct. No one can build more than four rooms, in these days, and, particularly on a design to follow the general scheme of this building, at an outlay of &#163;2,000. The Committee should have a little more information. While the matter of extended accommodation is under consideration, why cannot honorable members be provided with rooms in which to interview visitors ? This is the most uncongenial place possible in which to expect, members of Parliament to attend and do their business, and meet members of the public who may desire to see them officially. </para>

                                <para>- That is a just complaint. I cannot understand the action of the Government in proposing to erect additional accommodation for officials when there are not sufficient rooms in which honorable members may conduct their business. If the additions are to be suitably built, upon the lines of the permanent structure, the advance, instead of being &#163;2,000, should be more like &#163;200,000. That sum, at any rate, would need to be laid out if this building were to be made at all suitable for conducting the business of the Federal Legislature. According to the original design, this building is only half completed. Instead of putting any amount at all upon the Estimates for additions we should be considering necessary expenditure for the housing of the Federal Parliament at Canberra. </para>

                            <para>. - The question of accommodation in this building is one which has constantly recurred. It had been my intention to make a statement to the House at the first convenient opportunity; and, perhaps, since the matter has now arisen, the present may be an opportune moment. The question of accommodation at Parliament House for members and others concerned in the various activities of Parliament is one which has caused me considerable difficulty for some time past. The whole matter is one of supply and demand. Even in the earlier period of our existence as a Parliament the available accommodation provided was in several respects inadequate, and makeshift arrangements had to be resorted to in order to overcome some of the difficulties that presented themselves. For example, some of the rooms in the basement had to be partitioned off into small cubicles to accommodate officers of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, while I had recently to convert a lavatory into an additional room for their needs, and there are still insufficient rooms for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. The appointment of Committees of Public Works and Public Accounts, with the necessary officers attached to them, presented fresh accommodation problems, These I partially solved by prevailing upon the State Government of Victoria to forgo their exclusive reservation rights to the use of another room in the basement, which I converted into two rooms by means of a temporary partition. The appointment of female typists to assist honorable members with their correspondence, and the absence of a place where members could interview  callers, created further difficulties which had to he met by partitioning off odd corners of lobbies and encroaching on rooms provided for other purposes. The accommodation provided for the Standing Committees was found to be insufficient, and rooms had to be found elsewhere in the city to enable the work of those Committees to be efficiently carried on. The advent of a third party led naturally to a request for special accommodation for that party, and for an additional room for its Leader and his secretary. That additional room I hope to provide by allotting the one now in use by the Accounts Committee when that body shall have removed to new quarters in the city. The need for more rooms for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and for Library storage and other purposes, is one of some urgency. For lack of necessary Library storage and other accommodation, cases and cupboards of Library matter have to be dumped in the outside passages, and cellars &#39;have had to be utilized for the housing of the valuable Petherick Collections and other almost priceless <inline font-style="italic">Australiana.</inline></para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>The only accommodation available at present for Ministers, other than the Prime Minister, is one room - which should properly be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> room - and which is common to all Ministers, who have no place where they can interview officials or callers in privacy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> room is an improvised temporary enclosure of portion of the Library corridor, and is in every way unsuited for the purpose of a room; but no better accommodation is at present available. Heads of Departments, secretaries, and other departmental officials in attendance on Ministers while the House is sitting, are obliged to stand or sit about the corridors and passages, to their own discomfort and the inconvenience of others, because no accommodation is available. </para>
                        <para>Doubtless, when the House meets in its permanent home in the Federal Capital, all these disabilities will be overcome; but, as present indications do not seem to warrant the assumption that removal from the present domicile of Parliament is imminent, or even a realizable possibility of the immediate future - however desirable such a change may be - in view of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Prime Minister has approved of plans for temporary additions to the north wing of the building. These were submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brittingham,</inline> the State Architect, after consultation with myself. The additions will partially meet the more pressing requirements for additional accommodation. I may add that the additions will be reared upon the existing foundations, but that they will be practically of a temporary character; that is to say, they will not be completed in their ultimate form, but will be carried out in conformity with the general plan of the building as approved by the State Architects, so that they can later be completed as part of the permanent additions to the building. The plans have been submitted - as I just mentioned - from that official to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and they have been approved; and the estimate quoted is the estimate of the State Architect. Of course, it will only be a very plain type of structure; there will be no attempt at ornamentation. The additions will only provide a room for the Prime Minister, and for his secretary, a lavatory, and a couple of small rooms for clerks, attendants, and typist. The extensions will render available for other use one or two rooms which are at present engaged. </para>
                        <para>I am not prepared to say whether the proposed work can be carried out within the amount of the estimate. I must leave that phase of the matter to the experts, who are expected to know ruling prices of labour and material, and who have estimated that the extensions can be completed for the sum mentioned. </para>

                                <para>- The accommodation of the Federal Parliament here is temporary, but it has existed for the past twenty years. Whether the temporary accommodation will be availed of for another twenty years will depend largely on the view-point and actions of members of this Parliament, and on the opinions held by the people generally, as well as on the matter of finance. During latter days a rather ungrateful spirit appears to have taken possession of members of the Federal Legislature. They little think of the wonderful concession granted to Federation by the people and Government of Victoria in providing this House of Parliament. Although it lacks many of the conveniences of an up-to-date legislative building, and despite that some little expenditure has been incurred now and again, if honorable members will calmly consider the way in which the Federal Legislature has been housed and cared for by the Victorian people and authorities there should be expressions of thanks rather than querulous criticism. </para>

                                <para>- With respect to our removal to Canberra, I may say at once that I am not averse to the proposition. The difficulty which confronts me, however, has to do with finance. As for the item actually under discussion, I consider the proposed expenditure upon the additions indicated by the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> eminently reasonable. Honorable members may content themselves with this, namely, that for quite a number of years to come the Federal Parliament will continue to be housed in this building; and it is as well, since there are certain inconveniences occasioned by our being here, that those disabilities should be remedied. In this respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the officials of Parliament are doing a little - and only a little - to endeavour to remedy the somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs. The proposal to spend &#163;2,000 in making what may be regarded as a temporary improvement of this building in order to provide greater convenience for members should meet with the ready and unanimous approval of the Committee. When the financial clouds have rolled by, I, if still a member of this Parliament, shall do my best to expedite the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra, and will vote for the necessary expenditure. But with the present weight of debt upon the shoulders of the people, I am not favorable to the expenditure of a large sum for that purpose at the present time. </para>

                                <para>- That is necessary. Honorable members have been complaining that there is no accommodation for interviewing their constituents. Standing Committees of this Parliament have had to seek accommodation elsewhere in the city. This Parliament should give early consideration to the very big rent roll which the Commonwealth is paying. Although in time to come this Parliament must be removed to its permanent home in Canberra, accommodation will still be required for Federal staffs in the various capital cities. In Sydney, particularly, there is an absolute necessity for a considerable expenditure in providing office accommodation for Federal Departments. Some of the places in which Commonwealth officials in that city are housed are nothing more or less than rabbit warrens, and the Government ought to be arraigned before the Courts for breaches of the Factories Act for requiring their officers to work in such places. </para>

                                <para>- That is one exceptional building, which was erected only within recent years. The Public Accounts Committee recommended that the big rent roll should be reduced by the expenditure of money in providing permanent accommodation for the various Departments. The Navy Department and the Defence Department are paying considerable amounts in rents each year in Melbourne and Sydney, and many other Departments are doing the same. The Public Accounts Committee calculated that an immediate expenditure in the erection of buildings on property owned by the Commonwealth would be a payable proposition. In the Victoria Barracks area, on St. Kilda-road, the Commonwealth owns acres of land where Government offices could be built, thus saving rents and providing for our officers proper accommodation. This is a matter to which the Committee should give consideration. As private individuals we remain rent-payers no longer than we can avoid. We believe in owning the building in which we reside, instead of paying rent to a landlord. The Government should proceed on the same principle. If we are desirous of saving money let us erect our own offices, knowing full well that even after this Parliament removes to Canberra a great deal of office accommodation will still be required in each city by Commonwealth Departments. In the Perth General Post Office, owing to a wise purchase made by a Labour Government, the Commonwealth will be able to provide accommodation for all its Departments. The improvements which are being made to the Adelaide General Post Office will permit of a similar desirable state of affairs there, but the position in Sydney is disgraceful and that in Melbourne is little better. </para>

                                <para>- On account of Melbourne being the temporary Seat of Government, the rent roll in that city is larger than in some of the other capitals. But I repeat that even after Parliament removes to Canberra there will still be need for office accommodation for Commonwealth servants. I readily accord my support to the proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has placed before the Committee to spend &#163;2,000 in improving the accommodation in this building. My only regret is that owing to the financial stress he is obliged to limit his proposal to such a small amount. </para>

                            <para>.- The Committee has just agreed to an item of &#163;2,000; but in regard to it there was some discussion. Apparently, every honorable member was staggered by the enormous size of the amount. Personally, I shall not disagree to a vote of &#163;2,000, or even &#163;2,000,000, provided it is to be expended in Melbourne. One&#39;s attitude in regard to any vote depends on the place in which it is to be expended, and the purpose of such expenditure. I am not going to make any further protest against the expenditure of enormous sums of money; nothing matters, and nobody objects. We are called upon to-night to agree to the expenditure of &#163;3,000,000, of which nearly &#163;2,000,000 is to be expended for various purposes of defence. It is useless to get panicky over other items of expenditure. It is a matter of indifference as to whether the amount is &#163;10,000, or &#163;50,000, or &#163;100,000,000- we are increasing the bill all the time, and we must continue as we are going. I call attention, however, to the utter hypocrisy of men who in this House were talking some time ago about the green fields of perpetual peace - who said that peace was to to be brought to this country, and that the war had ended by giving the world a peace that would endure. Now we are about to incur enormous items of expenditure for arsenals, dockyards, and other things of that character. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stated this afternoon that no one dared to question the principle of a White Australia. Then, against what prospective enemy are we making all these preparations and spending all this money? Neither in regard to this vote nor any other vote, whether it be for &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;100,000,000, shall I take part in the hypocrisy of protesting against extravagant expenditure in this country. But here is an item that no Government dares to justify in the light of all its protestations and affirmations. Here is &#163;2,000,000 for defence; after it may come as many more millions as you like ; let it go ! </para>

                            <para>.- It is a very curious thing&#39; that the Government should apparently hope that a vote of this kind for defence purposes will be accepted by the Committee without even a meagre explanation, not to say an apology for, the proposals here submitted. Of course, having regard to the way in which the Government change their programme from hour to hour and from day to day we were somewhat surprised when they asked us to agree to a vote of &#163;1,302,000 in respect of defence, of which no explanation has been given by the Government, unless it was the speech of a Minister in another place, and the address which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> delivered by leave of the House - a statement that then and there was not open for discussion at all. The very first item in this division, and, indeed, the first words of the first item, are, I hope, an offence to the standard-bearers of Democracy in this country generally, and are a repudiation of the accepted terms of the Treaty of Peace which ended the disastrous and tragic war which, for over five years, disgraced the so-called civilized world. &#34; Warlike stores, including machine guns &#34; - for what purpose, and against whom? &#34;Vehicles, harness, and saddlery, accoutrements, and other regimental and personal equipment&#34; - for whom, and for what purpose? Not one word is vouchsafed by the Minister in respect of these items to justify the extent of the expenditure or to indicate what special purposes are to be served by the vote. It was at least due to the Committee that something in the nature of an explanation should be given. None has been given. One of the outstanding features of that Treaty of repudiation into which we entered was the reduction of armaments. This vote spells at least one thing which we can understand, and that is an increase of armament - an increase of the weapons of destruction, an increase of useless waste, an increase of what a Minister in another place described as the money spent upon &#34;our policy of insurance.&#34; It is a further instalment of money wasted upon that policy of so-called insurance, upon which so many millions of pounds have been already wasted, and an addition to the debt saddled upon the people of this and every other country. I rise only to protest against the vote. I have no hope of defeating it, but I shall not allow a proposal of this kind to go without protest and challenge. I shall, at any rate, record my vote against it. </para>

                            <para>. - I also raise my voice in protest against the expenditure of &#163;1,302,000 in connexion with Defence. The statements made by the leaders of the Government during the years of war are still green in my memory. We were told that we were engaged in a war to end war, to make the world safe for Democracy, and to bring about a reduction of armaments. Almost every Australian who volunteered to fight in the great war honestly .believed that he was offering his services, and his life, if necessary, in order that the world might never again be deluged with blood, as it has been during the last six years. Those whom they left behind held the same belief, and the men who fell on foreign fields were comforted in the thought that they were giving their lives in order to prevent a repetition of disastrous war. We find now, what, indeed, was apparent to some on this side of the House before, that we were not fight ing a war to end war, but that the great struggle would merely mean the building up of vaster armaments and navies. The statement that the great war would end war for all time was nothing but cant, hypocrisy, and humbug. In spite of the sacrifices Australia has made, in spite of the load of debt our people have shouldered, in spite of our huge pensions bill, and in- spite of all the pain, suffering, and tears which have been part of the sacrifice of our people, expenditure on armaments and preparations for war is still &#39; to continue. Instead of relief being afforded us as the result of the sacrifices which Australia made during the recent war, a greater burden than ever is being piled upon the taxpayers. I shall vote against this item. </para>

                                <para>- It is unnecessary to spend the amount that it is proposed to expend upon defence works. Honorable members who said that the last war was a war to end wars knew that they were speaking with their tongues in their cheeks. They did not believe what they were saying, and the proposed expenditure which we are now considering serves only to prove that. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly . We. should stand condemned before the people of this country if we supported the Government in a proposal to incur this huge war expenditure. I have always been opposed to war. I believe that wars cannot do any good. They have never done any good. They have always brought poverty, tears and suffering to the people, and it is the workers who suffer most from them. It is they who will suffer if the present proposals of the Government be carried. </para>

                            <para>. - I confess that I am somewhat disappointed at the proposed expenditure upon new defence works. As one who justified the recent war I was under the impression whilst the struggle was in progress that it was a war to end wars. But it appears to me that Australia, and, indeed, every other country is now engaged in preparing for future wars. It is the duty of public men in every land to bend their best &#39; energies to the task of preventing wars, and that cannot be done by making preparations for war. </para>

                                <para>- That is the cry 1 have heard all my life. We are told that we must be ready because the other fellow is likely to attack us. As a result the minds of public men run only in the direction of making preparations for war. irrespective of their cost. I was hopeful that upon the termination of the recent struggle when the representatives of the various nations met in Conference, and drew up the Covenant of the League of Nations, we should be able to devise some means of preventing war, so that we could bring about disarmament to a very large extent. I anticipated that an earnest endeavour would be made to reduce our military expenditure. I am not one of those who anticipate that we shall be plunged in another war in the near future. I know that there are some honorable members who hold that belief. They are constantly telling us that a certain nation is a menace to Australia. But I see nothing to cause me to apprehend that the Commonwealth is in danger. </para>

He has also overlooked the fact that it would not be to the interests of any nation to interfere with the Pacific Islands, seeing that the British Empire and at least one other nation which has not yet entered the League, are vitally interested in the control of those islands. </para>

                        <para class="block">But I do recognise the necessity for reducing our defence expenditure as much as possible. We are now invited to authorize the expenditure of a larger amount for defence than we voted last year. I was positively amazed last year to find that the sum of &#163;78,000,000 had been placed upon the Estimates for defence purposes. I was not present when the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech the other day, and, consequently, I do not know the amount which was actually expended under that heading. Certainly, it must have been a very large one. Still, another huge sum is to be expended this year. How long can we continue to travel along this road? We constantly hear rumblings from the other side of the world - rumblings which are ominous. We know that in Great Britain there are thousands of unemployed, and that a very severe winter is expected there. Similar conditions obtain throughout the rest of Europe, and ere long those conditions must be reproduced in Australia. What position shall we then occupy ? We cannot continue to pile up expenditure for an indefinite period. Last year we expended upon new works and buildings for defence purposes &#163;86,579, and this year it is proposed to expend &#163;1,302,153. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ; there is an item of &#163;294,200 in connexion with air services. That means that this year we are practically doubling our expenditure upon new defence works. To-day our revenue is rising bv leaps and bounds. Why ? Because we are heaping additional taxation upon the people. There ought to be as little expenditure as possible in connexion with defence, and I believe that our compulsory military training system should come to an end. If we are going to continue it, and to provide boots for the trainees, we ought not to pass by our own Commonwealth Factory, which is quite capable of manufacturing all the boots that are required in this connexion - boots of first class quality. </para>

But we shall not increase production by expenditure upon defence works. These works will produce nothing. We ought, rather, to do our best through the Prime Minister to bring into actual being the League of Nations. To-day the League is merely a skeleton, and we ought to endeavour to infuse life into it. These are matters which require serious consideration, and I could not, therefore, permit this vote to pass unchallenged. </para>

                            <para>. -  I agree with those honorable members who have said that we are entitled to some explanation from the Treasurer of the proposed vote for new defence works. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> has stated that the figures with which I supplied the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> are misleading, and that I should have had regard to the fact that the money which we propose to expend upon these works this year will come out of revenue, whereas the amount expended last year came out of loan moneys. Three items alone of these Defence Works Estimates, namely - General Arsenal, machinery and plant, &#163;248,651; Cordite Factory, machinery and plant, &#163;10,773, and an amount to be paid to the credit of Trust Fund Small Arms Ammunition Accounts for reserve of small arms ammunition, &#163;287,048, involve an expediture, roughly, of &#163;560,000. Yet upon those three items last year we spent only about &#163;30,000. The total amount actually expended upon new defence works last year was &#163;86,579. The proposed expenditure this year upon the military side alone is set down at &#163;1,302,153, to which must be added &#163;294,200 for air services, a total of &#163;1,596,000, as against an actual expenditure last year of &#163;86,579. It will thus be seen that for every shilling we expended last year, it is proposed to expend a pound this year. Yet not a single word of explanation has been vouchsafed by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in this House. We were told, as has been pointed out tonight, that the last war was a war to end war; but we have also heard that we should be prepared to defend ourselves against the other fellow. Do honorable members think that a penny of this expenditure is justified? Are they satisfied? Does every honorable member know that the money will be wisely spent ? I do not think so, at all events. For every shilling we spent last year we propose to spend &#163;1 this year. That is the position. I have gone through the figures very carefully on the various pages of the Estimates, and I challenge the Minister to deny the accuracy of my statements. Are we going to vote the whole of this money blindly? We have been told that we are to have another vote before us this evening, namely, a vote in connexion with the Federal Capital site. I am in favour of honouring undertakings, but I am not in favour of this huge expenditure without one word of explanation from the Minister. When we were discussing the Peace Treaty we were told there was to be a general disarmament. Where is the evidence of it in the Estimates? Instead of disarming, we are all the time building up. I have no objection to some of the small items; no objection, for instance, to the proposed expenditure of &#163;38,000 for additional machinery for the Cloth Factory, as that could be used for civilian purposes. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps we did. But suppose we did. Have we not found out since then that we were wrong, and that the last war has not removed the possibility of other wars? In my opinion, it has not. A great many people pin their faith to the League of Nations as the instrument to prevent future wars. I do not share that belief, but I think we should give the League of Nations a trial. If a tribunal such as the League of Nations will prevent war in the future, I shall support it heart and soul, for it is most desirable that we should do everything in our power to prevent wars with all its attendant horrors. I do not believe that the League of Nations will prevent future wars, and in support of my opinion I may repeat an argument which I have used on other occasions. For years we have been passing legislation in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments for the settlement of industrial disputes. We have laid it down that parties to a dispute must come before certain Tribunals. At first it was fondly believed that, as we had set up Arbitration Courts, there would be no further strikes; but, so far from that being the case, I think honorable members will agree with me that since the introduction of this class of legislation strikes in Australia have increased by 100 per cent. A similar result, I think, may be anticipated with regard to international disputes, for the settlement of which the </para>

The Prime Minister then explained everything, and told honorable members that the sum of &#163;3,200,000 would be placed on the Estimates for defence (military), &#163;3,200,000 for defence (naval), and &#163;500,000 for the Air Force.

                                <para>- With regard to the expenditure for this year, if honorable members have regard to the reduced purchasing power of a sovereign, which is only one-half of that of pre-war years, they will realize that our expenditure this year will really be no more than in 1914. There is, for instance, the item in connexion with the Cordite Factory. If we are to have a Defence Force we must have ammunition, and, therefore, we must have cordite for its manufacture. And then there is the Arsenal. It is not to be a one-building affair. The Arsenal is to be a huge supply depot, which is essential in any defence scheme, for it is of no use training men unless we have the wherewithal and equipment for them to fight with; and it costs a lot of money now to make ammunition. At present we cannot manufacture our own big gun ammunition, and we must have these weapons for the adequate defence of this country. I contend that the expenditure for this year has been cut down to the absolute minimum. As a matter of fact, it is not enough, but we must cut our cloth according to our measure. A great deal of the amount set aside for military defence is for the provision of war material. Then there is the training of our men. Adequate provision is not made for this financial year, but it is all we can do with the money at our disposal. The Leader of the Opposition and other honorable members of  his party have on other occasions made quite a point of the fact that they introduced the system laid down in the Kitchener scheme for the compulsory training of the youth of Australia. Very well, if the system is good, if it is necessary to train the youth of Australia, we must also provide the wherewithal to fight. </para>

                            <para>.- I wish to voice my protest against this huge expenditure for defence purposes, particularly in view of the state of our finances and the military conditions of the world generally. Notwithstanding the statement of the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> that other nations of the world are amassing war equipment, I consider the amount we are being asked to pass is much too heavy for a young country such as Australia. I do not like repeating a phrase that has been used very frequently this evening, but I must reiterate that during the whole war period we were told, not only in this House, but from every public platform, .that the recent war was to end all wars, and to crush militarism. We were told that Prussianism had to be destroyed, because it was detrimental to the interests of Democracy and the peace of the world. In destroying Prussianism as it existed in Germany, 60,000 brave Australians laid down their lives, but notwithstanding this, the Government have now the audacity to ask the Committee to sanction a huge expenditure for building up a great military machine. The military system which we were supposed to have been fighting is now being created in our own country, and to maintain that system Australia is now being asked to carry an unreasonable and almost impossible burden. We were told that the military machine had to be destroyed at any cost, but it seems that all we have derived from the  recent conflict  is victory and the very Prussianism that we were fighting. The nations that we have beaten have been compulsorily freed from the curse of militarism, and we are now being asked to shoulder the burden they once bore. </para>

                                <para>- We were told that the aim of the Allied nations fighting in the recent war was to kill the accursed militarism which we are now perpetuating. The Assistant Minister for Defence disclosed the true position when he said that the expenditure was not sufficiently heavy, and that  the Government had been compelled to cut their coat according to their cloth. The inference to be drawn from his statement is that the expenditure would have been heavier had more money been available. It is evidently the intention of the Government to spend even more in extending the system and in compelling the people to live under the iron heel of military rule. </para>

                                <para>- Very little, because there is hardly any need for it. If the victorious nations had used victory to destroy militarism there would not have been any need for unnecessary expenditure such as this. The nations that we were opposed to in the recent conflict -Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey - are &#34; down and out,&#34; and the Allied Powers have been victorious. If the victors had played the game militarism would not be receiving the attention of the world Powers at the present time. The principal nations of any strength at present are America, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, which is our Ally. Who are we preparing to fight.? If it is America, let us say so. </para>

                                <para>- When I desire an expression of opinion on the brotherhood of man I shall not appeal to the honorable member for Illawarra. At the termination of the recent conflict America was anxious to disarm, and if the other nations had adopted a similar attitude, disarmament would have been general, and military and naval expenditure all over the world would have been, reduced to a minimum. But it cannot be said that leading nations are adopting a policy of disarmament, and the inevitable consequence must be another clash of arms. We are being asked to pass a vote of &#163;1,302,000 for defence works for this year. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, that is an additional amount. Great Britain is increasing her military expenditure, and we must therefore expect our outlay in this direction to increase if we are to keep pace with other nations. The burden is becoming so great that the inevitable crash must come, and by deliberately voting for the expenditure of this amount we shall be assisting in perpetuating a system which must eventually lead to other wars. It has been said that the attitude adopted by other nations must control the situation in Australia, but it must be remembered that we are part of the British Empire, and our expenditure should be coupled to some extent with that of Great Britain. We were informed during the recent war that German militarism had to be destroyed because of the atrocities perpetrated. One hundred years ago France had to be crushed to secure international peace, and it was because of the position in which France was then placed that Germany became such a formidable military Power. The result of the great war appears to be that, although we have defeated two or three nations, the other Powers are still arming, and an Ally of to-day may be an enemy to-morrow. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose the honorable gentleman would like me to give the credit to the Win-the-War Government. Such cheap and paltry interjections have no effect upon me, and they are such as one would expect from one with a small mind and weak intellect. I understood the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> to say, by interjection, that no scheme of disarmament had been formulated. If such is the case, who is to blame? The Allied Powers compelled the defeated nations to disarm, but is there any reason why they should not have formulated a scheme to compel the victors to disarm? Surely they were powerful enough to do that? </para>

This talk about the safety of Australia necessitating heavy Defence expenditure is all moonshine. We are told that it is necessary to pile up Defence expenditure because of the possibility of war; but the only nation with which we could possibly go to war is one of those with whom we have been fighting side by side. The military power of the other nations has disappeared. </para>

                                <para>- I have practically concluded my speech ; but there are others who wish to address themselves to the question. As long as I am a member of this House I shall strongly protest and vote solidly against the heaping up of armaments, and the growth of military power in this country. Such things are detrimental to the national progress. Every nation is to some extent to blame for the danger of war, because of the way in which they go on increasing their armaments, the one vieing with the other to secure the most efficient killing machines for use when the time comes. </para>

                            <para>.- I would point out to honorable members that practically one-half of the proposed vote for the Department of Defence relates to reserve stores. Under that heading provision is made for the expenditure of something like &#163;625,000. I have been informed that there are but few serviceable rifles in Australia, and it, therefore, seems to me that the proposed expenditure of &#163;266,000 on reserves of rifles is justifiable. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that a rifle has not been returned for every Australian soldier who came back from the Front, and that thousands of rifles that have been returned are not effective. That is a most alarming and mischievous statement to make if untrue; but if it is correct the Department should at once take action to secure an ample supply. I regret very much that, so far as I can see, no provision is made on these Estimates for expenditure in respect of Rifle Clubs. </para>

                        <para>As I pointed out in my opening remarks, one-half of this proposed expenditure is in respect of reserve stores. There is an item of &#163;266,000 for rifles, there is also an item of &#163;70,000 for reserve stores for the Small Arms Factory and Cordite Factory, and an item of &#163;287,000 for reserves of small arms ammunition. These  items will not be a recurring expenditure. It is not to be supposed that the ammunition will become obsolete within a short period.- I am sorry that all this expenditure is necessary, but we have to consider, not what we should like in this world, but what we ought to do in view of the facts, and all the facts point to the inevitable conclusion that we must be prepared for the adequate defence of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- No. I desire to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to the compulsory training of boys, and it is sufficient for my purpose to move that the vote be reduced by &#163;1. I do not object to adequate preparations for the defence of Australia, and I am convinced that, if the United States of America had stood by its compact, and had remained in the League of Nations, all this expenditure would not have been necessary. In what respect shall we improve the defence of Australia by training our boys? We have, at the present time, something like 300,000 returned men - all highly-trained soldiers - and they are our best asset. </para>

                                <para>- I cannot say, but even if only one-half of them were fit they would represent a very considerable Force. Men who have been engaged in training soldiers tell me that they prefer the raw material rather than a half-trained boy. They assure me that a man who enters the ranks quite &#34; green,&#34; so to speak, can be more readily made a highly trained soldier than a youth who has been half trained. </para>

When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> returned from the Peace Conference he told us that, with the thorough establishment of the League of Nations, the need for large expenditure on defence would have disappeared, since the League would defend small nations. Surely if the League of Nations is to be a success we do not need to make permanent soldiers of the men of this country. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The boys of New South Wales already undergo physical training in the public schools. There are also various school sports which materially assist in their development. I fear that a lot of money is being wasted at the present time on the compulsory training of boys, merely, it seems to me, to find work for some of the men who have returned from the Front. I do not object to find jobs for the men who came back from the Front so long as they are usefully employed. </para>

                                <para>- I am generally against the Defence expenditure proposed. I consider that it is only a fair thing to ask that the Defence Department shall suspend for a number of years the training of young men. At the present time, we have a large army of trained men who are now in civil life, and if this country were invaded, those men would flock to the Standard. I submit my amendment with a view of testing the opinion of the Committee on the Defence expenditure proposed by the Government. </para>

                                <para>- The good General is not going to bluff me. He has had four or five years of that kind of thing ; but he is not going to be allowed to perpetuate it in this country. It is my firm belief that the Government are proposing this Defence expenditure at the instigation of those military heads who do not want to lose their jobs. They have had four or five years of a good time, and they do not wish it to come to an end. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that the General lost very much weight either. It was not only those who got the name df going to the firing line who did all the work in the  Avar.  The men who went into the trenches and fought and died there, and those who returned maimed, are the only men I recognise in connexion with the work of the war. I do not recognise those who went to the Front in fat billets and lived on the sacrifices of others. No one desires more than I do&#62; to recognise the splendid sacrifices made by the 60,000 men who lost their lives in the war. We have heard the honorable gr,em Der for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> prating this evening, but it was a very cheap kind of prating that he has given us. We have had enough of it for the last four or five years in this country. We have been told what we should do when we have spoken of the spendid sacrifices of our men. I do not wish to refer to this matter in any personal way at all, but the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> has told us that we must not let it go forth that our men died in vain. If they had not died in vain, why should we be asked to spend this year another &#163;1,500,000 on Defence? I say that our men will have died in vain if we are going to heap up Defence expenditure in the way proposed. </para>

                                <para>- We shall hear the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> afterwards. He is ready to come along with his pruning knife when proposals are made to provide postal facilities for people in the back country. Although he promised that he would not cut down the expenditure necessary for that purpose, he has done so, and we shall have more to say on that subject later on. But when there is a proposal to find jobs for people who have waxed fat upon militarism during the last four or five years, the right honorable gentleman apparently can see no reason for cutting down the expenditure proposed. The Defence expenditure is merely a sop to those people to continue them in their billets. I say, as one who has been against war all my life, that I am not prepared to take this kind of thing sitting down. We have only to look at some of the items of the Estimates to note the increases which axe proposed. The item for the &#34; Reserve of rifles,&#34; referred to by the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson),</inline> shows a vote of &#163;266,000 for this year as against &#163;32,352 for last year. &#163;262,000 is set  &#39; towards heavy guns, and reserve of gun ammunition,&#34; whilst no amount was voted on this account last year. The vote for Barracks is &#163;4,248 this year as against only &#163;288 last year. I could quote these increases almost without end. It is quite apparent that the war was not going to end war in spite of what honorable members have said. We were told by the Prime Minister of the excellent work which he did at the Peace Conference in connexion with the establishment of the League of Nations. We were told also that we were to have &#163;20,000,000 of the German indemnity. What has become of that indemnity? It has vanished into thin air. We hoar nothing now of the splendid work done by the Prime Minister in this regard at the Peace Conference. It is useless to tell a mother who has lost sons at the war, and has other sons growing up, that her elder sons have not died in vain when she is faced with the fact that the very same conditions will await her younger sons when they grow up. Those who sent their sons to the war were told that they would never again be faced with the same conditions; but, as a matter of fact, here we are, perpetuating the system of compulsory training, and heaping up defence expenditure. What a beautiful prospect is ahead of the parents of this country? The Minister tells us that we must continue compulsory training because of other wars that are looming ahead. The honorable gentleman boasts that the Australian soldier during the recent war played his part equally with the soldier from any other part of the world ; but as the great bulk of the Australian soldiers over twenty-five years of age could not have received any compulsory military training - the system had not been long enough in force to embrace them in its scope - they were mostly men whose only military training was that which they gained when they went into camp. The Minister claims that one volunteer is worth so many conscripts: in other words, he means that the Australians who had received less compulsory training than was undergone by soldiers of other countries, played their part equally with those other soldiers. The experience of our own soldiers is a complete answer to the statement that compulsory military training is necessary. The Australian soldier is equal to a soldier of any country in the world, yet has had less compulsory military training. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know that I was ever very strongly in favour of it. I have always been opposed to war. But it is useless for the Minister to attempt to saddle me or even the Labour party with something for which the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was responsible when he was associated with us. The Assistant Minister for Defence has not told us that there is any great menace threatening Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Then, apparently, the Minister does not agree with the statement made at Bendigo a few weeks ago by the Prime Minister, that Australia&#39;s menace to-day is the Bolshevik movement in Russia. He told us that it was Bolshevism that was threatening the liberties of the people of Australia, and he said that the people ought to arm to the teeth because of this menace. No school child could pay regard to such drivel, and there is hardly a reputable newspaper in the country that has not commented adversely on that speech. But the fact that the right honorable gentleman mingles Bolshevism with every other &#34; ism &#34; as he has been doing for the last five years, is not sufficient justification for all this expenditure. The Assistant Minister for Defence does not resort to the trash we got from the Prime Minister at Bendigo, but at the same time he has not given us any reason for departing from our pledged word given to the manhood of this country in order to get them to take up their responsibilities in regard to the war; that if they went away to fight, it would be the last war, and that it was to be a war to end war. </para>

Honorable members opposite, speaking of the Labour Party, say, &#34; You were all pledged to compulsory training ; it was your policy.&#34; We have not waited until this late hour of the day to get that information. When we were in power compulsory training was part of our programme. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister for Works and Railways may make all the points he can out of that interjection, but the experience gained during the last war as to the manner in which our soldiers acquitted themselves has shattered the beliefs of even the most ardent supporter of compulsory training. I was never enamoured of war in any shape or form, and any belief I had in compulsory training was shattered by our experience in the late conflict. I agree that our men were equal to any others at the Front ; yet they had had the least amount of pre-war compulsory training; and the fact that our soldiers so proved themselves is the best argument why we should put an end to compulsory training. </para>

                                <para>- However that may be, I regret that it is now proposed to expend a million and a half in this way, without any justification being offered on the part of the Government. All honour to those parents who sacrificed their sons, and they deserve something better than the future now proposed for them and their families. Instead of our returned men being able to look forward to a rosy time, they are asked to live under the old &#39;Conditions; and their little ones, as they come along, are to be trained to be killed later on. If that is to be their . future, the great war was fought in vain. What has become of all the grand promises that were made? Where is the nation that is menacing or threatening us to-day? The great nations of the earth who were our enemies are all &#34;down and out.&#34; What chance have they of an early recovery, to be a menace to this country? As I have said before, I firmly believe there is a number of heads in the Defence Department who have had a good time for the last four or five years, with no necessity to fight in the trenches, and they wish to keep their present positions. I do not say that that is the motive of the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> ; hut there is no doubt a move has been made by the militarists in the Department to keep their rosy billets.

                            <para>In considering the large expenditure which the people of Australia are being asked to hear as the result of the war, it should be borne in mind that Australia&#39;s burden is much heavier than that of some of the other Dominions owing, principally, to the great  difference  in the distances over which troops had to bc transported to the various battle fronts. Further, certain published figures show that the casualties among Australian soldiers, as compared with enlistments, were higher than among those of any other .portion of the Empire. </para>

                                <para>- Because we had certain facts and figures before us. We said it when the war was on; and now that the war is over, the Treasurer practically admits that what we then said was true. If, as I believe, Australia played an unequalled part in the war, it is poor satisfaction to the people of this country to know that, instead&#39; of this money being spent for the benefit of returned soldiers, maimed in the war which was to end war, it is to be devoted to training our youth for future wars. Why otherwise is this expenditure proposed? </para>

                                <para>- That is so. If we are going to incur that expenditure, there are many other avenues where the money could be used; for example, to provide extra facilities for people living in the back country, but where, instead, the pruning knife has been used. If the money were used in that direction, and for the benefit of returned men, there would be some justification for the expenditure. I regret that the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> did not move to reduce the vote by &#163;1,000,000. </para>

                            <para>. -  The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> just before resuming his seat, said that the Minister had told the Committee nothing about the danger that menaced Australia. Honorable members on both sides will recognise that it is not wise to go into explanations as to what the menace to Australia is, but there is one thing upon which the honorable member is, I suppose, very strong, and rightly so, and that is the White Australia policy. It might perhaps enter his mind that there could be a danger of some one interfering with it. It is not my intention to go further into an explanation as to any menace to Australia. </para>

We do not know what is before us. and it is as well, in my opinion, that we in Australia should be prepared. The honorable member also made a very strong point of the fact that there were a number of military men - I presume he referred to the officers on the permanent staff of the Military Forces of Australia - who have too long enjoyed soft billets. I do not think the honorable member can know anything about the work which the officers on the permanent staff have to do, nor do I think he knows anything as to their usefulness, if we are to have a Defence Force or an Army at all. Nor does the honorable member know what the value of these men would be, should we have to fight in Australia for our very existence. </para>

                                <para>- There are very few of the permanent men in Australia who had the chance of going to the war and did not go. It is of no use to have a Defence Force unless we have a good Staff. I undertake to say that every returned soldier in the House realizes the absolute importance of a trained Staff, and that is what these men at the Victoria Barracks are. Certainly we are in peace time,, and some honorable members say that those men are living in soft billets, but forget that they have had a life&#39;s-time training for the work, and a life- time of drudgery, and have had hard examinations to pass. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think the honorable member is quite fair. There is not a permanent officer in the Department of military age that did not endeavour to go to the war. If he did not go, it was not his fault. A trained Staff is an absolute necessity in any country which professes to have a Military Force. I might point to instances in the campaign where, through a Staff not being efficient, disaster instead of success attended the efforts of Australians. I do not want to go into details, but we had instances where we met with disaster instead of success simply because mistakes were made by the Staff, and those mistakes would probably not have been made had that Staff been efficiently trained. </para>

                        <para>I should like to draw attention to the difference between the first part of the speech of the honorable member for Hume and the second part. It was amusing to notice the change that took place when the honorable member saw another Minister bring me this volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> This is a book which ought to be burned, and there is no man in the House who would sooner see it burned than the honorable member. Some very awkward things are dug up and brought to light from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The honorable member saw this book brought to me, and immediately turned as many somersaults as the greatest acrobat that has ever been seen. He wriggled and twisted, and one would have thought that he would almost get out of his skin in his endeavour to show that he &#39;had not said anything against compulsory training. First of ail, he had said that there should  be  no compulsory training. He asked, &#34;Why should we train men?&#34; Those who went away to the war, he said, went without training and turned out to he the best men in the world. There was no necessity, he argued, for this expenditure on training. We should have no training at all. But when he saw this book, he thought to himself, &#34; Hello !&#62; what did I say a few years ago?&#34; He does not know now what he said; but I shall read to the Committee what the honorable member said, not twenty years ago, but comparatively recently, on 19th June, 1912. </para>

                            <para>Yes; I notice that honorable members opposite generally like to share the credit of anything that has been . attended with success. I should like to contrast the bold and effective policy undertaken by this Government to provide a suitable Defence for Australia with the policy of the ex-Minister for Defence, who, according to a published report, stated in the Sydney Town Hall that he pinned his faith to an increase in the Naval subsidy. It is satisfactory to note that the re-organization of our land Forces under our system of compulsory military training appears to have the entire approval of the great majority of the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>. - I am in entire agreement with a remark of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> to the effect that the fact of what an honorable member may have said, as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> eight or nine years ago, should not be taken into account without consideration, at the same time, of the changes which may have occurred during the period in question. Why, because an honorable member may have had reason to change his views, owing to drastically altered circumstances, should he thereafter be quoted and charged with inconsistency? I think that such conduct is only going to the extreme to which the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> might be expected to go. Where was the honorable member himself eight years ago? I do not intend to follow that up, but I propose, for the special edification of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> to quote something of what British statesmen have been saying concerning reduced expenditure upon the Imperial Army and Navy. I shall take  my facts from the House of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and from official documents. It is rather amusing, by the way, to hear honorable members opposite speaking in regard to the White Australia policy. They were very little concerned about it a few years ago. I am of opinion that, in the minds of the members of the Government, the White Australia policy is considered to be safer to-day than ever before ; if such were not the case, the Prime Minister would now be about to depart for the other side of the world.  His  statements to-night were different from those expressed and indicated by the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie).</inline> However, I would point out that, according to a Budget-paperss laid before the House of Commons, the estimated total expenditure on the Army for 1919-20 was &#163;405,000,000, and the amount issued from the exchequer to meet the expenditure was &#163;395,000,000- a reduction of &#163;10,000,000; and, whereas the estimated expenditure on the Navy was &#163;157,000,000, the actual expenditure was &#163;156,000,000. The estimated expenditure on the Army for 1920-21 was &#163;125,000,000- showing a reduction of &#163;162,000,000 on the Budget provision for 1919-20. The estimated expenditure on the Navy for 1920-21 was &#163;84,000,000 -a reduction of &#163;64,000,000 on the Budget provisions for 1919-20. The Air Force estimates similarly showed a reduction of &#163;45,000,000. Against those great decreases, as foreshadowed and carried out by the Imperial Government, expenditure on public education increased from &#163;38,000,000 to &#163;56,000,000, and on old-age pensions from &#163;17,000,000 to &#163;25,000,000. On the Ministry of Pensions there was an advance of from &#163;72,000,000 to &#163;123,000,000; and, on the Ministry of Health, an increase from &#163;12,000,000 to &#163;34,000,000. Enormous increases were revealed also in regard to other similar branches of public interest in Great Britain, while, at the same time, these tremendous reductions were being made in Naval and Military expenditure. In the course of his Budget speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austen</inline> Chamberlain, having enumerated the considerable reductions in Army and Navy expenditure, continued - </para>

The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is complaining about our load of debt, and I think honorable members are doing their duty when they point out directions in which the expenditure may be reduced. The British Parliament is cutting down similar expenditure, and, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, Great Britain is leading the world towards disarmament. </para>

                                <para>- What does the British Prime Minister mean by his statement that the Government were reducing the men in the Army from 3,700,000 at the date of the Armistice to 300,000 in March last? Great Britain has a population of 47,000,000, who are contiguous to the other big populations of Europe, and yet her statesmen say that, although great reductions have taken place in the Army and Navy expenditure since the Armistice, further reductions will follow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George stated also - </para>

                            <para>There is another advantage. The greatest military power in the world is without an army. The navy that menaced us is at the bottom of the sea. I am only putting that in order to show that we have grounds for confidence in the financial stability of the future. The great disturbing element in Europe has been demolished and swept away. Conscription has gone in the country that really drove other countries into conscription. The initiative in that movement was taken by Great Britain. </para>

                                <para>- It is time that Ministers rose and explained if the position is otherwise. They would have us believe that other countries are arming themselves to the very teeth, but I have disproved that statement by quotations from the speeches of Imperial statesmen. The British people are backing up the Government, and all parties in the Old Country are united in regard to the reduction of naval and military expenditure. </para>

If anything, she is weaker, she has signed additional terms of disarmament, and has shown her <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> to a greater extent than before - to a greater extent, I believe, than British statesmen expected.

                            <para>.- I shall be very brief, indeed, in putting the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> right in regard to the statements which he has made. From the British <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1920-21 I gather that the proposed expenditure on the British Navy for this year is &#163;84,372,300, as against an actual expenditure last year of &#163;157,528,000. It will be remembered by the honorable member that Great Britain was at war last year. Now she is not at war. The proposed expenditure upon the British Navy this year is, therefore, a Peace expenditure. I have given the estimate which was made by the First Lord of the Admiralty. If we compare the amount <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> charged in Great Britain under this heading with that charged in Australia, what do we find? Under our Estimates for the current year we shall pay 12s. 5d. per head, whereas Great Britain will pay 34s. 4d. per head. I come now to the British Army estimates. The Estimates for the current financial year make provision for a net expenditure of &#163;125,000,000. The total establishment provided for is 525,000 officers and men, and this number is in process of reduction to 280,000. In addition, Great Britain is spending upon air services a sum of &#163;15,173,430. </para>

                            <para>. - I am very sorry that any action taken by me this evening should have resulted in unpleasantness; but I thought that I might express an opinion upon this matter without hurting anybody&#39;s feelings. I merely desired to know why the Defence Estimates had been increased so enormously. The moment anybody raises  that question he is told that he is either a pro-German, a disloyalist, or &#39;a pacifist. I am not nearly so much a pro-German as those who have been &#34;  lick-spittling  &#34; about the descendants of Germans. I am not prepared to worship at the shrine of those who changed their names during the war in order to hide their German origin. I notice that those who have been interjecting most frequently this evening are not the honorable members who have taken an active part in the war, but men, like, myself, who were careful to keep thousands of miles behind the firing line. I can only say with the gentlemen who did as much to win the war as I did - that is nothing - that I am not imbued with less patriotic zeal than they are. I sacrificed my relations for the cause of my country. </para>

                        <para>The Assistant Minister for Defence has said &#39; that anybody who urged during the progress of the war that there was not to be another war was talking nonsense. That is what I have said for years past. But only a few months ago anybody who dared to make that statement would have been regarded as an enemy of this country. Yet we are now told that the recent war was not a war to end war.- The Leader of the Government and those who sit behind him frequently affirmed that the recent war was specially conducted for the purpose of finishing war. Did not the Prime Minister return from the Peace Conference with declarations to the effect that we were at last coming out of the pit of war into the green fields of perpetual peace? This is an excellent opportunity to point out the lies and shams which were then indulged in. It was urged from practically every platform that the sacrifices that had been made would not be made in vain. We were assured that we were about to enter upon the paths of perpetual peace. These statements were made by representative men in this country. Are they true or false? A heavy responsibility rests upon those who say one thing to the people during one hour and deny it the very next. What has the Treasurer said to-night? Somebody hp? stated that Germany is down and out. Personally, I have not so much interest in Germany as have some honorable members who, whilst wrapping the British flag around them, crawled upon their hands and knees to those of German blood and origin. But what was the war fought for? To destroy German militarism. We have been told that it was successful. The Peace declaration stipulated for the sweeping away of the German Navy. It stipulated for the acquisition of certain coal-fields, railroads, and territory, but as for the militarism which might have been stripped of its arms, well, the Treasurer says that the Germans still possess 1,250,000 rifles&#34; and 400,000 armed men. For what? For defence purposes? They would be inadequate. To make war upon the Allies? That would be impossible. For what, then? Merely that she may defend her Imperial junker class against the efforts of the workers of Germany to establish a pure Democracy. The junker class was to be destroyed, but when was that class more powerful in Germany than it is to-day? Talk about the destruction of  junkerism.  It still lives. Talk about the destruction of militarism ! lt is still very much alive ! Was the war to destroy the Kaiser? No. He still lives. He was to be hanged. He was to be brought before a Court of International Justice, but was not. The liars ! This man, who was described as a baby murderer, who ordered the German soldiers to spare neither woman nor child ; this man who was a monstrosity in the eyes of the world, was to be brought to the bar of human justice. He still lives in his palace across the border in idleness and opulence. These are the things for which the men of our country were called, upon to shed their blood. None of them. - the abolition of militarism, the hanging of the Kaiser, the destruction of  Junkerism  and the fulfilment of Democracy - has been realized. All that has been done has been to introduce black troops into the conquered Territory for the violation of their women and the destruction of those forces for which we were prepared to stand. This is the out-, come. </para>

                                <para>- After I have answered the interjection raised by the Honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> I shall come back to my main point, which has nothing to do with Germany or pacifism or anything else. I merely want to point out to those who represent the policy of economy in this country, the honorable gentlemen in the Corner, a few of their inconsistencies. They want to save &#163;100 here, &#163;400 there, and, perhaps, &#163;4,000 somewhere else. Well, here is an opportunity for them, because we are dealing with a question involving the expenditure of millions of pounds. This is not a question of pacifism at all. I have always believed that war is a necessary and an inevitable condition of the system under which we are living; but, apparently, there is to be an expenditure of &#163;100,000,000 this year, and in connexion with war preparations the sum is something like three times the amount set aside before the war. We talk about economy ! Where is economy to be effected? If we cut down all civil expenditure there will still be &#163;70,000,000 as the result of our defence policy. </para>

                                <para>- This practically is three times the total expenditure, and three times the total revenue of this country prior to the war. The Treasurer went to Sydney last week, and in a speech there he said that there could be no salvation for this country - I may not be quoting his exact words - until we can rid it of its load of unproductive debts. </para>

                                <para>- This only shows that sometimes extremes meet. They meet on this occasion. I agree with the Treasurer. But I say that whoever makes that affirmation, and then loads up this country with an enormous increase in expenditure for war, is pursuing a policy contrary to his convictions; convictions, too, , that are forced upon him by the actual circumstances. The sum required for interest and sinking fund now amounts to more than our total expenditure before the war. What are we going to do about it? </para>

                                <para>- We are. I have done the same myself. I have paid&#163;1off one debt and borrowed another &#163;4. And that is the policy of the Government. I am not blaming the Treasurer. I do not condemn him because of the state of public opinion, and the absolute incapacity of the newspapers to provide a compass for public guidance, wherever they may be. The mere condemnation of somebody else is not guidance, but useless criticism. I do not condemn the Treasurer, because he realizes the situation clearly and definitely. He sees the enormous load of unproductive debt that weighs upon the resources of this country. Our chief means at this juncture is derived from the flowing revenue that comes to us through the customs, in consequence of the enormous price of imported goods. There is no need to increase the  Tariff,  as the price of commodities that come into the Commonwealth are double and treble what they usually are. But the slump must come, and when prices are reduced the revenue must also fall. The Treasurer has said that he has a remedy, and that we can pay off our debts by having a Sinking Fund. Is it suggested that our enormous debt can be liquidated from a Sinking Fund? Some day it will be paid off, but not in our time, even at the rate the honorable gentleman proposes. Before that day and before that hour, other more pressing and vital problems will be upon us. They are coming rapidly. The Treasurer thinks there is a virtue in a Sinking Fund. </para>
