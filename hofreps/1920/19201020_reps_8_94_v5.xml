                            <para>. - I de sire to thank the Leader of the Government for the opportunity which his motion has afforded me of addressing the House. I do not presume to offer any opinion upon the objections raised by two honorable members. They probably had good and sufficient reasons for so doing. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Honorable members will .probably remember that in March last I left Australia on what was regarded as a mission of considerable public importance. They will  doubtless  also recollect that early in June I  resigned from the Government in consequence of differences between the Cabinet and myself, and that on 2nd July the Prime Minister read in this House some cable correspondence which had passed between us, and explained the situation from the point of view of the Government. The House is entitled and - I am led to believe - desires to hear the other side of the story, and my purpose to-day is to deliver it. I hope I shall be forgiven if the personal pronoun obtrudes itself somewhat in my remarks, but, in the peculiar circumstances, I fear that is unavoidable. I shall endeavour to unfold a plain, unvarnished tale, so that Parliament and the country may, if they wish, pronounce a considered judgment. At the outset, I will ask honorable members to cast from their minds one erroneous expectation which may have been implanted by unauthorized newspaper comments and predictions. I do not return to Australia to ventilate any personal or official grievance. Neither am I intent on pursuing a vendetta against the gentlemen with whom I have worked for three and a half years in more or less harmonious concert. Humanity, the world over, is moving, amid conditions of the utmost gravity, to the&#62; stupendous difficulties that follow in the war. Australia has her share of those difficulties, as I thankfully believe she also has her share of new and  wonderful  opportunities. There is little enough time, however, for her. big tasks and none at all for quarrels between, individuals. In this mood I would willingly have accepted any disapprobation or even obloquy which some hasty or prejudiced persons may have attached to me; but it is my duty to explain the facts in justice alike to the public mind and to any political reputation that may linger around my past work. I am not here to appeal for sympathy or to lick my wounds. Neither am I here to indulge in intemperate language. But I shall speak very plainly, and I shall have occasion, if permitted by the indulgence of the House, to ain.plify not only matters in connexion with my recent mission to England, but those connected with the former Peace embassy, from which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and his colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> emerged with merited distinction. I shall find it necessary to read some portions of the cable correspondence which were omitted from the published file, as well as to introduce new matter. I have carefully read the speech which the Prime Minister made in this House in July last. In a brief interview which I gave the press in London after my resignation, I said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> considered my remarks unfair or inaccurate I invited him to lay upon the table of this House the cables which had passed between us. I imagined that he would have done this, and would have allowed the correspondence to interpret itself. Instead, he employed all the strategy of a past master in his <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> deliverance. Before reading the cablegrams he assumed an air of solicitude and fairmindedness which created an atmosphere of hostility to myself. With a running fire of comments during the recital of the more important documents, he intensified that feeling; and. in closing, he vigorously, if regretfully subjected me to a condemnation which was strangely at variance with his opening declaration.  His  words were, &#34; I have never said, and do not propose to say, one word against him.&#34; The performance proved a victory for the Prime Minister - even if a pyrrhic one. I feel disposed to add at this stage only one thing. Give me the opportunity of uttering a chorus of criticism when reading my absent opponent&#39;s letters, and I will easily prejudice him in the minds of my hearers. </para>
                        <para>I think I ought, at this stage, to read to the House an extract from a newspaper published in Melbourne dealing with the circumstances of which I propose to treat to-day. It is published in placard form, and is headed &#34; Which Hand?&#34; The extract is as follows.- - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>In the course of a few days William Alexander Watt, the quondam Treasurer of the Commonwealth, will reach these shores. Naturally, there is a certain section of the community hoping for political fireworks when he arrives. But they who look for fireworks will probably look in vain. If there is even a stick from a dead rocket, it will be more than surprising. </para>
                            <para>The whole situation with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and his return is really that all the facts of the case have been placed before the country, and there is nothing more to say. Those who think there is something more to. reveal merely suggest that the Prime Minister is such a fool as to try to hide something when, obviously, &#34; the other fellow,&#34; from the very nature of the mission with which he was entrusted, would know just as much as. he, and be in a position to let the cat out of the bag - if there were any cat dr any bag. And even the worst enemies of the Prime Minister would not suggest that he is a fool,, or lacking in shrewdness. </para>
                            <para>

                                is the one who has to face the music. He undertook an important mission on behalf of his country. That mission meant much to the. finances of Australia. It meant much to the future status of Australia among the nations of the world.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                                left his job at the crucial moment. That charge he has yet to answer.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                                has yet to explain why lie behaved in such a fashion.
                            </para>
                            <para>Doubtless, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> returns, he will be given an opportunity of making his explanation, not only  to. his own party, but to the House and to his country as&#39; well. It is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> that he should bc allowed to do this,, for his actions certainly seem to call for some explanation, and he alone can clear away the prejudice they have created. And, having given what must be, and only can be, ranked .as a personal explanation or a privileged statement, it will .be for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> himself to decide whether he shall quietly take his seat in. the House or drop out of politics altogether. </para>
                            <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> returns, it will .be- a case of &#34;Which hand will you have?&#34; One hand may clasp the olive branch, but it would be just as well for him to ascertain .whether the other hand does, or docs not, grasp a bludgeon. </para>

                        <para>That is taken from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> of 7th October. I am  informed  on good authority, that that paper was recently purchased by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> W. Hughes, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. I shall not at this stage traverse the arguments contained in that placard, except to say that I am not to be deterred by any threats of bludgeons from following the track I have marked out for myself. I shall say what I have to say in this free Parliament - and I hope it is still free - disdaining the intimidation of press desperadoes  hired by the friends of the Prime Minister. </para>
                        <para>I think I am entitled to say that I did not seek this trip, but strongly recommended that another Minister should be despatched abroad. Eventually, after three discussions, extending over almost as many weeks, I yielded to the pressure of a unanimous- Cabinet that I should- undertake the task. &#34;Unanimity is not usual in a Government, according to my experience, and. it is to me an interesting, and, shall I say, a cynical reflection that this Ministry have achieved it on at, least two occasions. First when they decided with many rich compliments that I should go away; and, second, when they confirmed the view of their Leader that -I was unworthy of trust in the duties which they had so- recently declared I was so well qualified to perform . </para>
                        <para>The problems assigned me for attention at the other end of the world were many and various. With the exception of those dealing with the affairs of Australia House they all involved important negotiations with the Imperial authorities. A few days after my arrival in London I was surprised to learn that the British Government had not been advised of my mission. This Parliament had been told by the Prime Minister in March that I was to sit as the representative of the. Commonwealth m the Imperial Cabinet; but no intimation to that effect had been sent to the British Government. I felt the awkwardness of the&#39; position, and cabled to the Prime Minister asking him to wire me full authority to sit. He afterwards informed me that he had sent a cablegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, giving the necessary authority. Meanwhile I was an emissary, charged with pressing and far-reaching, matters, and the Government with which I was to discuss them had not been made officially aware of my existence. When the matter was apparently attended to I dismissed it from my mind, and the uncomfortable remembrance only revived when other developments which -I shall describe began to link with it. I have no doubt that such a procedure for the time being, at least, materially prejudiced my status and impaired my usefulness. Although, afterwards, I was sent confidential Cabinet papers I was never, as a matter of fact, invited to a Cabinet meeting in London. It may just have been that the subjects discussed while 1 was there were not of a strictly  Imperial  character. I was, however treated wit. characteristic personal courtesy by Ministers, and have no complaint to make on that score. </para>
                        <para>Those who know London, and parlarly the White Hall and Westminster end, recognise the importance of status as an asset to a Dominion visitor. There are, I imagine, many who would describe this occurrence as an unfortunate blunder, and ,1 was so inclined .to consider it; but coming almost simultaneously with other events of a more serious nature, I could not, and cannot even now, adopt that view. </para>
                        <para>But I pass on. The most urgent and important subject I was sent home to handle was finance. The problems were big and. pressing, and they demanded and received first attention. While I was in London money was scarcer and dearer there and in other world markets than in- the blackest days of the war. It was impossible for any over -sea borrower to go on to the open market and .gather any. I had been given a triple financial puzzle to solve. First, I was to get new loan money for repatriation-; second, I had to arrange for the discharge of our heavy indebtedness to the British Government ; and, third, I  had to square up wool accounts and moneys, and gather some of the cash owing to our growers. The more I studied the whole subject before and after leaving Australia, the more it became plain that wool money was the only key that would open the other two doors. With a proper settlement of that matter, I could devise propositions which would satisfy the Imperial Exchequer and help our own Treasury over its immediate difficulties. Everything depended, therefore, on the delicate and tactful handling of the wool problem. Skill and prudence would lead us to probable success, clumsiness to certain failure. Let us see what happened. </para>
                        <para>While I <inline font-style="italic">waa</inline> on the water, the Prime Minister was approached by what he called in his cable of 20th May &#34; a section of the wool trade &#39; &#39; to propound a new wool scheme embracing past and present clips. I have a shrewd idea who that section was, but I will let that pass for the present. According to the same cable, he &#34; worked up the whole thing,&#34; to use his own phrase, and subsequently placed &#34; a complete scheme &#34; - again using his own words - (before a private meeting in Sydney on 27th April. I ask honorable members particularly to note that date. All the time he was being approached and was working up and propounding this scheme to outsiders, he was in frequent telegraphic touch with me, as his published cables of 15th April, 16th April, 21st April, 30th April, and 4th May show. Yet he did not mention one word of -this to une. Before I left Melbourne, he and I agreed that wool was the pivot of finance in Britain. Yet here was a new set of important proposals, concerning the most important part of the mission, being dealt with in secret, and I was kept in entire ignorance of the intrigue. </para>
                        <para>I landed at Naples on 1st May, and received the Prime Minister&#39;s cable of the 30th April, suggesting that I should not hasten to London, but should see the Continent. I thought this strange, since my arrangement with him was that I should go with all possible despatch to London; but I put it down to fraternal solicitude for my health and welfare, and did not appreciate the inwardness of things till later. I arrived in London on 10th May, and two days later received the Prime Minister&#39;s cablegram asking me not to see Ministers about finance or wool until further advised by him I was still unaware of any new proposals, although, as the Prime Minister said in one of his later cables, the matter admitted of no delay. I replied to his cable the day I received it, 12th May, that I could wait two or three days, but any further postponement would be awkward. The next day, 13th May, the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> published the Prime Minister&#39;s wool scheme, which, for the first time, I saw in the press. Later on the same day I received from the Prime Minister a long cable, dated 11th May, containing his scheme, and also containing much that was unnecessary, because it was well known to me, and much that was laughably erroneous so far as finance and trade were concerned. Honorable members may recall the fact that the Prime Minister, in that cable, indulged in quite a lot of arithmetic. He went so far as to express his belief that by June, 1921 - that is next June - there would be lying in London, to the credit of various Australian public and private accounts, &#163;135,000,000. Five months have elapsed since he uttered that opinion, and the conditions have changed so rapidly that a substantial premium is now asked for the purchase of sterling in London. However, this is. an excursion. I noted in the Prime Minister&#39;s cable of 11th May that wool men, bankers, and other financial authorities, politicians, and journalists, had been consulted about his new scheme, but not one word of information had been furnished to, or consultation sought from me. In fact, I appeared then to be about the only man interested who knew nothing at all about the matter. I afterwards learned, however, that the Central Wool Committee had also been kept in the dark. The more I thought of the ready-made scheme sent to me, the more I feared its effect on wool interests- here and in Great Britain; and Australia&#39;s unhappy experience since the wool sales opened, has, I believe, now convinced many others of its weakness. I was shocked by the Prime Minister&#39;s methods revealed in this message, and I made my first protest in the cable of 13th May. Even then the idea that this was done deliberately to thwart my mission did not occur to me. I merely thought that this section of the wool trade had, to use a vulgarism, simply &#34; pulled &#34; the Prime Minister&#39;s &#34;leg,&#34; and that his worst crimes, apart from this, were his failure to see the situation clearly, and his more than usual lack of frankness. I believed that the Prime Minister had committed his final mistake, and would then leave the matter to me to straighten out. If he had done so. any difficulty would have been between himself and myself, and the subsequent outside complications would have been avoided. So I swallowed hard, and went to work. I saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and provisionally discussed the payments due by the Commonwealth. I told him that before presenting a scheme of settlement of our debts I should have to investigate the wool accounts, and see how much money was due to and procurable for Australia . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> cheerfully assented to that procedure, and intimated his willingness to sympathetically consider my proposals, and help as far as he could. I then entered into consultation with the Minister for Munitions, Lord Inverforth, and the Director-General of Raw Materials, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Goldfinch. It was quite clear from the first touch with&#39; these gentlemen that the criticism which had fallen upon the British end of the Wool Pool from certain Australian pens and lips had not rendered a settlement any easier. I explained this in a cable to the Prime Minister. However, ere long that feeling was happily brushed aside, and we got down to business. At my request, the Ministry gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> the Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, free access to all accounts and documents, and placed him in intimate daily touch with the accountants and auditors; in fact, they gave him the &#34; free run of the office.&#34; This presented me with the opportunity of checking the vital figures of profits and the surplus cash in hand. After several days&#39; investigation, the Minister of Munitions and I arrived at important conclusions. These were embodied in mv cable of 21st May, which the Prime Minister, _ I think with propriety, treated as confidential. </para>
                        <para>In order to illustrate how far the negotiations had gone, I now propose to accept the responsibility of giving those conclusions to honorable members. I shall read the words of the cable, and honorable members can themselves connect them with the cables already laid before them. Here is the part that has not yet been published - </para>

I said that we must have our share then, and they eventually agreed to hand me &#163;8,750,000. That is about our proportion of &#163;19,000,000, and is sum we have contracted pay British Government. Need not stress this point further now. I then pressed for another substantial payment before I leave Britain, say, in September. They agreed, hut we could not decide amount at the moment. I am, however, hopeful that I can get between ten and twenty millions as second dividend before returning. Directors estimate of carryover next September between three-quarters and one million bales, mostly cross-bred medium to low grades. .Generally I am well satisfied with result of negotiations.

Honorable members will remember that the Prime Minister said that he and the Central Wool Committee had been trying for two years to get as far. On the spot I had been able to get there in seven days. I was satisfied that by the 30th: June I would lift &#163;8,750,000, and by 30th September at least another &#163;15,000,000, and very possibly &#163;20,000,000.

                        <para class="block">Exchequer, when a sudden change came o&#39;er the scene. When next I met the Minister for Munitions I was shown a cable which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had sent direct to the British Government, containing three things in this order: First, a demand for a definite statement without delay of the amount due to the wool-growers of the Commonwealth ; second, a demand for payment forthwith for all wool sold to date; and, third, proposals for the new clip. The cable concluded by asking for an immediate reply. This had been sent straight to the British Government, as if I were not in London, and no mention was made of the fact thai I had been sent to Great Britain to discuss and settle the first two matters. I, of course, never contended that I had been asked to deal with the new clip. I said so in my cable to the Prime Minister. The new clip was intimately connected with my mission, but it was not part of it. I had certainly been nonplussed when I heard from the press that the Prime Minister had been developing problems so intimately connected with my mission without my knowledge. I was deeply concerned when I found &#34;rom his telegram  how far his proposals reached into my scheme, but never for a moment did I imagine that he would communicate those proposals direct to the British Government, and ignore the presence in London of the man who had been sent there to deal with them. ITo Minister can have any o&#39;bjection to receiving the views of his Leader if they are sent direct to him, whether they agree with his own or not, but the position is quite different when his back is broken by that leader&#39;s views being communicated direct to the people&#34; with whom the Minister is in negotiation. The Minister for Munitions told me that he felt gravely embarrassed by the situation. He had arrived at certain important understandings with me, in the belief that I was fully accredited, but on the top of them he had received straight from the head of my Government demands of a totally different character. It was impossible, he said, to do business with me while the Prime Minister was trying to do it direct by cable. I was politely bowed out of the office, and the door which I had so successfully opened was closed behind me. On 27th May I tabled to the Prime Minister setting out tie position, and saying that I could proceed no further until my position was defined. In his answering cablegram of 2nd June the Prime Minister raised a smoke-screen of verbal irrelevancies. He was studiously courteous, but he rejected by evasion the only conditions on which 1 said and knew, and still know, I could do good work in London, and on the 7th June I resigned. The Prime Minister, in hi3 speech in this House on the 2nd July, expressed wonder that the very politeness of his telegram had not pacified me. I recognised and marvelled at this unusual exhibition of suavity on his part. In point of tone the cable was a jewel, but principle is more than tone, and instead of accepting the principle for which I was rightly contending, he indulged in long recriminatory recollections of my treatment of him when he was abroad, all of which I shall to-day duly answer. Right through this urbane cablegram there runs the assertion that he was right in submitting proposals direct to the British Government which cancelled the ones I had been authorized to make aud conclude. He was apparently careless or oblivious of the fact that his intervention had superseded me. Whatever else honorable members may forget that is important in this conflict, I hope they will remember that the crucial step in the- destruction of my mission was taken by the Prime Minister when he went over my head to the Imperial Government and inflicted damage that was beyond repair. The king pin of the mission was wrenched from my hands, and I was absolutely powerless to proceed. My authority had been withdrawn by the hand that gave it. My tentative and highly advantageous settlement had been rudely torn up, and I was removed from the arena of negotiation. Surely no more staggering blow was ever dealt a trusting colleague, but I shall not dwell upon that phrase; others may if they are sufficiently interested. There are some people who, not understanding the position, have said that I should have put my self-respect in my pocket, gone on with my work, and fought the issue with the Prime Minister when I returned. Difficult as that would have been, I would have done it if I could have rendered useful service to Australia. But my principal had intervened, and I was no longer a factor in the discussion. British Ministers are not fools, whatever the Prime Minister may think or suggest, and the ones concerned with the wool problem properly felt that it was unwise, unsafe, and impossible to negotiate and make arrangements with a subordinate Minister when his leader did not recognise him, and, with his conflicting demands, repudiated the line of settlement already agreed upon. Their courtesy was unfailing, but their meaning unmistakable. I observe that in his, July speech in this House the Prime Minister suggested that I had abandoned my position wantonly, and left the Commonwealth stranded and helpless, apparently heedless of, or subtly hiding, the fact that the situation was the direct and inevitable result of his own deliberate acts. Even when animated by fraternal motives, the Prime Minister&#39;s mischievous ubiquity surrounds his &#39;colleagues with difficulty. He is evidently obsessed with the idea that no man con do &#34;good work but himself, and he cannot keep his finger out of any pie. I could have completed this business in a short time if given fair play and a reasonable chance, but it is impossible to do business in London under the conditions he created. Throw doubt on the credentials of an envoy in Britain and he might as well leave. Failure to notify my mission to the British Government cast doubt on. my authority. Direct and contradictory negotiations while I was there, and after I had arrived at agreements confirmed that doubt. In the circumstances, I could do no good for the Commonwealth, and so I decided to withdraw. And I say plainly, after four months of further reflection, that I would do precisely the same again if confronted with similar circumstances. The Prime Minister contended that he was trying to support me. The support he gave me was the support which the rope gives to the condemned man. My understanding with him in regard to finance and related matters was that I should be untrammelled. In the pressure he brought to bear upon me to undertake this work he flattered me with the suggestion that I understood these subjects better than any one else. He admitted that he knew nothing about finance, and he declared  that Parliament and the people trusted ray knowledge and judgment. He knew then, as he knows now, that I would never have left Australia if I had imagined that in this delicate and special financial work, I would have been so grossly tampered with. </para>
                        <para>Now I come to another phase of the subject. The Prime Minister dwelt impressively upon the wrong my resignation had inflicted upon Australia in leaving it unrepresented at the Brussels and .Spa Conferences. He described those gatherings as being vitally important to our people. The first notification about the Brussels Conference reached Melbourne before I sailed from Australia. It was sent by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department to the Treasury Department, and I wrote a minute on it to the effect that if the Conference were held while I was in England, I would attend it on- receipt of a cablegram from the Prime Minister. I received a cablegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> dated 21st April, when I reached Suez, intimating that I was to represent Australia at the Conference, and I replied that I would do so. The meeting was summoned by the Secretary to- the League of Nations to study - honorable members will be good enough to mark this - the international financial crisis. I understand that the matter originated in requisitions signed by a number of business, men in various Allied countries, and presented to their respective Prime Ministers. The British Prime Minister, in consenting to the Convention, laid down the condition that nothing done at it was to increase the obligation of Great Britain to help any other nation. The. idea, behind the Conference was to see if some solution could be found of the puzzle of international exchange-. The French and Belgian franc, the Italian lira, and&#39; theGerman and Austrian mark had suffered a tragic though varying decline and it was consequently difficult, if not impossible, for countries -trading on a non-depreciated sterling basis to- do business with the countries whose currency had fallen. The British Government nominated three bankers to represent them, and did not send a Minister, although the revival of their great Continental commerce might have seemed to warrant the appointment of a Minister. They, however, thought lightly of the matter. </para>
                        <para class="block">The more I studied the subject and discussed with financiers in London the prospect of a solution being discovered, the more I became convinced that there was nothing in the matter for Australia. Our microscopic contribution to the problem of international exchange could only be given by increasing the already heavy load on our Treasury and our private financial institutions, and I felt that it would be extremely indiscreet to undertake anything of the kind. The only way in which Australia could help the stricken nations wa3 to grant credits for goods sold to them; in other Words, to take their bonds in exchange for our commodities. Had we consented to do this, to the extent that we relieved their misfortunes we should have increased our own a hundred-fold. This, in the then state of our finance, would have been dangerous, for it would&#39; have meant either raising a special loan for the purpose, or still further inflating our already big paper issue. The Brussels Conference, instead of bringing grist to the mill of the Commonwealth.,, would, if &#39; we had been committed to anything by it, have drawn upon our substance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> the Secretary to the Treasury, who eventually attended! as the representative of Australia, evidently discovered this, as his cabled interview published in last week&#39;s newspapers plainly indicates. The clouds of the Brussels Conference were not big with blessings for Australia, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> professed, aud honorable members will see that Australia lost nothing by my non-attendance at the Conference. </para>
                        <para>Now we come to the Spa Conference. One would conclude from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> references that I had been appointed representative of Australia at the Spa Conference, which was summoned to meet early in June. That was not the case. On the 12th May, the British Prime Minister cabled to the Australian Prime Minister, through the old channel of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor-General, directing attention to this matter. Although I have a copy of the cablegram, which I obtained by direction from Lord Milner, I doubt whether I am at liberty to read it. It is not marked secret or confidential, but there are portions of it which, in British interests, it, might not be advisable to disclose to the German Government. I think, however, that I am at liberty, now that the Con&#39;ference is over, to refer to some portions of the cablegram without violating propriety, in order to show generally what was the contemplated purpose and scope of the Conference, and what was the invitation given to Australia. At Spa the representatives of the Allied Governments were, for the first time since the signing of the Peace Treaty, to meet the representatives of the &#39; German Government. The primary purpose of the meeting was to ask the Germans to explain past infractions of the Treaty, and to make arrangements for its future execution. A serious attempt was also to be made to fix the liability of Germany for reparation. It was thought that Germany wished to know her exact liabilities. It was considered that certain other matters might be raised, but - and the cablegram is perfectly plain about this - there was no idea of a revision of the Versailles Treaty. The British Government, feeling that the Dominions were interested, invited each of them to send an accredited plenipotentiary to attend meetings of a British Empire  delegation in London, to discuss with British Ministers before they went to Spa the questions involved. That was the substance of the whole matter. The meeting was an Inter-Empire gathering in London preliminary to the Conference at Spa. </para>

                                <para>- That was the invitation. I believe there was a short meeting of the Dominion representatives in London, but it was not treated as of much consequence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George&#39;s cable gram to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> declared that what was required in Europe was prompt decision, if hundreds of people were not to perish from disorder and famine; that delay at arriving at conclusions now must precipitate Europe into chaos. That was why he asked for plenipotentiaries. I find that, by the dictionary, a &#34; plenipotentiary &#34; is defined as &#34;an ambassador or other high official invested with full power.&#34; I Was nominated as the Australian plenipotentiary, but I was gravely told in the same cablegram that I was not to agree to certain things without consulting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> The arrangement was so Gilbertian that I was divided between amusement and annoyance. The idea of being asked to masquerade as a man with plenary power knowing I had none, was ludicrous, and I told the Prime Minister so in unmistakable language. I do not believe in hypocrisy of that kind, and I did not see why I should be made a party to it. That ended the matter; but the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in his cablegram of the 2nd June, 6ent me an unctuous homily upon the evil of my way. I had not the slightest desire to assume the powers of a plenipotentiary, but I objected to making a farce of a very serious drama. If the Prime Minister had, in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, objected to the status to be conferred upon Dominion representatives, as he was perfectly entitled to do, and had nominated me as the representative of Australia, I would not have been serving under false colours, and I would have been only too glad, in fact eager, to consult by cablegram with Cabinet, and especially with the two Ministers who knew the provisions and issues, of the Versailles Treaty better than I. But the Prime Minister did not appreciate the incongruity he had created, and chided me with wishing to usurp the functions of the Government. The Spa Conference came and went and accomplished nothing. When I arrived in England, as the press extracts will show, I put Australia&#39;s view about reparation and indemnity in an uncompromising manner ; but 1 was long enough in England to have lost faith in any German&#34; indemnity for British people worth talking about, and any man who builds on it is, I am afraid, building on air. In saying this, I do not reflect on the genius and strength of purpose  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George. No man can visit </para>

                        <para class="block">Britain and watch him at his work on world problems, noting the great influence which his rare and magnetic personality exercises over Continental statesmen and nations, as well as on the great bulk of the British people, and feel anything but sympathy and admiration for him in his giant tasks. I may be wrong, and I hope I am, but with the unparalleled decline in Continental currency, the disorders that reign in Europe, the resolute intent - and I beg honorable members not to think that the words are hastily used - with which Prance is pushing for a larger share of any indemnity, and priority in its &#39; payment, even straining the Franco-British Alliance in the attempt, I feel that in the end the British Empire must submit to receiving much less reparation than the Treaty provides. It is a lamentable thought, but I believe a true one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> may place any value he likes upon a gathering of Ministers and High Commissioners in London, but I object to him misleading the people of the Commonwealth by saying that I was appointed to attend the Spa Conference, and by magnifying the loss Australia suffered by my absence. </para>

                        <para>Bunning through the Prime Minister&#39;s speech, and in one of his principal cables to me, are two assertions. First, that he and I were in exactly the same position whilst abroad, he at the Peace Conference and I in London; and, second, that I had imposed on him the -same control as he was placing on me. I will deal with these assertions in their order, and hope to prove the first a fallacy and the second untrue. Dealing with them in their order, let me say that there was a vital difference between his task and mine. He and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> Joseph  Cook left this country six months before the war closed, to attend a Conference of Empire statesmen convened by the British Government. We had had no advice as to the matters to be considered. They left without knowledge of -them, with no instructions, and no discussion with their colleagues. We were hopeful that peace would come while they were in Britain; but we did not know. We could only hope. </para>
                        <para class="block">Then came the Armistice and the Peace Conference, which threw upon them tremendous responsibilities. With the exception of one matter, with which I can deal more fully at a later stage, if necessary - and which arose before the Conference assembled - our peace delegates were left entirely free from interference or control. If the cables were laid upon the table it would be seen that our messages to them are classifiable under three heads : first, those appealing for information regarding the progress of the deliberations; second, many voluntary messages giving helpful data or suggestions; and, third, strong cablegrams of approval and support sent in response to their requests. Once or twice, it is true, I explained to the Prime Minister how awkward it was for his colleagues here to read his views in the press before we had received them direct. But, with the one exception referred to, the Prime Minister received at our hands, as Peace Ambassador, no word of criticism and no instructions or directions. . No other delegates to that Conference were as free. These are generalizations, and provable, if the Prime Minister desires, before any judicial body. However, let me give two specific illustrations to which  he has drawn attention. He complained- that his Government turned him down regarding the island of Nauru. I will read the cablegrams upon that question, and allow honorable members to decide for themselves. My first cablegram to the Prime Minister dated 31st January, 1919, is labelled &#34;Very urgent and most secret.&#34; </para>

                            <para>Your former cables conveyed comforting assurances that the representatives of Britain and France would accept Australia&#39;s point df view and support her in this vital matter, and we view with greatest apprehension the changed attitude leading to acquiescence in Wilson&#39;s .procedure and objective. However the project of League of Nations may shape itself, &#39;the people of &#39;this country fully &#39;expected that the Peace &#39;Conference would determine such territorial &#39;questions &#39;before it rose. If -this is to bc left to some other gathering to be convened later, Australia will feel that its future has been left in a condition of grave doubt, and the Government begs of you to stress this phase to other Dominion statesmen, and particularly to the controlling  minds of Britain, Prance, and America. </para>
                            <para>On &#34;the question of mandate, the people of this continent strongly feel that British or Commonwealth Government, preferably the latter, should be given full control of former German Possessions now in occupation of our Forces. Our beneficent rule of native races in Papua should &#39;be sufficient guarantee to our  great  Allies that, if intrusted with this responsibility, we shall exercise our powers wholly in the interests of the .health, education, and prosperity of the natives. If this full trusteeship is impossible, then any mandate should specify publicly and definitely that the control of immigration, Tariff, and trade matters should be given to the administering authority. The most important of these is immigration. If this is not specified, Australia&#39;s racial policy will be challenged and injured, if not destroyed. This can only mean eventual predominance of- mixed and inferior races in &#39;the islands. Surely America must sympathize with a people isolated and adjacent to unnumbered coloured millions, but resolutely facing its duty to keep this fertile continent and its intimately associated islands for the selected white races. </para>

Our troops took it, and have garrisoned it for over., four years. If we are to get mandate for other German Islands, and not that one, it will be impossible to understand basis of settlement or explain away so ugly a differentiation. Its transfer to Commonwealth with other- adjacent and similar lands will simplify and cheapen administration, and obviate complications arising out of, overlap, of authority by Britain and Australia in these seas.

I propose in review of peace terms in press to-morrow morning to deal with the matter as firmly as I consider it prudent to do so; but I think it would be improper not to sign Treaty because our reasonable aspirations regarding Nauru have been frustrated. If Australia says she will not accept mandate for islands because Nauru not included, the natural reply will be we are grabbing at valuable asset. I suggest that you put up best fight you can, and, if defeated, sign, relying on subsequent, negotiations and representations to compel Britain to accede to our view or make suitable equivalent arrangements of financial kind.

                        <para class="block">The Prime Minister suggests that we controlled him, and that he was subjected to unfair treatment. I will ask any unbiased jury if Cabinet would have been justified in telling the Prime Minister not to sign the Peace Treaty, and not to accept a mandate over the other islands, simply because the mandate- over Nauru was eventually to be a&#34; partnership between certain parts of the British Empire, and not a purely Australian mandate. Any jury can answer that question to suit itself; but I cannot conceive that any rational body of Australians would have thought the Government wrong in assuming that attitude. As a matter of fact, I believe the arrangement ultimately arrived at in regard to Nauru is a better one than that which the Prime Minister sought, and that it is less likely to load us with heavy capital charges in the purchase of the whole of the company&#39;s rights. I propose, at a later stage, to give the facts regarding the new agreement for the purchase of those rights. I am quite sure that historians will .have no difficulty in deciding who played the statesman on that particular occasion. </para>

                            <para>You complain that I communicated with the British authorities. Let me remind y&#39;ou. of your own practice while I acted as representative of Australia in London. I could mention many cases in which you did this on matters relating to my mission, but one will suffice. In November, 1918, you advised Secretary of State of Government&#39;s approval of principles of clearing scheme for settlement of prewar1 debts, merely notifying -me of the action taken. That was clearly a matter on which I might have been consulted, at all events. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is a quotation from the Prime Minister&#39;s cable of 2nd June. I have not the means of proving what I am about to say, but the Prime Minister has. My recollection of this matter is that the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> carefully examined this scheme when submitted by the Imperial Government and brought it to Cabinet for approval. I said that before accepting the recommendation, the Prime Minister should be consulted, and I authorized the despatch of a cable asking his views or wishes. After some delay the Prime Minister said he agreed, and Cabinet approved and for.mally notified the British Government. The Minister for Trade and Customs may recall the procedure adopted; but, in any case, the official files are open for inspection, and I have the temerity, after the lapse of two years, to rely upon my memory of the matter. If I am in error I will gladly make amends to the right honorable gentleman. So much for that. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members, if they wish to judge such questions fairly, must, I submit, distinguish between the Prime Minister as Peace Envoy and the same man as Dominion Minister doing business for his people in Britain. The right honorable gentleman would fail before any fair tribunal to demonstrate that he was placed in harness as a Peace Envoy.: but he complained in this cable of 2nd June that I had repeatedly checked and blocked him in his other capacity as a visiting Minister. He gave several instances in addition to those I have cited. I propose to take a few of them. He, said that I had extended the wool contract without his consent. That statement, so far as it goes, is quite true. The question of wool was never mentioned as one to which he would attend, and, at his own request, I was specially placed in charge of it during his absence. I shall deal with this more fully when I come to refer to my earlier resignation from the Government, to which the Prime Minister, in his speech last July, gave much prominence. Before dismissing the subject, however, let rae say that, on several occasions while he was in England, he urged me to prevent any further extension of the wool contract.  But  .for that, I hav.e .no doubt, the recent catastrophic drop in prices would not have fallen on Australia&#39;s shoulders, and our great pastoral industries would have been standing today erect and prosperous instead of shivering in a night of uncertainty which bids fair to dislocate public and private finance in this country. </para>
                        <para>Knowing the Prime Minister&#39;s incessancy, and his notorious desire to meddle in everything, I laid down the principle in my cables while he was abroad that general Government functions where it lives - a principle which he indorsed and quoted - but that in regard to the special subjects intrusted to an absent Delegation the position is different. That is why I was studiously careful not to interfere with him in relation to matters specially placed in his hands. Wool was not so placed. It came within the province of general Government. </para>

                        <para class="block">Here again the Prime Minister is in a position, with all the official files in his possession, to prove or disprove the statement. I remember that shortly after his arrival in London in 1918, he asked me to telegraph him copies of all cables exchanged both ways with the Secretary of State. I pointed out the enormous expense of such a duplication, for our correspondence then was very heavy. Honorable members may recollect the congested state of the cables at that period - a congestion which the press and the public said was due to the huge volume of Government messages going through. After alluding to the expense of duplicating such messages, I further advised the right honorable gentleman to get the Secretary of State to promptly hand him in London copies of all cables despatched or received. That was the quickest, cheapest, and most business-like -procedure. If he did not do this for six- months it was ^ his own fault. That is my answer. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is not strictly correct, but it serves to recall an interesting episode. Everybody thought the Prime Minister1 was going in -an Orient ship, <inline font-style="italic">viti</inline> Suez, to London. The people who said good-bye to him in the Melbourne express on the, Sydney station certainly thought  so Many  learned with surprise that he had doubled back from Homebush, and had joined the <inline font-style="italic">Niagara</inline> for the Pacific route.. It was all very mysterious to me, his <inline font-style="italic">locum</inline><inline font-style="italic">tenens,</inline> and I - and I think other Ministers as well - had to submit to much badinage about it. A week or two after he had sailed, I heard -for the first time that the Governor or the Commonwealth Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, was a fellow passenger on the <inline font-style="italic">Niagara.</inline> Knowing the enterprise of my late leader, and remembering his daring transaction . in the purchase of ships when he was in Britain on a previous occasion, I adopted a wise precautionary measure. I had just&#39; gone to the Treasury, was deeply concerned about the condition of the loan moneys, and, wishing to be sure rather than sorry, I sent him, according to my memory of the occasion, a request, not an instruction, as Treasurer, that he would not embark upon anything involving large moneys without first consulting me. He at once acquiesced, showing, I presume, his complete approval. Is there any man here, remembering the war and finance outlook at that hour, who will pronounce such an action as unfair or unjustified ? I here, again, speak without access to official documents, but the Prime Minister is at liberty to table the cables, which, I venture to say, will bear out my recollection. I shall now traverse another statement in the Prime Minister&#39;s cable of the 2nd June. In that cable the Prime Minister said that in connexion with the sale of the Australian ships in March, April, and May, 1919, I. had said the proper procedure was to. obtain definite authority from the Cabinet, and that he should carefully observe that rule. The facts of the matter are these: About March,r1919, the Prime Minister started selling the ships of the. </para>

The Cabinet had never been consulted as to the method of disposing of our tonnage, and the first we knew of the matter was when the Prime Minister coolly told me- of the sales he had  made, and asked me to arrange the transfer to the British register. </para>

                                <para>- I remonstrated with the. Prime Minister, and reminded him of the requirements of the Audit Act. The real; point, however, in this discussion is whether I impeded him in his legitimate duties as an absent Minister. The answer to that question is that not one of his. then colleagues thought it was part of his job to undertake such business without previous consultation with the Cabinet,, and they authorized me to say so.. No rational man charged with the responsibility of running the Government at that or any other time could have taken any other course. The mere fact that the Prime Minister does not see the difference between the definite: commission on finance with which I departed from Australia and his own unauthorized activity- is an evidence of obtuseness - which he has hitherto successfully concealed. </para>

                        <para>Now, as to wheat, which is the remaining question. The Prime Minister complains that he was hampered by contradictory instructions and compelled to back down concerning some arrangements he had made with the British Wheat Commission. There is a man at present in the Cabinet <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> who could answer this if he-would. All I know is that the Prime Minister, himself, constituted a Wheat Board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;</inline> Was  chairman.  He gave to. that Board&#39; large powers regarding wheat, and everything that was- said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> in the cables. I despatched for him to the Prime Minister&#39; was after consultation with the men whom- the Prime Minister had appointed as trustees for the owners of the wheat. There- are a great number of men, intimate with- the wheat trade, who regret that the handling of the commodity was not in commercial hands at. that particular time ; and these men were in some cases associated with the Board.. </para>
                        <para>To sum these matters up I say that, as . peace envoy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was, in the fullest sense of the word, a plenipotentiary. He was subject to no interference or control in that capacity. I never con.municated directly with the British Government on one subject arising out of his. peace negotiations without his previous approval. All my suggestions and help went directly to himself. In all business - as distinct from peace matters - which the Cabinet placed in his hands, he was just as free, with, perhaps, the doubtful exception of wheat; and any influence that was brought to bear on him was of his own creation - it did not emanate from his Ministers. With regard to the things he did outside his specific commission, the telegrams will show that I sought nothing but Cabinet consultation, by cable,, which was. a perfectly legitimate attempt. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> resented. There is something strangely painful in the fact that a man with such an adroit and able mind should harp raucously on matters that, after all, are small, and&#39; do not matter. I have paid extended attention to these matters, not because they are strictly germane to the issue between us, but because the Prime Minister raised them, and&#39; I was anxious to give honorable members the answering facts. If the Prime Minister&#39;s view were right, that my position was identical with his own at Paris, at best he was, according to. his own showing, only trying to get a &#34; little bit of his own back ;&#34; in other words, he was trying to flog me with the whip he said I had&#39; used on him. I have shown that our missions were widely different - that I never used the whip as he suggested, and, above all, and this is the crux - that I never communicated directly with the British Government on matters concerning his work without his previous knowledge or approval. </para>
                        <para>I now come to some other- matters. I think it is generally true that the management of wool affairs by the Central Wool Committee has been wise and successful. I know there .has been criticism directed against its administration; but, considering &#39;the magnitude and diversity of its business, I have always thought that the organization established to handle the Pool worked with smoothness and satisfaction. The Government and the growers have been fortunate in securing the services of so many able men to perform this work; but while that is true of the Central and State Committees, I am not sure it is true of the Prime Minister whenever he interfered with wool. Some of his decisions are like the peace of God ; and when I was looking at wool matters in London a few of them came under my notice. There was a question of the supply of .50,000 bales to France, which the British. Administration felt bound to deliver.  They regarded the transaction as good business, and they asked me to get the, matter fixed up when I was in London. I, therefore, wired the Prime Minister on the 21st May, and told him <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> thought he should give a decision, and that in view of the history of the  negotia-tions  I did not see how we could refuse. That, I may say, was for some reason omitted by the Prime Minister when he read the cables to the House. He replied on the 29th May, and told me not to &#34;worry about it.&#34; That was his gentle way of telling me it was none of my business; but I did &#34;worry about it,&#34; first, because the British Administration, with whom I was working amicably, desired a decision, and, secondly, because I knew we were offered good  busi-ness.  The price at  which  the wool was to be sold was at the rates of February, 1919, which were higher by 85 per cent, than the appraised rates. Apart from our obligation to- give France the wool - if there was such an obligation - I felt that, on a doubtful market, we were foolish to risk a loss of clearly &#163;10 a bale. I do not know what has been done in lie matter, but if the sale has not been made - and .as to this the Prime Minister can inform us - I venture to say that the loss is in the neighbourhood of half-a-million sterling. </para>
                        <para>There was another matter of which&#39; I incidentally heard, .namely, a. sale to the </para>
                        <para class="block">Austrian Government pf 25,000 to 30,000* bales. The British Government were anxious to supply this wool; they wished to stop the spread of disorder, and to help the Central European countries, and this was their method of giving employment. A difference of opinion arose between theBritish Government and the Australian Government, not as to the question of supply, I understand, but as to the question of price. The British Government wished the price to be on the basis of the month of issue, which, ,as I remember, was July of this year. The Prime Minister of Australia, however, wished the price to be fixed on the average of the last six months. To me that was an unheard of. suggestion, with a fluctuating commodity like wool. I&#39;. do not know whether that sale went through or not ; but, if it did not, and the July prices were not taken, there, is another loss of about &#163;250,000. These items total about &#163;750,000, half of which would belong to the Australian grower. It would be interesting to have all the papers concerning these matters laid on the table. </para>
                        <para>While the Prime Minister was away two years ago, a question arose of the cancellation of a big sale to the United States of America after the war had closed. So far as I remember - and I was then dealing with wool in the absence of the .Prime Minister - the Government at Washington asked the British Government to agree to an abandonment of the contract, and the British Government recommended the Australian Government to agree. The Prime Minister objected, and resisted the cancellation. Eventually the .British Government did cancel the contract, with the. consequence that the undelivered portion was sold&#39; at a much better price than the contract price. If that transaction were analyzed, I would not be surprised to learn that the extra profit accruing through the sale, which the Prime Minister tried to prevent, was a couple of millions sterling, half of which, in duo course, is coming to Australia. </para>
                        <para>I must now deal with two .other wool matters of grave concern to this -country. Before the armistice, but late in 1918, While the Prime Minister was in London, the Central Wool Committee was giving thought to the question of a post-war </para>
                        <para class="block">Pool. The  chairman  of the Committee told me that many of the members thought it would take two or three years after the termination of hostilities to organize and stabilize the wool manufacturing industries of the world. With a large prospective carry-over of Australian wool at the close of the contract, the Committee thought it would be advisable, with the consent of the growers, to keep going an organization to bridge the gulf of uncertainty, and to maintain Australian and British supremacy in the wool trade. They were, therefore, considering whether we should attempt to have a still further extension of the wool contract. All those interested in the trade were not unanimous, and representations were made to me on the subject; but, to use a popular phrase, the Prime Minister&#34; squashed &#34; the idea by cabling that there was to be no extension. I so informed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, and there, so far as I know, the matter ended. Of course, we can all be wise after the event; but I venture to say that if the question had received the attention it deserved, the Australian wool position to-day would have been sound and free from anxiety, instead of being in such a critical position. </para>
                        <para>In my earlier remarks I referred to a meeting which the Prime Minister held in Sydney on the 27 th April. I think I ought to say that when the tenor of his speech on that occasion was published in the British press, administrators, wool traders and manufacturers, and bankers commented very unfavorably upon it. It created profound agitation in the trade, and much press criticism followed. The proposals were almost everywhere spoken of as impracticable, and ill-considered, and they were rejected by British wool opinion. That was the atmosphere I encountered in commencing the practical part of my mission in London. Whether the Prime Minister or his critics were right or wrong, I do not even now consider myself competent to judge; but this I do know: that from that day confidence in the Wool Committee appears to have been shattered. The market has been tumbling ever since, and the outlook for both old stock and new clip is, to put it mildly, very black. That may be a coincidence, or it may be the inevitable operation of cause and effect; but the net result is a loss to Australia of tens of millions of pounds. It is no wonder that the Wool Committee, in its annual report, disclaims all responsibilities for the proposals. I deeply regret that the Prime Minister has so often gone out of his way to flout on technical questions expert opinion which through the war, and since the war, has given such aid to Government. That is his responsibility, however, and I submit these facts and reflections for the information of the House, bearing, as they do, intimately upon a matter concerning which I was sent abroad. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister implied in his cables and speech that I was a high-handed man, who would not consult Cabinet or accept any directions. In laying the file of correspondence before the House, he omitted several things which prove the exact opposite; and I may say to the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> after noting in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> their certificates as censors of the correspondence, that I do not blame them. I have no doubt that they were called upon to do their work hastily, and perhaps could not see from my point of view the bearing which such cables had upon my relationships with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> ; but I propose to read some of those omitted cables, in order to show&#39; how anxious I was at every point to consult Cabinet, except in regard to those things concerning which I had been left free and specially commissioned. Let me take first this statement from the file in reference to the Nauru agreement. It is in my cable dated 18th May to the Prime Minister - </para>

                            <para>Secret. <inline font-style="italic">Re</inline> Nauru. - You are now in possession of Secretary of State&#39;s despatch, dated 25th February, referring to purchase price, compensation, &#38;c, to Pacific Phosphate Company. Draft agreement has now been sent to High Commissioner, and it has been perused by him and our lawyer, and by Collins. As you will note, in paragraph seven of Amery&#39;s despatch above-mentioned, two important reservations are made by the company (a) in relation to their contract with the Empire Transport Company, and (b) in relation to the right to take, after certain interests are safeguarded, up to a maximum of 100,000 tons phosphate per annum. I think both of these are wrong, particularly the latter; but, before asking the High Commissioner to sign draft, I think it advisable that Cabinet should consider these new conditions. Three other matters hav.e arisen, but you need not worry about them. The first is that the original Act does not cover Ocean Island - statutory provision could subsequently be made. The second is compensation to company&#39;s staff - in all circumstances I think we ought to agree to proposals up to &#163;30,000. The third is mutual agreement, referred to in article 8 of agreement between Governments, dated 2nd July, 1919, which has never been reached. Failing such agreement, contributions of capital will be decided under article 14. As proportion provided for in article 14 appears quite equitable, I think we may consider position on this point satisfactory. Please give early attention to question raised relating to tonnage contract and rights of Pacific Company to take phosphates after transfer of property, and advise me Cabinet&#39;s views. </para>

I do not understand why they were put in. Try and get them excised. If you fail, it is hardly worth wrecking agreement if we get full market rates for up to 100,000 tons. As to other points, they are not important. </para>

                        <para class="block">We did fail to get them excised, and finding that we were to get at least the full market rate on the 100,000 tons upon which the company was theoretically entitled to lay its hands, the agreement was accepted. That cablegram shows that I was in an amicable spirit of concord with the Prime Minister in regard to all matters in respect to which consultation was the proper method of procedure. As another instance, let me quote the cablegram I sent regarding the Commonwealth shipping line, which the right honorable gentleman also excised from the file for some reason or other. </para>

                        <para class="block">As instructed, I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin</inline> that his business was to communicate direct with-&#34; the Prime Minister. He replied, &#34; I have been doing that all along, but I&#39; thought that now you have come to England I was entitled to speak to you as if you were a visiting Minister with some power.&#34; I do not know whether <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> declined very much in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin&#39;s</inline> estimation after that conversation. British Ministers frequently consulted me about matters that were not on the list of my mission - they always do when Commonwealth Ministers go to London - and I always cabled to the Prime Minister about them. One instance&#39; was the appointment of a successor to- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ronald</inline> Munro Ferguson as Governor-General, but in regard to these matters I was warned off the grass. As I told the Prime Minister in one of my cablegrams to him, I was not permitted to touch subjects which were not included in my list, and in respect of those with which I was sent Home specially to deal I was told that I must await instructions before acting. I said plainly that that was the status given to an inferior official and not to a Minister of State, and I could not accept it. </para>
                        <para>Let me clear up two other matters which excited comment by the Prime Minister. He complained that he read of my resignation in the press before he received it from me by cable. Of course, I did not know that the right honorable gentleman was on holiday in New South Wales at the time, but I despatched my cablegram to him a full twenty-four hours before I  spoke to the press. At that time Government messages were easily racing press messages -to Australia. My late private secretary, who is now private secretary to the present- Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> can testify to the truth of that. Here is the other matter: In my cablegram of 27th May I told the Prime Minister that his fatal cable to the Secretary of State in regard to wool &#39; &#39; was not the same in- form or manner of presentation &#34; as he had advised me. Deliberately, or unwittingly, he distorted my statement, and said in the House that I had complained, that the two were different in substance. He professed amazement at my assertions, and said that he had shown the two cables to the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams}, who could see</inline> not  difference between the two. </para>

He knew he was doing me an injustice, and he tried to hide it as much as he could. This was an occurrence, not -important in. itself, but ugly and significant when surrounded by its context. It is another example of the Prime Minister&#39;s unpardonable, lack of frankness, even with a. colleague.. There are some kindly members of the Government, and, I understand, also- private members of the party, -who cannot, understand a man resigning office. Such a step is so foreign to their habits or. natures that they are baffled when another takes it. In their bewilderment they are driven to search for all sorts of mysterious explanations. Sometimes such an action is ascribed to mental aberration. In my case,. I believe it has; been charitably attributed to shattered&#39; health. The rumour has been sedulously whispered abroad, &#34; Poor fellow; he is not himself; he. has broken down.&#34; To these gentlemen, I would say that I am conscious, of their fraternal consideration,, but they are the victims of an unfortunate delusion. I had not been very well before I left for England, and I deemed it prudent to get medical consent before undertaking the trip. . During the voyage - which was a long one, because I travelled on&#39; a captured German vessel - my health rapidly improved, and I arrived in Europe full of mental vigour. Some of those who were brought into official contact with me would be inclined to confirm that de* scrip ti on. I say these things be-, cause I wish members to dismiss from their minds the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> exchanged cables with a petulant and impulsive invalid.. Whether they approve of my conduct or not, I ask them to accept my assurance that I was in possession of whatever faculties the Almighty had lent me, and that I determined on my course after the fullest consideration of all the consequences, national and personal. As I reflected on the Prime Minister&#39;s tactics in his. handling of me, my memory recalled an incident of some interest. &#39; When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> returned home from the Peace Conference, .we stage-managed, you will remember, a series of welcomes to him, from Fremantle eastward. </para>

                                <para>- The gatherings culminated with a meeting in Melbourne, and on that day I was seated with him on the dais at the Lord Mayor&#39;s reception. Towards the close of his speech th&#39;e right honorable gentleman recounted my services to Australia during his absence, and dwelt eloquently on my fidelity and loyalty to him and to the National party. He concluded by turning round with what the audience and I mistook for spontaneity and sincerity, and warmly wringing my hand, said, &#34; For what he has done, he has earned my undying friendship.&#34; In less than a year that friendship was dead, and he had vilified me in this House in my absence as a man who had deserted his country and left it stricken and helpless. If that be a tribute of friendship, to loyalty and sustained assistance, may God save me from any further exhibition of such friendship ! I have reflected mournfully upon the motives that impelled the Prime Minister along the path he trod. Although I believed from the first in the conjunction of the parties led by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> I did not desire, as the right honorable gentleman knows, to join the National Administration when it was formed. I again resisted inclusion in the new Government after the resignation of the old one at the close of the second conscription campaign. As I have explained, and as I shall have occasion to do again in a moment, I wished to withdraw from office when my health declined. During the time that I was a member of the Government, I gave of the best that was in me, and my consciousness of loyalty and of work tolerably well done is perfectly clear. In some of the Polynesian islands, a man suffers death for stepping on the king&#39;s shadow, and I suppose that, in some thoughtless moment, &#39;I must have committed that crime. Such speculation, although interesting, is fruitless, and I shall not explore further the dark question of the Prime Minister&#39;s motives. I leave them to his own conscience, and to the., more discerning brains of others to unravel. </para>

                        <para>For some reason, which to me is inscrutable, but which, I assume, was designed to discredit me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> told the House that I had resigned three times from the Ministry since his return from England. Let me give the facts. While he was away, I was strongly urged by medical authority to retire from office. That advice was supported by the requests of many relatives and friends. It was conveyed to him by cablegram, and he urged me to hold on until his return. I had fully intended to keep going until he came back, and I told him so. In our conversation, as we came east from Fremantle, I asked him to give me early relief from office. T did not resign. He urged me to remain with him until after the election which was then looming. Wishing to help him, I consented, and we worked on together. In </para>
                        <para class="block">September he made a speech in Sydney which re-opened a rankling sore in our relations. He had never forgiven the Government or myself for extending the wool contract while he was away, and, in that speech he reflected so seriously on his colleagues in regard to that action, that I sent to him the following letter of resignation - 22nd September, 1019. </para>
                        <para>My dear Prime Minister, </para>
                        <para>I take the earliest opportunity on my return from the country of addressing you upon a matter which has caused me much surprise and concern. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 17th instant reports you as having said to the Farmers and Settlers Association in Sydney - &#34;He could have sold more wheat and at a better price if it had not been that the Australian wool clip had been sold while he was on the water. That took away the strongest weapon in his armoury. In wheat they had competitors, but, in regard! to wool, Australia was &#39; it.&#39; If the wool had not been sold when it was, Australia would have been in a better position.&#34; </para>
                        <para class="block">If that is a correct report, and I assume it is, as it has not been contradicted, but rather confirmed by your reply to a question in the House later in the week, to my mind it involves a grave breach of Cabinet etiquette and principle. </para>
                        <para>It will be within your recollection that on several occasions while you were representing Australia in London and Paris after the cessation of hostilities, I expressed by cable disapproval of some of your published utterances: but, in my anxiety to preserve the unity of the Cabinet, I studiously refrained from announcing such differences. On the contrary, when questioned in Parliament and elsewhere as to whether the Government was bound by certain of your speeches on critical questions, I unhesitatingly said that the Government accepted full responsibility for. the views of the Prime Minister. </para>
                        <para>You, apparently, consider it permissible, without consultation, to take the other course. In my opinion, your action in so doing constitutes the most dangerous infraction of Cabinet solidarity. </para>
                        <para>I have always believed this principle to be absolutely essential to the maintenance of responsible Government when the Cabinet represented a homogeneous party; and I consider that its jealous observance is even more necessary in the present case when Ministers speak for a composite party. </para>
                        <para>Your statement disclaims responsibility for, and virtually repudiates, one of the most important acts of administration performed  by  your colleagues during your absence from Australia, and your open condemnation of it places them in a very invidious position. I do not know how they view the situation, but, as the one who bears, and cheerfully accepts, the prime responsibility for the transaction under review, I feel that my position is quite untenable. </para>
                        <para class="block">As to the merits of the wool contract question, inquiry will elicit the fact that the vast bulk of enlightened judgment cordially approved the sale It was hailed on all sides as a highly advantageous business deal, and I can recall no act of Government during the war  period which received such unanimous sanction. It stimulated rural production and stabilized public and private finance at the most perilous point in our history, as competent judges will testify. In view of the widespread satisfaction expressed at the extension of the contract and t he acknowledged benefits it conferred, there appears to be something sinister in your having gone out of your way to pronounce so strongly against it. </para>
                        <para>Your remarks suggest that, had the further sale not been made while you were on the water, you could have made better sales of other Australian products. I am, of course, not qualified to say whether that is, or is not, probable; but, if that opinion implies that, by accepting <inline font-style="italic">worse</inline> conditions for wool, you could have obtained <inline font-style="italic">better</inline> conditions for wheat or metals, then I say frankly I could not stand for such, procedure. If every producer of our staple commodities was, or is, entitled to relative world parity for his goods, there was, and is, surely no justification for asking the one man to take <inline font-style="italic">less</inline> for his wool in order that another should got <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> for his wheat, &#38;c. </para>
                        <para>Considerations surrounding the <inline font-style="italic">merits</inline> of the wool question, however, while thoroughly relevant, are not the most material things at issue between us. The main and vital point is that of Cabinet solidarity. This has been destroyed by your unexpected remarks on the occasion referred to, and while anxious, as I have ever been, to avoid embarrassment to the National party, or yourself as its leader, I feel that the only course open to me is to retire from the Government. </para>
                        <para>It would, perhaps, be scarcely fair to you, or to my colleagues, who may consider that they share responsibility for the situation I have endeavoured to describe, to summarily resign without discussion of it in Cabinet. </para>
                        <para>If an opportunity for such discussion is afforded before the House meets, I am prepared to withhold my resignation, but, if not, I shall bo reluctantly compelled to ask you to relieve me from office without further delay. </para>
                        <para>I shall, in the circumstances, not attend Cabinet to-day. </para>

                        <para>I am sorry, however, that you did not act similarly with regard to your colleagues, as you expressed your intention of doing at Cabinet on Monday. I cannot fathom the reason, although I suppose you have one satisfactory to yourself. </para>
                        <para>Since I wrote you on Monday, I have read the report of your Sydney speech in the <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and they are much more objectionable than the Melbourne extract I quoted. Both these papers report you as saying that the last wool sale was conducted behind your back. </para>
                        <para>An apology to, and eulogium of, the Wool Committee cannot undo the evil effects of such a statement. The Government, and not the Committee, sold the wool; and, as the Minister who made the recommendation to Cabinet, I cannot submit in silence to such an unwarranted attack. </para>

                        <para>Your latest utterances, however, render it impossible for me to longer remain a member of the Government, and I now desire to resign my position as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para class="block">The Prime Minister had another Cabinet meeting, and, subsequent thereto, made certain statements to the press. He said that he was greatly surprised that the newspapers had taken his comments in the way in which they had done, and, indeed, that anybody had misconstrued his remarks. He added that he had never meant to imply anything against his colleagues; and, generally, he apologized. That occurred on 25th September, and the resignation was withdrawn. The Prime Minister, by reference to such matters, sought to create the impression that I was an impossible colleague, always tossing down my job. The facts prove that I was not anxious to remain in office, but that I yielded every time to his strong personal appeals, and, probably against my best interests, cheerfully co-operated with him in his tasks. In the correspondence I have read my stand was based on high public principle. He evidently recognised that, because he amended his attitude and withdrew. This is another example of a wicked attempt to damn me in By absence, which, in a community of decent people, ought to react against its author. The incident would have passed into the limbo of things forgotten. Indeed, it had passed, and would have reposed there but for my right honorable friend&#39;s somewhat tasty resurrection. After the general elections in December of last year I reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> of our understanding, when he again urged me to continue in the Government at least until the session had got fairly going; and I consented. Shortly after, this trip was invented for me, and I was sent abroad, there to be discredited, which, doubtless, suited the Prime Minister&#39;s ambitious schemes better than my quiet withdrawal from office. The Prime Minister stated that I had resigned twice in writing in one year. I have no recollection of any resignation other than that which I have read. But the extraordinary and welcome popularity of my former private secretaries with present Ministers makes it difficult for me to refresh my memory. One of these officers left Australia for Geneva, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, only a few days before I landed in Australia; and my last secretary - I am very pleased to note - has been adopted by my successor at the Treasury. If, however, the Prime Minister has any other resignation among his papers he is at liberty to table it. </para>
                        <para>I have detained the House unduly and I wish very briefly to close. I desire first to thank the&#34; Leader of the Labour Opposition, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> for the honorable way in which he observed the pair which I had arranged with him before leaving Australia; and also to thank my old friend of thirty years&#39; standing, who is not here today - I refer to the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> - for the cheerful manner in which he co-operated in the operation of that pair. I thank my friend, the honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) in that, although a heavily laden man himself, he so well attended to the work of my constituency. And, having said these tilings, I have said all that I wish, at this stage, to say. If it should be necessary to speak again I shall do so. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members may have been asking themselves whether I am going to declare my attitude towards the Government. I do not think that, under cover of a motion for the suspension, of certain of our Standing Orders, the occasion should be regarded as appropriate for me to do so. . But, at an early stage, when opportunity offers, I shall make my attitude in that respect perfectly plain. I tender to honorable members my thanks for the excellent hearing which they have accorded me. I have outlined the facts concerning my resignation as a Minister, frankly, and as I see them ; and I leave the whole matter to the judgment of the people, whose servant I have been for twenty-three years. </para>

                                <para>. - The honorable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has made a very long speech. He has had the fullest opportunity to set out all those circumstances that he can urge by way of extenuation or explanation why he abandoned his post as the representative of the Commonwealth, leaving problems which, as he said, related to matters of &#34;life and death&#34; unsettled. We have heard him, patiently, and I put this question to my fellow citizens: What man who had a good case would have made such a speech? The situation is quite simple. The honorable gentleman is no novice in politics. He has had very long experience. He went from this country charged with matters of grave import. He abandoned his position. He resigned his office. He has introduced a hundred new reasons for his action ; but the reasons which he gave in the cablegram announcing his resignation are the reasons by which he must stand. I am not going to follow the honorable member along that path which he has elected to tread in his personal attack upon me. I am as well able as any one both to make and to receive personal attacks; but I am content to appeal to the facts. </para>

                                <para>- Let me remind honorable members what those facts are. The honorable gentleman was a colleague of mine, and he was selected by the Government to undertake a mission which he himself had declared to he fraught with matters of &#34; life and death to Australia. Se went from this country under favorable auspices. He reached England. He entered upon his task, and then, almost at the very outset, abandoned it. He has sought to ma&#39;ke it appear that sinister influences were at work, that a conspiracy was on foot, to prevent his mission becoming a success. But the facts speak for themselves. The honorable gentleman went to England to deal primarily with finance. He went to grapple with the question of wool profits, with mandates, with the war indemnity, trade representation, and immigration. All these things were intrusted to the honorable gentleman. They were matters of very great importance. How has he dealt with them? He has left all of them undone ! This is not the first time he has been to England, nor is this the first time he has returned in circumstances which have called for a good deal of explanation. He was ill-natured enough to make some references to my own return. He will at least admit that when I returned to Australia there was  no  need for me to make any explanation as to why I had returned, nor upon the manner in which I had done the work I was sent to do. The circumstances spoke for themselves. I was sent to represent the Commonwealth, and I remained until my mission was completed. The honorable gentleman has endeavoured to camouflage the circumstances surrounding his resignation, but they are abundantly clear. He was intrusted with, perhaps, the most important mission - outside of that which my right honorable colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and I had undertaken during the war - which has ever been given to any man as an emissary from the Commonwealth. He has been away from the Commonwealth for seven months, and, of that time, to the consideration of these &#34;matters of life and death&#34; he has devoted three weeks ! How does he explain all this ? He says that some act of mine prevented him, when he was on the very threshold of success, from bringing his mission to a satisfactory conclusion. What  did I do? I sent a telegram to the Secretary of State. The :message to which he refers was despatched on 20th May. &#39; It deals with two things - first, with the payment of the half-profits on the wool sold to Britain; and, secondly, with the sale of the 1920-21 clip. The right honorable gentleman says I ought not to have sent this telegram. But why? It was a very proper telegram to send. He says the copy I sent to him is different from that sent to the .Secretary of State. That is not true. The circumstances &#39;under, which the telegram was sent may be&#39; stated. The Australian wool-growers - the men who, after all, were the most deeply concerned, both with the sale of that clip and with the distribution of profits on the old clips - had a conference, and then waited on me and asked me to send&#39; this cablegram. The joint council of the wool-growers drafted the &#39;message, and it was sent at &#39;their request. I make no apology for sending it ; it was my duty to do so. The suggestion of the honorable gentleman that I ought ;to have stayed my hand, that the full weight of the Australian Government was not to be behind him, and behind the growers, in support of their demand for payment of .their money, is monstrous, and not &#34;for one -moment to be seriously considered. Had I failed to ask the &#39;British Government for the ..payment of -the half-profits, would I not have laid myself open to the charge &#34;that J had left !my colleague without support while on a mission of &#34;life and death&#34;? </para>

                        <para>The right honorable member has said many things. Ho has endeavoured to make it appear that his resignation was  due to the sending of the cablegram to which he referred ; that it was because of something inherently evil in myself ; that I am a different man from what I was when he left here; that his colleagues are different; that the need for the Commonwealth being effectively represented in these matters of life and death is less now than when he went away. These excuses will not bear a moment&#39;s examination. We are the same men; this is_ the same Commonwealth, and its financial needs are now as great as, or even greater than, when my right honorable friend went away. He does not seem to understand why it is that people censure him for resigning when and as he did. Despite his opening remarks, he seems to think that, in some way, this is a personal dispute- between himself and me. ,But an infinitely more serious matter is involved* As I said when J. had the honour of addressing the House in regard to this matter on a previous occasion, the circumstances which would justify a Minister resigning his portfolio in Australia would <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> quite insufficient to justify his resignation when, 12,000 miles away, he stood as the representative of this Commonwealth, and stood where he could not be replaced. The position is analogous to that of a soldier in peace and war. What is permissible in time of peace is not permissible in time of war. </para>
                        <para>The right honorable member has shown in the clearest way that I did everything I could do, both while he was- here and when he was away, to retain him as a colleague^. He has shown that I made both public and private apologies to him. He has shown that I used every means at my disposal to induce him to remain as a. colleague when he resigned here on a former occasion, and if honorable members will look at the cable correspondence, they will see that I was not less assiduous in my efforts to retain him as a colleague, despite his determination to resign, on this occasion. If he resigned, upon- him rests the whole responsibility, and his colleagues do not share it, for, as the cables show clearly, everything was done to induce him to remain a member of the Government. But the right honorable member does not seem to recognise that,, even if he had right on his side - even if I interfered, and, as he said, meddled with his business - he still ought not to have resigned. His business was to remain in London to do the work he was sent to do, and then, on coming back, his position, if he should then have assailed me, would have been very different from what it is this afternoon. </para>
                        <para class="block">What are we to think of the right honorable member who, going away from this country seven months ago, returns in  the most leisurely way, after devoting of those seven months only three weeks to the service of his country, and assumes that his fellow-citizens will accept abuse of myself as sufficient explanation for his failure to do that which he, him-  self declared was a: matter- of &#34; life  and  death?&#34;  He contemptuously brushes  aside every, effort made by  me- on behalf of his colleagues to induce him to remain. Coming back now, at the end of seven months, he says, &#34;I was on the threshhold of success. Had I been allowed to continue a little longer, my efforts would have been crowned with success. Yet I resigned because the Prime Minister sent Home a certain cablegram.&#34;  That is his own version of this unhappy business. Does he seriously expect any one to accept such an explanation? I put it to any man whether it is a satisfactory  explana-tion  for his resignation. I. invite honorable, members to recollect that, when the right honorable member&#39; complained, I dealt with and remedied all the matters about which he complained in the fullest possible way. </para>
                        <para>He has spoken of my failure to notify his appointment to the Imperial Cabinet. Almost in the same breath, he has said that there were no. meetings of the Imperial Cabinet whilst he was in London. Surely, then, this, was not a sufficient, reason for his resignation. I did not notify the British Government that .he was to attend meetings of the Imperial Cabinet before he arrived in London, because I did not know there were to be any; but directly he called my attention to it, although, a.s he has said, there were no Cabinet meetings, I rectified my omission, and he was duly accredited. But I had notified the Imperial Government long before that the right honorable member was going Home to discuss matters of finance. That was the important duty he went Home to discharge, and of&#34; that the, British Government was notified.. Arid, as I have said, as soon as the. right honorable member complained that the British Government had not been advised, that he was to attend meetings of the Imperial Cabinet I rectified the omission. . I was sorry, and, I say again, I &#39;am sorry, that I did not send word sooner.  But surely this wag not sufficient to justify his resignation, for it had nothing whatever to do with his mission. As I said in my message to &#39;him - . </para>
                        <para>This. I regret, but could, not foresee the circumstances. I regret if you have been embarrassed, but I think I&#39; have put this matter in order, and you will have no further complaints. </para>
                        <para class="block">He complained that I had not sent him copies of cables to the Secretary of State. I immediately cabled him as follows: - </para>
                        <para>As requested,  I  am asking Secretary of State to supply you with copies of all cables both ways.  I  was under the impression that this had already been done, but find it was limited, through an office misconception, to cables relating to Brussels Conference. </para>
                        <para>At the end of my long telegram, which covered all points raised by the honorable gentleman, and to which I refer honorable members, I said - </para>
                        <para>Now for a final word.  I  have endeavoured to cover the points raised in your cable and put matter quite clearly.  I  understand,  I  think, just how you feel, and  I  want to assure you that you have no reason whatever for the belief that anything is being done, or will be done, at this end to impede your mission. On the other hand, everything will be done, whether by silence or action, at your request, to further it. We want you to succeed. We both have the same object in view, viz., the welfare of Australia.  I  want to do everything  I  can to help or support you. If it appears to you otherwise,  I  ask you to accept my assurance that you are absolutely mistaken. </para>
                        <para>I ask honorable members what more could I have said ? Who could have taken exception to being addressed in such terms? As I said before, had any man addressed me so, I would have put all ill-feeling aside and gone on with my work. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member standing in his place to-day was quite unable to take exception to the tone of these cable messages. But he has stated quite positively that behind this camouflage of tone there was a deliberate purpose on the part of myself and the Government to impede his mission and to damage Australia. I am sorry that the right honorable gentleman could not have dealt with this matter on its merits. He has said that we have endeavoured to explain his resignation on the ground of ill-health. The right honorable member resents that explanation. He says, &#34; I was never better.&#34; In my cable message of 2nd June I said, &#34; I understand just how a highly -strung man feels in the most difficult environment in the world - London. &#34; He cabled back that I was quite wrong in thinking he was ill. &#34; I am quite well,&#34; he said. </para>
                        <para>Why, then, did he resign? Is it suggested for one moment that a difference of opinion of such a nature as is disclosed by the cables is sufficient to justify his resignation ? Does the right honorable member say that the functions of the Government in Australia are to be entirely suspended when he leaves this country? He has sought to draw a subtle distinction between his absence from this country and that of any one else. He has said in effect, &#34; When the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook went away they were not charged with any specific mission. They were dealing with matters at large.&#34; He has said in effect to me, &#34; Although you are the man who originated the Wool Pool, although you had complete control of these wool matters as the Minister in charge before you went away, the moment you left you were not even entitled to be consulted in relation to these matters which you originated, and which concern your Department. And so, although I took this extraordinary step of selling the wool clip of the country while you were on the water, I did not notify you, let alone consult you.&#34; All that, he says, is quite proper. But it was most improper, he says, for me not to have consulted him in regard to the sale of the 1920-1921 clip, with which he had nothing whatever to do. It was not a part of his mission, and he had nothing to do with it. He was asked only to expedite the payment of the half profits on the old clips. </para>
                        <para>The right honorable member has covered such a wide field that it is impossible for me to follow him. Nor is it necessary, since, apart from his personal references to myself, he has said nothing that throws fresh light on his resignation. He has been back in Australia for the last week or ten days, and although this Parliament and the country was denied an explanation from him for months, he has kept the Parliament waiting while he has prepared this oration. He comes here seeking by a cloud of words to hide that which cannot be hidden, to explain away that which cannot be explained. How does the right honorable member attempt to explain why he resigned his position as a representative of the Commonwealth ? He begins by endeavouring to make me responsible for an article which appeared in a paper called <inline font-style="italic">Punch.</inline> There would be something humorous in this if it were not so serious. He says that this paper was lately bought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes. Why did he make that statement? He made it, I believe because he thinks that by so doing he will be able to. cast enough dirt at me to lead people to no longer ask themselves, &#34; Why did Watt resign his position in London?&#34; but to inquire, &#34; What is there between F. W. Hughes and the Prime Minister? What is their relationship?&#34; That is not a very manly thing to do. I wish to remind him that, before he went away, he was mainly responsible for the drawing up of the new wool-tops agreement made between the Government and F. W. Hughes and Company. I say nothing at all about <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> for it has nothing whatever to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt&#39;s</inline> resignation; but I could retort very easily. If there is a paper in this State that is not for the honorable gentleman, but is for me, I should like to hear of it. It is perfectly true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Hughes is a friend of mine. I pick my friends where I please; I have always done so, and I always shall. But the honorable member has a very great friend in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> and he has a great friend in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fink,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fink</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baillieu</inline> own the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> Why did the honorable gentleman not mention this fact also? It would have been quite as relevant.. That sort of thing is unworthy of the honorable gentleman, and shows the poverty of his case. He set out, as I say, to explain away what cannot be explained; and I should like to put the matter quite clearly. Why did the honorable member resign ? Here in my hand are the conditions on which he said he would consent to carry out that mission relating to &#34; matters of life and death.&#34; Here is the ultimatum he delivered to the Government. I ask every man in the House to place himself where we were. Would any honorable member have meekly accepted this ultimatum, which demanded the complete surrender to the honorable gentleman of all the powers of the Government over these most important matters? If any honorable member answers &#34;Yes,&#34; he must be for the honorable gentleman ; if not, he must be against him. This is what the honorable gentleman demanded that we should do - </para>

                        <para class="block">These were the terms of the honorable member&#39;s ultimatum. I need not ask honorable members opposite whether they would give to any single man such power as the honorable gentleman asked, for I know what their answer would be. I am content to put that question to any man in any section of this House, or to any of my fellow-citizens throughout Australia. What is it that my honorable friend desired ? He desired that the Government, while taking the responsibility - for he does not deny that we should be responsible for every act of his - should hand over to him all power. He demanded that we should not even have the right to be consulted - that we should leave it to him to decide whether or not we should be consulted. The principle to which the right honorable gentleman wished to commit us is a principle that abrogates the very basis of responsible Cabinet government. The honorable gentleman has set out reasons for his resignation, and he has amplified those reasons, and, as I have said, they speak for themselves and condemn him. In reference to the Spa Conference he demanded that he should not, as he said, have the mind of a plenipotentiary with the &#34;status of a telegraph messenger.&#34; Then he goes out of his way to explain that he was not a delegate to the Spa Conference. The honorable gentleman was a delegate or plenipotentiary - let him call it what he will - to the extent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George had requested one.

                        <para>Well, I do not apologize for laying down this condition. Before I, in my responsible position, could give to any man, I do not care who he may- be, the right to commit this country in regard to matters of life and death, surely it was proper to insist that the Government had, at least, a right to be consulted before action was taken !&#39; The honorable gentleman takes exception to that view. But he says that if we had not called him a &#34; plenipotentiary&#34; it would not have mattered. What is the use of beating the air about words? The honorable gentleman went home clothed with the. fullest authority that is given to Ministers. But that did not satisfy him. He insisted upon greater authority than it is  possible,  under responsible government, to give a Minister who represents his Government abroad. What would have been the honorable gentleman&#39;s position if he. had been here? How are decisions arrived at in Cabinet ? By a majority. Does, the honorable gentleman suggest that on all occasions he had his way? Not at all; I am sure he had not. None of us do. Cabinet Government is a matter of give and take. </para>
                        <para>The same principle applies in party meetings, and, indeed, in society generally. But the- honorable gentleman says; &#34; When I leave Australia, you must leave everything to me.&#34; Matters of finance, which go to the very root of the structure of government, are to be left to him, and he is to decide whether or not he consults his Government. That, in plain terms,  is what he .insisted upon. And because we could not agree to surrender all&#39; our authority to him and become mere automata, he resigned. If the honorable gentleman had been &#39;given the free hand he claimed, and I had been asked in  this  House what he had done in regard to any loan which the honorable gentleman was raising abroad, I should have been compelled to say that I did not know - that he had not consulted the Government. What would be said of a Government which confessed that it knew nothing at all of financial commitments amounting to millions, or loans involving the credit of the community? It only requires to put the position in plain language to show that the honorable gentleman  has  taken up a position which is incompatible with responsible government. </para>

                        <para>The honorable gentleman sought to. make it appear- that while as a general principle&#62; to quote his own words, &#34; the Government functions- where it lives,&#34; it is different . when certain, definite matters are intrusted to Ministers; in such case, the Government must leave- the matters to its representatives. With certain reservations, every one can agree with that position.  For instance, if I said to the honorable gentleman, &#34;Go Home and borrow &#163;20,000,000 on the best terms you can, and let us know, before you finally complete negotiations, what the terms are,&#34; I should say that then the negotiations were within the honorable gentleman&#39;s own hands, subject to the reservation I have made. But the position was quite different in this particular case. The honorable gentleman was charged  with many things.. In regard to finance his mission was at. large to a very great extent; and. he was asked to disentangle a most complex financial position. The honorable gentleman takes exception to my communication with the Secretary of State on a matter which was connected with his mission. He says it prevented&#39; his mission being a success; that it justified his, resignation. Does he expect the House and the country to believe this? How many times, did the. honorable gentleman communicate with the British Government in regard to matters within the scope of the mission with which I was intrusted ? But the honorable gentleman said that the mission pf the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and myself was at large. That is not so. </para>
                        <para>When I left this country I was asked to sell, its products; to look after the interests of our soldiers.; to see that the interests of this country  were safeguarded - to do all things possible to assure the welfare of the Commonwealth. If any one tells me that when I left . Australia I had surrendered my right as a Minister to be consulted in regard to the sale of the wool clip of Australia, I shall utterly deny it: The honorable gentleman ought to have consulted me. The matter was one of first magnitude. It bore directly on my mission. It was a matter in which 1 had taken the keenest, interest, and on which. I had  very  definite views. He had ample  opportunity to- consult me. He did not do so. Not only did he not consult me, but he did not even notify me, and I learnt the facts through the press of England, and in a casual way from a remark of the Secretary of State. Yet, not only did I not resign, I did not even complain, although I felt it very keenly. The honorable gentleman has said that no restrictions were placed upon the Treasurer and myself in regard to Peace matters, while every restriction was placed on him. The cables tell a very different story. He refers to the cable sent to the Secretary of State by me. He says it ought not to have been sent. I do not agree with him. &#34;What was this cable? It dealt, as I have said, with the sale of the new clip and with payment of our share of profits of the wool sold to Britain. Let me remind the honorable gentleman that he took no exception whatever to the proposal in that telegram for the sale of the new clip. While he thought it might be difficult to get a suspension of sales for the length of time then suggested, he did not think it impossible to arrive at a working compromise with theBritish Government. That was the essence of the scheme for the sale of the new wool clip. The honorable gentleman speaks of his negotiations for the payment of half-profits. &#34;How did my cablegram affect these? Does he say that because I supported his argument for payment, his mission was rendered futile? As to his mission, he does not deny that the sale of the new wool clip had nothing to do with it. </para>

                        <para>Mr.HUGHES.- As to the wool half- profits, the honorable gentleman has led the &#39;House and the country to believe that he was baulked on the very threshold of triumphant success. He is not the man we know him to be if he would draw back when success was so near, for in what more effective way could he have silenced me, and all those who he Says attempted to belittle him, than by returning to Australia as a successful envoy? He cannot deny that I did everything possible to induce him to remain in the Government. Nor, on the other hand can he deny that he did everything in his power to make that impossible. Was this the action of a man who was on the verge of success? Was it that of a man honestly desirous of remaining in the Government? Was my attitude that of a man who desired to remove the honorable gentleman from the Government? I ask honorable members and my fellow citizens to remember that the right honorable gentleman took a step without precedent, as far as I am aware, in the history of responsible government, and certainly in the history of the Commonwealth. On the heels of his resignation - he says twenty-four hours elapsed - he communicated his intention to the press, in which I first read of it. Not satisfied with that, when I requested that he should give me an opportunity to meet my colleagues, who were scattered all over Australia, he contemptuously referred to the Cabinet, &#39;of which he was still technically a member, saying, &#34; What does it matter to me &#39;when the Cabinet meets ; I am no longer a member.&#34; Had the honorable member been so near success as he would have us believe, does any man think that in the face of &#39;the cable I <inline font-style="italic">sent</inline> to him, in which I implored him to remain in the Government, and stated the matter in such a way that no man who did not want a &#39;row could have resisted the invitation, he would have resigned? The honorable member said that he was within a hand&#39;s touch of success. Well, I offered him, on behalf of the Government, an opportunity to achieve success. He told us that he delivered an ultimatum to his colleagues, setting out in detail the complaints against us. Let me remind the House of how far we were prepared to go to meet him. I quote from my cablegram of 2nd June, to which I refer honorable members - </para>

                            <para>You say I have interfered with you and embarrassed you. Cabinet has looked most carefully through all the cables which have passed between you and me, and into those between British authorities and Commonwealth since your departure, and has considered my actions here in all their bearings, and, as I have said, they do not think your complaints justified. </para>

                            <para class="block">I quite see your point, and shall not send any further wires in reference to half-profits except to you..... Believe me I shall not embarrass you, but will do everything to help you and keep you informed. I shall not communicate direct with the Secretary of State <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> wool half-profits or finance except at your request, <inline font-style="italic">lie</inline> failure to notify your appointment as representative on Imperial Cabinet: As it was not contemplated when you departed that formal meetings of Imperial Cabinet would take place, sufficient notification of your authority to sit did not precede your arrival. This I regret, but I could not foresee the circumstances. I regret if you have been embarrassed, but I think I have put this matter in order and you w.ill have no further complaints. As requested, I am asking Secretary of State to supply you with copies of cables both ways. I was under the impression this had been already done, but find it was limited, through office misconception, to cables relating to Brussels Conference. Now for a final word. I have endeavoured to cover the points raised in your cable, and put matter quite clearly. 1 understand, I think, just how you feel, and I want to assure you that you have no reason whatever for the belief that anything is being done, or will be done, at this end to impede your mission. On the other hand, everything will be done, whether by silence or action at your request, to further it. We want you to succeed. We both have the same object in view, viz., the welfare of Australia. I want to do everything I can to help or support you; if it appears to you otherwise, I ask* you to accept 1113&#39; assurance that YOU are absolutely mistaken. </para>

                        <para class="block"> In regard to the half-profits on wool sales, the right honorable gentleman said that he was within an ace of securing those things which would have made such a tremendous difference to this country, but he drew back because of the cable I sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Because of that cable, he would not remain a member of the Government, and, by so doing, enable his country to reap untold advantages. He would not reach his hand out to get for the pastoralists those millions of pounds which were within reach. We know the honorable gentleman too well, and we know human nature too well, to believe that statement for a moment. The honorable member asks us to believe that he resigned from the Government because we prevented him from doing that which he had been sent to England to do. The cable messages speak for themselves; I invite my fellow citizens to look carefully through them, and then say in what way it would have been possible to do more than the Government did to retain the services of the honorable member. In my cable of 2nd June, I said - &#34;... However, I quite see your point and shall not send any further wires in reference to payment of half-profits except to you. . . </para>
                        <para class="block">What more could we have done ? Are we to be censured because we stood fast on the principle that we must be consulted before we were committed on great questions of policy ? I  do not  think that one honorable member will take that view, because this House is most jealous of its rights, and is continually urging the Government to consult it. How much more have the Government the right to insist that no one of its members shall act without affording Cabinet an opportunity to express its opinion? The right honorable member said that we must leave it to him to decide whether or not we were to be consulted. He has made it perfectly clear that, for some reason, he had determined to resign. He has alluded to a previous occasion on which he and I differed in regard to the sale of wool. He sent me a letter which honorable members have heard read; it was not a letter which I would have sent to any man; and he said that I should apologize for the remarks to which he took exception. 1 did apologize, but it never seems to have occurred to him that the tone of his writings, as well as his utterances, is usually such as to demand an apology, not from others, but from himself. Apparently, the honorable member goes through life quite satisfied that he is a model on which we should pattern ourselves. </para>

I emphasized those views very strongly in Great Britain, and for that was subjected to much criticism here, particularly by a newspaper which is owned by friends of the right honorable gentleman. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has sought to make it appear that the Government agreed with what I said about Nauru, but they did nothing of the kind. I asked them to back me up, so that I might say to the British Government, &#34; Our claim to this island is greater than yours. We fought for it, we garrisoned it, we hold it at this moment, and we have a right to it.&#34; That seemed to me a sane view, and one which every Australian ought to have held - I do not say that every Englishman should have held it. Had I been backed up, I doubt not that we should have got Nauru. However, we did not, and I made the best of a bad job. I do not say:that it was a very bad job. The right, honorable gentleman said that the verdict of posterity will be that a statesmanlike course was pursued by him in subordinating Australian to other interests. If so, that will be the verdict of a weak -necked generation. While half a loaf may be better than no bread, the whole of the phosphates of Nauru would have been better than only one-third of them. </para>

I complained that the right honorable gentleman had communicated with the Secretary of State for the Colonies about this matter, and had not notified me, I learning of it for the first time through the press.  His  reply is that, charging his memory as best he could with what had happened, two years before, he thought that I had been consulted. Speaking, like the honorable member, from memory, I say that I knew nothing of. the- matter. To the. best of my knowledge and belief, I was not consulted ; and I am absolutely certain .that I did not approve of what was done.. But I have been supplied by the officials with the following particulars from, the files, which refute absolutely the statement of the right honorable gentleman: - </para>

                                <para>- It may have, but I am afraid the longer you go into it the worse it gets. However, there is the position quite clearly. The right honorable member said that he had consulted me before replying to the Secretary of State. That is hot so. The point I am making is this: The right honorable member seeks to draw a dear line of distinction between the manner in which he was treated and that in which any other Minister charged with  high and important duties abroad has been treated. I venture to say that the principle- of responsible government has demanded the same treatment in every case. Not only did he treat me in the very same manner to which he takes such strong exception, but, as I said: when speaking- here before, when my right honorable ex-colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> went Home, and I acted for him for. nine or ten months while he was in Africa and England, it was repeatedly followed. When speaking on this matter . on the last occasion, I pointed out that an important question like the Treaty of London, to which apparently the British Government was then likely to commit itself, had been brought up before the Cabinet, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was instructed - not authorized - to vote against it, which he did.The principle of responsible government, and its bearing upon the representatives of the Commonwealth when engaged in missions abroad, is well established. The right honorable gentleman has sought, by introducing extraneous matter, and by abuse of myself, to make it appear that he has been choused out of his position; that he has been treated unfairly; that he has been pushed out of office; and that his mission was deliberately hampered. I say emphatically that there is not one word of truth in such a statement. The documents laid on the table of the House, which contain the correspondence between him and me, speak for themselves. Every honorable member who will look in an impartial way at those cables will see that they show clearly that this Government was most anxious to retain the services of the right honorable gentleman, and to make his mission a success. I say deliberately, as I told him in my cable, that I was most upset at his resignation, and could not understand it. I remembered the occasion on which he had written me before, and I took the same course in this case as in the other. I hoped it would have had the same result. The right honorable gentleman may believe of me what he pleases, but I assure him that it was a bitter blow to the Cabinet when he resigned. It was a bitter blow to me. I ask him, as a sensible man, what I could have done more than I did to induce him to remain. I ask him what I could gain by frustrating his mission. He does not deny that, on a previous occasion, when we had a difference of opinion arising out of one of the matters that have been mentioned to-day. I did everything that a man could do to induce him to remain. He does not deny that, on my return from England, when he said that he felt that his health was such that he would have to resign, I used all my influence with him to induce him to remain. He cannot deny that I told him that, if he resigned, I would not carry on. Why, then, should he assume these sinister motives in regard to actions done with sincere and honest motives? The fact is that the honorable gentleman for some reason or other decided to break with his colleagues. He took up an impossible position. He demanded that he should be given a free hand, that he should be allowed to do whatever he pleased inside a wide and most important mission. He&#34; demanded that he should decide whether he would consult or notify his colleagues. To that principle we could not accede; but everything else we righted so far as we were able to do it. So I cannot but regret that the right honorable member has, in his explanation to Parliament, introduced matters that are quite irrelevant, and that he did so upon the excuse that I attacked him during his absence. I would remind him that he himself invited me to do the very thing that I did do. He invited me to take&#39; what was, as I said then, and say now, a most unusual course, by tabling the correspondence.  He has suggested, although he did not persist in the suggestion, that I had withheld certain portions of the correspondence. When I assure him that the whole file was referred to a Committee, consisting of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Mr. Tudor),</inline> and the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> that there was no difference of opinion between us, and that we decided what should be left out, he will surely accept that assurance from me. It was a matter of indifference to me what was left out. The parts that were left out were not left out because they would favour or prejudice the honorable member, but because they seemed to contain references that might give offence in other quarters. </para>

                                <para>- Or because they were entirely irrelevant. The right honorable member has come back to us, and has told us that if we had allowed him to continue, he would have been successful. He said, further, that if I had not interfered with the scheme to extend the Wool Pool for a further period of years it would have been very much better for Australia. -All these things are by the way. They have nothing whatever to do with the right honorable member&#39;s resignation. He does not pretend that they have anything to do with it. He resigned because he had a difference of opinion with his colleagues. If everything was as he says it was, if I had deliberately withheld information from him, if I had deliberately sent that cable to the Secretary of State with a view to intruding into a sphere that was properly the prerogative of the right honorable member, even these things would not justify his resignation. All that he has said does not excuse it, although it may explain it. The right honorable member resigned from his post. He left his post when it was impossible to send another man to take up his duties for many months. Now he comes back and. says, &#34;I was on -the eve of success when the Prime Minister sent this cable; and the doors of Lord Inverforth and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> were closed in my face.&#34; He says, also, that he would have been able to secure all these millions that he has read about this afternoon, and that I ought not to have asked for those millions myself. He says it was grossly improper for me to do so, although those to whom these millions are due authorized me to do so, and insisted upon my doing it. Does the right honorable member suggest that the wool-growers of this country have no rights in this matter? Does he seriously say that, because I sent that cable Home supporting his demand for payment, it is a sufficient reason why he should have resigned? He said I asked for all, while he asked for it only in instalments. I did ask for it all. I said what I waa told to say. This is what I said - </para>

Where are those millions of which you speak ?&#34; He also says - &#34;The Brussels Conference about which you spoke was unimportant.

                                <para>- He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> represented us there, and that no harm could have come to the Commonwealth. It may have been so. We do not know; but the honorable gentleman has assured us that the Commonwealth has not lost anything from his absence from the Brussels Conference. Then there is the matter of the Spa Conference. The honorable member has assured us again that we have lost nothing through our failure to have a representative upon the Empire&#39;s delegation there. It may be so. But, in regard to immigration, to trade .representation, to finance generally, and with respect to the loan position, what had the honorable gentleman to say? What has he done in regard to all these &#34; matters of life and death &#34; ? Nothing ! As I said at the outset, he has dealt with this one matter at great length. He has exhumed the bodies of the dead, and he has dishonoured the graves of those who have fallen - I speak of political graves, of course. He spoke about smoke screens. He has endeavoured to raise a smoke screen behind which he hopes to find some degree of security, or, at any rate, of obscurity. He would have done far better, in my opinion, if he had confined himself to the merits of his case, and told us just why he resigned. How has his abuse of me helped him ? Although the honorable gentleman may not think so, everybody in this House was desirous of giving him the fairest of fair shows. But he can hardly say that his explanation has improved the situation, No doubt he evoked some applause From those who are the deadly opponents of that party to which., before he went to England, he was committed; but from no other. That, perhaps, did not occur to him ; but there I leave it. I am satisfied that the honorable member has not been able to assail the arguments or the principles laid down in the speech which I delivered in this House on 2nd July. The documents tabled in this House speak for themselves. The honorable member has admitted that nothing has been suppressed which bears on the subject.. He has sought, by an attack on myself, to divert the discussion from the facts of the case to other things. I am sorry he has done so; but I feel confident that the verdict of the people will be one of censure of the right honorable gentleman who has resigned an office of such importance at a juncture so critical for causes which, upon analysis, are found utterly insufficient to afford justification for his action. I am content now to leave the whole matter where it stands. </para>

                                <para>- There were certain news cables, one of which referred to the result of the New South Wales election. I believe the whole file was submitted to the members of the party opposite before they came &#39;before us, and, had I known that, I am not sure whether I would have assisted in editing the file. Speaking from memory - I have not seen the file since that time - I believe one cable related to the rate of interest on future loans, and, . in the interests of the Commonwealth, we deliberately excluded it. I believe we did right, because we probably prevented Australia from paying a heavier interest bill than we have to meet at present. Another cable reflected upon another nation that has been friendly towards Great Britain in the past, and may be friendly in the future. We did not think it necessary to include two cables, one to the shipping manager and another to the Secretary of State, as they were not considered relevant to the fight between the Prime Minister and the late Treasurer. I have always adopted the well-known practice of refraining from interfering in a family quarrel, and is is not my intention to interfere on this occasion. I was interested to hear the honorable member for Balaclava confirm a statement that has often been denied, that the reception to the Prime Minister from Great Britain was stage-managed. </para>

                                - It is not my intention to occupy much time at this juncture. The whole position is very regrettable, and it is deplorable that the resignation of a Minister should have been brought before the House in this way. In regard to the cables, I re-echo what the Leader of the Opposition
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline>
                                has said.I believe we honestly tried to play the game between the two contesting parties-, and I do not think any one will accuse me of- being strongly prejudiced, in favour of the Prime Minister against the honorable member for Balaclava.

                                <para>- When I perused&#39; the cables I made certain shorthand notes. When I came to one particular message I said, &#34; This is- probably the cablegram that has wrecked the financial mission of the late Treasurer.&#34; That was the message sent by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> direct to the Secretary of State; and I am not surprised to hear, that that message interfered very materially with the financial arrangements the late Treasurer was to have made in Great Britain. I believe the Prime Minister is very much to blame for not having- sent that cablegram direct to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> with a request that it be forwarded to the Secretary of&#39; State. So far as the late Treasurer&#39;s action is concerned, I think he also made a regrettable error of judgment, as his proper course would have been to inform the Prime Minister that he had made it absolutely impossible for him to carry out his financial mission. In doing so he could have asked if it was the wish of Cabinet that he should represent the Commonwealth at the Brussels and Spa Conferences. I think that would have been a much safer and better attitude for the honorable member for Balaclava to have adopted. The whole position is very regrettable, and. when the late Treasurer Gabled that cables should be laid on the table of the House, it would have been better, if that had been done - omitting only those that were not of any consequence to the issue - because honorable members would then have been&#39; able to pass judgment without any interlude at all. The messages had been submitted at a party meeting, and there was no necessity to bring the matter before the House. The Prime Minister has said that the late Treasurer returned to Australia very leisurely. But I may say that the Government acted with equal leisure in appointing his successor. If this matter was of such vital importance - as I believe it was - the moment the late Treasurer&#39;s resignation was accepted another.Minister should have been despatched by the first boat to take up the work that he had surrendered. I take up the position adopted by  the  Leader of the Opposition in saying that this is really a dispute between two Ministers, and, so far as I am concerned - and I think I am speaking for the members of my party - we can very well leave the dispute to the two Ministers themselves. </para>

                                <para>-  I rise to order. When the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> asked leave to make a statement this afternoon some honorable members objected. That objection being fatal, a motion was then moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I understand that that can only be done in cases of urgency, and cannot cover a debate extending beyond the speech of the honorable member who has asked leave to make a statement. I would like your ruling, sir, on that, and also on the point that I now ask leave to make a speech which will probably extend over three hours in summing up from all sides of this question. </para>

                            <para>- In the Estimates relating to the Treasury there is an item of &#34; Miscellaneous,&#34; which covers an expenditure of something like &#163;500,000, and, no doubt, includes every thing from a postage stamp to the purchase of a steamer. I have no doubt that portion of the money to which the item relates has been expended on cable messages. Apparently, for quite a long time the money of the Commonwealth was spent on complimentary cablegrams between the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> When things were a little dull the right honorable member for Balaclava would write a book and cable it to the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>.-I am very sorry that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has not been afforded an opportunity to make a personal explanation. Surely when a mistake has been made the right honorable gentleman should be allowed to correct it. However, I wish to refer to one or two matters connected with the Estimates of the Treasury Department. The first relates to our Notes Printing Office. I would like to preface my remarks in this connexion by directing attention to a report of the Public Works Committee, which was issued some considerable time ago concerning the way in&#39; which the employees of that Department are housed. Nothing could be worse than the conditions of those who are employed in our Notes Printing Department, and&#39; I marvel at the attitude of the Government in neglecting to take the necessary action to alter those conditions. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the Bill which was submitted to Parliament a little time ago by the Treasurer in connexion with the note issue. There are certain sections in that Act which demand our most serious consideration, because there is not the slightest doubt that if, the Government persist in increasing our note issue, and in compelling the banks to hold large quantities of- notes in: reserve, the future solvency of, this country will be gravely endangered. We cannot pay our debts by issuing promissory notes. There is too much of a Micawber-like policy in connexion with the action of the Government and. of politicians generally. The sooner we come to a determination in regard to matters of this sort the better it. will be for this- Parliament and for the country. </para>

                            <para>- I was hopeful that the Treasurer might have given us some little information in regard to the taxation proposals of the Government. Apparently, there has been some change recently in reference to the Government policy. A little time ago we were assured that there would be no necessity to raise any further loans during the current financial year. Yet I notice in the press to-day an announcement that it may be necessary to raise an additional &#163;110,000,000 beforeJune next. </para>

                    <para>I would like to know from &#34;the right honorable gentleman when &#39;the Taxation Commission will be able to issue its report, and whether there is the slightest possibility of amending legislation with a view to an adjustment of the incidence of taxation being introduced this year. At the present time the incidence of taxation is not fair. Some persons pay taxation upon a far heavier basis than do others. Time after time we have asked that &#39;this taxation shall be based upon an average of three &#39;or five years. If the Treasurer can give us any information upon that matter we shall regard it as  a  very great favour. I have no desire to delay theCommittee further. I merely rose for the purpose of directing attention to these items before we agree to them as a whole. </para>

                        <para>. -  In regard to the Notes Printing Department, I know that things are very unsatisfactory. But the remedy really depends upon action by this House. Our position at the present moment is that we want new and better housing for the Notes Printing Department. That Department is &#39;congested, and, as an honorable member says, it is dangerous. &#39;Something must : be done soon. There  is  upon our business-paper a notice of motion which should be submitted as early as possible in order that we may obtain the decision of the House upon it. </para>

                            <para>- There will always have to be a Taxation Office in Melbourne, for it could not be removed to Canberra even if we were ready to go there to-morrow. There is something further I should like to say in this connexion. It is not a question of whether we are likely to deal with the matter of taxation averaging this year, because before the next financial year, we must have a new scheme of taxation altogether. This is the last year for collecting the war-time profits tax, and we must collect equivalent revenue by some other means; and this, of course, involves revision of the whole scheme of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- As to that, we must wait until the year is up. It looks as if there was going to be a speedy easing up of import duties for other reasons than the operation of the Tariff. I do not anticipate that imports are going to continue to pour into the country at the same rate as at present, and, therefore, our scheme of taxation must be made to meet the situation. Involved is the question of whether taxation should be levied on the average, or some other basis; but I look on that point as settled, the House having emphatically declared that the averaging principle must be applied to the income tax. I hope the Commission of Inquiry which is dealing with the matter, will soon report, so that we may be prepared for the new conditions. </para>

                        <para>. -  Can the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> give the Committee any information regarding the difficult problem of deflating the note issue? I understand that the right honorable gentleman has already been able to cancel about &#163;3,500,000 of notes, but whatever plan may be adopted to this end, it must be gradual in order to avoid the infliction of hardship on the community. Something must be done in this direction; and, although the result may be some unemployment, there will be benefits to counteract the disadvantages. In view of our present financial position, it may be necessary to be cruel in order to be kind. If we continue issuing notes too freely, we shall only make our position worse, deluding the people with an apparent prosperity which can only result in a crash sooner or later. Has the Treasurer any scheme in contemplation for calling in the surplus notes? Before the note-issue was taken over by the Commonwealth, it was a very fine system in Australia, representing, perhaps, the best of the kind in the world. The notes went in and out of the banks just as the trade of the country required - a sort of automatic arrangement which worked admirably. The assets behind the notes were ample, and the notes were a first charge on the banks; but when the Commonwealth took over the note-issue, it had to have a gold backing, which, according to the Act, must be 25 per cent. Fortunately, we have always been able to provide even a better backing than that, but still, at the present time, there are more notes in&#39; circulation than the business needs of the country justify, and we ought to endeavour to get back to normal conditions as soon as possible. An inflation of the currency always means increase in prices, with the consequence that the paper money buys less and less, while the gold retains its standard value. Has the Treasurer any idea what is going to be done in the direction I have suggested ? </para>

                    <para>Have the Government had under consideration any scheme by which people of working age may contribute to a fund to provide old-age and invalid pensions, and insure against sickness, maternity, and unemployment? The present doling out of money must have a very serious effect in sapping the moral fibre of the people. If we are content to give a man a pension because he has just managed to steer clear of gaol, while doing nothing at all for the community, we are getting into a dangerous position. It is all very well for honorable members opposite to laugh, but they would force pensions even on people who did not desire them. I am glad that there are old-age pensions, and I only wish they were larger; further, I think that the earnings of the old-age pensioners ought not to be limited in the way they are, &#34;especially in the case of the blind. It is time the Government formulated a scheme such as I have indicated. I remember that in the days of the Liberal party such a proposal was on their platform, but nothing has ever come of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has been able to do something on those lines in the Old Country, and we should follow the example he has set. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that there should be weekly contributions by the people. In Germany and other countries, the employee and the employer both contribute, and the State gives a subsidy, with the result that there is always ample money to meet the claims made. It is a serious matter to dole out money in this way, leading the people into a fools&#39; paradise, because the day may come when we shall not have these sums to dole out. Any one with self-respect would be only too willing to pay a fair contribution towards a fund which would provide a pension for him on his reaching the age limit. Of course, it ought to be the aim of every man to achieve a position which will put him beyond the need of an old-age pension, but at the same time I would like to see provision made for the payment of pensions to those who are unfortunate enough to require them. However, if this country is to proceed as it is row doing with the load of debt upon it, the day may come when we shall find that we cannot afford to pay old age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- My idea is that while an individual is able to work he ought to contribute so much at intervals, and. according to a scale, to a fund which should be subsidized by the State. Such schemes are common enough in other parts of the world, and if we are to be a self-respecting nation it is necessary that we should follow their example, because a race which is lacking in self-respect cannot put up much of a fight against one which is self-respecting. Our present system saps the self-reliance of the people and is leading the community, especially the aged section of it, into a fools&#39; paradise, because some day they may wake up to the fact that the Government, instead of being in a position to increase pensions, will be obliged to curtail them, a condition of affairs which I do not hope to see. I am sorry that the pension is not larger. Hundreds of people who have worked hard, lived honestly, and served their country well, are not receiving anything like the allowance I should like to see them get. If the Government would adopt some scheme on the lines I have suggested they would not be called upon to provide every year the large sums we are now paying in the shape of pensions, and far better results would be achieved. Pensions certainly would be on a more stable basis. I know that some honorable members go outside and hold up an honorable member who speaks in the way I have done as one who opposes the payment of old-age pensions, whereas he may be endeavouring, as I am, to make them what they ought to be, in the interest of those who are obliged to accept them. If the Government have any scheme in their mind, I hope the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will outline it to us. If they have none in mind at the present time I hope that they will take my suggestion into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle)</inline> stated that he was not conversant with the Standing Orders. He evidently was not. A motion had been made that I leave the chair and report progress. That had been defeated, and, under the Standing Orders, could not be moved again until a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and not even then if, in the opinion of the Chair, the motion was made for obstructive purposes. The honorable member for Calare then rose with another proposition, different in terms, but similar in effect, and I declined to take his motion, and asked him to confine his remarks to the question before the Chair, namely, the vote for the Treasury Department.. I hope that not only the honorable member for Calare, but all other honorable members, will study the dignity of the Chamber and themselves, and allow business to proceed in an orderly way. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member and others like him are very much concerned about matters connected with matrimony and old age pensions. I have noticed that most of the- discussion on the Estimates is by honorable members who profess themselves anxious for economy, and to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to the reduction of the Estimates. Yet the fact stares us in the face that honorable members on the Ministerial side have the power to do things which they complain have not been done. That applies especially to the honorable member for Wilmot. </para>

                            <para>- I was discussing the arguments which the honorable member for Wilmot has submitted to the Committee. He has criticised certain actions of the party which, he supports. He finds fault with the Government for leaving undone those things which they should do, particularly in connexion with old-age pensions. He advocated a course of action which he claims would have a beneficial effect. It is characteristic of honorable members who sit on the Government side to &#34;beat, the air&#34; with speeches of that description, while they retain in power a party which is responsible for the things of which they complain. </para>

                            <para>-That is all right. The honorable member for Wilmot mentioned his desire to increase the old-age pensions, and to introduce a contributory scheme, presumably in connexion with a general- pensions system. But- the honorable member and most of those on the Government side who have voiced these sentiments believe in a contributory scheme for the workers, but make no such suggestion in regard to pensions for high officials like the late Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. It is then a question of rushing, a Bill through for the express purpose, of giving some high-salaried official, who- has had a good time for a considerable period at a high salary, a retiring allowance equivalent to half his salary; &#39;but when it comes to the working classes, the honorable member suggests that they should, be forced to contribute something, notwithstanding, that they have given the best years of their lives to the building up of the industries and the wealth of this country. I am satisfied that he will get no support from the working men and women of the Commonwealth for any pensions scheme on a contributory basis.

                            <para>- The honorable member has not yet explained why he is so much opposed to the payment of a maternity allowance, although on several occasions he has taken up the time of. the Committee in endeavouring to advance reasons why it should be discontinued. He would be much more in touch with the requirements of the people outside, and especially the working classes, if he occupied himself with urging upon his party and the Government the wisdom of materially increasing these allowances. The honorable member, in common with other honorable members on the other side, mildly criticises the Government, but still allows them to go on. He cannot get away from the fact that he looks at these matters from a different social stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is wrong. The industrial insurance law of Germany compelled the employers to form associations and penalize one another in case of accidents. In other words, they made it unprofitable for accidents to occur in any particular industry. If we are to have any alteration in our existing law, I shall favour the non-contributory pensions scheme, because I hold that the men and women who are building up the industries of the Commonwealth are contributing every day of their lives. Honorable members smile sometimes when I rise to speak about Soviet Russia, but I tell them that Soviet Russia is ahead of Germany in regard to this particular matter, and they can, if they like, obtain full information  from the official papers available to them in Melbourne. I have read some extracts from them myself. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer said just a while ago that he agreed with me, but now he says he favours a contributory scheme for national insurance. I believe in a non-contributory scheme for social insurance. The Treasurer, as one of the most important Ministers in the Cabinet, can at least use his influence to see that injustices which occur in connexion with the existing pensions scheme are remedied. I mentioned one injustice a few minutes ago when I pointed out that, if the wife of an old-age pensioner is obliged, by economic necessity, to supplement the income, the pension allowance is reduced by the amount she earns. Surely the Treasurer does not contend that he is powerless to remedy this injustice ? </para>

His difficulties would be with his own followers. The answer to appeals such as I am making for an alteration of the law is always that there is not sufficient money. But money can be found for other things. Taxation can be increased and loans can be floated to provide means for other expenditure, yet not for the betterment of the social conditions of the people.

                            <para>- The Federal Capital is of little concern to the working men and women of this country, because few of them will ever go there. The honorable member belongs to the Economy party. When it is a question of increasing the old-age pensions and bettering social conditions, the cry is, &#34; We must economize&#34;; but there is no talk of - economy when it is a question of taking part in materialistic wars, involving the sacrifice of life, and the maiming of hundreds of thousands, with a consequent huge debt. Then the man who talks economy is branded as a traitor and disloyalist. I am glad that, as their intelligence grows, and their grasp of the real state of affairs in society becomes firmer, the people of this country are becoming more and more discontented, and I hope that, eventually, whatever Government may be in power, it will be forced to give the old-age pensioners much more than the paltry pittance which I am now endeavouring to get from the Treasurer. I ask the right honorable gentleman if he will give the assurance that a short measure for the amendment of the law will be introduced? He is silent. He will not promise that the injustices to which I have referred shall be remedied. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has just referred to the discontent amongst the industrialists; there will also be much discontent amongst the taxpayer&#39;) when they realize that some representatives of the people consider, when the Estimates are before them, that the only thing that matters is to get the business done so that they may leave here at half-past 10 o&#39;clock at night. I represent a district where in only one out of &#39; four years have the pastoralists, farmers, and cane-growers  got anything from their enterprise, but they have been hit up by the war-times profits taxation to such an extent that practically everything they have made has been taken from them. The Treasurer regrets that next year he will not be able to continue that taxation. </para>

                            <para>- So it seems to me. A Commission has been promised, but the matter should have been settled straight off. I should like an assurance from the Treasurer now that before income returns have next to be furnished under the State law, arrangements will be made to prevent the duplication of Federal and State returns. Every country representative and every city member who feels that the residents of the country should not be harassed almost beyond endurance, should take up these matters. Many of the men on the land, who have not had a very great education, tell me that what worries them is not so much the payment of these exorbitant taxes as the extreme care they have to exercise in making their returns, and the fact that, after putting in their returns, they get letter after letter from the Income Tax Commissioner suggesting that they have falsified them. </para>

                            <para>- What is needed is a common-sense and practical method of dealing with the question of stock. As the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> said, the question should be one of receipts and expenditure. No one but the dairy farmer, or the sheep man, is taxed both on his capital and the product of his capital. A dairy cow, which is really capital, is put down as income at &#163;6 in New South Wales, and &#163;3 in Queensland, simply because the farmer has to include it as part of his income. The butter which is produced from the cow is charged up as income also. The calves are also charged up as income. A sheep is put down at &#163;1 in New South Wales, and 10s. in Queensland and the wool has to be returned as income for taxation purposes in addition. Capital and income are taxed on every possible occasion. When a drought comes the stock, which has been taxed as income, dies, after costing, probably, hundreds of pounds in an effort to keep it alive. The owner has already paid income tax on it for the previous year, but he is given no rebate. The time has come to stop that state of affairs. It needs no Commission to inform the House, or the Government, or the Income Tax Commissioner, that this thing ought to be stopped. </para>

                            <para>- I am in the unfortunate position of holding stock, and I find that in the years when I make losses I have to pay income tax, simply because I happen to have a few calves, where the year before I had a lot of breeding cows, although the value of my stock is hundreds of pounds less. That is not a fair system. It is not applied to men in the city. Those in the city with regular incomes pay infinitely less in income tax than men in the country. On top of that the Government impose a war-time profits tax, which has almost ruined many pastoralists, and has been a scandal and disgrace in its effects on the producing community. </para>

                    <para>The cost of the Commonwealth Stores Supply and Tender Board is put down this year at &#163;1,520. Last year it cost &#163;11,950 to run. The total estimate last year was only &#163;150, but the expenditure reached the figure I have just stated. Cutting down the estimated cost this year to &#163;1,520 is an instance of economy in the wrong place. It is scarcely possible for the work of a Board which is going to be of any value to the Commonwealth Department, in view of the high turnover involved, to be handled for &#163;1,520. It has to co-ordinate all tenders and departmental activities. It must be composed of active and practical men. It would be the best expenditure in the whole Budget to make it a Board of such calibre that it could be trusted to buy largely and thus save millions. The wisest economy would be to increase the expenditure on it so . as to insure quick methods of dealing with big general problems, such as supplies of stationery, galvanized iron, tiles, wire, and so on. If the Board is not efficient, we are better without it. </para>

                    <para>It is notorious that the cost of living has increased, and its effect should be considered on the position of invalid and old-age pensioners. Many old-age pensioners have been eking out their receipts by a little extra work. Owing incidentally to the increase in the cost of living, the amount they have been able to earn has also gone up a little ; but because they are able to earn about &#163;1 a week extra, their pensions automatically go down. That is simply putting a premium on indolence and loafing. I urge the Treasurer to revise the amount they are allowed to earn, and institute a sliding scale in accordance with the value of money and goods. Surely that is a fairly easy matter to arrange. It &#34;has been suggested that it will cost millions. </para>

                            <para>- If people now enjoying pensions at a certain rate are allowed to earn a little more outside,I fail to see how that can affect the Budget in any way. I urge a reconsideration of the question. </para>

                    <para>Another matter to which I desire to draw attention is that of the payment of the maternity allowance. In many instances, where the bonus is availed of, it is of no value; but in many others the monetary assistance proves of almost incalculable benefit. I plead that the bonus should be made available to certain women who, at the period of maternity, often have to undergo a great deal of hardship, and who are not now eligible to benefit by the allowance. I refer to the circumstances of women who happen to have been of alien parentage. There are in my electorate numbers of mothers of Syrian extraction. I am confident that their children will grow up as good Australian citizens as any others in the Commonwealth to-day, even though the parents happen to have come from that part of Syria, outside of Lebanon, which was originally French. The granting of the allowance may often mean all the difference in the matter of preparation, or lack of preparation, for maternity. </para>
