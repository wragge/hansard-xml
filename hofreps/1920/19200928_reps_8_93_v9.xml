                        <para>- This is a question to be settled by the Nationality Bill and the naturalization laws generally. A woman takes the nationality of her husband. That has been the law for a very long time, and was not adopted, as the honorable member's inquiry suggests, merely during the time of war. It has been in operation ever since we have been here. Whether we are to alter it remains to be seen. We have on the notice-paper the Nationality Bill, but whether it covers the matter I cannot, at the moment,say. </para>

                        <para>- I have noticed that the British Government is endeavouring - I hope I may say without offence - more or less spasmodically, to encourage the growth of cotton amongst other Empire products. I hardly think it would be correct to say that it is doing so as a component part of a comprehensive policy. One of the effects of its action in that direction in Egypt is that the Egyptians are giving up growing wheat and going in for cotton production. As a result, I think we shall be able to sell to the Egyptian Government quite a lot of our wheat. Thus, indirectly, cotton-growing is a very good thing for us, especially when it is carried on in other countries. So far as I know, there never has been any doubt that cotton can be grown here. I know that tea and coffee will also grow here, but the main consideration is as to whether we can grow cotton on a commercially profitable 'basis. To do so, one of two things would be necessary : We should either have to pick the cotton with cheap labour, or have machines for. the purpose. We cannot get the cheap labour, and the Government would be very glad to offer an inducement to stimulate the sluggish inventiveness of honorable members on both sides of the House, and that of citizens generally who are potential members of this Parliament. That, I hope, will be satisfactory to the honorable member. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not be long in discussing the proposed increases in postal rates. I admit that when I saw the Budget, and before I heard the statement of the Treasurer and that of the Postmaster-General on this Bill, I imagined that what was proposed was a transfer of the war postage of ½d. per letter or paper to the old rates. I admit that I prefer some of the proposals of this Bill to the "War Postage Tax, which merely added ½d. per letter or paper to the original postage, whatever the amount of it might be. For instance, the ordinary householder sending a letter would pay1d. postage on it, and under the War Postage Tax he was called upon to pay lid. A business house might send letters through the post upon which the postage might be 6d. or1s., and under the War Postage Tax they were required to add only½d. more to the postage previously chargeable on the letter. I understand that what is proposed by this Bill is that a double rate shall be payable on every article posted. </para>

                        <para>- So that the ordinary business house sending out. a letter on which the postage is now 6d. will, under this Bill, be required to pay postage to the amount of1s. instead of to the amount of 6½d. as under the War Postage Tax. I think that on the whole that is a fairer proposal than was the War Postage Tax. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Why double the present rate? Is not a 50 per cent. increase enough? To increase educational facilities is the policy of all civilized countries. Free libraries everywhere are the embodiment of this idea. Free libraries, of course, seriously compete with the booksellers just as free overcoats would reduce the business of tailors. </para>
                    <para>Booksellers are the only traders who have Government and municipal competition, therefore, booksellers deserve special consideration from the State to help them distribute their wares. We would suggest that booksellers' catalogues and circulars, if printed in Australia, should go through the post at the rate of one half -penny (½d.) for four (4) ounces. The wide distribution of these catalogues would considerably increase the postal business in books, thus materially benefiting the postal revenue at the same time. People of the " OutBack" certainly deserve to be treated liberally by the Postal Department in the way of literature; books, magazines, and papers are their' great connecting links with civilization. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it does not pay the Post and Telegraph Department to carry newspapers at such a low rate, and many newspapers do not each weigh an ounce. I certainly think' that in all the circumstances the case put up by the booksellers deserves consideration. They complain that they are in competition with the public libraries, but the public libraries obtain their books from the booksellers, and they do not get them for nothing. Lending libraries are referred to in the booksellers' circular, and  these send books into the country, which have to be returned. I think that a reduction of the postage in such cases is justified in the interests of people in the country who are entitled to some consideration as compared with people in the city who have libraries practically at their back doors. If the Postmaster-General can see his way to meet the booksellers in this regard I hope that he will do so. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. He probably refers to thu large proprietary newspapers, but they are not affected by this proposal to the same extent as are small newspapers like that published, for instance, by the Single Tax League. In some cases I believe that as many as forty of these small newspapers are covered by the postage charged on 20 ounces. </para>

                <para>I regret exceedingly that the Postmaster-General has seen fit to double the rate. The increased rate for telephone messages is not dealt with in this Bill, but will be provided for by regulation. Some honorable members, so far as the Standing Orders will allow, would' like to discuss the question of the increase in telephone rates, as well as the increase in the rate for letter telegrams, which are dealt with in this Bill. I personally held, when we introduced the lettergram, and agreed to send forty words for ls., that we were doing something which probably we would have to go back upon. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> agreed with ane when I expressed that view. As I pointed out then lettergrams are chiefly used in big cities, giving the people in metropolitan districts an advantage not enjoyed by persons living in other parts. They are greatly used by business houses who keep their ordinary messages back to take advantage of the lettergram system. I think the Postmaster-General is .taking a step in the right direction by making this increase. However, I do not think he is justified in doubling the rate for the conveyance, of letters throughout Australia. I know that our distances are great, but, as a matter of fact, the majority of the letters posted are for delivery within a circumscribed area. I believe that 90 per cent, of the letters posted in Melbourne are for delivery within a radius of 10 miles.  If an amendment is moved to decrease the (proposed rate I shall support it. On the other hand, I consider that there should be an increase in the postage rate on newspapers in order to bring it more into line with the rates that people are called upon to pay for other postal matter. </para>

I am pleased also at the proposal to revert to 2d. postage. I opposed the reduction eleven years ago, because I considered that by charging 2d. for the conveyance of a letter considerable revenue could be raised in a very reasonable way. I do not know that the large daily newspapers will derive any great benefit from the magnanimous rates the Postmaster-General  proposes for  the conveyance of newspapers, but as large numbers of their subscribers who  are  not living close to railway stations are obliged to obtain their papers through the post-office, I presume that they will participate in this concession. There is a good deal of prating in the press about the voting of money by this Parliament, but I notice that the leading journals can form a very solid combine when they seek to impose fresh advertising rates on the  public.  In the Melbourne daily newspapers at the present time there are almost identical advertisements, increasing the advertising rates. I wonder if the proprietors of these papers consulted their clients by  means  of a referendum before imposing these extra charges, or whether they came under review by any price- fixing tribunal. At any rate, if it were possible to stop the "stinking fish" policy adopted by one section of the Australian press in  respect to Australian interests, good service would be rendered to Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The proprietor of a lending library has drawn attention to the fact that the postage on printed books is now to be doubled, to the great disadvantage of many people who live in country districts, and receive books through the post from lending libraries. Hitherto the postage rate upon a book sent out from one of these libraries has been 2id. The rate will now be 5d., but inasmuch as the same amount of postage has to be paid on the return of the book, the total cost of sending out a book to the subscriber to a library and returning it will in future be lOd. instead of 5d. When goods are sent out by railway, they are often returned free, and it seems to me that a similar concession a night be made in regard . to books posted by lending libraries to country district subscribers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very pleased that the Government propose to revert to 2d. postage. Some people may call it a retrograde step, but I hold that those who get a service should pay for it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "</inline> Henniker Heaton " Chapman was Postmaster-General, he always tried to surround Id. postage with a certain amount of sentiment, but there is no room for sentiment in business matters. The posting of a letter is a business transaction. The letter is intended to convey information for a certain purpose. However, now that we are to have 2d. postage, I hope that greater facilities will be provided in country districts through the extra revenue derived by the Department. </para>

There ought to be money enough to provide those facilities, and, although I am a respresentative of a .city constituency, I shall do all I can to assist country members in seeing that the additional revenue derived from 2d. postage is spent on providing postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities in country districts.

                        <para>- Exactly. In 1911, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Josiah</inline> Thomas, the then Postmaster-General, brought in a Bill to reduce the postage rate on letters to Id., I was daring enough bo move to' maintain the rate at 2d., because I held that no rate should be imposed which might lead to a loss. At that time, the Post Office was run at an annual loss of £400,000 or £500,000, and I could not consent to a policy which meant a continuation of that loss to the advantage of big commercial houses. To-day I do not think the Government have gone far enough. There is a great deal more sentiment surrounding cheap literature. My experience is that most of the cheap literature sent through the post is not educational, but merely for amusement. I can find no educational value in the sending of cheap prints which are not really newspapers, but are principally advertising media. Coming from Sydney, members of Parliament, like everybody else, rush to get the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in order to see the news. The moment they read the Sydney news, they say, "That is not the truth, anyhow," and they know that, because they have just left Sydney. Yet they will take all the Melbourne news in those papers as gospel until they reach Melbourne, and find that it is not the truth either. If the newspapers gave the truth it might be news, but they do not do so. They only tickle the palate of some people to get their paper in as an advertising medium for some city warehouse or boot shop. The newspaper proprietors ought to pay proper rates of postage. I have always been against the running of cheap trains to send the Melbourne dailies into the country. One reason is that it is done for business, and the State has no right to lose money on it. So far as postage is concerned, the papers should pay- full' rates. That policy would have many benefits, one of which, is that it would save lies getting into the country. I remember that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, during the great railway strike in Victoria, would print one edition for the country, telling the men in the country that the men in the railways here were going back and scabbing, and another edition for Melbourne stating that the men in the country were scabbing. They used their paper for that purpose, yet the statements were not true. Another good effect of the change I suggest would be to give the country newspapers a chance, and encourage journalism in the country generally, instead of it being crippled through the ability of the Melbourne dailies to reach the country towns with a lot more news and a lot more lies. The printing of country newspapers ought to be helped rather than discouraged.I have always expected some Government to be game enough to take in hand the task of charging adequate rates to newspapers for their transmission by post. Until the Postmaster-General or the Treasurer comes up to the scratch on that question, he will not be doing justice to the country. There is no reason why newspapers, more than any other commodity, should be carried at a loss. I am sorry the Postmaster-General or the Government have not seen fit to make them pay their just dues for their transmission by post, as is the case with other commodities. </para>

                    <para>.- I have often argued that the Post, Telegraph, and Telephone Department could be made a very useful factor in helping the settlement of the back country. I think the request made to members by the various bookselling firms in Melbourne should be given heed to. They are not asking for very much. The amount of revenue that would be lost is not much, if any. In fact, there is a good chance of the revenue being improved, because if their request to be allowed to send circulars and catalogues through the post at the rate of½d. per 4 ozs. is granted, the possibility is that the volume of books and magazines carried by the Department will increase. The least we can do for the people who live out of the cities is to grant the concession. A great many of them read magazines and similar literature, and this habit ought to be encouraged, because it improves their information and widens their literary taste. To grant the request would at least have a considerable indirect advantage, and involve no direct loss. </para>

                        <para>- What is wrong with it, if it increases the revenue of the Department from the traffic in books and magazines through the post? It is a fair request on behalf of the people who live out of the city radius, and also on behalf of the booksellers themselves, who are already subjected to a lot of competition. A free library is not a benefit to the booksellers, but they have to put up with it. Every reading room endowed by a municipality is more or less in competition with the local booksellers. I hope the Postmaster-General will see his way to amend the schedule in the direction which the booksellers ask for. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with great interest to the criticisms offered by honorable members, and am surprised to find that they take more interest in the welfare of the rich publisher than in that of the poor selector and others in the back-blocks, who will have to pay the twopenny postage. I am opposed to an increase in the postage rate on the broad ground that it will not produce more revenue. The history of the world shows that the penny postage is a better revenue producer than the twopenny postage, in normal times. The aim of the world is to obtain uniform postage rates. That is the real objective of the International Postal Union, which discussed the matter from all viewpoints. It has been proven not only in theory, but in actual practice, that penny postage yields more revenue than twopenny postage, not alone in British-speaking countries, but all over the world. For that reason I am not disposed to vote for twopenny postage unless it can be shown to me that it is going to do some good. I deny that it will bring in more revenue. If the history of the world shows, as it does, that penny postage is the best revenue producer, why put this further impost on the people? After all, those who suffer most will be the people in isolated districts, far from the centres of civilization, who do not enjoy many of the privileges which we in the cities have. A man with a family of three or four half-grown children who want to write letters  will find that this increase is a heavy tax on him, because it practically doubles his postage rates. </para>

                        <para>- If the newspaper rate does not pay, why does not the Postmaster-General bring in a proposal to make it pay ? Why make the unfortunate selector and other small toilers in the country districts, debarred as they are from many of the privileges which we enjoy, pay for the concessions given to the rich newspaper proprietors? If, as the Leader of the Opposition says, the newspaper rate does not pay, and the others do, the Postmaster-General should have brought down a very different proposal from that contained in the schedule. The people in the country are not only being penalized, but, at the same time, their privileges are being cut away. I am not accusing the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> of doing that, because I believe he has made a proposal to give some increase in the conveniences in country districts. Why tax those people' to pay for the extra privileges which we receive in the city ? </para>

                        <para>- I shall read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with very great pleasure this week, because it will contain the record of charges which the honorable member made in this Chamber. I propose to call upon him to prove them. I understand that he said that the vote of £150,000 for Canberra was brought in by the Government to bribe me. I shall call upon the honorable member to prove his statement, because no member has a right to come into this chamber and deliberately make assertions that are not true. Even when they are made at the dictation of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> I cannot excuse him. Immediately one says a word in furtherance of the interest of the people outback, some honorable members, who represent metropolitan and suburban constituencies, regard it as a good joke, but they would take a different view if they lived in the back-blocks, 30 or 40 miles from the comforts and conveniences of civilization, with one mail a week. Even those who live in the cities, and have two or three deliveries a day, with a public telephone at every corner, sometimes grumble, but their grounds of complaint are nothing when compared with these of the people in the country districts, with their scanty mail service and no telephone without a guarantee of revenue. This Bill appears to me to be on a wrong basis; it is introduced for the purpose of obtaining extra revenue, but it is very much to be doubted whether that will be the result. Last year there was a surplus of £500,000 as a result of postal taxation, and it would be interesting to know where that money has. been expended. Can any country representative say that the postal facilities have been extended in his electorate? As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case, because the privileges hitherto enjoyed are being cut down. Those in charge of little allowance post-offices, who are paid <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> or £3 per year, are now receiving notices that, owing to the small revenue derived from those offices, . their magnificent remuneration is to be reduced by 10s. I protest against the proposal to increase the postal rates, because, as I have already said, all postal authorities are agreed that the cheaper rate results in the larger revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying a word against the present Postmaster-General, who, we know, is much hampered in his efforts by the lack of material. In any case, there is no reason why the people outback should be penalized, while all improvements are reserved for the benefit of the residents of the cities. The present Postmaster-General will probably have to be two or three years in office before he can change the parsimonious policy that has prevailed in the Department for the last four or five years. Of course, we have been living under war conditions, which excuse anything and everything. It was quite right to raise money for the one supreme purpose of carrying on the war, but, nevertheless, we should insist that further consideration should be given to those who are so badly served postally in the country districts. We do not ask for many extra country mails, but more consideration should be given to the country people, who live under very trying circumstances. There are postal inspectors all over the country, but can any country representative say that an improvement in the services has ever been made at the suggestion of one of these gentlemen or any official of the Department? I do not know of one instance throughout my own extensive constituency; and my belief is that not 5 per cent, of the improvements in the last ten years have been made as the result of any action on the part of the representatives of the Department. It should be an inspector's business to see where improvements can be made, and to make them; and, after all, the Post Office is cot what one might call a financial concern, but must be regarded as a great educator and  civilizer,  one of the objects of which is to bring the people closer together. I recommend the Postmaster-General to alter the present policy. I know that the honorable gentleman has already made efforts in that direction, and we ought to -encourage him to make more. I take it that this Bill is only a temporary measure, for it cannot be supposed for a moment that Australia is going to fall back in the march of progress, though latterly that would appear to have been the case. If the Department cannot provide wires for telephone extension, why not try a wireless system? Of course, we all know that any new suggestion of that kind is always " poohpoohed," ' just as was wireless telegraphy when first mooted in Australia. We in the cities have picture shows, theatres, trams, trains, and every comfort and convenience; but the people in the country are very differently circumstanced. With them, the arrival of the mail is an event, and it is eagerly met by men from all over the country - the very men who keep the professional men in the cities going. If a tidal wave swamped Melbourne to-morrow, it would not affect, the fertile country districts of Australia; but if these fertile districts were swamped, Melbourne would be nowhere. The present  Postmaster-General  has certainly tried' to liberalize the terms on which our country mails are carried; but I do not suppose that 50 per cent, of the contractors are carrying out their contracts without a loss, owing to the increased price of fodder, and so forth. I should warmly support the proposals in this Bill, as a means of taxation, if they would result in more revenue; but that, I feel sure, would not be the case. For a month or two, more revenue may result, but the experience of the world is that the lower rate is more effective. Probably, these remarks apply,' also, to the' charges for telegrams, for the cost is the same whether a message be sent .10 or 100 miles. As I said before, the Bill, in my opinion, is on a wrong basis, and I hope that the Government will accept some improving amendments in Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - For much the same reasons as those advanced by the honorable member for Eden. Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman),</inline> I do not feel inclined to support the proposed increased charges on letters and telegrams. If the increases would result in more revenue, and that revenue were used to give better facilities in country districts, and to increase the remuneration of the keepers of allowance post-offices, they would be supported by the majority of honorable members. We have asked repeatedly for extended postal facilities in country districts, and we would be very ungenerous if we did not give the present Postmaster-General all the credit due to him for the improvements that have already been made at his instance during the short time he has been in office. ' I am of opinion, however, that it is not necessary to increase the postal rates in order to effect the desired improvement to our country postal and telegraph services. By still further cutting down the facilities enjoyed by city residents, and by due economy in the many branches of the Postmaster-General's Department, we can make such a saving as will render the proposed increases entirely unnecessary. It -cannot be denied that though the Economies Commission very severely criticised the administration of the Postal Department, and suggested where economies might be made to the amount of many thousands of pounds annually, the only recommendation of that body to which it is proposed to give effect is that increasing the salaries of the higher paid officials. I avail myself of this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General one of the improvements which may well be adopted in our country districts - an improvement which is desirable both in the interests of rural residents and of the departmental revenue - the keeping open of our post and telegraph offices till 8 p.m. This demand is being made in the country districts throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that it is permissible for me to mention the fact, because the adoption of the course which I have suggested, would result in such an increased revenue as would obviate the necessity for increasing postal rates in country districts. Our farmers are usually busy till late in the evening, and it is very seldom that one of them can be communicated with over the telephone till 6 p.m. If the post-offices in country centres were kept open until 8 o'clock each evening I am confident that the business transacted by them would be almost doubled. This matter is one which is worthy of serious consideration at the hands of the Postmaster-General. I agree very largely with the remarks of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chapman)</inline> in regard to postal administration, but he will not indorse my view that whilst the Government can find money to squander upon building the Federal Capital we should not support any increase in taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - I exceedingly regret that the Postmaster-General is suffering from such a sore throat that it seems almost inconsiderate to ask him to explain the meaning of this clause. Did I understand him to say that, before the war postage rates were imposed, the postage upon newspapers was only½d. per 20 oz. ? </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the newspapers should pay as much by way of extra postage as should any person in the community. I should like to know why they are to be specially favoured under this clause? If a private individual posts a newspaper to a friend, he will be required to pay1d. postage upon every 10 ozs., or part thereof, whereas the newspaper proprietors will be permitted to post up to 20 ozs. for l½d. What is the reason for this differentiation ? </para>

                    <para>.- There is a wonderful difference between the postal rates charged upon newspapers to-day and the rate which was operative twenty years ago. At that time, the smallest newspaper proprietor was obliged to pay½d. postage upon each newspaper  forwarded through the post. Now the rate is only 1½ d. for 20 ozs. Of course, this rate will not touch the proprietors of the great dailies, because 'they are in a position to increase the prices of their papers, and also of their advertisements. </para>

I should like to see them contribute a little more to the revenue of the country, and would therefore welcome an addition to the newspaper postal rates, but for the fact that the increased burden would fall very heavily upon the country newspaper proprietors. </para>

                    <para>.- I am opposed to this clause. The Postal Department should not be operated as a revenue-producing concern. The aim and object of the Department should be to place postal facilities within the reach of every one. Twopence per letter may be only a small charge, but I consider that instead of the rate being increased it should be reduced from1½d. to1d. The odd halfpenny was a war tax, and was not paid into postal revenue. That being so, the Government are now proposing to increase the postage rate by 100 per .cent. I believe this impost will press heavily upon the people, and I therefore shall vote against the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer informed me that he desired to get this Bill passed in order that the reduced tax may operate from the beginning of October. The Bill modifies an impost which my party is anxious to repeal entirely. I said during the last general election that if the Labour party were returned to power the entertainments tax would be repealed. </para>

I am willing to accept any amendment which will lighten the burden on the people, but I desire that the Treasurer shall go further. He has proposed that all charges under 3s. for admission to  cinematograph and theatrical entertainments and concerts shall be exempt, but that on the first 3s. a tax of 3d. shall be collected, and an additional halfpenny for every 6d. or part of 6d., by which the payment exceeds 3s. But in regard to all other entertainments he proposes to commence the tax on an admission charge of 6d. That means that persons attend-: ing football or cricket matches or race meetings will be taxed on a sixpenny charge for admission. </para>

If entertainments are to be taxed at all, they should all be treated alike, because what may be an amusement to one person may not be an amusement to another. For instance, the person who attends a football match as an amusement of that kind might not care to go to the picture show. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not. The Committee has to decide whether, in the matter of taxation under this Bill, preference is to be given to picture shows over other forms of amusement. I do not know why they should enjoy this privilege. Surely it cannot be on tie ground of their educational value, because, so far as my knowledge goes, some pictures are far from being educational. I believe that a great deal of trouble arising from the use of firearms in Australia may be traced to excitement created by certain types of picture shows. The amount involved in the amendment is not very great, and, besides, the Treasurer . has other means of obtaining revenue. At present the great bulk of taxation is borne by the industrial section of the community. Customs and Excise duties fall chiefly upon the poorer sections of the people. They pay double the amount paid by the wealthier classes. I should like to see the Treasurer draw a little more upon certain reserves of taxation. If he cannot get what he wants by way of the war-time profits tax, then he ought to be able to do it by  means of the income tax, and, if necessary, make the impost retrospective in regard to some of these companies that have doubled their capital out of profits. </para>

                        <para>- But I suppose the Treasurer will not double the amount if I ask him to do so. The proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is only intended to secure justice to all forms of entertainment. If the tax is to be maintained on entertainments at all, it would be far better to leave it standing as at present than to exempt picture shows, theatrical entertainments, and concerts; as proposed. I do not know if pressure has been brought to .bear upon the Treasurer by the picture theatre managers, and if he fears their influence because of their opportunities to criticize him 'by means of their picture films, but I feel that he would be doing a statesmanlike act if he refused to differentiate between one form of amusement and another. I remind him of the opposition when the proposal to tax the children was under discussion. </para>

I would rather attend a football game played by the youths of my district than waste my time at most other forms of entertainment. The English cricketers will be out here soon. If we go to see international cricket we shall have to pay a tax, whereas if we were to waste our time over pictures, inside a crowded building, instead of making the most of the open air, we would not be taxed for our entertainment. I hope the Government will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that theatrical entertainments and concerts are to be placed in the same position, with respect to the proposed tax, as picture shows. I am glad to learn, as regards first-class theatrical entertainments and concerts, that the relief is to be granted on the lowest priced tickets. My experience of theatrical shows in Australia is that they are among the best and cheapest in the world. Upon every occasion of my re: turn from travel abroad I 'have been surprised afresh at the reasonableness of the prices charged as well as by the high standard of the talent displayed. We should do all that may be reasonably expected to encourage those people who spend large sums upon the salaries of highly talented artists, in order that Australian audiences may be provided with a splendid type of entertainment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I had intended to appeal to the Treasurer to grant exemption in respect of one particular class of public entertainers, but I understand that the amendment of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> will cover my purpose. I refer to country bands, and I do not know that I would press for exemption for bands in country parts alone; I would like to see exemption granted in regard to all bands. These organizations do excellent work for charitable purposes; but their general financial state, so far as my experience of country bands goes, is always more or less precarious. They are almost always "up against it," and, in order to- keep going, they are frequently forced to organize entertainments and the like. </para>

                        <para>- I am asking that they be exempted in respect of any form of entertainment which the bands themselves may organize for their own financial benefit. It appears to me, from the interjections of the Treasurer, that if a band calls a social and dance a concert, it will not be required to pay tax. However, this is not a matter on which we should split straws. I have been present on Hospital Sundays in various parts of the country for years past, and have noted that bands have always been the chief attraction; and their services have always been given without fee. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot understand why the Government propose to differentiate between various forms of entertainment. If I read the schedule aright, it is proposed to exempt tickets, up to 3s., <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the matter of cinematograph shows, theatre performances, concerts, &amp;c., while the lowest priced tickets to sporting and athletic attractions, such as football, cricket, and swimming matches, are to be taxed. What is the motive of the Government in taxing a 6d. ticket issued in connexion with a cricket match, and in releasing from taxation a similarly priced ticket to a picture show ? I admit, of course, that what may be regarded as entertainment by one individual would probably be boredom to another. There does not appear to be any reason why the tax should not be similar on all classes of entertainments. We should not endeavour to discourage outdoor amusements, and confer a benefit on the many thousands who nightly patronize picture shows. If there is to be any differentiation, it should be in the interests of those who patronize outdoor amusements, which are more healthy and certainly better for the individual. I do not think there should be any proposal to exempt or reduce amusement taxes in any direction, particularly when we are in such dire distress for revenue. </para>

I was exceedingly sorry to hear the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> say that he was in favour of it. ' The honorable member is a representative of the Country party, the members of which are supposed to protect the interests of the country people; but he is apparently still a member of the old " boodle " party, which is always anxious to take the tax off the wealthy and place it on to the shoulders of the poor. When an attempt is being made to benefit those in the country districts, one would have thought that every member of the Country party would have supported the proposal. Many honorable members know that what are known as Saturday night socials, the expenses of which are covered by a small charge for admission, are the only entertainments that many country people can attend. </para>

Under this proposal, those living in the populous centres are to receive every consideration, while those who are frequently referred to by honorable members on the corner benches as the backbone of the country are to . be penalized. Are the members of the Country party going to sit idly by and allow the confidence trick to be played on them in this way? There are very few " shows " in. the country for which a charge of 3s. is made, with the exception, perhaps, of a few in the backblocks of Queensland. </para>

The tax should be imposed on those who are conducting entertainments for profit.

                        <para>- When last visiting a portion of my constituency, I was informed that a clergyman was advised that he had committed a breach of the Act because he conducted a church social without the necessary permit from the Department. 1 think that a tax should be continued on racing, football, and cricket, because the people who attend such amusements should be prepared to pay taxation. The tax should also apply to all who conduct cinematograph shows or other entertainments conducted as a business, but it ought not to apply to entertainments arranged for charitable purposes. A gentleman who had been instrumental in raising over £20,000 for the charities of Western Australia by means of concerts and other entertainments some time ago failed to observe a regulation of the Department in connexion with a concert that he held in one of the suburbs of Perth, with the result that he was brought before the Court and heavily fined. Representations were made to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, who recommended a reduction of the fine to £5 for each offence. There was no suggestion that this man had been guilty of misrepresentation or had attempted to defraud the Department, but he was heavily fined. . </para>

                <para>I hope that the Treasurer will withdraw the Bill. Our taxation in the future will be exceedingly heavy. I fully realize the demands that will be made upon the Commonwealth by the time that we have made arrangements te&gt; honour all our promises and have pro&gt;vided for those who' were maimed or blinded during the war. Much still remains to be done. Heavy bills will have to be met, and I know of no better way of providing for such liabilities than by imposing a heavy tax upon luxuries and a tax on entertainments, race meetings., and sports gatherings generally. The tax should, of course, be proportionate to the charges for admission. Such taxation would tend, in some degree, to induce the people to economize; it is the duty of the Government to not only practise, but to enforce, economy, and I would support a heavy tax on expensive  luxuries-. I know no reason why those who indulge in luxuries of this kind should not be compelled to make at least some small contribution to the. revenue. I repeat that entertainments for social, charitable, and religious objects should be exempt. </para>

                        <para>- I can only say that on the occasion of my last visit to Kellerberrin I was told that the Reverend Father Fahey, whose name figured conspicuously in the details of the Gallipoli campaign, had been notified that he was to be prosecuted for a breach of the Act in connexion with a church social. The fire brigade in the same town had intended about the same time to hold a dance, but as the necessary permission had not arrived from the Taxation Department, the promoters were compelled to hold it in the fire station instead of the public hall, and to make a collection at the door instead of a charge for admission. I think that the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Western Australia is standing hard and fast by his regulations. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the, view that it is a mistake to remove this tax. There are two outstanding reasons why it should be continued. As I see the position, the enormous revenue charges with which we  are  faced absolutely preclude the removal of  any taxation unless it is so hopelessly unjust that it would be an iniquity to allow it to remain. It is difficult at this stage to make the point that is in one's mind as to the whole question of taxation. We have not had an opportunity to consider our (present or future position with regard to our revenue as opposed to our obligations; but when we <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> we shall have to approach the whole matter in a very serious spirit. I think we shall be a little startled when we realize what we shall be faced with in the next financial year as distinguished from the year for which we have already made some attempt to provide. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Another factor which it appears tome must be considered very seriously is that we have no hope of making our way through our present financial troubles unless every member of the community, from the highest to the lowest, realizes how essential it is to economize. I unhesitatingly admit that this tax is most keenly felt by all classes, and particularly by those whose incomes are small. It is the very tax, however, that we should be careful not to remove, since by doing so we shall pull down one of the fingerposts pointing to the road of economy, which is certainly the only road that we can safely travel in the future. I have a lot of sympathy for those with small incomes who have to pay this tax. The cinematograph show, in particular, has brought brightness into the lives of many such people in this and other parts of the world. It is, therefore, to me a matter for deep regret that it should be necessary to impose such a tax, or to do anything which might conceivably curtail the opportunities afforded people with small incomes to bring a little brightness into their lives. But we are faced with the hard facts of life as it is after the war, and it seems to me that if we are even to pretend to lead this country, it is necessary for us to drive home to the people the lesson that they have to be taught. </para>
                <para>One other aspect of this question which ought also to be emphasized is that, while with one hand we are giving up certain revenue which has come to the Government by way of the entertainments tax, we are replacing it by further taxation upon the postal facilities of this country. That cuts the ground from under the argument that the poor people of our cities, while this tax remains, are deprived of the facilities that were offered them before its imposition to visit a picture show. Even if they are slightly penalized, the unfortunate residents of country districts who have no cinematograph shows which but for this tax they might attend, are to be penalized by being called upon to pay extra postal taxation so that city residents may have restored to them the extra facilities for attending places of amusement which they enjoyed before the war. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no logical reason for the remission of a tax on picture shows if it is to be imposed on cricket matches and  other forms of recreation and amusement, but I sympathize with the Treasurer, nevertheless, because at the last election both parties went to the country promising this exemption. I see as clearly as does any other honorable member, and have seen for years, the tremendous difficulties confronting us in making both ends meet owing to the debt with which Australia is saddled, and I recognise the necessity of inducing every member of the community to practise economy; but as this promise was made to the country by the Government, we cannot blame them for adhering to it, and, in the circumstances, I shall vote with the Treasurer on this schedule. </para>

                        <para>- I stood on nothing promised by any political party. I do not think that I have even read the Prime Minister's policy speech. That, however, is beside the question at the present time. I stood as a Nationalist, because the Nationalist platform was the one with which I agreed most closely. So far as any promise with regard to the remission of this tax is concerned, I know nothing of it, and am not bound by it. Further, if the Government were pledged to the remission of the entertainments tax, they are not pledged to its remission in part, as applied to special entertainments such as cinematograph shows, theatre performances, and concerts, and to retain it as applied to other forms of recreation and amusement. I can see no justification for what is now proposed, and I shall be surprised to hear the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> claim that the Government are adhering to the letter to the promise which has been referred to. I shall be very sorry if the Government press this schedule to a vote, as I feel sure that a majority of honorable members realize that a mistake is being made. We should endeavour to be as consistent as possible, and if we wish to be consistent and fair, we cannot justify this proposal. I hope that the Treasurer will look at the matter from this point of view. I do not see how honorable members representing country districts can possibly vote for this schedule. People in the districts they represent have very few opportunities of enjoying such forms of amusement as are proposed to be exempted from taxation under this schedule. Apart from any question of town or country, a member of the community who likes to attend a football match on a Saturday should not, in the matter of taxation, be treated differently from another who prefers to spend a few shillings at a picture show during the week. This proposal is quite inconsistent, and I am opposed to it. </para>

A distinguishing line can be drawn, and it is that which is drawn in the Bill between those forms of amusement which are educational and those which are not. It is of no use for honorable members to say that picture shows are not educational. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that there are objectionable features attached to nearly everything in life. I suggest that the ordinary " gazettes " at the picture show are highly educational and instructive. I often think when I go to a picture show that the "gazettes" alone are worth more than is charged for the whole entertainment. The last time I visited a picture show, I saw a picture of a telephone dissected, and the exhibition was of a really instructive and educational kind. Then, again, take- such operas as are now being produced in this city, and no honorable member will claim that the cultivation of musical taste of that kind is not differentiated from mere amusement. If we take the Shakespearian season which this city is fortunate enough to be enjoying just now, will honorable members say that it is not educational? It is, in its very essence. There is a clear distinction to be drawn between such forms of entertainment and horse-racing, dancing, skating, and so on. The schedule is a compromise, and I ask honorable members to let it pass. </para>

                <para>Bands do excellent work, and they are always on the side of charitable effort, but if they hold a social in order to raise money for themselves they are compelled to pay this tax. They are generally in a state of financial hardship.I do not know one of them which has a credit balance in the bank. They frequently travel long distances to take part in charitable concerts and such-like entertainments, and the least we can do is to give them some sort of encouragement by. exempting them from the payment of this tax. I think the Treasurer will see that this is a reasonable request. </para>

                    <para>.- I make a final appeal to the Treasurer, on behalf of the bush-whackers of Australia, for the exemption' of their one form of amusement, the bush social. The promoters of these gatherings are now compelled to send hundreds of miles for a permit, and their exemption would avoid all the necessity for this permit business. At any rate, when bouquets are being thrown about in the cities, one or two might also be dropped in the bush, where they are more needed. However, our Treasurer is as hard as flint where people living in the bush are concerned. </para>

I ask the Treasurer not to be adamant in regard to the request to exempt this little form of amusement in the bush. The revenue he would get from these socials would not be more than a few pounds at the most. </para>

                    <para>.- Many bands give all their entertainments without receiving any fee or return for themselves, except, perhaps, when they are seeking to raise funds to buy instruments. Then it is not the individual, but the band itself, which owns the instruments purchased in this way, and when the individual resigns his membership he is obliged to surrender all his claim to his instrument. A gentleman, who has been the honorary secretary of a band for many years, has written informing me that while the income tax continues to be charged in such cases, he does not feel inclined to do anything else but resign his position.  His  band was called upon by the Commissioner of Taxation to furnish returns for three years back and pay a penalty of 10 per cent, for overdue payments of the tax for that period. It cost the members of the band £34. When I appealed to the Treasurer to grant- them some relief he was sympathetic, but upon the case being submitted to the Commissioner of Taxation he pointed out that he was obliged to carry out the law, and that he did not see how he could avoid doing what he had done, except by giving time for payment. I appeal to the Treasurer now to exempt from the payment of this tax band socials which are provided for educational, religious, or charitable purposes. I am sure the public would appreciate our action a great deal more if we cut o*t tins kind of taxation rather than adopt the full proposed reductions on picture shows. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to explain my reasons for opposing the amendment of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney).</inline> It will be very difficult to decide exactly what form of entertainment is to be exempt under his proposal. If I understand it aright, a concert given by a band, or in aid of a band, would be exempt, and a social where a baud is playing without charge would also be exempt. I can see no reason why such a social should not pay the same tax as one where the music  is supplied by a. pianist or a violinist. I am sorry I cannot support the amendment. I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal, but to my mind there is only one thing to do: either to exempt all tickets up to 3s., as proposed by the Treasurer in the case of cinematographs and theatres, or else to charge the tax on all. Nothing else will satisfy me. We must have one or the other, and I do not care very much which. </para>

                    <para>. - I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> and indorse everything that has been said for it. Every word said by honorable members about the .people in country districts is true. I know from my own experience in the running of these functions, that, as the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> says, it is not so much the payment of the tax, as the getting of the permit, that  i3  the trouble. In a great many cases, we are hampered to such an extent by the delay in the mails that we are forced to wire for- the permit in order to obtain it in time. If it is delayed, we have to follow the first wire up with more, and in the end it perhaps costs us fi to get the permit before we can start off at all. If this trouble were wiped out, it would be a great convenience to us in the back-country districts. City dwellers do not realize the amount of inconvenience we put ourselves to in the country in order to raise funds for such purposes as the honorable member for Hume wishes to exempt. Country bands do an immense amount of good. Many a person who shines to-day in the cities as a musical genius received his first musical education from a country bandmaster. In Inverell, my home town, we have a man who has been a bandmaster for twenty-six years without receiving any fee or reward whatever. The band have never received assistance from Government or municipal funds, but have been responsible for giving the cities many of the best musicians that have come from that district. They have always done everything they could to support every charitable institution. </para>

                        <para>- In many cases, the pianists and violinists are professionals. The members of the bands are amateurs. The cases are not at all analogous. The country band is composed of amateurs pure and simple, who devote an enormous amount of time to the work. They help to make life livable in country towns. I hope the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will take note of the fact that in many country towns life would not be nearly so pleasant as it is were it not for the bands. The cities have plenty of musical entertainments, But the band is really the life and soul of the country town. It helps in all entertainments run for social or charitable purposes, and in all demonstrations for war loans, or movements to raise funds for any public purpose whatever. When we have an object of that sort in mind, we go first to the country band, and get them to come along. They are the great draw for the crowd. That is how we, in the country districts, raise the funds that we do for charitable and public purposes, in which honorable members are often pleased to have our assistance, when they are appealing for help from citizens throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member so desires, he can move for the insertion of a definition, and the Committee can deal with it. The Treasurer should extend consideration to all entertainments such as we have spoken of , for the purpose, as much as anything, of saving us the trouble of having to obtain permits. In many cases this has caused us endless trouble and worry. In one case I paid 15s. out of my own pocket for urgent wires to enable us to advertise the function far enough ahead. It is not that we wish to evade the payment of the tax. We look at the question in the light of what is intended by the entertainment. I do not think if the function were run for the profit, of an individual it should be exempt, but consideration should certainly be extended where the object is to benefit a charitable or public institution, or to forward a public purpose. I trust the Treasurer will help us in this way to make life more livable for residents in country districts. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think we can insert here any definition of ' ' entertainment ' ' that would meet the desires of honorable members generally. My impression is that the tax should be imposed where entertainments are carried out for profit, or people make a business of them. It should apply also to race, football, and cricket clubs, and matters of that sort. It should not be imposed where a little social is being held, and a great deal of trouble is caused in obtaining a permit. I have had the same experience as the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page).</inline> People in a little country town 40 or 50 miles from a railway have to send all messages to the city by telegraph or telephone, and must obtain the permit before the night of the entertainment. I have in my bag some correspondence on this subject which is worth reading. It tends to show the difficulties that are in the. way when an Act of Parliament is strictly administered. It might meet the case if a paragraph could be inserted at the end of the schedule stating expressly the classes of people who have to pay the tax. That would be better than asking that band socials should be exempt while other classes of entertainment that might well come within the same category are taxed. I should be glad if the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> would exempt entertainments where no effort is made to make a profit for the individual; but, of course. not exempting race clubs and institutions of that sort. A yachting club, for instance, that runs a big carnival, should pay the tax. </para>

If the Treasurer could promise to insert a paragraph at the end of the schedule making it clear that the class of entertainment for which honorable members generally have been appealing will be given consideration, that would be much better than to carry the amendment of the honorable member for Hume. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather surprised at the attitude of the Treasurer towards the amendment, and I am also surprised generally 'by the resolution which he asks the Committee to pass. I was under the impression that he was going to give the people of Australia something real in the way of a reduction of the entertainments tax, but so far as I can see, he. has given them very little. He has exempted from taxation cinematograph and theatrical entertainments and concerts, where the charge for admission is less than 3s., but has failed to exempt all other entertainments. As was very ably and correctly pointed out by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page),</inline> the resolution, as it stands, will inflict great hardships on the residents of country districts. I noticed a number of honorable members smile when 'the honorable member (pointed out the manner in which the measure will affect those districts. Their smiles proved to me and others conversant with country conditions that they did not know anything about them. Those of us who do understand them, realize that practically the only forms of entertainment provided in real out-back districts are the annual day's horse-racing, and a periodical dance. If the Bill goes through in its present form, the residents in those districts, who have to nut up with more than sufficient hardships as it is, will be taxed when they attend the only entertainments at their disposal. For these reasons, I am sure the Treasurer will accept the amendment, and will exempt, so far as the amendment goes, although it does not go as far as I could wish, those forms of entertainment mentioned by the honorable member for Hume. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; it is customary to get up entertainments for widows and others in need, and such entertainments are taxed by the Bill. For the Treasurer to bring a measure before us, and try to convince us and the electors that he is affording some real relief, is, to my mind, only a piece of political humbug. A few forms of entertainment in the cities will be exempt, but no redress will be afforded in country districts. I hope the Treasurer will accept the amendment; then, bad as the measure is, it will be more acceptable than at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I see the difficulty, and it is a real one. The rigid application of the Act in its present form might, indeed, impose hardship on country bands and such like institutions. After all, the test is - Are the entertainments carried on for profit, or are they not? May I suggest that the honorable member for Hume withdraw his amendment, with a view to the insertion of the following words after the word "concerts": - "or entertainments for the purpose of raising funds for musical societies, associations, or bodies' not carried on for the profit of the individual members thereof." </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment, if carried, will, of course, involve consequential amendments, and any charge over1s. for admission to any entertainment will have to be taxed. There is great necessity for economy, and also for revenue, in this country at the present time, and I do not regard a tax on any charge over1s. as excessive. I may say that, even if my amendment is carried, I shall vote against the Bill as a whole; but if it is to be passed, then I wish it to produce as much revenue as possible. I am sure that the suggestion to introduce this Bill never came from the Treasurer himself, but must be in fulfilment of a Government pre-election promise. That being so, the Government will have done its duty in asking the House top accept it, and, 1 think, the duty of honorable members is at least to accept the amendment I now propose. Many honorable members are anxious that children shall not be taxed on their admission money to entertainments, and the amendment will leave them quite free. I do not see why in times like these persons who are prepared to pay 2s. 6d. or 3s. for an entertainment should not pay a tax. I can see no justification for exempting them. </para>

Surely it is better to tax the person who pays 2s. 6d. or 3s. for an entertainment, than a poor woman who purchases some tinned fish or something of that sort. As a matter of principle. I think we are quite justified' in reducing the amount. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite competent for any honorable member to move in the direction of reducing taxation, but it is not competent for him to submit a motion that will have the effect of increasing it. The amendment moved by the honorable member will have that latter effect, and, therefore, I am of opinion that it is not in order. </para>

At the present time certain taxation is imposed on entertainments, and the Treasurer proposes to reduce it. I am seeking to prevent that reduction, by not giving effect to it to the extent he desires. But I am not increasing present taxation ; I am reducing it. </para>

The honorable member for Dampier proposes to make every person who pays between1s. and 3s. for an entertainment, pay a tax; he brings all such persons within the ambit of taxation. </para>

                <para class="block">But when I expressed my opinion upon the proposal of the honorable member for Dampier I overlooked the fact that we are not now dealing with a Bill, but with a resolution in Committee of Ways and Means. T. am, therefore, obliged to recall a ruling which I gave in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, when the first Tariff was under consideration. Upon that occasion a non-official member of the Committee sought to increase a rate of duty, whereupon I ruled that at that stage, and at that stage only, it was competent for an honorable member to move in the direction indicated. I then gave my reasons for that ruling. A very long debate ensued, in which the greatest constitutionalists of that day, including the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Alfred.</inline> Deakin, and a number of others took part. After I had given my ruling, the matter was referred to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder for his final decision. He listened attentively to the debate which followed, and, in a very lengthy ruling, stated that, much against his wish, he had to confess that the ruling which I had given was in order, and that, therefore, it would stand. Having ruled in the way that I did upon that occasion, I must give a similar ruling now. </para>

                        <para>- The High Court may do so, but, until sufficient reason has been given for a departure from the ruling to which I have referred, the higher Court of Parliament should not act similarly. Consequently I now rule that the amendment of the honorable member for Dampier is in order, notwithstanding my opinion that it seeks to increase a rate or duty in opposition to the provisions contained in standing order 171. </para>

                <para class="block">This Bill imposes the rates of income tax for the financial year 1920-21. As I indicated in the Budget speech it is the intention of the Government to propose a general increase in the income tax rate of 5 per cent, on the rates of the preceding year. I find that that announcement is misapprehended in many quarters. People imagine that we are imposing a new rate of 5 per cent, on the total income of the people. That is not so. It is a 5 per cent, increase on the rates of last year; that is to say, a person who paid £100 in taxation last year will pay £105 under this proposal. The proposed rates represent an increase of 70§ per cent, over the rates originally fixed in 1915. It will be remembered that those rates were first increased by 25 per cent, in 1916, and in 1918 the rates then in force were further increased by 30 per cent. This increased the original 1915 rates by 62£ per cent. The present proposal means an increase of 5 per cent, on the 1915 rates, plus 5 per cent, on each of the latter increases mentioned. The first, second, and third schedules of the Bill are on the same basis as those of the original Act. It is not considered desirable to revise the schedules so as to embody the proposed rates of tax, as it would be necessary to so revise them as to set out the curves of the second and third degrees increased by that percentage. Such schedules would be complicated and cumbersome, and I therefore propose to leave the curves alone for the time being. </para>

                        <para>- No, and I am sure the honorable member does not. The better method for the present is to retain the original schedule, and. to provide in the substantive portion of the Act for the addition of certain specified percentages to the amounts as calculated under the schedules. Although the desirability of abolishing the schedules in the present form, with a view to the substitution of a simpler form, has been considered, it is not deemed desirable to alter the present method, pending the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, which is now beginning its investigations into the whole incidence of taxation, Federal and State. All previous collections of income tax have been made on the basis of those schedules, and, consequently, the additional amount of tax to be derived from' any percentage of increase can be calculated with accuracy. If these schedules were cast aside, and some simpler method were introduced, it could not be guaranteed with any degree of certainty that the incidence of the rates would remain the same, and that the desired amount of tax would be collected. A very difficult process of adjustment . would be entailed. The curves would require to be examined and mathematically drawn again; therefore, it is better, on the whole, to leave them alone for the present. In connexion with the 5 per cent, increases, one or two  little  anomalies occur. For instance, as regards the rate on cash' prizes in lotteries, the rate last year was 13 per cent., and as a 5 per cent, increase on this would give only a fractional increase on the  previous  rate, for simplicity of calculation the rate has been increased to 14 per cent. Similarly, in the case of companies, as the exact 5 per cent, increase would make the rate on undistributed profits of a company 2s. 7£d., it has been decided to fix the rate at 2s. 8d. This will make for simplicity of calculation in the assessment, and, in addition, the Department will get an extra £d. in the £1. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that we have not before us the Income Tax Assessment Act, which fixes the amount of general exemption and the amount to which a parent shall be entitled to deduct for each child. The Federal Act is much fairer in that respect than are some of the State Acts, which give no exemption for children. I have said on each occasion when the Income Tax Bill has been before Parliament during the last two or three years, that the exemption of £156 is not of anything like the assistance that it was when it was fixed in 1915. The (purchasing power of money to-day is much less; £3 per week then had probably a greater purchasing power than £4 has to-day. The amount of the general exemption should be increased. The increase in the rate of tax which the Treasurer is proposing is more than 5 per cent. If a man was paying £100 in income tax in 1915, he had to pay under the 1916 Act £125. Since then, we added the supertax of 30 per cent., not on to the £100, but on the £125. . This would represent £37, which, added to the £125, would bring the amount to over £162, really more than is estimated under this measure. The Taxation Department officials use a ready reckoner, which shows what each £1 of income is liable for under these curves. They merely added the 25 per cent., then the supertax of 30 per cent., and now they will add this proposed 5 per cent. increase. </para>

                        <para>- That would not be a bad idea. On page 20 of the Budget papers there is set out a table showing that individuals and companies with incomes of £1,000 and upwards paid over £9,000,000 out of a total of £10,800,000 income tax collected last year, but if we look at the percentage of total tax assessed, we find that the only substantial increase is in the case of incomes of £10,000 and upwards. Since 1915-16, they have increased 6.9 per cent. The percentage of total tax assessed has increased, in the case of incomes below this amount, from about½ per cent. to 1 per cent. I agree with the Treasurer that the Taxation Commission may be able to throw some light upon the incidence of taxation, but Parliament must take any responsibility for altering the exemption limit, and of deciding how the tax shall be borne by the community. When the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> was Acting Treasurer last year, in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> I brought under his notice the fact that, while an exemption is granted in the case of unmarried persons who may be supporting relatives, a married man who may also be contributing to the support of relatives does not enjoy this relief. This, I think, is a matter which might well be inquired into by the Taxation Commission. I have no objection to the Bill at the present time. I understand the Treasurer is anxious to get these taxation proposals through in order that they may become operative for the current year, but I think we ought to deal with the question of raising the exemption in the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that. The Commission will, no doubt, look into the incidence of the tax, but if we allow the present exemptions to stand the Commission will not be able to do anything in that direction. In sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of paragraph G, it is provided that the tax payable by any person with a gross income of not less than £100, or in the case of a person carrying on a business in Australia with an income from the business of not less than £100, after making allowable deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act, shall be taxed £1. But that does not affect the exemption of the ordinary citizen. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Queensland lottery, I understand, is called the Golden Casket. We have been told that the undistributed profits of companies will now be taxed to the extent of 14 per cent., the rate, I understand, being increased from 2s. 6d. to 2s.8d. I repeat that I am anxious to increase the exemption of ordinary incomes, which was fixed in 1915-16 at an average of £3 per week. The Treasurer, no doubt, is quite right in endeavouring to get his taxation proposals through, but we did not expect to deal with them to-day, and when we enter upon the discussion of the Budget the new imposts will be operative. </para>

                        <para>.- Since this is not a 'machinery Bill, I take it that the House will not be free to deal with various phases of the levying of income taxation, such as have already been indicated and discussed in this Chamber. The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> introduced a motion some months ago which was agreed to, I understand, without division, and which was to the effect that the  Government be recommended to introduce the principle of assessing the income of primary' producers upon an average taken over a period of five years. That is something different from any procedure hitherto followed with respect to taxation in Australia. The idea is that if primary producers suffer from a bad season they should be able to spread its effects over a five-year period ; or, that if there are four bad seasons among the five they should not be asked to pay income tax separately upon that prosperous fifth season, but should be assessed upon an average covering the whole period. I understand from -the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that this matter is among those submitted to the recently appointed Royal Commission. </para>

                            <para>- I take it, then, that we must wait until the Commission has presented its report. I do not know whether' the Commission will be free to report generally, also, upon the matter of exemption. I desire that the matter of exemption shall be reviewed, both in respect of married and single persons. The levying of a tax of  £1  upon people in receipt of incomes of  £100  will hit certain grades of school teachers very hard. Numbers to-day are receiving  £100,  and, what with the ever increasing cost of living, they are finding it more and. more difficult, year by year, to live. Their salaries have not increased proportionately to the cost of things, so that they will not be in a position to meet the demands of the Taxation Commissioner. It is my intention, in Committee; to move for the insertion of a new clause to raise the exemption not only in respect of single persons, but also with the object of making the general exemption higher than  £156.  Wages in various industries have been increased on account of the. cost of living, but men to-day are finding themselves worse off at  £200  per annum than when their pay was  £156,  prior to the war. <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> points out that the increase in the cost of most of our necessary staples of food and clothing amounts to nearly  100  per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not see- any reason for delaying the assessment of income tax over a five years' average until the report of the Taxation Royal Commission shall have been presented. Honorable members have' fully discussed and unanimously agreed' upon this method, and the Government must have accepted it as. a very strong recommendation. From the in.ception of 'the Country party, the principle has comprised one of the most important planks in our platform. Many other honorable members, beside those in the Country party, strongly favour the granting of this just and equitable concession. As for the argument that it has not hitherto been tried in Australia, we need not go further for  precedent than to examine the history  of  income taxation in Great Britain. Practically, since the levying of taxation on income was first adopted, the method of averaging on a basis of three years- has been practised. It has always been recognised in England, at any rate, that to levy separately, from year to year is grossly unjust to those engaged in somewhat hazardous and precarious pursuits. Seeing that the system has been long tried, and is unquestionably accepted in the Mother Country, where seasons are not so precarious as in Australia, it is only right that the Commonwealth Government should adopt a like procedure. However much seasonal conditions may vary in Great Britain, the variation in Australia is considerably more marked, and the difficulties of those engaged in the primary and secondary industries - which are closely allied to our primary industries - are immensely greater than in the Old Country. 1 do not intend to labour the question; but I ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> even if an amendment be not moved when the Bill is in Committee, to give the House some assurance that this matter will be taken into full and adequate consideration, and that an opportunity will be given to enable this House to come to a decision. I hope it is not the intention of the Government, upon this point at all events, to wait until the whole matter has been threshed out by a Royal Commission. The question at issue is of vital importance to those engaged in country districts, and particularly those connected with our , primary industries. Our primary producers are unanimously in favour of the proposal, and I feel so strongly on the subject that I. again ask the Treasurer to give the House some assurance that the Government will not wait until the report of the Royal Commission is furnished before taking action, but that he will make an endeavour to bring the change into operation as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>. - I was pleased to have the opportunity a few months ago of submitting a motion to this House dealing with the proposal to base the incomes of primary producers on returns over a five-year, instead of a one-year, period, as has been the custom in the past. When the motion was before the House the then Treasurer promised that the question would be referred to a Royal Commission, which was to be appointed to go thoroughly into the question of taxation, and, personally, I  have every confidence that that will be done. I feel certain that it would be practically impossible to immediately bring this reform, which is generally regarded as a very necessary one, about. I can see that it will take considerable time before it can be successfully brought into operation, and it is, therefore, likely that some time must elapse before a scheme that will be generally acceptable can be introduced. I cannot think that the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> is really in earnest when he asks the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to give a definite promise to introduce the reform forthwith. </para>

                            <para>.- I am not quite sure of the usual procedure when Bills of this character are introduced. I believe, however, that it is customary for the Government to place upon the notice-paper the business to be brought forward during the day so that  honorable members may have an opportunity of collecting -any information they may desire to enable them to properly debate the questions before the House It is somewhat difficult when important measures are brought forward without the slightest notification. </para>

                    <para>It was my intention to deal with the question of exemptions, which has already been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, but I can see that there is no opportunity to do so on this occasion. I may say, however, that I am a great believer in every one paying something, however small, in the form of direct taxation, because it helps people to become better citizens and to realize their responsibilities when selecting their political representatives. In view of the great increase in the cost of living I think it would be wise for the Government to give consideration to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition, but the better way would be to relieve   a  taxpayer according to the family he has to support, instead of increasing the exemption. If such a proposal were submitted to the House it would have my support. Some time ago various matters were brought before the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and a Royal Commission has been appointed to make full inquiries. I was out of the Chamber when the Treasurer delivered his speech, and I would, therefore, like to ascertain whether we are likely to have the report of that Commission during the present, session, and whether it will be possible to give effect to its recommendations if the Government approve of them. </para>

                            <para>- The matter is of great importance, and I have received communications from all parts of the country. Here is one from the Producers Association's Central Council of New South Wales, which reads - </para>

                    <para>For some years past, it has been very apparent that the system of taxing the primary producers upon the results of each individual year's operations has proved most inequitable and unfair owing to the extreme fluctuations that come from seasonal conditions. One year the taxpayer has to pay upon a large profit, am', the next year lie may have a huge loss owing to drought, and it may take him years to recover his position; but, except that lie pays no tax on the year of his extreme loss, he gets no other relief, for, as soon as he can again show <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> profit over working expenses, the Taxation Department is down upon him again, though his previous year's loss may have only been covered in a small degree. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is apparent to every man who goes on the land. Periods of severe drought are usually followed by exceptionally heavy rains and floods, and it often happens that thousands of head of stock are destroyed. Many poor devils who have been contending against drought for years lose their stock when heavy rains fall, and are frequently called upon to pay taxation upon the value of the stock they have lost. Surely there" is something grossly unfair which compels these people to pay taxation upon the value of stock which they have lost, after having spent considerable money in an endeavour to keep them alive. In Great Britain . the income of a primary producer is averaged over a period of three or five years. </para>

                            <para>- Then I think the same principle' should apply in Australia. We have passed some very unfair taxation proposals in this Chamber, and I am never likely to forget the amendment of the war-time profits tax, brought forward by the late Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> Any one who realizes the huge expanse of territory we have in our back country, and who knows the vicissitudes and hardships experienced by many of our primary producers, can realize how unfairly the wartime profits tax ha* affected many of. them. They have had to contend against difficulties and dangers year in and year out, and surely, when it comes to a question of taxation, they are worthy of some consideration. I have, on previous occasions, referred to a man who had invested £17;000 in the back country, and who, for seven years prior to the war, showed a loss. In the first year after the war he showed a profit of £1,200, and in the next year £4,800, but after paying land tax and income tax on that £4,800, which was a book profit only, as he might lose the whole of it the next year, he was asked to contribute £2,750 as a war-time profits tax. On the other hand, a man may remain in the city and place a similar amount of capital out on mortgage, which would give him an assured income without the slightest risk. The man on the land had to pay £2,750 on an income of £4,800, but the man who had money out on mortgage would not have to contribute a single penny, even if he in the same period earned £50,000 or more as a commission agent, because he made his income with his brains. That is a grave reflection on the laws of this country, and such a provision is grossly unfair. I have also heard of another man who, in 1911, showed a loss, of £840: in 1912 a loss of £623; in 1913 a loss of £126; in 1914 a profit of £283, and in 1915 a profit of £158. In 1916 he made a loss of £33. He had a large amount of capital invested, and after battling in the bush, fighting against nature for all these years, he showed a net loss of £1,181 up to the 30th June, 1916. For the year 1916-17 he showed a book profit of £3,035, and for , the year 1917-18 a book profit of £2,506. In respect of those two years, after paying land and income tax, he was called upon to pay £1,703 by way <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> war-time profits taxation. In other words, this man, allowing for his losses, was asked to pay to the Commonwealth by way of taxation 70 per cent. of his actual income. No one will say that that is fair. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Unfortunately, while it was agreed that their war-time profits taxation should be based on their average profits for six years prior to the war, the House refused to insert in the original Bill a clause suggested by me under which the pastoralists would have been allowed 10 per cent. on their capital, and would have been taxed on all income in excess of that amount. I should have been satisfied with such a provision. </para>

                    <para>I mention these matters, not because they actually come within the scope of the Bill before us, but to show how necessary it is that the Government should review as quickly as possible their whole system of taxation. Every honorable member, no matter on what side of the House he sits, desires that something like fair play shall be meted out to all sections of the community. Income tax based on book profits may be all very well in the case of the ordinary business man, who is permitted to make a reduction in respect of bad debts, and whose stock is such that it will be of value in the succeeding year; but it is not applicable to those engaged in primary pursuits. It may not work any serious injustice in the case of pastoralists in Victoria, where a drought rarely occurs, but it is wholly unjust in the case of men who take up country that is subject to periodical droughts. It should be our object to help and encourage such people. The more wealth they can produce, the better for the country. The man who can make huge profits should certainly be compelled to pay income tax upon them, but the taxation should be based, not upon his book profits, but upon his actual earning?, and when the opportunity arrives I shall strongly press for an amendment in this direction. </para>
                    <para>Here is yet another fallacy associated with the Income Tax Department. The taxation authorities require of every grazier a complete balance-sheet, and they value every lamb and calf produced upon his property and tax him accordingly, although he may not have realized upon them. </para>

                            <para>-The valuation varies j it is less in the north than it is in the south. I know of a man who bought a station in the northern part of Western Australia, on which there were a number of cattle. Desiring to convert it into a sheep-station, he sent 400 head of cattle down south to Cue. I dare say that those cattle in ordinary circumstances would have been worth from £12 to £15 per head, but after allowing for the cost of droving, selling, and losses <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> - owing to the drought there was lack, of water on the route, and nearly every head of cattle was lost - the owner of this station made an actual loss of £120 on the sale, when he lost all his cattle, and £120 in addition. Extreme difficulty was experienced in inducing the Taxation Department to believe that loss .came within the scope of the section iri the Act which provides for deductions in . respect of losses due to drought. It was said that the drought had not occurred on the station property, and that, therefore, the1 case did not come within the meaning of the Act. I cite this case with the object of emphasizing the point that a man should be  compelled  to pay income tax1, only upon the1 profits actually realized by him. Sooner or later a grazier must realize upon his- stock, and when he does - when he secures payment- he should be taxed. Honorable members would not think of paying taxation in respect of salary which they had been promised but had not received. In the case of the primary producer income tax should be levied on the average basis, and should be collected only in respect of profits actually made. </para>

                    <para>Another point is that the income tax assessment  forms  should be simplified. It ought to be possible for the Department to prepare a form compelling taxpayers to furnish all the information required, and yet so simply framed that the average man would be able to fill it in without having to seek the assistance of agents. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has promised that the Taxation Commission will be asked to make recommendations for the simplification of income tax forms, and I hope that when those recommendations are made they will receive treatment different from that meted out to those previously made in connexion with other taxation proposals. Some time ago a Conference of the Federal and State Commissioners of Taxation was held, and one of the most important decisions arrived at. was that the profits of companies should be taxed at their, source. In other words, it was decided that companies should be compelled to pay income tax on all profits that were apportioned to shareholders. Had that recommendation been adopted, the Department would have received, from companies every penny payable by way of income tax on their dividends. At the present time they collect the tax from . the individual shareholders who receive the dividends. Some people who receive only small dividends might forget to include them in their returns. </para>

                            <para>- That matter was discussed and threshed out on a previous occasion. The companies should, be compelled to pay the taxation on the basis laid down by the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under the system recommended, if a man had an income of £1,000 per year, one-half of which was derived from dividends, on which, let us say, ls. 6d. in the £1 had been paid by way of income tax, whereas the rate of tax on the total income of £1,000 was 2s. in the £1, the Department would surcharge him to the extent of 6d. in the £1 in respect of the dividends amounting to £500, on which ls. 6d. in the £1 had been paid by the company from which they had been received. On the other hand, it would make a rebate where the amount paid was in excess of the rate in respect of which the taxpayer was liable. </para>

                    <para>Another reform that is urgently needed is the institution of one collecting authority and one form of taxation forCommonwealth, State, and municipal land taxation. Just as many people think that on applying to be enrolled for a State electorate they will also be enrolled for a Federal electorate, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> so many people are greatly confused by the varying forms of Federal and State land taxation. We should endeavour to adopt as quickly as possible a uniform system that would give relief to the taxpayers, and earn for us their gratitude and respect. Under the present system we have a conglomeration of returns which have to be sent in to the Federal and State authorities, and huge expense is unnecessarily incurred in their printing, distribution, collection, and examination. I believe that the additional labour, cost of printing, and loss of time involved must represent something like £750,000 per annum. I hope we shall be able to obtain from the Treasurer an announcement that he will make a special effort to bring the States into complete harmony with us in this regard, and that we shall have very soon a measure providing for simplicity of taxation forms and one collecting agency for the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                        <para>. - I am extremely disappointed that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> in submitting this Bill, has made no provision for increasing the amount exempted from income tax. The sovereign of 1911 is now worth no more than about 13s., but the present high cost of living has not been taken into consideration as it ought to have been. I think that some relief should be given to taxpayers by the increase of the amount exempted from taxation to more than £156. </para>

So far as I can learn, the Basic Wage Commission will shortly recommend a basic wage of £6 per week, and I have no doubt that its decision will be based upon the evidence collected by it. </para>

                            <para>- My complaint is that no allowance has been made for the depreciation in the purchasing power of the sovereign, and it is because of that depreciation and because wages have not increased in anything like the same ratio as the cost of living, which will be proved conclusively when the Basic Wage Commission issues its report, that we believe that the amount exempted from income tax should be increased. I intend when the Bill is in Committee to move to increase the exemption to £200, and I hope that the Treasurer will be satisfied with that proposal. </para>

It is undoubted that a majority of the members of this House are in favour of the adoption of that method of assessing such incomes, and the Treasurer should meet the wish in that regard that has been expressed. In some parts of New South Wales, in 1915, people had a good year, but in 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1919 the residents of those parts experienced bad years. They paid on their incomes in 1915, and in some cases they had a good season in 1916, and paid on their incomes during that year. At the present time they are mortgaged up to the hilt, and I have had applications from graziers, selectors, and farmers to obtain for them time within which to pay their taxation. They have had to spend the incomes of good years in the purchase of fodder to carry them over bad years. They are now head over heels in debt, and although they will in all probability have a splendid season this year, all that they will make will have to go to pay off debts contracted during the last three or four years. In the circumstances, it is, I think, clear that the average income over a period of five years is the fairest basis of assessment for taxation. </para>

                    <para>On the question of the simplification of the income tax schedules, I understand that a new form of schedule has been drafted and has been submitted to the State Governments. It is to be hoped that they will agree to adopt the common form proposed, and that in future the Commonwealth will be the only authority collecting this taxation. The simplification of the schedule is highly desirable, especially in the interests of those who do not reside in the towns, where accountants may be employed to assist taxpayers in filling up their schedules. I believe that the Government should take early steps to raise the exemption to £200, though, personally, I should like to see it raised to £250. </para>

I urge upon the Government the desirability of adopting the five years' average in assessing the primary producer's income, the increase of the exemption to £200 or £250, and some expedition in the adoption of the new method of taxation, and of one form of income tax schedule for Commonwealth and State. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with what has been said as to the necessity for greater simplicity in the form of the income tax schedule. I go further than some honorable members, and urge that there should be infinitely greater simplicity in the method adopted for arriving at the amount of tax to be paid in respect of any income. I venture to say that there is not an honorable member present who has the remotest idea of what is meant by the mathematical conundrum set forth in the schedule to this Bill. Indeed, the Treasurer has no idea what it means. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that in our present system there are many anomalies which ought to be adjusted, and it is with a view to the rectification of these anomalies that the Commission  has been appointed. Originally, the Wartime Profits Tax Bill introduced in this House contained a clause providing for the averaging of profits and losses over a period of years, but that provision was deliberately omitted from two subsequent measures of the same kind which were introduced. On two occasions I fought strongly for the reintroduction of that provision, but it was resisted by the Government of the day, because, it was said, it would involve a dislocation of the finances. It was of no use whatever to direct attention to the fact that the finances of the Mother Country were colossal as compared to those of this small community, and my request for the reintroduction of the provision I have referred to was successfully resisted. The result has been to bring about anomalies which have worked gross injustice. </para>

                    <para>For one or two years, I also strongly urged greater consideration for the system of taxation at the source, a system which is adopted in the Mother Country, in the State of Victoria, and, to the best of my knowledge, also in the State of New South Wales. There is much to recommend this system . of taxation. This is a matter which received , very close attention from the expert Commission in the Mother Country to which I have referred. I read a portion of the report of that Commission, and particularly that portion- dealing with taxation at the source. The Commission, after taking a great 'volume of evidence on the- subject, and' assessing the value of that evidence, came ito the conclusion that taxation at the source was&gt; the correct system to adopt',, as it was just and fair: The system: which obtains, in Australia received' full consideration; but, after a thorough investigation of the whole subject by this expert Commission, they wound up their report by recommending , that the system of taxation at the source, which had obtained in the Mother Country, should be continued. That system is deserving of consideration by the Taxation Commission appointed here, and I hope it will receive it.- The objection urged to it here is- that we have a. graduated tax,, with which the system of taxation at the source is inconsistent. Under our system a company pays dividends in cash in the ordinary way, or bonus shares, and. so soon as the cash or shares are received by the taxpayer they are taxed in his hands. They are not taxed in the hands of the company, but only when they are distributed to the shareholders. In that way the income of the shareholder is assessed, and is taxed according to the graduated scale. I submit that taxation at the source is quite consistent with the system of graduated taxation, because it would be quite possible to give credit for the amount paid by the company on behalf of each taxpayer receiving dividends. I hope that this phase of the question will also receive consideration. </para>
                    <para>As to the Bill before us, the necessity for this taxation is, no doubt, a cause of deep disappointment and regret to all of us, and of bitter resentment to a great many, because it is, to some extent, brought about by the waste and extravagance of the Government in other directions. However, there appears to 'be no doubt that the majority of honorable members are determined to pass it, so we must submit to the inevitable. But what is the position? Upon the original tax we added 25 per cent. Then we proceeded to add another 30 per cent.,, and then a super tax of 5 per cent. To-day it is proposed to add still another 5 per cent. That is to say, on to the original tax 70 per cent, will have been added. When we were told that incomes were to be taxed by a super tax of 5 per cent., we innocently believed that it was a tax merely on the original income. But such is not the case. Much more than 5 per cent, is to be added to the income tax payable in order to produce the £600,0.00 the Treasurer requires. It is practically a tax added to a tax already added to and to a super-tax previously imposed. </para>

                            <para>- That is the position. The general idea was that it was merely to be 5 per cent, on the original income tax. This increase of 70 per cent, on the original tax is most regrettable, but I suppose that we must  accept it for the present. Indeed, we have no alternative, but I do so distinctly under strong protest. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not concerned so much about the 5 per cent, which is to be added to "the income tax. To my mind, the increase is too small in the case of large incomes, which, I think, ought to pay an additional 20 per cent., so that wealth may be called upon to do something which we were told it- was to do, and which it ought to have done, in order to help to' meet the national obligations. I rise to say a word or two upon the penny wise and pound foolish principle of maintaining the flat rate of £1 on all wage-earners with an income of £100, and keeping the exemption at £156, with £26 for each child. The burden which this tax represents to-day, with the present high cost of living, and the economic position of the workers, is much greater than a 20 per cent, increase would re-' present on large incomes. The fundamental principle of income taxation is that each man should pay according to his income, the individual with the biggest income paying the biggest tax; but that principle does not apply to-day. The exemption should be raised to £250, and if it were so graduated that the man with a wife and three or four children could be exempted up to £300, it would be little enough. The deduction of £26 allowable for each child is too small, and should be increased to £50, which would only make it equal to the exemption allowed by the New South Wales State Act. </para>

                            <para>- Early in this Parliament we were told that wealth would be made to pay a bigger burden of taxation, and that stern measures were to be taken against profiteers - in fact, they were to be shot - but now we find that the bullet aimed at the profiteers is merely a 5 per cent, increased tax on big incomes, which are increasing all the time. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert .Best)</inline> hopes that a Royal Commission will take the incidence of this taxation into its consideration. But that is the trouble with the Federal Parliament to-day. It decides nothing. It is an insult to the intelligence and standing of this House that anything intricate, and requiring the exercise of brain-power, has to be solved by a Royal Commission, appointed at great expense to the country, the Government assuming no responsibility in any direction. Half the time the people do not realize that they are being put to this extra expense, and that the Government are shelving their responsibility in this way. I have already said that ' the fundamental principle of the income tax is that a man ought to pay according to his income, but the primary producer of Australia is in a unique position as compared with persons on fixed salaries or in business. Industrial troubles may dislocate a business undertaking for a few weeks, but it is very seldom affected by such things as floods, droughts, or bush fires. A commercial man's income may fluctuate a little, but, as a rule, it is fairly steady, and one year'3 return is a. fair criterion of what he will receive year in year out, making allowance, of course, for any extensions. On the other hand, the farmer may devote to his work the highest intelligence and the greatest industry possible, and he may slave, morning, noon, and night, but if the rain does not fall, he has no crop, and if it falls too heavily he may lose the result of all his labour through rust. He may make £2,000 in one year, ' and may lose £1,500 in the next year. For two years he may do well, but for the following three years he may be crucified and practically compelled to leave his farm. Is it right to make him pay income tax on £2,000 for one year, when he may suffer a loss of £1,500 in the next year? </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and I go so far as to say that the primary producer who has enjoyed a large income over five years is entitled to pay an extra 20 per cent. I would say that on any platform. I believe that the old law in New South Wales permitted any person who suffered a loss in one year to set it off against another year's profits. </para>

                        <para>.- I am in agreement with the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and others who preceded him, that it would be fairer to relieve a man according to the number of his dependants, rather than exempt the man with the fixed income of £150 a year or less. Every man should pay income tax according to his ability to pay it, and there is no reason why a; person with an income of £150 should not be called upon to pay his proper share of the taxation; but when we realize that there are only 371,580 individuals in the Commonwealth who pay income tax - that is, one out of every fourteen persons - it must be admitted that there are many persons with incomes over £150 who are not paying income tax. It may be that many thousands of people are not rendering returns, or that because the exemptions already provided for are so generous they are not called upon to pay the tax. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to enlarge upon what has been said by honorable members with regard to the proposed system of assessing incomes over a period of years. Honorable members generally agree that it is the most equitable method to adopt, and I see no reason why it should not apply to business men as well as to farmers. No doubt it is the only just method of assessing a farmer's income. The primary producer appears to have a lot of friends in this Chamber. I am extremely pleased that he has so many, and for that reason all his troubles should be put right in the very near future. I know only too well that the farmer, at the present time, pays taxes several times over, whereas the man in business or the man who derives his income from mortagages, dividends, or Government securities pays only once. There certainly should be a readjustment of the principles of taxation, but I am afraid we are not going to derive much benefit from the report of the Commission which is about to sit and decide as to the best or fairest method of applying taxation. We have had a number of Commissions, but my experience is that we have not acted upon many of their reports so far. There is not much doubt in any honorable member's mind as to the most fair and equitable way of adjusting taxation. We do not need a Commission to tell us that. I am afraid it is not a question of what is most fair and equitable, but rather a question of expediency with the Government when they have to decide who shall pay the taxes. We had an example of that this afternoon. There is not the least doubt that the reason why the Government decided to exempt amusements, such as picture shows and theatres, from the entertainments tax was" that many hundreds of thousands or people would benefit, and that, therefore, the move would be very popular, as compared with the few people that attend athletic sports, cricket matches, and other such gatherings, and who will still have to pay the tax even on 6d. tickets, while tickets up to 3s. at picture shows and theatres will be exempt. I am, therefore, very much afraid that any inquiry we may have, or any report that the Commission may make, will lead us very little further than we are at present. I am not in favour of increased taxation at the present time. I can see no necessity for it. What we want is economy in administration. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> in his closing remarks said that the Government was guilty of great waste  and extravagance. He  was opposed to the increase in the income tax, but was afraid that we should have to put up with it for the time being. I cannot view the matter in that way. I will not use the words " waste " and " extravagance," but I am convinced that when we can spend money as we are proposing to do, on such enterprises as were passed last week - without mentioning any names - it is not necessary to impose increased taxation to fulfil those so-called obligations. For these reasons I am compelled to oppose the increase in the income tax by 5 per cent, at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- A stopgap due to the great appetite of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> for coin. All legislation seems to be of a stop-gap character at present, and the Income Tax Bill does not differ from other legislation in that respect. Anything that takes money out of one's pocket is unpalatable, but what I object to is that we carry on week after week, month after month, and year after year in this manner. Why cannot we have a sensible proposal for income taxation? We have a Treasurer of great experience, politically and in every other way, in Charge of the exchequer, and yet he cannot tell us what our income tax system means. Not one member in this Chamber can explain it. </para>

The Government are appointing a Commission, which, after all, can give us no new information, although we are told that the British Income Tax Commission collected useful information and made very valuable suggestions. We have had Commission after Commission at considerable expense, but nothing is done with -their reports, and I often wonder where they go. The report of this Commission will meet the same fate, no matter what they do. We have all the information, and if we have not we have officers who ought to be able to give it to us. If they cannot, they are not fit for their posts. </para>

                            <para>- It would be, but it would be still better for the Treasurer to sit round a table with the officers of the Taxation Department, so that together they might frame a system that the House could understand, and that would be acceptable to the people of Australia. Everybody rails at the officers. That is an unfair method of doing things; for, after all, the officers have a very ticklish and responsible position, requiring ability and courage. Th«y have to analyze very difficult accounts. The information they receive is very confidential, and they know everybody's affairs. I doubt if many of them could tell us offhand what the curve business means. The officers do remarkably well. That is my experience, at any rate, and the absolute faith that the people have in them is complimentary and striking. We had a practical Committee of the officers of the Federal and State Departments meeting in conference. That was much better than the proposed Royal Commission. They not only went into these questions, but practically agreed on a line of policy, and if my memory serves me right, a Bill was actually prepared. What has become of it? Has it gone to the limbo where all these reports go? Nothing has been done. One of the things they suggested was that amalgamation should take place. What has become of their suggestions? </para>

                            <para>- I believe the trouble is that the States say they ought to collect the whole lot, because they can do the work better and cheaper than the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Department has to collect the entertainments tax, and a number of other taxes which cost a good deal of money to bring in, but the States do not take that fact into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear it. It may be simple to the right honorable gentleman, but before he can elucidate the point, he will probably get the information from the very officers who, in my opinion, ought to be able to give it direct to the House. Why should we not have the information given to us when a Bill like this is brought down ? There are many things I should like to do in this Bill. x but what is the use of putting a spoke in here and a spoke in there, seeing that, after all, the Bill is a stop-gap ? It is of no use attempting to put in any of the different proposals which -have been made to-night, some of which I am in favour of. I represent a community of farmers and graziers, and I maintain that the farmers and graziers are entitled to an average system of incomes, but why should not the business men have it too? </para>

                            <para>- A system of averages has been found to be the best in countries which have had a long experience of income taxation. We are only novices at it. Why not apply the average system to all men who have to pay income tax? The exemption has been spoken of, but the difficulty there is that it opens the door to let a number of people out. According to statistics, and the figures quoted by the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Mr. Pell),</inline> a lot of people do not pay income tax, but every day in the papers we see that the officers are on their tracks. Fines of £20, £50, and £100 are recorded, but the whole system is unsatisfactory. I believe the income tax is the fairest of all taxes.  We cannot have anything fairer, so long as its incidence is right, and so long as we have a decent Act. A better Bill than this could be framed and put into force by schoolboys, to say nothing of a Parliament. Why not have common-sense legislation on an. equitable basis that we can understand ? I am in favour of having one Income Tax Department, and that should bc the Federal. After all, we know the time is coming when these duplications will have to cease. What a retrograde step it would be to go back to the rule of the States! The change must come, because we all know that we cannot go on indefinitely with seven different Governments, and seven different Governors. It is only a. question of time. Why cannot 'we adopt the best of the seven systems ? Instead of bringing in this stop-gap legislation, why did not the Treasurer have the courage to say to his officers, " We are going to alter the income tax system. Let us bring down a Bill on proper lines that the people and. Parliament can understand, and that I myself can understand and explain"? </para>

I am- in the unfortunate position of being obliged to vote for this Bill to support the Government. They are on the right" track, because they want more money. We must pay what we owe, and the income tax is a good way to obtain a large part of what we need. The people are pleased that the increase was only 5 per cent. Most of them expected 10 per cent, at least, and it was a 'pleasant surprise to many business men and others that I have spoken to to find the increase so moderate. I guarantee that the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West),</inline> who, we know, is a financial expert, cannot explain the curve system . to me.

Those with big incomes should be made to pay; and when we get above the living line, what does it matter at what rate the income tax is levied if the taxation is justified? The time has arrived when all our taxation should be put on a fair basis. At present, the principles of our income taxation are neither satisfactory nor understandable, and everybody laughs at the whole thing. </para>

As I say, I am in the unfortunate position of having to vote for this stop-gap measure? I believe we could alter it as to make it more acceptable, but to deal with the question of taxation in a piecemeal way is hopeless. We may have some result from the Commission, though I am afraid it will meet the same fate as other Commissions. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> says that no one is satisfied with our income tax system; but did any one ever know a taxpayer who was satisfied ? It is necessary to introduce a Bill of this character every year in order that the income tax may be collected, hence the measure before us. I must say, however, that I do not think the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has taken much interest in the question of taxation. He knew that he had to do something, and he has introduced a measure which he thinks will prove plausible to some people at any rate, but the result can only be to create widespread discontent. If the Treasurer were really in earnest, he would make himself a student of taxation {principles, and adopt the best means of removing the incubus on Australia. There is one point to which I would like to refer, namely, the tax imposed on the incomes of public companies. Some years ago there was some trouble in Sydney in connexion with this matter, and it was decided that public companies should pay at the rate of 2s. 6d. on all undistributed profits. My opinion is that the late Commissioner, who was then in. office, had no idea of the extent to which  proprietary and part proprietary businesses were being turned into public companies in order to take advantage of that rate of 2s. 6d. What these companies are doing is to take the undistributed profit of one year, and with it to water their  capital,  and this to their great pecuniary advantage. So widespread is this practice that I doubt whether there is one company which has not doubled its capital, and which should pay a much larger rate than 2s. 6d. On more than one occasion I have suggested that in this regard we should follow the example set by Great Britain when large sums of loan money were in circulation during the war. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member who has just interjected has advocated one uniform system of collecting this taxation, and that suggestion has been made frequently. It has not been acted upon simply because during the last few years we have had no one in the position of Treasurer strong-minded or courageous enough to deal with the matter; indeed, if there had been a Treasurer desirous of doing so, he would not have obtained the support of his Government. In order to have one uniform system' we must either take away from- the States the right of direct taxation, or out of the income tax collected return to each State a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount. This is an arrangement that could be easily made, with the result of rendering our taxation much more equitable than at present. </para>

                            <para>- I will if I have the opportunity. We must remember that, although this is a National Parliament, there are many honorable members who have not sufficient national spirit to fight the State-righters in the State Parliaments, and who are willing to do an injustice to the people of Australia in order to keep a Nationalist Government in power. When an appeal was made to the country in 1910, there was a desire on the part of the Fisher Government and the party behind it to get rid of the " Braddon Blot," which had been inserted in our Constitution in the first instance merely as a temporary expedient. The late Lord Forrest favoured achieving this end by agreeing to refund to the States 25s. per head out of our Customs and Excise duties in perpetuity, whereas the Fisher Government desired to limit that payment to a period of ten years, and this was approved at the elections. At a later stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> who was then Treasurer in the present Government, attended a Conference of State Premiers, at which he proposed that the States should be annually deprived of 2s. 6d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> until the amount being paid at present had entirely disappeared. I was absolutely convinced of the late Treasurer's sincerity in this matter, and was firmly of opinion that his proposal would have been adopted. But the Government had not the courage of their convictions, and just before the last election, the 'Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> publicly announced that he was not in agreement with his own Treasurer upon this matter. Consequently the reduction of 2s. 6d. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> did not materialize. My own idea is that the National Government should have exclusive control . of the revenue derived from indirect taxation in the form of Customs and Excise duties. But nobody upon the Treasury benches has the courage to give effect to that programme. Ministers think more of their political skins than they do of the adoption of right principles. </para>

                    <para>To-night, my Leader, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> invited our attention to the question of exemptions'. But his appeal fell upon deaf ears. Very few members indeed exhibited the slightest interest in his remarks. Most of them walked out of the chamber, whilst the Treasurer, with a bland smile, endeavoured to induce us to pass the Bill. The honorable member for Yarra stressed what must be perfectly obvious to every man who, gives the matter a moment's consideration, namely, that if £156 was a fair general exemption in 1911, and if £13 was a proper deduction to allow for children under the age of sixteen years, those amounts need to be considerably increased to-day owing to the greatly reduced purchasing power of the sovereign. I need hardly remind honorable members that Great Britain has adopted exemptions very much larger than are our own. There this question has been very closely investigated by a Royal Commission, which in its report says - </para>

                        <para class="block">No wholly earned income will be charged at more than half the standard rate of tax if it does not exceed -  £400  in the case of a bachelor.  £500 in the case of a married couple with  out children.  £600  in the case of a married couple with three children. </para>
                        <para class="block">No wholly invested income will pay tax if it does not exceed -  £135  in the case of a bachelor  £235 in the case of a married couple with  out children.  £315  in the case of a married couple with three children. </para>

                        <para class="block">Then, examples are given as to how these payments pan out. That Commission was composed of men who possess an intimate knowledge of income tax matters - a much greater knowledge than we can possibly possess, seeing that the first British income tax was imposed as far back as 1842. </para>
                        <para>The income tax was originally imposed in Great Britain as a war tax, and, although it has never been entirely repealed, it has been altered from time to time to meet the circumstances of the Treasury. At times the rate of tax was small; at other times, when the need for revenue was greater, as for instance during the period of the Boer War, a considerable sum was raised by this means, of paying the cost of the war. The Government would be justified in increasing the exemption. Unfortunately, the matter of imposing taxation is entirely within the hands of the Government. That is an old constitutional practice, established no doubt as a safeguard against any crank reducing the amount of tax, and thus leaving the Government with insufficient funds with which to carry on the administration. A wise Government, however, will raise only sufficient money as is necessary to carry on the affairs of State. A Government which raises more money than is necessary shows that it does not understand the principles of finance, because it is extracting more money from the people, byway of taxation, than is justified. That policy is not conducive to the well-being of the country. </para>
                        <para>For some time past honorable members have been asking the Treasurer to explain the curves of the second and third degrees. These curves were brought under the notice of the British Taxation Commission, and also an American Commission. Both admitted that this is the most just system of levying taxation. Under the system first adopted by this Parliament, and still in operation in the States, a man is taxed, say, eightpence in the £1 on an income of £700, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Ms income</inline> is a few pounds in excess of that amount the rate of tax is increased a penny. That system is not just. The British Commission admitted that, although the curves were not understood by the ordinary citizen they worked out with absolute accuracy and justice to the taxpayer. They represent the most equitable system of arriving at the proper amount of taxation to be paid by each individual. </para>
                        <para>Reverting to the matter of exemptions. In the United States there is a general exemption of £500. On incomes from £500 to £1,000 the rate is increased on. a gradual incline. On incomes above £1,000 the incline becomes steeper, and on incomes above £5,000 the rates rise very suddenly. That is a good way of levying taxation. The citizen should be allowed an income free from taxation - except Customs and Excise duties - sufficient to buy for himself and family the necessaries of life. I notice that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> told a deputation, a few days ago, that the present tariff is designed for revenue-producing purposes rather than as a protective medium. That affords me a further justification for endeavouring to get the amount of exemption increased. </para>
