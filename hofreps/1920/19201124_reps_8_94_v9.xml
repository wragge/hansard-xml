                        <para>- On the 14th October I asked the Prime Minister the following question :  - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>What action the Government intend to take to compensate ex-Gunner Yates for the undeserved slur cast on his character and military record by the misleading answer given in this House by the Acting Minister for Defence, and to reimburse him any expenses that he may have been put to in connexion with the recent inquiry? </para>
                    <para class="block">To that the right honorable gentleman replied that he would take the matter into consideration after conferring with the Minister for Defence and the Assistant Minister for Defence. Last week I asked the Assistant Minister for Defence a question on the subject, and he replied that there had been passed for payment to ex-Gunner Yates a certain amount for out-of-pocket expenses. I ask the honorable gentleman now whether he considers that that amount is sufficient compensation for the slur that was cast on the character of ex-Gunner Yates, it being alleged that he had not even seen the fighting line, and for the suffering that his family was put to in connexion with the matter. Will the Government consider these things with a view to granting some compensation to ex-Gunner Yates? </para>

                            <para>- That is all that ex-Gunner Yates asked for, and I do not consider that the Government is under any obligation to pay him anything more. If it had not been for me, I do not think there could have been an inquiry into his conduct, and the present suggestion seems to me like flogging a willing horse. Immediately I saw that a mistake had been made,I promised a full inquiry. </para>

                            <para>-Then may I explain that an agreement was entered into to the effect that lands acquired by the States in connexion with the Murray Waters scheme should be taken as at their value on 4th July, 1921. That agreement was arrived at by the Premiers' Conference, and has been 'broken. Yesterday the Minister told, me that the questions I asked had been answered before, but one of them certainly has not been, answered, and I should like the Minister to throw some light on the subject with which it deals, because a good deal of feeling is being created. I wish to know what were the circumstances that led to the cancellation of the agreement? </para>

What happened at the Premiers' (Conference was that certain resolutions were passed, which were to form the basis of an agreement, but they were subsequently revised, and the provision to which the honorable member has referred was not embodied in the agreement. However, I shall explain the matter fully when dealing with the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- This matter is of such striking importance that I consider it my duty to bring the particulars before honorable members. The Commonwealth has a protective policy. I purpose to endeavour to show how that policy is undermined. The citizens of Australia, have endowed the Treasury with a large sum of money in order to -settle returned soldiers upon the land ; and it is on behalf of the citizens, and also in the interests of the soldiers themselves and of the manufacturers of Australia, that I have introduced my motion. Following a meeting of manufacturers,, a letter was sent to the Lands Department of Victoria. The communication which I shall quote is an answer to the manufacturers' request for permission to scan periodically the list of names of successful soldier applicants. Before reading the epistle I desire to remind honorable members that the subject is not wholly a Federal one. Citizens of the Commonwealth find the whole of the money for soldier settlement on the land, but the policy itself is linked up between the States and the Federation. It is " up to " the Government to demand that the manufacturers of Australia shall have a fair show. The latter, in making their request to the State Department, sought no favoritism, but merely desired that they should be told the names pf soldier applicants whose claims had been successful. The reply was as' follows : - </para>

                    <para>The matter was considered by my Committee at its last meeting. In view of the fact that the Department has appointed men to advise each soldier in regard to the selection of machinery, stock, &amp;c, and of the difficulties involved in allowing access by representatives of business firms to the departmental records, I regret to say it is not considered practicable to grant your request. </para>

                <para class="block">Prior to Federation a motion was agreed to by the Victorian Parliament to the effect " That substantial preference should be given in all the Victorian Government Departments to Australian-ma'de goods." Although that was agreed to by the State Parliament at a time when I was a member, owing to the splendid business capacity of the Germans, the number of . Krupp's goods sold was larger than that of any other make. It was proved conclusively before a Select Committee that the price paid for Krupp machinery was in excess of that at which English machinery of equal value had been tendered. I hope that the Federal Government will avoid the mistakes that have been made by the State. We are told in a report that the Department  ha3  appointed men to advise each soldier, and I think it would be well for the Minister to make inquiries, and to inform the House as to what machinery has been supplied to soldier settlers, and what proportion of that machinery is of Australian manufacture. My information seems to indicate that the representatives of American manufacturers of farming and agricultural machinery have better means of getting in touch with soldier settlers, and of ascertaining their requirements, than have the agents of local manufacturers. The Federal Government appealed to Australian manufacturers to employ as many returned soldiers as possible. Our agricultural and farming machinery . makers are employing large numbers of returned soldiers, and I am convinced that the average returned soldier settled on the land would prefer an Australian to a foreign made machine. It  i3  only fair to the people who find the money for our soldier settlement scheme that local industry should be given special consideration. Abraham Lincoln pointed out that if Americans purchased a locomotive in another country, when that locomotive wore out they had neither the engine nor the money, but that if they purchased a locally manufactured locomotive then, when it had worn out. the money would still be spinning round their own country. That  is still true. By purchasing Australian instead of imported machinery our returned soldiers will keep their money circulating in the country, and will avoid adverse rates of exchange. The whole of the taxation of Australia is borne by something like 900,000 householders, and it is up to the Commonwealth to see, in the interests of the taxpayers who find the money, that the State Government, which deals with soldier settlement in Victoria, expends that money, as far as possible; amongst our own people. I should be loth to say that a question of commission is involved, but if the statements iue.de to me are true, then, as surely a.-t day follows night, it is either because of that or some other occult reason that the representatives of American manufacturers can always obtain the information they want as to soldiers going on the land. I should be very sorry to say that any State or Federal officer was guilty of treachery to his country by giving  special  information in return for a commission received, but if proof is forthcoming of any such treachery, then the officer concerned should be treated, not as an Australian, but as an alien who has no right to be here. The honour of the Victorian State and Commonwealth Governments is at stake in this matter, and I hope that the watchword that will ring out throughout Australia will be, " Australia for the Australians, and Australian tools for Australian hands." </para>
                <para>I recognise that 'it is difficult to adequately protect some Australian industries, and that the members of the Country party hold strong views in regard to import duties on farming machinery, but we ought certainly to manufacture all our own requirements. We should be a self-contained community. I have the fullest belief in the initiative and mechanical genius of the Australian worker. I know a Flinders-lane clothing manufacturer who has had experience in Austria, Switzerland, and Australia, and he assures me that he has never had more intelligent workers ;n his factories than he has obtained here. </para>
                <para>In the name of the manufacturers and of the  agricultural  implement makers of Australia, who are employing a lot of returned soldiers, I demand that they shall have a square deal. They should always be able to obtain information as to returned soldiers who are settled on the land. I recently saw a number of returned soldiers, who are settled along the Murray, and the average "Aussie," who was man enough to risk his life for his country and his race, would rather have an Australian-made machine, when he goes on the land, than one that comes through the Customs House. The Telbart tractor was successful against all competitors in a recent reliability trial held at Werribee, and Australian-made agricultural machinery is equal <inline font-style="italic">tq</inline> that of any other country. My sou, who is farming in Western Australia, obtained agricultural implements through the State Government, and found them all that could be desired. He tells me that local manufacturers, who have to compete with imports, not only from abroad, but from all the other States, are turning out first-class machinery, and that their operations are tending to keep down prices. In the name of the- citizens who provide the Government with the money to carry out its scheme for the benefit of those for whom we cannot do- too much, I ask for fair play for local manufacturers. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> holds the purse strings, and is therefore entitled to tell the State Government that, if they do not observe our requirements in connexion with the returned soldiers' settlement scheme, we shall have to make other arrangements. Ab the member for Melbourne, I regret to say that, in regard to soldier settlement, the Victorian State Government has been  the slowest and slackest of a'l the State Administrations. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member had his opportunity to present his case, but he made only general statements, whereas I have facts and figures - knowledge the result of years of close association with the Board. There are also the records of. the Department to bear out what I say. It is unfair to make general charges of the kind against the Board. From my own personal knowledge, the members of the Board and their officers have given years of devoted and loyal service, working day and night, and, at times, even on Sundays. </para>

                        <para>- They have a free choice; the Board does not direct them in the matter, and all manufacturers, within the Commonwealth and outside, have equal opportunity. The Australian manufacturers, of course, have an advantage, inasmuch as their implements enjoy protection, and are here ready for inspection and sale. Whenever an estate is purchased and subdivided, a list of the successful applicants for land is published in the press, so that any interested manufacturers are able to get all the information necessary. The general charges made are without foundation; in every way the Board has carried out its duties to the satisfaction of the Australian soldiers and the public, and also of the Government, who find the money. </para>

My point is that the manufacturers are not getting a fair deal, and to those manufacturers I refer the Minister. It is all very well to say that the reaper and binder is not manufactured here. </para>

                        <para>- He has not. Whether I have made out a case to the satisfaction of the Minister or not, I ask him to consult the manufacturers, from McKay all the way down to the smallest maker of implements, to see if they are content. The charge I make is that the Australian manufacturers cannot get the information which is available to the representatives of American firms. </para>

                        <para>- He gave a pledge to the House and the country that we were to see the end of an Act which has become anathema to the people; but he is so saturated with the lust of power that the Act gave him that, while making a pretence of surrendering that power, he is determined to re-enact some of the very worst features of the Act. This Bill is a fraud on the face of it. While it contains a promise on the face of it that it is a Bill for an Act to repeal the War Precautions Act, it actually proposes to keep alive the very worst* features of that pernicious measure which we have had in operation for the last four or five years. We read in the newspapers with interest that the Ministerial party was not .surprised when this Bill was introduced yesterday, that, in fact, they had been 'discussing the matter upstairs. If that statement is correct, it suggests that the bulk of the Ministerial supporters are behind the Government, and desire to give effect to the Bill - a very regrettable thing. But I am prepared to give them the benefit of any doubt I may have, until after the division bells have rung, when  it  will be seen whether the Prime Minister has succeeded in dragooning his supporters to accept the Bill. It is hard to believe that support could be found for a measure which makes for the wiping out of trial by jury and the curtailment of freedom of speech. No other meaning can be read into the Bill but that it is intended to destroy those two things. Its outstanding features are the provisions which strike a blow at that freedom of speech which is the boasted birthright of every man in this country, and trial by jury. Should the Bill be passed we can say good-bye to freedom of speech.  There will be no further freedom of speech, and there will be no further trial by jury in this country. </para>

                        <para>- Within a certain area. If persons are in certain streets, or within a certain distance of the building in which the laws of the country are made - and these may be the worst laws in the world - the Bill will apply to them. For instance, if those who were promised definitely by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> at the last election the advantages of a basic wage feel aggrieved that effect is not to be given to that promise, and assemble at certain , places, they will be deemed, under this Bill, to have met for an unlawful purpose, and may come within its penalties. Therefore, I say that it is good-bye to freedom of speech. </para>

He concluded his speech by saying that he intended to vote against the measure, and, indeed, there was no other course open to him. But the newspapers tell us that the subservient section of Ministerial supporters that meets upstairs fell at the knees of the Prime Minister, and agreed to do everything that he asked it to do. </para>

                        <para>- I can see in my mind's eye the Prime Minister appealing to the passions and prejudices of his followers, and insisting on the need for legislation to suppress sedition, holding up certain individuals who should be brought under these provisions. He would only have to do that to get the honorable member for "Wakefield to agree to anything that he might propose. The Prime Minister, being reluctant to throw off the robe of dictator, which he has i worn for -the last four or five years, was able to make the honorable member and others agree to his proposal without much difficulty, because he knows exactly how to appeal to certain persons for what he wants. I did not expect that this Bill would put an end to the War Precautions legislation, and, as I expected nothing better, I am not disappointed. I knew that the Prime Minister would find it difficult . to relinquish the unlimited power that he possesses, and that for the past four years he has used against the liberties and interests of the country. </para>

The Prime Minister and those who follow him could hardly be expected to extend the privilege of trial by jury to the people of .this country, judged by their latest act. On the bare report of a newspaper, with nothing else to guide them, they expelled an honorable member from this House, and there was no. indication that they desired to give him fair play. I was not here on the occasion, being absent in another State with the Public Works Committee ; but, from all .accounts, there was not the semblance of fair play. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to it as an indication that we are not to expect anything in the nature of trial by jury from this Government. If the Bill becomes law, those who propose to meet to-morrow night to express their grievance against the Government respecting the non-acceptance of the basic wage might be dealt with and punished for daring to criticise the Government's action. I cannot understand the members of any party agreeing to some of the provisions of this Bill. It proposes to make a person coming to these shores go through the farce of taking the oath of allegiance. I can understand that the Prime Minister had certain persons in view when he got his party to agree to that upstairs, and I know how he appealed to their prejudices. An Act of Parliament cannot make a man loyal. A person coming to- these shores might take the oath of allegiance, and it would prove nothing of value. On the other hand, to force persons to take the oath is the very course which would lead to disloyalty. When every man is liable to be bailed up and have his loyalty questioned, ' he is made to believe that he is regarded with suspicion. Such conduct will not make one a more" loyal or more dutiful citizen. The proposals of the Government, as indicated in this Bill, would be laughable were they not so ' serious. They are absurdly foolish, and the measure can only have been introduced because there are certain individuals in the minds of ' the Government against whom they propose to use these powers. The Government are not even original in this absurd legislation. The powers which they propose to secure with respect to sedition are borrowed from the Sedition Bill introduced into the New South Wales Parliament in 1916 by the ex-Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman).</inline> So much did it aggravate the people that that measure was one of the chief' causes of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman's</inline> relegation to political obscurity. The only satisfaction to be gained from the introduction of this Bill is that a similar fate may very reasonably befall this Government. Besides drawing upon the New South Wales Act, resort has also been had to the old Queensland code of fifty years ago. </para>

                        <para>- There is one great principle recognised in the Queensland code which is conveniently absent from this Bill. I refer to the right and privilege of trial by jury. The Government have borrowed the worst features of other criminal codes, and have cast aside all the better features. It is to a large extent immaterial what a Government may seek to import into the criminal laws of a country so long as they retain and safeguard the great right of every citizen to open trial by a jury of his fellow-countrymen. </para>

                </continue><para>There is a clause in the Bill which seeks to make it seditious to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom, or against a Government of the King'6 Dominions. Was ever such a proposition sought to be foisted upon a free' people? We are to be required not only to swear allegiance to  His  Majesty the King, but to  His  Majesty the Australian Czar. We must refrain from criticising either the .Lloyd George Government of the United Kingdom, or the Hughes Government of Australia. We must be very careful, if we do not wish to excite disaffection, not to dare to criticise this Government or any of its laws, in operation or proposed. Having studied the history of the Lloyd George Government and of the Government of the Commonwealth, it would be hard to avoid laying oneself open to a charge of sedition. One may not even offer reasonable , criticism, it would seem. I can quite appreciate how this proposed law will make it a very serious matter for any one to refer, for example, to the Ready incident, the recollection of which still carries a very bad odour. It will be recalled that steps were taken by the Government to increase their majority by spiriting away certain persons - as in the Ready and Watson cases. However, no longer are we to be permitted to refer to those incidents. All our boasted rights and privileges with respect to the criticism of governmental administration are to go by the board. </para><para>The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> referred yesterday to the meddling  practices of the Prime Minister. There are' clauses in this Bill relating to companies: and, having them in mind, I quite agree with the honorable member for Dampier that it is about time the Prime Minister ceased from his  meddling  with Australian industries, which are being thwarted at every turn. T do not say, of course, that they should be allowed to continue unrestricted in every respect; but the Prime Minister has shown that he has not the qualifications - much less the right - to interfere with business activities in Australia. If he wished to do anything in the direction of suppressing sedition, the Prime Minister could go straight ahead and bring in a specific Bill to amend the Crimes Act in that respect. If he desired to deal with companies along the lines proposed within this measure, his proper course should be to introduce a Bill to amend the Companies Act. And, with respect to the proposed restrictions upon immigration, the Prime Minister would be acting properly if he introduced a Bill to amend the Immigration Restriction Act. The desire of the Prime Minister is not to help industry.  His  past actions have tended in the opposite direction.  His  proved desires have been to thwart industry.  His  chief purpose now is to continue to wear the robes which, unhappily for Australia, he has donned for so long. The Government- say it is their great desire to introduce suitable immigrants to Australia. The worst way in which they could possibly go about that purpose is to publish broadcast the provisions of this measure. If a stranger were to land on our shores, and were to read of these proposed safeguards against sedition, he would say, " This is' the best country in the world to shun." The worst advertisement which could possibly be given Australia is to have it made known abroad that our people are such that these safeguards against sedition are necessary. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> referred yesterday to people who were trying to disrupt the Empire. He remarked that he was pleased that these clauses had been introduced to deal with sedition and the like. He spoke of quite a large number of people who, during the war, were seeking to overthrow the Government of this country and of the Empire.  His  language would give one the impression that there were really very many people in Australia who were anxious to bring about revolution and chaos. According to his allegations, if all those who should have been imprisoned had been cast either into the internment camps or our gaols, they would have been far too small to hold such a throng. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Then, his opportunity having been missed on that occasion, I, personally, would be willing to extend to the honorable member a chance to make a statement forthwith - so long as he undertook to give names. If the honorable member was aware, during the period of the war. of the actual names of persons who were guilty of sedition and the like, he had a clear duty to perform. He should not have waited until the present moment, and sought the interjection of some honorable member to give him his opportunity to furnish the particulars. The fact is that the honorable member for Kooyong finds it more convenient to keep on vaguely saying these things for purely political motives. Let him get down to " brass tacks." He desires the impression to go forth that this country is eaten up with disloyalty and sedition, and that we have in our midst many who are out to overthrow the Empire, so that it is absolutely necessary to perpetuate this pernicious measure. Unlike the Prime Minister, I was born in Australia,, and when I say that I have its best interests at heart, a greater degree of credence can be given to that statement than to any such assurance by the right honorable gentleman. In the best interests of Australia I hope we shall quickly get back to pre-war conditions. I hope that we shall have a speedy return to normal times, and that our industries will be allowed to go on peacefully without meddlesome interference on the part of the 'Government. I trust that we shall have restored that harmony and goodwill amongst the people of the Commonwealth, and, indeed, the Empire, that will enable us to work out our destiny just as we were doing before the Prime Minister came along with his War Precautions Act. The people were then largely at peace among themselves, and were endeavouring to work out their own destiny in their own way. Our industries were free from the Prime Minister's interference and meddling, and we have a right to expect that such interference will be no longer continued. The War Precautions Act has become anathema to the people, who feel that they have been fooled by the title to this Bill. They were definitely promised that before the House adjourned for the Christmas vacation the pernicious War Precautions Act would be removed from the statute-book. It is by no means new to find the Prime Minister breaking his pledges to the people, but they, and we, as their representatives, are entitled to enter our protest. The fact that the Prime Minister has broken many promises is not a sufficient reason why he should continue to do so. We were definitely told that the War Precautions Act would be repealed before the House rose, but, true to his traditions, the Prime Minister has broken that pledge. </para>

The Prime Minister, under the "War Precautions Act, has been interfering with various business enterprises. As the result of his interference in the interests of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Com- pany that corporation was able to make something like Â£300,000 out of a  contract  that it entered into. It was given special facilities that were denied others. It was granted privileges which other firms  in  Australia could not secure. </para>

                        <para>-I should like to know whether its name appears on the list of subscribers who are. presenting the Prime Minister with a cheque for Â£25,000. It would have paid the persons concerned to give a few shillings to the fund, or, as the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> suggests, to contribute the full amount. The presentation, on behalf of the public, of a cheque to the Prime Minister  is,  I suppose, another illustration of the stage management to which the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> recently referred. The Prime Minister is supposed to know nothing about the creation of this fund, but I venture to say that some very good friends of his manage to work these little things for him. That may be a wrong conception of the right honorable gentleman's patriotism. It is, perhaps, too great a reflection on his patriotism to make such a suggestion, but I, at all events, have my doubts, because, unless there is something of the kind  at  the back of the War Precautions Act, I see no reason why the right honorable gentleman should seek to perpetuate it. The people are heartily sick of  it.  They do not want it, and the only conclusion I can come to  is  that its principal features are being perpetuated in order to suit certain people. Let us get back to pre-war precaution days. The people should be allowed to carry on  in  peace and harmony, and to work out their own destiny without any interference of this kind. </para>

But it was a shock to me when I had placed in my hand the Bill now before us. I cannot agree with a line or even a word in it. </para>

                            <para>- With that exception there is nothing in the Bill which.I can indorse. Even the title of the Bill should be altered, and when we go into Committee I intend to move accordingly. Instead of being a Bill to repeal the War Precautions Act it is designed really to perpetuate the worst features of that measure. While the war was in progress, the Parliament, believing that it was necessary that the Government should have certain powers, passed the War Precautions Act. under which they were given almost unlimited authority. And to-day - two years after the war is over - when every one is looking forward to the repeal of that Act, we have the Government coming forward with a Bill which, although entitled the "War Precautions Act Repeal Bill," actually continues the very worst features of that measure. We find that  it deals with such matters as claims and functions as towharfs, agreements with and guarantees to banking corporations, companies, firms, and businesses, " oath to be taken by persons entering the Commonwealth," unlawful assemblies, amendments of the Crimes Act, the punishment of sedition - with definitions of sedition which suit the Government - investments by municipalities and other bodies in Commonwealth loans, the right of banks to advance money to employees for investment in Commonwealth loans, the investment of trust funds in Commonwealth loans, acts which the Government say are prejudicial to the raising of such loans, a council of finance, agents of oversea companies and firms- </para>

I cannot say that the Bill is a fraud or a farce, since when I used such an expression in respect to another measure I was instantly called to order; but I will say most emphatically that I am absolutely opposed to the Bill. It is merely another bit of political acting on the part of the Prime Minister, and is introduced, I dare say, in furtherance of his desire to retain the wide powers that he has enjoyed during the last few years. I shall vote against the second reading. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause sets out the powers which may be exercised under the Coal Regulations It is very necessary that coal should be controlled by the Commonwealth authorities, but I am disappointed with the manner in which these particular regulations are administered. In the past the administration has been directed in certain channels, and, probably, against one particular class of the community; but there has also been laxity in the administration affecting the whole community. The clause in this Bill which continues the War Precautions (Coal) Regulations gives the fullest possible power to the Commonwealth Government to deal with any matter which may arise in connexion with the coal-mining industry. Under these regulations this Parliament derives its power to pass legislation recently enacted affecting the coal-mining industry. But my contention is that we are not endeavouring to make the power we possess effective. Certain negotiations are proceeding at the present time to bring about a settlement of a dispute which has arisen in connexion with coalmining, and I hope they will prove satisfactory; but I cannot permit an opportunity like this to pass without entering my protest against the neglect of the Commonwealth Government to take action under the Industrial Peace Act to force the Victorian State Government to observe an award given by a Tribunal appointed under the provisions of that Act. It is idle for us to have this power if we do not use it for the purpose of giving effect to an award made by a Tribunal appointed in consonance with the power we exercised by virtue of the Coal Regulations. Who are to police the awards made by these Tribunals ? The employees, the employers, or the Commonwealth Government ? There can be only one answer. Under the Industrial Peace Act the Commonwealth Government is charged with the duty of policing awards made by Tribunals appointed in pursuance of provisions of the Act. Yet to-day we have the spectacle of a State Government setting an example to private employers by refusing to observe an award made by a Tribunal and attempting to justify its action on the ground that it was not a party to the dispute. The Industrial Peace Act makes it quite clear that the Commonwealth Parliament has assumed complete power over the coal trade throughout the Common-  wealth, and, in that Act, an " industrial dispute" is defined as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">There was an impending probable dispute. It became necessary to appoint a Tribunal. The Tribunal gave an award. To-day a State Government is defying that award. The proper course of that Government was to observe the award, and pay the men the wage allotted to them, and then appeal to the High Court if it was not satisfied with the decision of the Tribunal; but it has assumed the attitude that the Tribunal had no right to control its workmen, and has raised the point that it was not represented at the inquiry. As a matter of fact it was. The State Premier at first objected, but, after the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had been consulted, and had expressed the opinion that the question was one that ought to be submitted to the Tribunal, the State Government was represented by two persons. It then took no, exception whatever to the proceedings until an award was made, whereupon it refused to obey it. The Act provides that any person who does not wish to become a party to the dispute may appear before the High Court and show cause why his name should be struck out of the list of parties cited; but the State Government did not adopt that procedure, and instead of the Commonwealth Government saying, " We propose to police this Act and see that you carry it into effect, just as we would compel any private employer to do so," no action has been taken against the State Government. Certainly negotiations were opened up. but I contend that it is our duty as a Parliament to assert our authority. Of course, if we have no authority in the matter the sooner the public know it the better; but if we have the power, why should we allow a State Government to flout it? A penalty of Â£500 may be imposed for a breach of an award, but no attempt has been made to recover any penalty from the State Government, which refuses to recognise the authority of the Commonwealth, and chooses to defy us. </para>

                        <para>- The duty of the Federal Government is to police its own Acts, and it is for the Courts to decide whether the State Government is right in this matter. On the merits of the case I venture to say it is wrong. Certainly its actions are not in the best interest of the people of the State itself or of the Commonwealth as a whole, because if a settlement is not arrived at within a week steps may be taken which may be harmful not only to Victoria, but also to other portions of Australia. This matter is so serious that I cannot allow this House to go into recess without raising my voice in protest. The State Government has taken up a wrong attitude. Some honorable members have asked why the Morwell miners should be classed as coal miners, but as a matter of fact under the award of the Tribunal they are classed as' ordinary labourers, and are to receive the lowest wage paid under the award, namely, 16s. 6d. per shift. The lowest wage paid under the award to a coal miner isÂ£1 per shift. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. Every one knows that in any industry there are all classes of men engaged, and that if a plaint is filed the log covers all classes of employees. When a Tribunal gives its award it fixes the wages to be paid to all classes of men engaged in the industry. In the case of the Miners Federation it fixed the wages not only for the miner, but also for the wheeler, the clipper-on, the screen man, and every other person employed about a coal mine. This Tribunal fixed the wages to be paid to the Morwell men at the lowest possible rate awarded, namely, 16s. 6d. per day. </para>

                        <para>- A Government which sets the example set by the Lawson Government does not deserve to remain on the Treasury bench for five minutes. If it felt aggrieved by the award of this Tribunal it had the right of appeal. First of all, it could have appealed against being made a party to the dispute, but it did not do so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawson</inline> admits that he made a mistake in that regard. However, if it felt dissatisfied with the award the only course open to it was to appeal to the High Court upon the constitutionality of the Industrial Peace Act. It could not appeal on the merits of the award. But the State Premier simply proposes to ignore the award of the Tribunal, with the result that a very bad feeling has been created in the community. Some honorable members have said, "Why cannot these Morwell men allow a State Tribunal to deal with their case?" But these men are members of the Miners- Federation, which has decided that it will not bring about any industrial upheaval in the Commonwealth on condition that the whole of its members are protected by a Tribunal appointed under the Industrial Peace Act. Do honorable members imagine that a federation would not protect a section of its members because they happen to be small in numbers, and allow it to be debarred from the advantages given by the award of this Tribunal; or that it would forsake its friends, and not stand by them, especially knowing that a Government was breaking the award? If the men had broken this award they would have been dealt with, but no action is apparently to be taken against a .State Government for breaking it. I do not know whether this is because a National Government has control of affairs in Victoria, but that is a fact which should not weigh at all in connexion with this matter. A State Government has as much right to be dealt with for a breach of an award .as has a private employer who refuses to observe an award. The point I wish to make is that the Commonwealth Government ought to police the awards of its own Tribunal - no one will contend that it is the duty of the workmen to police them - but it chooses to depend on negotiations. I hope these negotiations will be successful ; but from what I heard on Saturday last, unless some change has occurred in the meantime, the position is not too hopeful. If the State Government adheres to its decision that it has the right to go to a Police Court for remedy, trouble will occur. If a certain point is raised before any Police Court in Victoria, the decision will assuredly go against the men. The State Government ought to be compelled to comply with the provisions of Commonwealth legislation, and go before the High Court. Then if it should get a decision favorable to it, well and good; but no Government should be permitted to flout the law of the land, or refuse to obey an award of a Tribunal appointed under that law. It is useless for the State Government to argue that if it complies with this award it will be obliged to pay the same rate of wage to every other person throughout the State engaged in similar work. We know that when an application is made for an award in connexion with a certain industry the award given affects that industry only. Any other person who seeks to increase his wages to the amount fixed by that award is obliged to cite a case for the Court, and the Court will deal with his application on its .merits. In view of the fact that we have a declaration that the basic wage is about Â£5 16s. -a week, will any one say that an award of 16s. 6d. per day is too much ? Although the men at Morwell may be working in an open cut, their work is arduous, they have a lot of material to shift,  and they lose a lot of time through wet weather. No one can argue that the wage of 16s. 6d. per day for six days a week, even without lost time, is more than sufficient to maintain a family at the present time. Yet when an award is given fixing 16s. 6d. as the standard wage for certain employees of a State Government, that Government absolutely repudiates it, and the Commonwealth Government does nothing to enforce Commonwealth legislation. The Prime Minister said to me the other day that he did not know what could be done in the matter, and asked me to suggest what I thought could be done. My only suggestion is that the Commonwealth Government is charged with the duty of policing these awards. </para>

                        <para>-I  understand that they were paid 13s.. 6d. per day, and I have it on the best of authority that when their wages were increased by1s. 6d. per day, the Government at the same time increased the price of coal by about 2s. per ton. Of that 2s. per . ton, 9d. covered the increase given to the men, leaving the Government the advantage of an extra 1s. 3d. per ton, which I believe would fully cover the increase to 16s. 6d. per day under the recent award. But the real question is, what is a fair and reasonable wage for the men employed in the industry? The tribunal having found that these men are entitled to16s. 6d. per day, it is the duty of the Victorian Government to pay that wage, and of the Commonwealth Government, if it refuses to do so, to take what action may be necessary to compel it to obey the award. Unless this is done, what will be the value of our industrial legislation? If a State Government is permitted to disregard an award, a bad example will be set to private employers and also to employees, who, when they do not get decisions of which they approve, may say," The Victorian Government has disregarded an award, why should we not do the same?" If a settlement is not come to in Sydney to-day - though I hope that it will be - the Commonwealth Government should cite the Victorian Government before the High Court with a view to compelling it to observe the award. </para>

I propose, therefore, to omit sub-sections 1 to 17. which contain the provisions of the existing regulations, and to retain sub-sections 18 and 19, and later to insert a new clause providing for the continuance of the War Precautions (Companies, Firms, and Businesses) Regulations now existing for a period of twelve months only.

I understand that there is to be an important meeting of Commonwealth public servants in the Exhibition Building to-morrow night. Possibly, twenty of those attending the meeting may see fit to come here for the purpose of presenting the resolutions of the gathering to the Leader of the Government. It would be very proper and desirable that they should know at what precise spot they should cease from discussing the subject-matter of the meeting while on their way to this building. Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> inform me whether he will accept an amendment in the direction of the erection of red flags about the area by day and of the installation of red lights by night? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle)</inline> is moderate in his desires. He has not expressed a wish to delete the whole of the clause, the reason being, perhaps, that he is aware that he would not get sufficient support in that direction. Personally, I do not know what good purpose the clause can serve. It does not seek to prevent what is unlawful. It seeks really to" make unlawful that which is recognised as lawful throughout the world - the right of every citizen to make known his grievances. It is not wise for us to attempt by legislation to prevent citizens from ventilating their grievances. This clause, however, will really prevent any persons making known their grievances at a public meeting within a certain distance of Federal Parliament House. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member assists me by his interject' on. After all, the Parliament House of the Commonwealth is a place where grievances are remedied. It is here that the deliberative assembly of Australia sits, and this is the place al which grievances should be made known. Why do we propose to silence people when they come within a quarter of a mile of this holy of holies? Why do we say that we will not allow them to discuss public matters within a quarter of a mile of these buildings ? The Government are trying to make this a kind of <inline font-style="italic">sanctum sanctorum,</inline> and for that reason I hope that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> will bring his influence to bear upon the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> and induce him to accept the amendment. It would certainly make the clause more acceptable to the general public and remove a good deal of that criticism which has been so effectively directed against it by honorable members of the Labour party. I hope that we shall not be driven to insist upon a division, but that the Minister will reconsider his decision, and accept, after all, what is a reasonable amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause was fully discussed and explained during the second-reading debate. The honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle)</inline> now seeks, by his amendment, to remove the very essence of it. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has, unintentionally, misrepresented the effect of the provision. It is not designed to prevent the public discussion and formulation of grievances, nor will it prevent assemblies of the people to discuss public grievances, exoept within the immediate neighbourhood of Parliament House buildings. It provides that it shall not be lawful for any meeting of persons exceeding twenty in number to take place within the area defined, but, subject to that exception, all public grievances may be discussed in any part of the Commonwealth. There is absolutely no limitation to the free expression of public opinon. </para>

                    <para>.- Although we have been meeting here for nearly twenty years, it has not been thought necessary before to enact a provision of this kind for the protection of the Parliament. It is evident, therefore, that the Government must have done something to shake public confidence in them, and that they fear that the people may gather in the neighbourhood of Parliament House to give expression to their views concerning them. This is really an insult to the citizens of Melbourne. It suggests that they are so violent that it is not safe to allow them to hold a public meeting for the discussion of a public grievance within a reasonable distance of Parliament House. I do not wish to insult the people of this city. They conduct themselves quite as well  a9  do the people of any other city, and I have a very high opinion of them. Gatherings of the kind forbidden by this clause serve a useful purpose in enabling the Parliament to ascertain what is public opinion. I ha.ve no fear of such demonstrations. Quite recently a big meeting was held outside the House, but I walked out calmly, without any lack of confidence in the people assembled there. It was a pleasure to meet and see them.We have had occasionally some little excitement outside the House, but no harm has been done. There has not even been a good punching match in connexion with any of them. I object to any attempt to stifle the free expression of public opinion. We could have no greater safety-valve than is afforded by the unrestricted discussion of public grievances. Honorable members must have read of the mass meetings which take place from time to time in Trafalgar-square, which is almost in the heart of London. The British Parliament has never attempted to interfere with such meetings, and Trafalgar-square is not much further from the Houses of Parliament than this building is from Elizabeth-street. Sometimes meetings of from 60,000 to 100,000 strapping lusty fellows are held in Trafalgar-square, and if such crowds were disposed to damage property, the police would be powerless to prevent them from doing so. When Lord Sherbrooke, as a member of the Gladstone Ministry, many years ago, brought in obnoxious taxation proposals, an enormous procession of men, women, and children marched from the East End of London to the front of Parliament House. I saw the procession. It was 100,000 strong, and a deputation from it actually went into Westminster Hall. </para>

                        <para>- I shall oppose the clause with all the power I possess. I have sufficient confidence in my fellow-Australians to believe that they will not abuse the liberties that have ever been the right of the British people, and such legislation as this can only tend to promote discontent and disorder. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> or some other far-seeing man, who once declared that liberal laws meant a law-abiding community, and that is as true to-day as when the words were uttered. However, I feel that I am beaten; those who could assist me will not do so. Doubtless they feel they owe a duty to the Government behind which they sit, and have no thought or desire to afford the community at large proper opportunities for ventilating any injustice they may suffer. There should always be the right to approach the King or the Government, and this Bill, particularly this clause, is a step in the wrong direction. I feel sure the people of Australia desire to do only what is right, and the country cannot prosper if there are parliamentary representatives who, by the legislation they support, indicate that they regard their fellow-citizens as little better than rogues and vagabonds. I know that in the attitude I now take I am representing the opinions of the vast majority of the electors of the great constituency of East Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the 1890 Act with knowledge of events in Victoria at that time, and of some of the men who were then in power. We all remember the great maritime strike, in the course of which the famous military order was given to "fire low, and lay them out" when the people were in public meeting assembled. It seems as though some of the spirit of that order prevails to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Quite likely. We do not know what is ahead of us ; but I shall never forget the stirring times of 1890. Compared with the speeches then made within the precincts of the House, or in the immediate neighbourhood, those delivered to-day are orderliness itself. In those days it was recognised by men of advanced thought, both here and elsewhere, that one of the greatest safety valves was liberty of speech in public meeting, and there was no talk of limiting the area in which that liberty could be enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course, is a foolish idea. If the various State Governments were to prohibit gatherings in the Domain, Sydney, on the Yarra-bank, Melbourne, in the Gardens at Adelaide, or on the Esplanade at Perth, they would do more to promote the disruption of the community than any other course I know of. To-morrow night a great meeting of public servants is to be held in the Exhibition Building, and it will be almost possible for the. voices of the speakers to be heard in the Legislative Assembly chamber itself. Some of the greatest meetings - great from an agitator's point of view - have been held in that building, and no objection was ever raised to them. A meeting to protest against this or some other iniquitous measure could be held there, and no authority would seek to prevent it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how the law will operate in that connexion. There are sharp lines of demarcation between constituencies such as my own and Melbourne, and I suppose that if a meeting were held on the far side of the sharp line drawn in Spring-street to mark off the prohibited area, there would be no attempt to impose any prohibition. The clause, honorable members will observe, speaks of open-air meetings only, so that if the authorities of St. Peter's Church, which is just over Parliament House fence, were to consent, meetings of any kind might be held in the Parish Hall. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate it shows the peculiarity of the measure we are asked to pass. A revolutionary gathering must not be held in the open air within the prohibited area, but, as I read the Bill, one of that nature may be held within a building in the area. Legislation such as this can only create discontent, and tend to turn the most peaceable of men into violent agitators. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell),</inline> from his association with unions in days gone by, knows that during the great maritime strike, some of the quietest of men became absolutely the most revolutionary, simply because of the curtailment of the liberty of speech, and the removal of rights and privileges that have been for many a year enjoyed by Britishers. </para>

                        <para>- Is this law to be set in force by the Commonwealth Parliament because certain folk happened to come into this Chamber with printed sheets which they flung among honorable members, and because some voices were raised in the gallery? I can foresee the end of this measure. Common-sense and liberty-loving people will return men to those benches opposite with sufficient supporters behind them to repeal all this obnoxious legislation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine passed his Coercion Bill, I told the people that a Parliament would soon be elected which would take the extreme pleasure of expunging the obnoxious provisions of that measure from the statute-book, and even men who were the colleagues of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine at the time he passed the measure were to be found amongst those who subsequently voted for its repeal. It is absurd to make out that there is danger in a peaceable community from the holding of public meetings. The Government are sowing seeds that may produce a crop which will not be to their liking. These repressive, and, to me, repulsive measures, instead of having the result desired, will have the very opposite effect. The prohibition of the right to speak in the open air is contrary to the very spirit which moved the Chartists and other great reformers in days gone by. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite mistaken. I still have the feelings of abhorrence to which I gave expression in 1890, when I was a private citizen and a member of the executive of a union, though my language, perhaps, might not be so extravagant or violent in condemnation of these things. I know that when many citizens, not members of unions, found that public speech was prohibited in a certain area, they joined issue with those who had introduced that legislation, and, so far as I know, have ever since voted for the Labour party. When we adopt repressive measures which deny the people public and civil rights, we are only increasing the number of agitators, and the numbers of those who will join in asking for a restoration of the privileges of which they are now deprived. I deplore the fact that we are called on to pass this measure, because I know the crop which will ensue from the seeds we are sowing. </para>

It is only during this session that it has been found necessary to have legislation of this kind. A Minister has interjected that it is old legislation, but I would be the last to be guided by legislation passed in a conservative and almost stagnant - politically - State like Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I would like the Government to adopt some of the laws enacted by the Imperial Parliament, but I would be very sorry if they were to adopt some other legislation passed by that Parliament. Apparently the reason for this clause, which was nut before us a few months ago in the shape of a Bill, is the fact that the Government have been guilty of something which renders this legislation necessary. In my opinion there are two causes for the introduction of this restrictive provision. First of all, the 'returned soldiers, finding that the Government had not carried out their promise to give them a cash gratuity, gathered in front of this building in their hundreds, and expressed their righteous indignation at the manner in which they had been fooled. If they were good enough to go away and fight for us in their hundreds, they were good enough to. gather outside this. House in their hundreds to demand justice. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, the Government intend to introduce legislation which will impel and compel the justice- loving, " dinkum" British people of this community to come before this building, and demonstrate against them. But we should preserve our privileges, and one of these privileges is the right of gathering in the open air to express our views on any subject. This right has been referred to as the safety valve of public opinion. I hope that honorable members will not be so narrow in their vision as to support the clause, but will allow the British subjects in a British community to continue to gather as they may think wise in the endeavour to secure the redress of their grievances. </para>

                    <para>.- This provision seems hardly worth discussing. I do not anticipate large assemblages in the vicinity of Parliament House likely to inconvenience members in their deliberations, unless the conditions are such that those who gather will pay little heed to the proposed restrictions, and in that case members will still have to run the risks against which they think they are safeguarding themselves. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the clause is useless. Another objection to it is that very few persons will know what is the area within which assembling is prohibited. Those responsible for a meeting within the prohibited area will be aware of what they are doing, but the great mass of the people who will attend that meeting will be led there simply by curiosity to discover what is in progress, and though innocent of any offence, may be brought before the Police Court, and punished. It is the most natural thing in the world for a person who sees a crowd to join it to ascertain what is going on. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle)</inline> somewhat improves the provision; but, as I have said, if public feeling is excited, and public anger aroused to such an extent that people will gather  in large numbers in the vicinity of this building to ventilate their grievances, or for any other purpose, the clause will not prevent them from doing so. During the war the War Precautions Regulations were framed for the purpose, but they did not prevent these assemblages. It may be that whoever are responsible for this piece of legislation wish to be able to deal with their political opponents should they address such assemblies. On the last occasion when a crowd assembled outside this building, those on the Ministerial benches invited us on this side to go out and address it. That was said by way of putting us in our "proper position." We did not accept that invitation, but the day may come when we may accept a similar one.. Should I deem it necessary to address persons assembled within the prohibited area, the fact that I should be liable to certain penalties for doing so would not prevent me from addressing them. </para>

                        <para>- And that would not matter. This Bill, however, is so much waste paper. It is a sort of political placard notifying the public that the Government are taking action to prohibit certain things which they, in their hearts, know full well they cannot prohibit; that is, if and whenever the people make up their minds in a contrary direction. The Government may have their Bill. It makes no difference either to me or to any one else. It is a dead letter before it is passed. </para>

If that be done it will be made clear, at all events, that it is not intended by this clause so to strengthen the hands of the Government as to make it an act of sedition to strongly criticise the Government of the day. There is a very material difference between attempting to overthrow the Constitution and attacking the Government for the time being in power. </para>

                        <para>- When I pointed out that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of sub-clause 1 was fair matter for adverse comment it was suggested to me by a friendly interjection that my objection was met by subclause 2, which graciously concedes some measure of freedom of speech, notwithstanding the apparently harsh provisions of sub-clause 1. I shall not debate this provision at length, beyond pointing out that sub-clause 2 does not meet in any way my objection to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of subclause 1. I have pointed out that it might well become the duty of any member of this Parliament, or any member of the public, to support the claim of an integral part of the Empire in the assertion of its independence, specifically mentioning the case of India, where there is a vigorous and well-informed Home Rule movement, quite as vigorous and, in my view, probably, as well-founded as that associated with the Republican movement in Ireland. I have also pointed out that in South Africa there is a very active and well founded movement designed to secure the independence of that portion of the Empire which originally formed the Boer Republics that were, in my view, and in the view of a very large and militant section of the South African people, wrongly deprived of their independence. While sub-clause 2 permits the suggestion in good faith of the Sovereign being mistaken in any of his counsels, or of arguments being directed in good faith towards pointing out defects in the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom or of the Commonwealth as by law established, and while the Government graciously permit us, always in good faith, to excite  His  Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any lawful matter in the Commonwealth as by law established, orfinaly, still in good faith, to point out with a view to their removal any matters which are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of  His  Majesty's subjects, there is nothing directed to the particular point which I have last raised. I am not alleging any grievances of an Imperial character other than the one I have already indicated having special reference to Ireland, but I urge that in connexion with the government of all these various integral parts of the Empire there might well come a time when it would be not only a right, but also a duty, of a citizen of this country, to express his sympathy with those who desire complete independence, provided, of course - and this is only a proviso - that complete independence is desired by a majority of the persons in the country concerned. In other words, what I am arguing for now is really well expressed in that new-born phrase so much used in connexion with the war, namely, the right of self-determination. These are the only matters about which special comment may be made in connexion with this clause. I venture to say that the law upon this subject wa6 sufficiently clearly stated and well understood, at all events, as far as it could be understood in the Statutes in exist.ence. and more particularly in the common law, without bringing it forward in a special measure, exciting, as it necessarily and naturally does, controversy and those feelings of ill-will which, on the face of it, it was designed to prevent. I hope the Minister will at least consent to an amendment. I cannot support this provision while it contains the specially objectionable features to which, before the adjournment and since, I have ventured to call attention. </para>

The honorable  member  for Batman has raised another point in which he is correct, and I propose to accept his suggestion to amend paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of subclause 2 by inserting the words " or of any of the King's Dominions " after the words ' ' Constitution of the United Kingdom." This will make it lawful for any person to point out in good faith errors or defects in the government or constitution of the United Kingdom or of any of the King's Dominions as by law established. The amendment will bring the paragraph into conformity with subclause 1. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased to see that provision is made for the punishment of any person who may bring the Sovereign into hatred or contempt because in Australia we have a section of people who, by the absurd methods they adopt to show their loyalty, certainly do bring the Sovereign into hatred and contempt. In fact, we have had exhibitions of it in this House. If this provision had been in operation in the past, many honorable members would have been liable to a conviction, because of their use of the National Anthem which, whether we like it or not, is associated with the presence of our Sovereign . There are individuals who believe that the best way in which they can  display  their loyalty is by conducting themselves in an unseemly manner which, to my mind, brings the Sovereign into contempt.  His'  Majesty may have an opportunity of visiting Australia,, but if the Australian newspapers print about him the absurd articles which they published about  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales on his recent visit, I hope this provision will be brought into operation against them. Many honorable members think that the way in which they can show their great regard for the Empire is by getting hold of the Union Jack and marching down the street singing " God save the King." It is absurd to see a full-grown man, who is supposed to have sense, rushing down the steps of Parliament House, waving &amp; Union Jack, and singing " God save the King" in a voice so nasty that it only aggravates his offence. He may not intend to bring ridicule upon the King, but he certainly does so. I hope that those( who are administering this measure if it becomes law, will not look upon this particular provision with spectacles  coloured by their own political convictions. I know why the paragraph finds its place in the Bill. It is there so that, for instance, the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> may catch me on some unfortunate occasion saying or doing something he thinks will bring the Sovereign into ridicule. </para>

                        <para>- This provision has been placed in the Bill in order to pander to the small-mindedness of a certain section of the community, but I hope that it will be administered in the light that it means what it says, so that if any member gets up in this House, and sings " God save the King " when <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is quite unnecessary to do so, action will be taken against him for bringing the Sovereign into contempt. The punishment inflicted might prevent some fools from following in his footsteps. Some newspapers think it their duty to pander to the maudlin sentiment of a few people in the community. I remember a newspaper printing a paragraph to the effect that a young lady had seen the Prince of Wales in his pyjamas on the balcony of his hotel. The article was not published to give information of any value, but simply to pander to the wishes of a contemptible section of the community. I hope that the Government will inflict punishment on news: papers that print articles for such a purpose, and impress -on them the fact that such paragraphs only bring the Sovereign into contempt. </para>

                <para>I also object to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of subclause 1, which provides that an intention to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects so as to endanger the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth is a seditious intention. There are many persons who avail  themselves  of the opportunity to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects, and any attempt to prevent them from so doing will be an interference with their political liberty. I have a right to express my political opinions, although they may cause ill-feeling and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects by hurting the feelings of another section of the  community  opposed to my views. The Government is taking too much power, and I would remind Ministers that, although they have a majority now, the time is not far distant when the Labour party will be in power, and if I am in Parliament then, I shall not follow the Labour Government if it does net use this provision to put some honorable members in their proper places. There is hardly a member sitting behind the present Government, who does not, on every possible occasion, use language calculated to promote ill-will and hostility, between the various sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>- The present Ministry could not give good government to the Commonwealth ; and am I to be prevented from saying so? Some honorable members opposite, in their innocence, believe that they are keeping this Ministry in power in the interests of good government, but the sinners of the party know that it is not so. Because Ministers have the big battalions behind them, they say to us, "You shall not give utterance to opinions which may endanger the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth," and the only government that . they would allow to be considered good is that which proceeds  from their own administration of public affairs. I may be told that my contention can be maintained, only by a stretching of the imagination; but there are politicians spiteful enough to do anything to damage their political opponents, and this provision could be used by Ministers to prevent criticism of their administration. I feel that it is not intended to put down sedition, but that its object is to enable the Government to " down " its political opponents. If British politicians had in the past taken notice of the feelings of their political opponents, and had thus arrived at a true understanding of matters, much of the trouble that is occurring in Great Britain to-day would have been prevented. Enactments like that proposed compel people to adopt undesirable methods for gaining their ends. The provision looks innocent, but I would not trust the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> not to use it to " down " a political opponent, and there are other members opposite who also would be capable of using it for that purpose. It has been inserted in the Bill to prevent members from availing themselves of opportunities to place before the people their ideas of right government. If they do so, Ministers can say, "You are endangering the good government of the Commonwealth," and punish them. I know that this Government has a weak lot of followers, who would support any of its proposals. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection proves my contention. The honorable member thinks that only those on his side desire the good government of the Commonwealth, and that any one wishing to displace the present Administration should be dealt with. He is one of those whose kindly hearts would prompt them to make a gift, but who would never recognise another's right. This community is composed largely of individuals like him: people with large hearts, but with very narrow views respecting the political rights of their opponents. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member would say that the alternative was not good government. The Government are taking powers to deal with those who, the honorable member would say, do not believe in good government. Political parties on all occasions will fight their opponents strongly and bitterly and exercise every possible power to " down " them, but to charge a man who differs from you politically with being  seditious is playing the game very low down. Many unfair punishments have been inflicted upon sections of the community by the putting into force of laws which were supposed to be obsolete. Some day I can imagine a far-seeing gentleman like the Prime Minister or the Treasurer going through these laws and discovering something which will "down" their political opponents for the time being. Although the only offence of their opponents would be a desire to remove them from the Government bench, they could charge them under this measure with sedition. </para>

                        <para>- Not only the Treasurer, but many supporters of the Government on the other side of the chamber, have talked republicanism. I believe that the limited monarchy of Great Britain is preferable to the presidential system of the United States of America, or even that of France, but still I am a republican at heart, because I believe that a republican form of government such as I could mould would be better than our monarchical system. For saying that I might be charged with sedition, but I submit that it is not seditious. </para>

                <para class="block">The same phrasing occurs in other parts of the proposed new section, but the question can be tested at this point, where it first appears. There is a great deal of difference between discussing the shortcomings of the Government and attempting tb upset the Government and Constitution of the country. Under the English Act, the offence is the doing of something subversive of the Government and Constitution of the realm. It is very doubtful whether, under the form of wording adopted in this Bill, it would not be an offence to criticise severely the Government- of the day or the members of the Government. If that is so, it is altogether too great a restriction to place upon the rights of a democratic people. If the English form of wording were adopted, it would bring under the penalties of this measure every person who tried to upset Government as  Government,  because Government is part of the Constitution. Now that the newer phrase has been- adopted in the Bill, the Committee is entitled to some much more weighty reason than has yet been given for the departure from the English model. </para>

                <para class="block">Constitution." Attention has been drawn to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the exemptions. This provides that it shall be lawful for any person to point out in good faith  ' errors or defects in the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth as by law established, or in legislation, or in the administration of justice, with a view to the reformation of such errors or defects." That does not cover my point at all. The absurdity of the proposal is shown by the fact that, while a man is to be free to criticise fully the administration of justice, he must not criticise the administrations of works and railways. The exemptions will not protect a man in 'criticising the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Government. They will not permit him to criticise the Prime Minister's administration of his Department. There is not a word in them which will enable him to criticise the administration of the Wheat Board, or of metals, or of any -other big?  undertakings of the Government except- . ing the administration of justice, and also excepting legislation. He will be allowed to criticise legislation, but not administration. Sub-section 1 provides that a  man  shall not criticise the Government as Government. That is altogether too narrow. No part of the clause will give ham the right to criticise the administration of a Minister, apart from the administration of government. He is not given the right to criticise the Government -upon any other heads than those set out in sub-section 2: In its present form: the clause gives altogether too wide .a power to the Government. The people should not be deprived of the fullest right of criticism of the Government in all its phases. </para>

                    <para>. - The very best answer to the criticism of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector -Lamond)</inline> is that this provision has been the law in Queensland for many years, :and there has not been a single prosecution under it on the lines which he indicates. 'If he had been a Queenslander, or taken any  part in  elections  in Queensland, he would know that there is a latitude of criticism in that State the extent of which I do not suppose is exceeded in any part of the King's Dominions. It is apparent, therefore, that the section in the Queensland Act does not apply in the way which the honorable member suggests. The honorable member has, perhaps, been misled by the way in which the word "government" is used. Nowadays we are constantly using the word "government" in the sense of the persons or individuals who do particular things. The clause allows the freest possible criticism of the administration of every Minister .and adviser of the King, because paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of subsection 2 provides that it shall be lawful for any person " to endeavour in good faith to show that the Sovereign has been mistaken in any of his counsels." There is the principle of responsible government. Every Minister is responsible for the advice he gives to the Crown, and every person in the community has the right to offer the fullest criticism of a Minister or Government for any advice tendered by him or  them  to the Crown in relation to the administration of public affairs. There is, therefore, not the slightest ground for the objection taken by the honorable member. The meaning of the proposed new .section is clear. It appears to me that the interpretation of the word " Government " as used in the clause .is " the .Executive." This country is governed by an Executive, it is legislated for by a Parliament, ,and its laws are administered by the Justices of the High Court. These organs are all provided for in the Constitution. Their functions are assigned to them under the Constitution', and in the administration . of law generally the  Executive must be sustained in its. position. What is aimed at here is to put a stop to all movements of a seditious character which have for their purpose the undermining of constituted authority in its administration of the laws of the land. This has nothing to do with the individual acts of Ministers. I would .be properly liable to be criticised if I, as a Minister, were guilty of maladministration. But, at a time when feeling is running high, and when men are trying to play upon that feeling in order to weaken the administration of the law, surely there should be authority such as is provided in this clause. In the law of the United Kingdom there are the words, " Government and Constitution." In the Queensland code, however, the phrase is " Government or Constitution."  There is no attempt, in this piece of legislation, to take away from any persons in the community that  right of criticism which should exist if we are to have healthy administration. The difficulty will be, with the phraseology of this measure, to secure convictions for sedition; there is a heavy onus thrown upon the Crown to prove any charge of such an offence. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> argued that under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> anybody who criticised the Government might be proceeded against on the ground of a seditious intention. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> does not deal with that phase of the matter at all. It has to do with those seditious movements which are launched with a view to set class against class, and undermine the peace, order, or good government of the community. I quote from Stephen's <inline font-style="italic">Digest of the Criminal Law</inline> the following words, which are the declared common law of the United Kingdom: - </para>

                <para class="block">The offence contemplated by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> is, therefore, embodied in the common law of the United Kingdom. It is embodied also in the Queensland code. We are a Federation, and, as such, the Federal Government have somewhat more restricted powers than the States. Consequently, we have legislated only within the ambit of our authority. We have, therefore, added these words, "so as to endanger the peace order, or good government of the Commonwealth." </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the honorable member for Illawarra will insist upon his amendment. It is most necessary. It is refreshing to hear the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> citing Queensland as an authority and a guide for this legislature. We have recently passed several laws which are based upon the legislation of the United Kingdom;  and the ground on which we have been asked to agree to them has been that of the urgent need for uniformity. Honorable members on this side made many efforts to secure amendments ; but the Ministers in charge of measures always replied that the amendments could not be accepted, because it was necessary to legislate in complete uniformity with the British law. Now, however, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> departs from that standpoint in support of the contention that any one who criticises the Government may render himself liable to be charged with seditious intent. He quotes, also, the Queensland authority. The <inline font-style="italic">EncyclopÃ¦dia of the Laws of England,</inline> page 448, describing seditious words, states - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>It is sedition to do any act or to publish any words tending to bring into hatred or contempt the person of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom as by law established, or either House of Parliament. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The different wording is employed deliberately. The Minister may argue that the change is made in pursuance of copying the Queensland law; but, if there is anything objectionable in the Queensland law, the Government would not ask the House to copy it. Do honorable members say for one moment that, upon some big public question, because one may severely criticise the Government, one should rightly be liable for arrest upon an accusation of sedition ? </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what we want, and is what the honorable member for Illawarra seeks by his amendment. In view of the admission of the Minister that the interpretation is narrower than the British law, and that the British law is deemed sufficient for all purposes, one is bound to ask, " Why should we go beyond it?" If the British law, as I have quoted it, is good enough for the Imperial Government; if it is sufficient for the law of the United Kingdom to employ the word " and" instead of " or," surely it is good enough for us. Every honorable member desires to do what is right along the lines of safety; but, while they may agree to give power to punish those who are guilty of sedition, they do not want to grant the Government power to proceed against any person on any ground of alleged sedition. </para>

                        <para>- The safety valve, in regard to the future of Australia, is best provided in allowing the people freedom as wide as possible. It is a mistake to seriously curtail the liberties of the people. We must do what is fair and reasonable. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has said that this provision is designed chiefly to enable the Government to deal with. Domain orators. Those who speak in the Domain, so far as I know, do no harm. They are entitled to give vent to their feelings, and even under the law as it stands to-day, if they are guilty of seditious utterances, they can be prosecuted. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> 1&gt;hat such criticism might render one liable to a prosecution for sedition. The amendment is reasonable, and I do not .know why the Minister should object to it. It seems to me that the Government in power for the time being, no matter from what party it was recruited, could use this clause to the detriment of the great body of the people of Australia. Such a power should not be given to any Government. We need only to have laws providing for the proper control of the community and the affairs of the country. We shall go altogether too far if we enact that any criticism of the Government of the day shall be regarded as sedition and punishable as such. I want this Bill to be as fair as possible, and if we put the Minister in the position of the British authorities by substituting the word " and " for the word " or " I think he should be satisfied. This Parliament, during the past few years, has shown a tendency to pass legislation that is far too restrictive, and is actually hurtful to the people. Some day we shall find this out to our sorrow. To put it in a nutshell, under this provision a man may be prosecuted on a charge of sedition for saying something of which the Government does not approve. That is unreasonable. In the interests of the whole community,' I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. If lie refuses to do so, I hope that the honorable member for Illawarra will press it to a division. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government, to my mind, have been extraordinarily moderate in the drafting of this clause. They propose only to gaol people who criticise them. They have not proposed, as they might have done, to include any member of the Nationalist party, so that, whoever criticises them, shall be open to a charge of sedition. ' They might have gone the whole hog while they were about it. These half-hearted measures lead to the disruption of the ranks, as illustrated by the action of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> in submitting his amendment to substitute the little word " and " for the word " or ". I do not think that such an amendment, if carried, would make any material difference in the operation of the drag-net. The Government tell us that they are out to safeguard the Constitution, the Empire, and the class administration that we have in existence at the present time. They are out to safeguard all the paraphernalia of government as it exists today. They are out to " scotch " all criticism that may be levelled against them. They are out, in fact, to do what they did during the whole period of the war. This nice piece of legislation would have been very handy from the point of view of the Government when the Senate scandals were before the public. It would also have put a stop to all criticism of the attempt to interfere with the ballot when the conscription referendum was taking place. We can well imagine how such a power as this will be exercised by a Government which, under cover of War Precautions Regulations framed for that specific purpose, attempted to get the desired result from the ballot-box by intimidating sections of the voters, and so preventing them from exercising the franchise. With legislation of this character to back them up, the Government might then have prosecuted any citizen who pointed out how they were subverting the Constitution which they were supposed to protect. Such utterances would have been classed as " seditious " and " disloyal " by the dictators of that day, who were themselves subverting the Constitution. The Government are exemplifying in their own person the truth of the old adage -as to the lust for power, since they are constantly endeavouring to grasp more and yet more power. </para>

As a matter of fact, that prosecution secured me a majority of 600 votes ;- but I may say in passing that I am not in favour of obtaining majorities by the same process. It was the Acting Attorney-General at that time who determined that I should be tried before a magistrate instead of being indicted to appear before a Judge and jury. The evidence was collected by the military - the secret service people. I had no chance of ascertaining how it was accumulated, and the position will be the same with regard to any individual prosecuted under this clause. It will be put into operation against those whom the Government ' cannot intimidate or bribe into submission. </para>

                </continue><para>Under this clause, any attempt " to bring the Sovereign into contempt ' ' is also declared to be a " seditious intention . " The Government might have so extended that provision as to include the whole Royal Family. Had they done so, we should not have been able to say a word against the Kaiser. It is hard to say whether people who were credited with having been loyal during the war may not now be regarded as disloyal. Established order is being upset in Greece, and Constantine, the Allies' enemy, is now on his way back to that country. We find that we made a huge mistake in regard to his attitude towards Great Britain, and that, far from being our enemy, he was distinctly pro-British. In fact, presently it will be discovered that the Kaiser did all he could to stop the war; and the individual who dares to say a word against a person so closely related to our Sovereign Lord the King will be in danger of losing his liberty, because of being disloyal or seditious. Of course, in Great Britain, the Monarch only holds his job by a British Act of Parliament. Republican advocates can take their seats  in the House of Commons, and Arthur Lynch can organize a society for the purpose of establishing a Republic in Great Britain ; but here any person who is sufficiently disaffected or short-sighted to attempt to advocate that Australia, South Africa, India, Ireland, or, in short, any Dominion of the Empire should be a Republic, would, under this clause, be haled before a magistrate and punished for attempting to excite disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King's Dominions. I do not know how any one can establish a Republic " constitutionally " ; but with Republics or Monarchies it is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee, so far as I can see, under the existing social order, and therefore I do not propose to get particularly excited about the disaffection wrapped up in the advocacy of a Republic. A middle-class Republic would be of no more use to me than a constitutional Monarchy is. What I want to see is the idea which is being increasingly promulgated by the intelligent working classes of the world, and that is a complete change in the social order upon which all Governments are established and all Constitutions rest. What the Commonwealth Government are so much concerned about is displayed in the Minister's reply to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> What they are afraid of is what they term the exciting of class hatred between the working classes of this community and their exploiters. Their troubles about Republicanism or the Royal Family, or the United Kingdom or the Houses of Parliament! Their concern is only to maintain the present profit-making system intact ; and any orator, writer, or agitator, as they term him, concerned in pointing out to the people how they are being robbed in the workshops and factories of this country they regard as a seditious or disloyal individual.  This  drag-net piece of legislation has been brought forward for the purpose of maintaining the present system of capitalistic production. </para><interjection>

                    <para>.- For the last two hours we have had "much ado about nothing." The Bill is efficient enough to gaol all honorable members on this side of the House and those people outside who are supporting us. The task of interpreting the law will be in the hands of the Government. Who is to be the judge of whether disaffection against the Government or Constitution of any of the King's Dominions is excited: - the Cabinet, the Attorney-General, or some newspapers outside who support the Government? The exciting of disaffection against the Sovereign, the Government, the Constitution of the United Kingdom, or any of the laws passed by the House of Commons, or the House of Lords, will be sufficient to warrant the indictment of any person at the hands of the Government, or of the Attorney-General, as the case may be; but the clause goes further, and prohibits any person from exciting disaffection against the Government of India. No one will be allowed to take objection to the Fijian laws, which permit of indentured slavery, and make provision for the herding of mixed sexes of unfortunate Indian coolies. If any one in Australia " excites disaffection " against these laws of Fiji he will immediately be indictable. </para>

What does it matter whether " and " is used instead of " or " ? The powers given are great enough whether "and" or "or" is used. Personally, I shall vote against the clause, and against the Bill itself, no matter if twenty " ands " are substituted for a like number of "ors." I have not the slightest doubt that the Government will use the powers given if they think that their position as a Government is in danger. </para>

                    <para>.- I want to say a word in favour of the amendment which was forecasted bv the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who pointed out the reason for adopting it, and which was subsequently moved by the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond).</inline> It is proposed to substitute "and" for "or" in order to make the burden of proof on the person laying the charge a heavier one by calling upon him to show that disaffection has been excited, not only against the Government, but also against the Constitution. I thought that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> might have argued that " Government " and "Constitution" were alternative or synonymous tenths mutually explanatory of one another, but he lias not taken up that attitude. I certainly think that the amendment moved would be an improvement to the paragraph. It might be only a slight improvement, but we cannot expect to get anything but slight improvements in a measure of this sort. The Minister regards this as a very meritorious provision, deserving of support, because it has been taken from the Queensland law. It is quite a new experience to me to hear the Government claiming that anything that comes from Queensland is deserving of support. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may say that. Certainly we did not put this law into operation, and I do not think that if the Labour party came into power in the Commonwealth at would operate the law now proposed to be enacted. Labour Governments do not require adventitious aids of this sort; they should be able to live on their record. It is because of its record that a Labour Government still retains power in Queensland. Although the Minister and his colleagues, in December last, went up and down Australia saying that Labour had made the cost of living higher in Queensland than in any other State of Australia, a report just made by a Royal Commission to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth shows that in that State the worker is 10s. a week better off than in any other. </para>

                    <para>.- I listened carefully to the explanation of the Minister regarding the objection of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond),</inline> and it did not quite satisfy me as to the advisability of adopting the Queensland verbiage instead of that of the English law. I am at a loss to understand why " government " should be disconnected from " constitution " in this regard. I understood the Minister to say that the two terms are practically synonymous, and that, therefore, no action could be taken for an offence against one which did not include an offence against the other. But the word " or " is disjunctive; it distinctly dissociates government from constitution, and, to my mind, its employment makes it possible for action to be taken against criticism of the Government, whether in reference to the Constitution or not. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to say that there had been occasions when I might have been subjected to annoyance under a strict interpretation of a provision of this kind. I was imprudent enough to publish a pamphlet criticising somewhat severely the Parliamentary head of the Government, and I am not sure that that very enterprising gentleman might not take it into his head, if he had the opportunity, to try the strength of the proposed enactment against me. At any rate, I should prefer a greater degree of safety, and I think that undoubtedly I should be safer under a provision fashioned on the British model than under this fashioned on the Queensland model. We cannot go far wrong if we accept English precedents in a matter of this kind, and, for that reason, I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Has proved, so far, fruitful as to promote a good deal of discussion. I do not desire that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> shall either, intentionally or otherwise, mislead the Committee as to the real point now to be decided. When the Minister first spoke on the subject, he quoted against members on this side Stephen's <inline font-style="italic">Digest,</inline> and the common law of England, to show that the present Bill is merely a reproduction thereof; but I had already noticed, and later called his attention to, a very significant point of difference between the texts on which he relied, and the wording of the Bill. It is perfectly clear that the deliberate substitution of " or " for " and " has either a significant meaning or no meaning at all. If it has a significant meaning, the Minister should admit it, and that meaning must be that he intends, by the substitution, to give a wider meaning to the term " sedition " than is accepted by British jurists as sufficient for the Government of the United Kingdom. It is perfectly obvious that the intention of the Minister now is, if there is any reason for the substitution, to place some measure of restraint on persons and newspapers desirous of criticising the Government, and, that if the clause becomes law in its present form, it is beyond doubt that many members on both sides of the Chamber, should they repeat outside what they have already said here, could be punished, and equally evident that the publishers of many of our newspapers could be successfully indicted under the criminal law. </para>

                        <para>- I am not here as a defender of newspaper publishers, nor as the defender of members opposite, but even the most insistent loyalists should desire to stop short of hampering free criticism of the Government of the day. The Minister has suggested that " government," in this connexion, has some wider meaning than ordinarily understood ; that it means, in the wider sense, the Executive. But I venture to say that if, after the passing of this Bill, I repeated on the public platform what I have already said about this Government, and some phases of its public conduct, I would be indictable. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has put the whole position in a nutshell, and has read from the authority that the Minister relied upon. Let me remind honorable members that this is not Statute law, but is really the result of not only years, but of centuries of British experience which, crystallized in the common law, has been the subject of consideration, litigation, and prosecution. There is nothing which the British people more jealously guard than the right of its citizens to criticise the Government of the day. I have been wrongly and wickedly accused in this House of showing ill-feeling towards Britain which I have never expressed, and never felt, though I have not been slow to speak frankly of the Government of that country or this. On the contrary, in the House and elsewhere I have frequently had occasion to quote British text books and show how far this Commonwealth Government has departed from the best traditions of Britain. I invite this Parliament now to resist the insidious introduction of a simple word of two letters which means the breaking down 'of a principle which is very dear to the British as well as the Australian people. When it becomes an offence to freely, or even ferociously, criticise the Government of the day, it will be a very black day for the Commonwealth. It is not a small matter but a grave one, and it is significant, because of the manner in which it is being pressed by the Government. For what reason does the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">("Mr. Groom)</inline> appeal to us to accept his proposition ? Is it on the ground that it is adopted from the Queensland Criminal Code, and because the late Chief Justice of that State, eminent lawyer though he may have been,  was  responsible for it, and of him I do not propose to offer any unfriendly criticism now he is gone. Because he departed from British practice, and embodied the result of that departure in the Queensland Criminal Code, is that any reason why we, as members of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia in the twentieth century, should follow the unwise example that the Government propose to follow, and disregard the settled and established precedent in British jurisprudence ? I trust the Minister will be sufficiently impressed by the arguments coming from his own side, if he is not influenced by those initiated and supported on this side of the chamber, and will see his way to accept the amendment without giving away anything that is dear to those over-confident loyalists, and, in so doing, adopt the principle that has stood the test of centuries in the country he is always so prone to follow. </para>

                <para class="block">I hope this amendment will be acceptable to the Government. Every honorable member knows that trial by jury is an established practice amongst British people. It is not right that it should be departed from, particularly in such a matter as sedition, and especially when the question of intention is taken notice of, as it is in this Bill. The question of whether a man charged with any of these offences shall be tried before a jury oi not is, according to the Bill, to be left entirely in the hands of the Attorney-General of the day. It is only fair that a man who is liable to be imprisoned -for three years for what the Government of the day allege to be sedition should have the right to appeal to twelve of his countrymen, as well as to the magistrate who happens to be sitting on the Bench. If the sense of common justice among honorable members, and the esteem which they profess to have for British methods, will not cause them to vote for this amendment, no amount of talk on my part can move them to do so. I appeal to them - seeing that what one man may call sedition another may not, and that the question of intention can be considered by the Court - to recognise that such a case should be decided, not by one Judge, trained though he may be, but by twelve of the fellow-countrymen of the accused person. I could say much stronger things. I could go back over the last four or five years, but I shall not do so- I wish to be moderate, and will content myself with the expression of the hope that the Government will accept my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the law as enforced in the States, sedition is regarded as a very serious offence, and persons convicted of it are liable to severe penalties. In Queensland the penalty is three years' imprisonment. We provide the same penalty in this Bill. In proposed new section 24e we propose an alternative method, by which the accused may be prosecuted summarily. That is in cases where the sedition may not be regarded as of a very serious character, or where it may not be desired to impose an exemplary punishment. It is stipulated, however, that no summary prosecution can take place without the consent of the" Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am speaking from memory, but my impression is that sedition is an indictable offence in the United Kingdom. It is clearly so in Queensland. Trial by indictment means trial before a jury. To some extent summary prosecution is an advantage to the accused, because he may be taken before a magistrate, and the penalty provided in summary proceedings is imprisonment for a period not exceeding twelve months, or a fine not exceeding Â£100, or both. It is therefore possible in a summary prosecution- to impose a smaller penalty than in a prosecution by indictment. </para>

In awarding punishment for an offence, judges always weigh the character and quality of that offence. Having established the fact that there has been a breach of the law, they weigh the circumstances surrounding that breach, in order that they may make the punishment fit the crime.

                    <para>.- T gather from the remarks of the Minister, for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> that sedition is a very grave crime. From my reading of the legal text books, I have obtained the same impression, especially as for a number of years I have been sedulously - endeavouring to avoid committing it. If sedition is everything that it is said to he, surely it is sufficiently grave to warrant its being treated in the same way as other serious offences are treated. I -can imagine what would have happened if honorable members upon this side of the Chamber had argued that the crime of sedition should be a matter for summary jurisdiction by a police court. We should have been told that the offence was a very grave one - too grave to allow it to be dealt with in the summary jurisdiction of such a tribunal. Honorable members opposite would have asked, " Why should we place sedition upon a lower plane, from the stand-point of jurisprudence, than is larceny ? " We should have been assured that sedition constitutes an attack upon the very foundations of our civilization, and that therefore we should not permit it to be dealt with summarily. But, because the amendment comes from the Opposition side of the Chamber, I fear that it is not going to receive very much support. I suggest that, as sedition has always been regarded as a very serious offence by jurists of older lands than our own - an offence which has been punishable even by death - it is only fair that it should be placed at least upon the same footing as larceny or embezzlement, or other offences which require to be initiated by indictment, and which give the accused person the right of trial by jury. Why should this matter be left to the discretion of the Attorney-General, seeing that the offence is, to a large extent, political in character? The Attorney-General is specially unfitted to deal with it. The Minister has stated that in certain instances the right of trial by jury may be conceded to the accused. But we are not concerned with the intentions of the Ministry, or with the possible effect of this clause in particular cases. We are concerned only with the broad principle as to whether, upon a charge of sedition, an accused person should have the right to be tried by a jury. The clause in its present form will give to the Attorney-General, if the prosecutor desires it, the right to determine whether or not the accused person shall be so tried. I hope that the Minister will gracefully agree to the amendment, just as he did to the amendment submitted by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline> By so acting, he will be doing a still greater measure of justice to the Government and to himself. He certainly ought not to allow the Government to be open to the suspicion that they are animated by political motives in connexion with this sub-clause. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill which is now before us is one which, to an extent, will repeal the War Precautions Act, and thus enable us to get back to normal conditions. I have no objection to urge against the provisions of the Bill which relate to the treatment of persons who are disloyal to the Empire of which we form a part. Whatever powers were given to the Executive during the war period - powers the exercise of which resulted in accused persons being punished without even the formality of a trial - were abundantly justified by the conditions which then existed. But in time of peace, there can be no justification for denying any citizen who is charged with the serious crime of sedition the right to be tried by a jury, which is the recognised right of every British subject. I have not one word to say against the Attorney-General personally, but I am not prepared to clothe him with the power to say to the police that an accused person shall be tried summarily. If the honorable gentleman were armed with any such power, it would necessarily follow that he would also possess the power to say that an accused person should be tried summarily, and the right of a trial by jury denied him. We are not legislating solely for the Administration of to-day. We do not know what Government or what Attorney-General may be administering the law upon some occasion in the future when it may be invoked. Are we prepared, then, to give any one individual - even though he be the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth - power to send a person for summary trial before a magistrate? If the individual charged were to prefer to plead guilty and be summarily dealt with, well and good. In South Australia there is provision whereby, even though an offender has in all circumstances the right of trial by jury, he may plead guilty and elect to bc dealt with forthwith by a magistrate. We should be the last people on earth to do anything in the direction of restricting the right of trial by jury. The Government are not now copying the Queensland law, or the law of any State, or of the United Kingdom. They are going out of their way to re-enact legislation which, necessary though it may have been in time of war, nevertheless caused more ill-feeling and turmoil than any other piece of legislation in the history of the Commonwealth. Why, then, in all the circumstances, should we perpetuate such a law in times of peace? Let us demonstrate that this- Parliament is really prepared to return, to normal conditions; and let us re-affirm that when any person is alleged to have broken a law of the land, he shall retain the right of trial by jury which would bc his in any other part of the British Empire. </para>

                <para>As for the provision whereby the Attorney-General may send a person for trial before a magistrate, I can only speak in respect of magistrates in my own State. There are some in South Australia before whom I would be very sorry to send any man for trial upon any alleged offence whatever. Certain among them have reached a stage where they ought to be retired, because they are no longer fit to carry out their responsible duties. I strongly appeal to the Government to accept the amendment, or to wipe out the whole sub-clause. </para>

                    <para>.- While discussion has centred around the question whether a person should be sent for summary trial before a magistrate or be permitted to be tried before a jury, it appears to me that it is the Attorney-General who will really try all such cases in the first instance. Every matter .must be submitted to the Attorney-General before a decision is reached concerning whether or not an alleged offender shall bc prosecuted summarily or be tried before a jury. The Attorney-General examines the circumstances and makes up his mind. Thus he pre-judges the case. </para>

                    <para>.- I have heard no justification for the introduction of this Bill. It is  odious  and obnoxious. I shall take this opportunity to briefly place on record my strong objection to the present Government of the Commonwealth having a special law passed for the purpose of safeguarding themselves against public criticism. </para>

                <para>There are old laws at present on the statute-books of the States that at this time are a disgrace to any country, and should long ago have been wiped out. Most State Governments have sufficient public decency to allow them to lie dormant. These laws are available to the Commonwealth, and yet on top of them the Government require Parliament to pass a special law re-enacting obnoxious legislation, and putting the thumb-screw and the rack into it. There are new and novel features included in this Bill, which should be protested against. Many of the most important provisions of the Bill are to be operative on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of one man - the Attorney-General. The probabilities are that in some time of special trial and strong feeling that one man may be the present Prime Minister, who has shown his gross partiality in administering legislation of this kind. That such a power should be handed over to a dictator and petty tyrant such as the Prime Minister is a gross reflection on this Parliament. </para>

I had a letter from a soldier at the Front, who was a resident of my electorate, telling me that he had been transferred to the Sixth Division, and he forwarded me a Christmas card bearing the colours of that division. On that authority I stated at a public meeting that a sixth division had been formed, and the Government  prosecuted  me for telling a falsehood. I had that letter and card in Court to support my statement, but under the rules of evidence I was not permitted to produce them; and a military officer stepped into 'the box, and swore that a sixth division had never been formed. On that officer's evidence a conviction was recorded against me. Are we to have a repetition of prosecutions of that kind, by means of which the Government may really fix up a conviction, for that is what it really amounts to? </para><interjection>

It was only when I was found to be without my private shorthand-writers, and there was,, therefore, no possibility of contradicting the military evidence, that it was sought to obtain a conviction against me. When I put an advertisement in the press calling for shorthand volunteers to come to my assistance, I was able to have two of them every night on my platform in order to insure that no injustice could be done; and the prosecutions immediately ceased. That is the kind of administration that we shall have under this Bill. </para><para>On the other hand, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> could, during the war, make practically any statement he chose. He could libel and maliciously scandalized all and sundry with impugnity.  He spoke of " Germany's mouth " at people's "ears," "Germany's hand" in their " palm," and " German gold " in their pockets ; and then he passed ' a regulation  which   prevented any prosecution of himself for libel. The Prime </para><para class="block">Minister libelled men who sit on this side of the House, and, with a special law, protected himself against any action. Is that the kind of administration we are to have under this Bill? </para><para>I have mentioned the partisan administration of the Government in several cases. When the Leader of the Labour party, and the organizations of the party in the various States, called upon the Government to initiate prosecutions for gross and palpable breaches of its own law, the Government absolutely refused to proceed against any one on their side, though always ready to proceed against members of the Labour party. </para><para>I desire to put ou record the perversions of the law which this so-called enlightened Government are placing on the statute-book. Such measures as this are absolutely unnecessary - nave not the slightest justification. No evidence has been brought forward to show that the existing law is not sufficient. </para><para>The probability is that the Government appreciate that their own administration may drive the. masses of this country to disorder; and are, therefore, getting ready legislation to meet such a contingency. That, it appears tome, can be the only justification for a. measure of this kind. </para><para>The Government may think that at this moment of inflamed passions on one or two points they have a little public sympathy with them, but I feel confident that the Democracy pf this country, when it realizes the full iniquity of this Bill, will take an early opportunity to sweep the Government out of office. </para><para>The Government are. pretending that they are repealing the War Precautions Act; but, in my opinion, if there could be anything more obnoxious than that Act, it is the Bill before us. This is not a proposal to repeal an obnoxious measure in order to bring us back to pre-war conditions, but a measure which only shows how impossible it is to wrest from, the Government the extraordinary and tyrannical powers they were permitted to assume during the war. We know that we cannot influence the Government, no matter what case we put up against this class of legislation, and that they and those who so slavishly follow them, without rhyme or reason, will  vote for it;but our hope is that when we go before the people and explain the character of the legislation which is being passed, they will give a mandate to some other party to wipe all these obnoxious measures from the statute-book. </para></speech>

                        <para>-It places a pistol at the heads of the municipal bodies. The last two loans have been to a considerable extent compulsory. The municipal bodies of Australia have funds which they may invest, and if we empower them to invest these funds in Commonwealth stock, there is nothing to prevent the Treasurer from issuing a compulsory loan, and compelling them to put their money into it, whether they desire to do so or not. I am not prepared to assist further borrowing, and I think that the position which it is sought to create is an exceedingly dangerous one. A glance at the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> list will show that at the present time Commonwealth loans return in interest from 6Â½ to7Â½ per cent., although money can be borrowed privately on mortgage at 6 per cent. Yesterday, as a trustee, I signed a mortgage on property in Melbourne for an advance of Â£2,500 for three years at 6 ner cent. The money was borrowed from a financial institution. After the transaction I asked how it was that when its funds could be invested in Commonwealth stock for a return of7Â½ per cent., they were willing to lend on mortgage at 6 per cent. The answer I received was that it was easier to finance on mortgage than on Commonwealth loans. For the first time in the history of a British community we find that the credit of a mortgage is considered a better security on the financial market than Government stock. I have said in this House before that we have reached the Plimsoll mark in the matter of borrowing and only the other day we received an intimation from the British Government that it was not advisable for Australia to go on the London market for short-dated loans. Surely that was an intimation that the Government should" keep off the grass." </para>

We also know that the Queensland Government has recently been negotiating for a loan in America, and i think the intimation they received was to the effect that they could not borrow at anything approaching a reasonable rate of interest. </para>

                        <para>- The reason i am giving is this: It will not be at all unfavorable to us if the Government are compelled to stop borrowing for a time except for the renewal of loans as they fall due. We have gone on borrowing, and we are now  in a state of indebtedness which is perfectly appalling. I do not feel disposed, in the slightest degree, to extend the facilities of the Government for increasing the indebtedness of the Commonwealth. What is the object of this clause? </para>

The Treasurer has stated that my remarks mean a cessation of repatriation work, but there is not a member of this House who is desirous in the slightest degree of interfering in any way with the pledge we gave to the soldiers in the matter of repatriation. If the Treasurer will now inform the House that there shall be no loans floated before Parliament re-assembles, except for repatriation purposes, I shall accept this clause without any objection. The Treasurer has said that my proposal would be the means of abolishing the Repatriation Department, unless taxation can be increased to the extent of Â£20,000,000. If the Treasurer will give the House an assurance that loans to be raised will be only for repatriation purposes, I shall be satisfied . </para>

However undesirable it may be to go on the money market, our promise to the soldiers must be kept. If loans are to be raised for ordinary purposes, such as we have floated from time to time, I do not intend to assist the Government in the slightest degree by increasing their facilities to borrow. This practice of borrowing must sooner or later be stopped. There are tens of thousands of men in Australia whose financial position has, been saved by their bank manager informing them it was time they called a halt. The time has come for this House to tell the Government that they, too, must call a halt in borrowing for ordinary purposes, and unless the </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> has to a large extent voiced the only feeling I have in regard to this proposal. If the word " shall " was where the word "may" is in the first part of the clause, I would oppose it. I regard it as an invasion of State rights, and of a very particular right, too, because each State may have certain laws and regulations for the development of its own territory, whereas this Act will override all those laws, and exonerate any of the bodies mentioned from the necessity of investing their money in State securities. On. the other hand, there is the fact that municipalities and Harbor Trusts and Boards within a State will certainly give some preference to their own State before they invest in Commonwealth securities. They may have surplus money to invest, and I hold that they could not invest it in any better cause than a Commonwealth loan, but the State may seriously want money also, and this provision would be a way out for such municipality, Harbor Trust, or Board to set the State aside and invest its money in a Commonwealth loan, which it would not now be entitled to do under State legislation. I have not had time to consider the real aspects of the proposal from every stand-point, but I can see in the clause a possible intrusion of a serious nature upon State rights. </para>

                    <para>.- The question of giving municipalities and other local governing bodies the power of investment is not a very serious one. It is continually done when any particular Government loan or Government funds are made legal investments for trusts and public bodies. I do not think there is much in the argument about a compulsory loan, because we could not have compulsion of that nature without an Act of Parliament. If a compulsory Loan Bill were brought in, a clause of this sort might well come under  it. But the dangerous part of this provision is that which gives municipalities and other local governing bodies the power to raise money by way of loan, and to go to the banks and get an overdraft in order to invest in Commonwealth securities. It is most undesirable in many cases to give local bodies that power, and if it had not been for the assurance of the Minister that he proposes to limit its operation to the next two years, in order to make provision for the necessary moneys required for repatriation, I should certainly have voted against the clause. I recognise, however, that the Government must keep faith with the soldiers in carrying out their repatriation policy. If this proposal is. going to help them in any way in the matter, I am willing to go that far, and accept the Minister's assurance that he proposes to bring in a new clause which will limit this power to the next two years. It would be a most dangerous innovation to give local governing bodies unlimited power to borrow and run bank overdrafts. To my mind, that would be a very unsatisfactory and dangerous thing to do. </para>

                    <para>. -  But for a similar power to this, the Empire could never have financed the late war. It is really the local bodies up and down the Empire that have been the backbone of the Empire's defence all through the war. But for these provisions operating throughout the length and breadth of the Empire, at Home as well as here, the war would never have been financed. We owe a wonderful debt of gratitude, one that we can never repay, to the municipal and other local bodies of all kinds for the work they did during war-time. The war is not over yet. That is to say, we are still standing up facing the consequences of war, and if there is to be  no  more borrowing, this House can so enact; but let it be understood clearly at the same time what such a policy will mean. It will mean cutting off all the supplies which are necessary to repatriate the soldiers. That is all that this borrowing is for. It does not mean anything more. </para>

If honorable members had had my experience during  the  recent loan, they would  not  applaud  the  deletion of this sub-clause  as  vigorously as they are doing. There are men in this community who went about systematically during the raising of the recent loan trying to decry it in every way. They said, for instance, that the Government would never pay the money back; that they would repudiate the debt. There was not a day throughout the whole campaign that we had not to be following these lying and malicious statements from end to end of this continent. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope what little persuasive powers and eloquence I possess will induce the Government to delete this clause. The Commonwealth has quite enough responsibilities and quite enough difficulties to overcome for the next few years, without attempting to handle the liquor question. It is proposed by this clause to give the Defence Department power to deal with the licensing law. </para>

                        <para>- I am not finding fault with what was done during the war. But the war is now over. Everybody knows that during the war period money was very plentiful. People were then in a position to indulge in luxuries which they will be unable to purchase as soon as loan moneys become exhausted. The Government would be acting wisely if they decided to have nothing whatever to do with the liquor traffic. </para>

                        <para>- There may be only one hotel within many miles of such a camp. I appeal to the Government to abstain from interfering with the liquor traffic, and to allow the States to control it. The Licensing Board which was recently appointed in New South Wales has just de-licensed sixteen hotels in and around Sydney. In Marrickville and Dulwich Hill there is only one hotel, and there is a military camp in close proximity to it. We all know that the military authorities, if clothed with the power which will be conferred upon them by this clause, will exhibit no consideration whatever for the people who are resident in any district in which there may be a military camp. They take a pleasure in being autocratic and domineering. </para>

                    <para>.- il should like an explanation of the reasons which underlie paragraph d of this clause, which provides that _ the Governor-General may make regulations prohibiting or regulating the publication of books, pamphlets, or documents purporting to be records of the services of any Naval or Military Expeditionary Force raised in the Commonwealth. I cannot understand the reason for such a provision. The war is now over, and why should we not have the fullest information regarding the work of the different sections of our Military Forces abroad ? </para>

The registration of such companies and of foreign companies requires the Treasurer's consent. The clause also deals with the transfer of the capital and registration of companies to persons residing in places situate outside the British Empire. We propose to continue the regulations referred to in this clause for a period of twelve months, taking power to repeal, vary, or modify them in the meantime if that course should be deemed to be necessary. Of course, any companies formed here by natural-born British subjects will not be affected by them. </para>
