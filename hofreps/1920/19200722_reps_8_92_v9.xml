Its aim 'is to prevent the disclosure of, important information, to give power to deport and otherwise deal with aliens, to interrogate and obtain information in various ways, and to appoint officers to carry into effect any orders or regulations which may be made under the Bill. </para>

                        <para class="block">Some honorable members who sit to-day, as they sat then, in the Ministerial corner, protested violently against any extension of the period of operation of this Statute. They objected to it operating for one day longer than was necessary, and every member of the party sitting on this side of the House voted against any extension of the Act. The honorable member for  Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> complained that the Act and the regulations thereunder were upsetting the commercial world. I, whilst admitting that certain sections of the Act had worked advantageously, protested against the continuance in operation of certain powers whilst others were dropped. The regulations which dealt with price fixing did afford a certain amount of relief to the community, but price fixing was abandoned by the Government, notwithstanding that I recollect the Prime Minister saying that price fixing operations under the Act had saved to the purchasing community about £3,000,000. Other powers under the War Precautions Act are still being operated. I am convinced that, had the Ministry not given their word to the Corner party that the Act would terminate on the 31st July, 1919, or three months after the declaration pf peace, the 1918 Bill would have been defeated. </para>

I know, sir, that you will not allow me to refer to a particular case, which was mentioned yesterday, and which is said to be <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> I remarked yesterday that it is very strange that, whilst we in this House are prevented from discussing that case, outside persons and Ministers on public platforms can say anything they please. Why are they not haled before the Courts for contempt? And why were members in another place allowed to discuss this matter yesterday for upwards of an hour and a half, one gentleman making charges, and a member of the Government replying to him? Apparently, in every other building in Australia persons are at liberty to say what they like about this case, but we in this House may say nothing. I say here, as I have- said elsewhere, that I am opposed to the deportation of any person without trial. When the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> on the 15th August 1919, moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the matter of deportations, he put on record communications from the Defence Department, and showed how the authorities were separating husbands from wives, and children from their parents. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> informed this House a few days ago that 122 or more Australian children have been sent out of this country. I agree with the honorable member for Capricornia in his remarks, made in October, 1914, upon the War Precautions Bill, when he said: - </para>

I regret to find that there is- a feeling against Germans who have come to Australia, and have made their homes here at our invitation - people who have raised families here, and whose sons and daughters are in every respect good citizens of Australia. What may be described as a "  pannicky  " feeling has taken possession of some members of the community,. and it is causing a great deal of cruelty to be exhibited to certain persons who are good citizens of Australia. </para>

                        <para class="block">That was true at that time. It may have been panic legislation. I was a member of the Government which passed it. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> truly said the other day that we were going to resign at one particular stage when we were both members of the Fisher Ministry. That is not the only time when I was about to resign. However, I was not prepared to take the extreme step of resigning over  every matter coming (before Cabinet with which I disagreed. Surely at this stage, so long after the signing of the armistice, we should have advanced far and away from this piece of legislation. There is no reason to-day to do things and make provision for emergencies which might have been necessary during a time of war. </para>

It has been stated, both in this Chamber and elsewhere, that by the action of the Government, Magna Charta has been virtually torn up.

When that time limit was. included it was considered that July, 1919 - so late a period after the armistice had been agreed to - would furnish a reasonable term for the operation of the measure. To-day is twelve months later, but the Act is still in operation so far as the liberty of certain persons is concerned. The Government may say that they have reason for their action. What is that reason ? We have a right to know. I am not free to say what was said in another place yesterday by the Leader of our party in that Chamber. The statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> delivered elsewhere, would have been ruled out of order if one of his colleagues had sought to make it in this Chamber. Why should there be one set of rules for the guidance of one place and another set for the con- ' duct of this Chamber? </para>

                            <para>. - I  shall be very .brief.  ;Th I Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has moved the  adjournment of ' the  House to protest against " The continued operation of the  War  Precautions Act, and the deportation,, without trial, in times of peace,  of  persons resident in the Commonwealth." The honorable member, who was a member of , the Government which brought that Act into existence, told me only ten minutes' before the .House met that he proposed' to take' this action, and I have thus had but little time to refresh my memory by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> 'My references to the records, therefore, must necessarily be of- a -fragmentary character. ' It was generally agreed by the party to which I and the honorable member at the time belonged, that a War Precautions Act was necessary. </para>

The Labour party supported this form of legislation with their eyes open. </para>

                                <para>- But I am speaking of the. Act of 1915. When speaking to the motion submitted last week by the honorable member, I called attention to the change which came over the attitude of the Labour party;and I may be permitted, perhaps, to point out that that was one of the first indications of that change expressed in terms of legislative activity. The Labour party was responsible for this Act, and I have not the slightest doubt that if that party, with the policy upon which it was returned by the people in 1914, had been in office to-day, it would have found the same reasons for continuing it that the present Government have found. </para>

                        <para>All that has been said by the Leader of the Opposition was said with very much greater force by the honorable member for Bourke and the honorable member for Batman in 1915, yet the honorable member voted for the objectionable clause. I shall, therefore, direct my remarks to that phase of the motion in which complaint is made of the application of the War Precautions Act to deportations. The honorable member asked why we applied the Act, now that the war was over, to the deportation of persons resident in the Commonwealth. The answer is very simple. These men could not be deported during the war. They were interned during the war, and the reason is sufficiently obvious. If I were asked why the case of the particular gentleman about whom my honorable friends opposite are so much concerned, has been dealt with at so late a stage,- I would say that it is owing to the mistaken weakness of this Government, who listened time and again to representations made by honorable members opposite-- </para>

He must be silent while I am speaking, or else leave the chamber. I listened to the representations I have mentioned, and when the new Parliament assembled I was again met by what was, in effect, a round robin pleading that further delay should be granted. I agreed to that. Then it was suggested that the person concerned should have a fair trial before the Solicitor-General. A deputation waited on me urging this course. The members said that they would abide by the decision of the Solicitor-General. I agreed to the suggestion. -I agreed to all they asked ; the deportation long agreed upon was delayed, the tribunal asked for was granted; and if I am asked why this which is now done was not done before, my reply is that it was because of the representations of those who asked for delay. To this man consideration has been extended far beyond that extended to any other. The reason, then, why deportations are being carried out now is that they could not be carried out during the war, and the reason why this particular deportation is so delayed is because of the representations to which I have referred, and to which in a moment -of excusable weakness - if honorable members like to put it in that way - I listened. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- The- honorable member has asked why the War Precautions Act has been used for the purpose of deporting persons, whom, under its provisions, it has been found necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth to deport, and I was saying that it was one of the chief purposes for which" the Act was brought into force. I was also saying that the principal reason why deportations had not been gone on with at an earlier stage, was 'first, that it was impossible to deport these persons during the war, and secondly, because representations were made to which the Government listened, and those representations were in favour of delay. Owing to the wording of the motion, and the decision of the Chair, it is impossible to deal with the merits of particular deportations, and, therefore, I shall not attempt to do so. I am content to say, in regard to deportations generally, that the only charges that can be laid at the door of the Government are that it has not deported men who ought to have been deported; that it has extended undue consideration to certain persons, and has allowed the law to slumber when it should have been active. Those are the only charges that can be made against the Government. So far as the War Precautions Act is concerned, I said, when I introduced it years ago, that every man should have the opportunity of being heard, and every man has been given an ample opportunity of being heard. It is now said that every man should have a trial before a jury . Every one knows that, in the very nature of the case, it would be impossible to get a conviction against such persons before a jury. Every witness who came forward would be a marked man. We know what is occurring in other countries, where the man who dares to come forward and give evidence is shot. </para>

                            <para>.- I appreciate the spirit in which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the names of the five honorable members who voted in opposition to the Fisher Government on that important division which took place during the discussion in Committee of the War Precautions Bill. There must be some honorable members now present who remember the attitude I have always taken up when anything relating to the Defence Department or the War Precautions Act, in particular, has been before the House.I never allowed a clause to pass by if there was the slightest doubt that the civil power would not be more powerful than the military law. I moved amendments to the War Precautions Bill; other amendments were moved by the party to which I belonged, even when we were sitting behind the Fisher Government, and I permitted no clause of that measure to pass without the assurance of the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Andrew Fisher)</inline> upon the point of the dominance of the civil power over military law. Towards the end of the night, when the Bill was under discussion, the present Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General in the Fisher Government, became angry, and asked me why I would not accept his assurance on the point. I told him that I would not take his word on account of the deception put up in the Melbourne Trades Hall, at the time I was Vice-President of the Central Executive of the Labour party, and he, accompanied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor, Mr. Batchelor,</inline> and other members of the Watson Government, came to us as a deputation, informing us that in order to. " dish " the Reidites the New South Wales Executive had passed a resolution granting immunity to any of the Liberals supporting the Watson Government to the end of the Parliament, and asking the Victorian Executive to adopt a similar resolution. </para>

                                <para>- I am showing the attitude of the Prime Minister on that occasion, and endeavouring to point out the illegality of actions taken under the War Precautions Act. At any rate, when I refused to accept his assurance in regard to the point I had raised in the House, he left the chamber and brought in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who informed me that the particular provision of the Bill to which I was drawing attention left the civil authority more powerful than the military. Will any honorable member say, in regard to the deportation of persons without trial, that the military is not stronger than the civil power? The civil power has been degraded by the War Precautions Act. That Act was passed on the understanding that it would have force during the war, not for three or six or eighteen months after the war. I have never defended a guilty man. Any one who is a traitor to Australia is a traitor to my country, which, with me, comes before England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales. But the war is ended. We are no longer fighting with Germany, with Austria, or with Hungary. </para>

                                <para>- My seat is safe, I suppose, because I trust the people, and have given them the right to recall me if they wish to do so. For between thirty-five and forty years I was a member of a German workmen's club here, and in its gymnasium I developed the comparatively large chest which I possess, and which, I believe, saved my  life the other day. When the authorities proposed to close that place, I introduced a deputation to that superfine gentleman, the ' Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who said- that there was nothing against the management of the . gymnasium, but that on account of difficulties that had arisen in Melbourne, it was thought well to close it ; so the place was closed, with a mortgage upon it. Over thirty young men of German parentage went from it to the Front; to Gallipoli, to France, and elsewhere; and many of "them will never return. My Democracy was taught to me by old members of that club, and if they had their way, there would be neither Kaiser nor King on any throne in the world. Now this Government is trying to rob the club by offering a paltry £8,000 for a property for which £10,000 has been offered. I sent the figures to the Minister, and asked that this wrong should not be done. People fought not to be ' forced to the Law Courts to get their rights. The Government does nothing for ,the physical training of the young men and young women of this city,; but hundreds of nien owe their fine physique to that club. The members of the City of Melbourne Swimming Club, of which I am  president,  have started a -free gymnasium, in the hope of doing good in this way. As a medical man, I say that the closing of the gymnasium to which I referred put a blot on the escutcheon of the Defence Department. By some persons, no one having a German name, no matter how good he may be, is regarded with honour. Lieutenant-General Monash is a good Australian, who proved his qualities on the field, but the gilt-spurred roosters in the Defence Department do not give him his rights, because he does not belong to the little gang that has the ear of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The House, however, will not allow him to be passed over.  I have had a quarrel with him, and would like to know who wrote or forged his name to a telegram in regard to Ozanne, which was sent out here. </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw it. Our rules of debate need amendment ; we have not the freedom of speech that they have in the Senate. No man would dare to tell his constituents that he was opposed to any one having a fair trial. The War Precautions Act is being manipulated by the Departments. Within the past two or three days, thirty or forty regulations, all having the force of law, have been sent to honorable members. Not a legal man in the city can say that he has a grasp of the law created by these regulations. During the war, as many as 340 were issued within a single year, and this year about. 120 have been issued. They are turned out  like sausages from a machine. Andrew Fisher was an- honest politician. He gave his word that the civil law would be more powerful than the military law. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews),</inline> and myself fought continuously to make that certain. The promises made have been wilfully and brutally broken. No honorable member can now truthfully say that the civil power is not subservient to the military power. Is this to continue for all time? No honorable member would dare to tell his electors that he favoured allowing the military to be superior to the civil power. If men are guilty, let them be punished ; but if they are not traitors to our beloved Australia, do not send them away. What chance would a man of German birth have of sitting on the Ministerial bench? </para>

                            <para>.- After the great fight for freedom by our gallant soldiers abroad, it is strange that we should hear the Prime Minister pleading for the continuance in operation of an Act which abrogates <inline font-style="italic">Magna Charta</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act, and takes away trial by jury. I cannot understand how the supporters of the Government can justify their attitude to the War Precautions Act. It was interesting to hear the reasons put. forward by the Prime Minister for 'the passing of the Act, and to hear those given by members for allowing it to pass. It is interesting, also, to know their confidence in the then head of the Government, the Honorable Andrew Fisher: But I say that no honorable member believed, when the measure was passed,, that it would continue in force for at least eighteen months after the actual conclusion of hostilities. Goodness knows how much longer it may operate if the Ministerialists and the members of the Corner party allow it to do so. Under the Act, the Government has not only the power to deport, but possesses also a general power of legislation to which, before I sit down, I shall briefly refer. But I should like, first, to draw attention, as the Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has done, to section ,2, which shows clearly and definitely that it was the intention of Parliament that the Act should remain in operation during the continuance of the state of war, and no longer. Section 2 provided that the end of the war would be indicated by the issue of a' proclamation by the Governor-General in Council. The only power intended to be given to the Governor-General in Council by that sub-section was that of actually defining the time when the state of war ended, and the necessity for continuing the drastic powers that the Act conferred upon the Executive Government no longer existed. Some honorable members sitting on this side opposed the provisions of the original Act, but all honorable members of this party opposed entirely the amending Act of 1918,. which extended the War Precautions Act for a period of three months after the termination of the war, or until the 31st July, 1919, whichever date was the later. So that it cannot be said that any member sitting upon this side is responsible for the extension of the War Precautions Act, which gives the Executive the autocratic powers they are exercising to-day. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister of the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> says that even without the amending Act the state of war would continue until the Governor-General in Council issued a proclamation to the effect that the war was ended. A proclamation in regard to the termination of the war with Germany has been issued. It is admitted that hostilities with Austro-Hungary have ceased, and peace with that country exists, but on a technicality that the end of the state of war with that country has not been proclaimed, the '.Government put forward the contention that they are enabled to do all the un-British things that are now being done under cover of the powers contained in the War Precautions Act. I invite the attention of honorable members and the public to the manner in * which a superior Court of the United States of America deals with the matter of deportation. I shall, state the facts of a particular case as referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">New Republic</inline> in order to show how the Supreme Court of that great Commonwealth of the West regards the infringement of the rights of the individual. A man named Jackson, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, one of the " reds,'' and an alien, was arrested and ordered by the Bureau of Information to be deported. But in his behalf an application was made to the Supreme Court, the protector of the Constitution, for a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus.</inline> It is almost bracing to read the judgment of the Court. The Court ordered Jackson to be released, not on any ground personal to him, but 'on the broader ground that the whole method of seizure, trial, and deportation without due process violated the Constitution of the United States -of America. To the argument, supported by a passing dictum of the Supreme Court in an early case, that the constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizure do not apply to  aliens, Judge Bourquin replied emphatically - </para>

                            <para>To say you shall be exposed to unreasonable searches and seizure without warrant, and deprived of the due process Congress prescribes in deportation, because you are' an alien, is to say you are an alien because so found upon evidence secured by unreasonable searches and seizure and in' proceedings without the due process Congress has prescribed - a vicious circle and a grave danger to all, citizens as well as aliens. It invokes the age-long methods of tyranny to convict by unlawful means because you are guilty, and to condemn as guilty because you are convicted by unlawful means. It is impossible that by the dictum aforesaid the Supreme Court intends to or will sanction so dangerous and tyrannical a construction of the Constitution, virtually legalizing outrageous, cruel, and horrifying raiding, mobbing, and lynching like that at bar, in which both citizen and alien are sacrificed. </para>

                        <para>These are comments that are very proper to he read in this Chamber, because, according to this paper, they emanated from? a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States of America when dealing with the case of a despised alien, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, and one of the "reds," who was hounded from pillar to post, and finally ordered to be deported. The case produced the truly magnificent sentiments and eloquent judgment I have read. I am sorry that I have not a longer time in which to deal with that aspect of the matter; but there is another matter which I desire to mention, and that is the manner in which the Government are using the War Precautions Act for legislative purposes. On the 7th July this year, the Government issued a new regulation which abrogates a regulation made in March, 1918, in regard to shipping. Regulation 21 of 1918 provided " that all expenditure involved in the execution of these regulations shall be defrayed out of revenue derived from the operations of the vessels controlled by the Committee, and no charge shall be made on the. Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of that expenditure," Yet, on the' 7th July, the Government, without reference to Parliament, or without even laying the regulation on the table, legislated to repeal the old regulation, and to authorize the money that they had lost on the operation of the ships to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Without asking honorable members to say yea or nay, they made this legislation, in order, I suppose, that the Treasurer may get the .shipping accounts past the Auditor-General. When the Estimates are before us, we may or may not have an opportunity of discussing the matter. Money, apparently, has been lost on the- requisitioning of ships. Although large profits have been allowed by the present Government to go into the maw of the profiteering concerns which operate the ships on our coast and overseas, are the taxpayers of this country to be asked to pay out of the Consolidated Revenue the losses incurred by the holding up of the ships during the strike? This action was taken under the War Precautions Act, that was supposed to he passed in order to save the nation in a time of great danger. </para>

                            <para>. - In regard to the last statement made by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> amid the torrent of abuse he poured upon certain " profiteers who trade about our coast," I say that the money was paid because it had to he paid. It was a just obligation, and it will be for this House to say, very shortly, I hope, whether or not the money was paid properly. </para>

                                <para>- No doubt. This question of deportations has been raised rather late in the day. It is very singular that all this pother has been caused when the deportations have practically ceased. We did not hear the welkin ringing in denunciation of these proposals while all the previous deportations went on. It is only now, when a particular deportation is taking place. </para>

                                <para>- I believe I was more successful in finding the Prime Minister than the honorable member has been in finding certain other individuals whom he has been seeking. I sought, and I found. The honorable member sought, evidently, but did not find.; hence this particular howling in the House and its vicinity, and I wonder when the matter is to come to an end. Have you not made your protest? Did you not make it on the steps of Parliament House last night? </para>

                        <para>In regard to the American case quoted by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> the name of the unfortunate man concerned was Jackson. I fancy that an individual bearing such a name would be likely to belong to the British race. He may have been an alien so far as the United States of America was concerned; but, anyhow, the case does not apply here. First, I would ask the honorable member for West Sydney to tell us what became of the thousands of Industrial Workers of the World men who were deported right out of America. It is a matter of common knowledge. There is no country' which has treated the Industrial Workers of the World with such severity as the United States of America. We, in Australia, have had to suffer because of that policy. These individuals were not permitted to remain in the United States of America. They say that a great many of them found their way to Queensland while the honorable member for West Sydney was Premier of that State. </para>

                                <para>- It would take a keener point than that which I am making to penetrate the honorable member's skull. There is no parallel in the case which he quoted from the United States. There, the party concerned was not an alien who belonged to a country which was at war with America. Those individuals who have been deported from Australia were aliens, and were not merely aliens. The honorable member, however, stops at the point that this man in America was an alien. Therefore, his parallel fails. These men in Australia were aliens belonging to a country which was at war with our own. No country on earth has visited the Industrial Workers of the World with such severity as the great United States; nor do I know of any country which has treated with so much toleration as the British Empire those who set themselves against every interest that we hold dear. </para>

                            <para>.- The Minister for the Navy has not endeavoured to justify the action of the Government, any more than the Prime Minister sought to do so in relation to the administration of the War Precautions Act. Both right honorable gentlemen spoke in wide generalities and endeavoured to make it appear that honorable members on this side are responsible for the position in which we find ourselves. During the course of the censure debate last week the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> read the names of certain honorable members who had taken part in a division connected with the War Precautions legislation. To-day the Prime Minister also read the names from a division list. At the time the Bill was introduced no division was taken. Honorable members were unanimous that in time of war the Government should be clothed with great powers. </para>

                                <para>- There was no question put before this House, because honorable members were unanimous that Parliament should be clothed with powers to deal with any circumstances that might arise during a time of war. At a later period, however, there was a division, during the course of discussion upon an amending Bill. Honorable members on this side were constantly urging the Government then that, seeing that the war had virtually ended, there was no need or right to further administer the War Precautions Act. Let me call attention to a few remarks which I made on the 12th December, 1918, when discussing the amending Bill introduced by the Acting Attorney-General, the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> I stated - </para>

                            <para>We consented to the giving of this power to the Government in order to protect the Empire during the currency of the 'war. With the cessation of hostilities, the necessity for this measure, except in relation to a few matters, disappeared. As soon as hostilities ceased the Government should have proceeded to eliminate every regulation designed to secure the safety of the nation while the war was  actually  being waged. Instead of doing that they come forward with a proposal to continue the government of the country under the War Precautions Act. This Act has been responsible for the sowing of the seeds .of dissension in this country during the last two or three years. Once the people get into their heads the idea that the country is being governed, not by their direct representatives, but by heads of Departments, whose recommendations are approved by the Government, there must be trouble. </para>

                                <para>- The time has passed when this Act should remain in being. Surely, now that the war has ended, no one will argue that we should continue to exercise  war-time  powers. The Minister for the Wavy has just stated that the particular deportation which has been under discussion is practically the last. </para>

It will depend on circumstances. If it suits the Government, the Government will accordingly use it." It is time we returned to responsible government. We have been governed by a bureaucracy. Departments have' been set up, and have taken control, and this Parliament counts for very little. We cannot, apparently, get back to responsible government. The Government evidently think they can do just as they like. Familiarity breeds contempt. The Government look upon thi3 Parliament as a cypher.- </para>

However, the point raised by the Minister for the Navy has nothing to do with the question of legislation in this Chamber. I would remind him that, prior to the war, we always came before the head of the Government and besought intervention, in order to prevent, if possible, the precipitation of industrial disturbance. I recall that before I entered this Chamber I waited upon the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and upon the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in connexion with a trouble then pending. Those two Ministers received me and my co-delegates with courtesy, and did what they could to help us. The reference of the Minister now, therefore, has nothing whatever to do with the matter. It is a question of legislation. </para>

That is the position I took up on a former occasion, and I stand by it to-day. If there' are in Australia any persons who are working against its best interests, let them be tried, and, if found, guilty, dealt with. </para>
                        <para class="block">An attempt has bean made to show that we are making this appeal on behalf of a certain person. That is not so. Hundreds of people, about whom we have heard nothing, have probably been deported since the war began. I learn with surprise that 126 children have been deported from Australia. Will any one argue that little children would be guilty of disloyalty? </para>

                                <para>- The trouble is that the Government do not give us information regarding these matters. Why does not the right honorable gentleman tell us exactly what has occurred in regard to these deportations ? Why has not his leader told us everything? If the facts were put plainly before us there would be no possibility of misunderstandings. Mistakes must occur when the facts reach us in such a round-about way. These are matters of public importance, but the Government give us no information in regard to them. The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> now tells us that these little children went away with their mothers. I want to know whether the circumstances warranted the deportation of the mothers. There should be a fair public trial in every case, so that' we may know who are guilty of acting against the best interests of the country. It would be just as well if those who are prepared to work against the interests of Australia were somewhere else. </para>

                                <para>- Unfortunately, I do not. The fact that I, although a member of this House, have to make that admission, serves to illustrate the secrecy observed by the Government in the  exer.cise  of the powers conferred upon them by the War Precautions Act. It is this secrecy, amongst other things, that leads us to ask for the repeal of the Act. Eighteen months have elapsed since the cessation of hostilities; yet the Act continues to operate. No one knows what may be done under it to-morrow. The power rests entirely with the Government. If they choose, they may continue it so far as one can see as long as they please, because no one knows when peace will be signed with Austria-Hungary. When the Act was passed it was not thought by one of us that it would be continued in operation, so long after the close of the war. We were under the impression that with the cessation of hostilities the Act in the main would be repealed, and an endeavour made to bring about in the community a better feeling. We find, however, that during the last eighteen months the Government have been guilty of action after action calculated to make public feeling even more acute than it was during the war. They are not healing but  aggravating  the wound by continuing this Act. The Government are setting man against man and woman against woman. </para>

I can do but little, but I have worked in the best interests of Australia. I have certainly not worked to its detriment, and the Government should also work in its true interests. They choose, however, to continue the operation of this Act, and, by virtue of the powers which it confers upon them,' do things behind the back of Parliament.

It would have been more to the point to emphasize the many cases coming under our notice of the abuse of that freedom, and the necessity for its punishment. No punishment meted out in this regard has been in respect of anything but the abuse of freedom. The Government have exercised their legitimate powers in discharging the duties placed upon them as an Executive. There can be no doubt as to at least two phases of this question, since they have been the subject of judicial decision. In the first place, the High Court has held that the War Precautions Act is in force. </para>

                                <para>- It was challenged, but we have now a legal decision on the point, and there is equally no doubt of the fact that the Government have legally exercised their powers in respect of any deportations that have been made. I was one of those who urged as strongly as possible last year that the Government should take the earliest opportunity to repeal the War Precautions Act, so far as it controlled or attempted to control commercial and trading activities. At the same time I urged that, in so far as it was necessary for the safety of the Realm, it should not be repealed until superseded by some law which would furnish that protection. The Government then undertook that they would not exercise the powers conferred upon them by the War Precautions Act in all the directions in which they previously operated it. But they agreed, as many of us urged, that it should be exercised to insure law and order and the safety of the Realm, and not repealed until superseded by some measure which would grant the requisite protection. That is the position which must be remembered. </para>

                        <para>There has been much learned talk in regard to the war having ceased for more than eighteen months. As a matter of fact, although, technically speaking, hostilities ceased some eighteen months ago, the war cannot be said to have ended until peace has been signed. A most eminent Committee was constituted in the Old Country and a Committee of equally eminent legal men was created in Australia to consider and advise on this and other questions, and the advice tendered by both Committees was that the " termination of the war " occurred at that particular point of time when peace was actually signed. Thus the war is still, technically, going on. If the Government had failed in its undertaking to cease the operation of the Act in its general scope, I should be one  of the first to bitterly complain. But I am also among the first to recognise that they have a duty to perform when they find that the safety of the Realm is challenged by reason of the poisonous work of any enemy of the country. They have performed their duty in the deportations which they have made, and they would have failed in the proper exercise of the powers intrusted to them had they not taken action. We have to look at this question from the driest legal standpoint. If the Government have exercised the powers conferred upon them by the Act in an unfair, unreasonable or illegitimate manner they should be challenged and dealt with. But so long as they are carrying out the duties cast upon them by the law, no fault should be found with them. </para>

                            BEST .^Unless the subject of an Act of Parliament, has the honorable member ever heard of a trial by jury as to whether a man should be deported or not ? The power of deportation was originally inherent in the Crown, although it fell into desuetude for a considerable time, but if I remember rightly it was directly involved in a case which occurred in Canada some ten years ago, which subsequently went to the Privy Council, when it was there held that this power was still inherent in the Crown. In an Act passed by the British Parliament in 1914, a provision was inserted stipulating that before any deportation took place, the necessary facts of the case should be placed before a tribunal appointed for the purpose, and upon whose report the Executive could exercise its power of deportation. I believe that this legislation was copied by the Commonwealth. At any rate, if I remember correctly, there was a Bill before the House containing that provision. I quite approve of the principle; but today we are dealing with a totally different matter. The honorable member for West Sydney
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline>
                            has referred to American legislation, and to the care exercised by the American Courts in the preservation of any rights that the citizens of the United States of America or aliens may possess; but, on the other hand, it may be said that no country in the world has more arbitrary legislation upon the subject than that passed by America during the period of the war. Even in regard to normal times, the American legislation in this respect is as arbitrary as that of the British nation; some might deem it more so. At any rate, its war legislation on the subject might be described as tyrannical - to adopt the word used by the honorable gentleman - as indeed it was essential it should be, and in any case there is no analogy between a step taken in times of peace and an operation carried' out under a war measure legally in force in Australia.

                                <para>- Persons may have been tried before juries on various offences which would render the offenders subject to deportation, but when the honorable member suggests that there should be a trial by jury as to whether a man should be deported or not, I say that such a thing is unheard of. I challenge the honorable member to produce a case io which it has been done. We are now dealing with the arbitrary provisions of a war measure, and the Government, having come to the determination that it was against the interests and safety of the realm to permit certain enemies of the country to remain here, have .simply exercised the duty imposed on them by deporting, them. </para>

                            <para>.. -  The honorable member . for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has challenged the honorable member for West Sydney to point to any other Government in the world that has granted trial by jury in regard to deportations; but if it is impossible to do so, it is only because there is no country in the world which has a Labour majority. All the Governments in the world have been constituted as our present Government is constituted. That is to say, they are not representative of the Democracy of their countries. This afternoon it was pitiful to see the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> running back to six years ago in order to explain a matter referred to by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> the other day, when  he took so much trouble to show how certain Labour members had voted on an amendment to the War Precautions Bill, moved by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline> The Minister for the Navy very conveniently overlooked the fact that in 1918, six weeks after the war had finished, the Labour party decided unanimously that the War Precautions Act should be repealed, and voted accordingly in this House, and consequently this party ought to be relieved of all responsibility for anything that has taken place under its provisions since then. </para>

                                <para>- That is absolutely incorrect. There was a Labour Government in power at the time, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, who was Prime Minister, gave the House the assurance that the civil law should prevail. He asked the Labour party, which he then led, to treat as inadvisable the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke, because it meant the combining of jury and military. On that occasion the honorable member for 'Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> asked a question in these words : "Will the civil power be dominant over the military power?" and before we voted on the matter the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> whom we had just followed back from an election, and' who was then true to Labour principles, gave us this assurance - " Yes, the civil power will remain dominant." We  voted with the Government because we believed that a Labour Government would be true to its pledge to preserve that plank of the Labour platform which gave trial by jury, and therefore our vote was one to insure trial by jury. So long as the leaders of that Labour Government remained true to their pledges they remained in power, but we kicked them out when they were false to them, and now the members of that Ministry;- with the exception of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> are sitting side by side with the Minister for the Navy, who formerly sat in opposition to them, and who is now violating the principle of trial by jury which we maintained when in power. </para>

                        <para>-The answer to the honorable member's questions is as follows :  - 1 and 2. The Commonwealth Government, in concert with the Government of Western Australia, has been in negotiation with the Fremantle Trading Company and with producers in that State for the establishment of cooperative lead smelting works; but certain producers insistently pressed the Government for a temporary removal of the embargo on exports in order to allow the sale of concentrates to furnish funds for the development of the mines, and the Government felt itself obliged to accede to this course. This delayed the progress of the Commonwealth scheme, as it was impossible to guarantee full supplies of concentrates for local treatment. The Government has always maintained the policy of local treatment, and is prepared to assist to the best of its ability any proposals for that purpose. </para>

                    <para class="block">In moving the motion, I ask the House to re-affirm a resolution to the same effect, though not in identical terms, as that of one which it came to on the 19th June, 1903, on the motion of the late  Hon.  G. B. Edwards. There is no need to go exhaustively into the history of the metric system. The principle of the metric system was first adopted in France in 1790, and in 1801 the National Assembly approved of a concrete scheme, but the system was not wholly in force in France until 1840. Since that time it has been adopted by all the great nations of the world, except Great Britain, the United States of America and Russia. Japan has sanctioned its adoption without making it compulsory, and within the last year or two China has made it compulsory. In Great Britain there is a gradual and steadily increasing agitation for the introduction of the metric system, and public feeling there is growing in its favour. Many years ago private individuals and associations endeavoured to have it brought into compulsory use. A Decimal Association was formed in 1854, and a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons in 1864 to make the use of the metric system compulsory for certain purposes. As the Government opposed that measure, a permissive Bill was substituted for it, and became law. But the Act was drawn with such extraordinary carelessness that an inspector successfully prosecuted a man for having in his possession metric weights, and when the case was referred to the Crown Law officers they advised that under the Act a man might legally use metric weights and measures, but was liable to prosecution if such weights were found in his possession. In 1871 a Bill to make the use of the metric system compulsory was lost in the House of Commons by only five votes, and in 1895 the Weights' and . Measures (Metric System) Act was passed, legalizing the use of the metric system in trade in Great Britain. Since then the matter has been frequently before Parliament. In 1901 a Bill was introduced to make the use of the system compulsory, but it was defeated by a narrow majority. In 1903 the Imperial Conference affirmed the desirability of adopting the metric system throughout the British Empire. In furtherance of that resolution the Colonial Office communicated with all the </para>
                    <para class="block">Colonies for the purpose of obtaining their ideas upon the question ' of whether this system should- be adopted. In Mauritius and Seychelles it had already been introduced. In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Gambia, Northern Nigeria, Gibraltar, Guiana, Trinidad, the Leeward Islands, and the Windward Islands the desirableness of its introduction was affirmed. I think that the resolution to which I referred just now is that which declared the need for adopting thin system so far as Australia is concerned. Sierra Leone, Southern Nigeria, Ceylon, and the Falkland Islands were prepared to introduce it, provided that it were adopted throughout the Empire. Fiji said that she would follow the- lead of Australia. St. Helena, Cyprus-, Lagos, -the Barbados, the Bahamas, and the Gold Coast were ready for its introduction, but anticipated that some local difficulty and opposition would be encountered.- Canada, the Bermudas, and Newfoundland sent no answer, but we may take .it that these places will be governed by the action of the United States in this matter. In other words, when the reform is adopted bv the United States it will be adopted by them. Although the system was thus indorsed by ii majority of the Colonies and Dominions, the various Governments of Great Britain have exhibited considerable neglect in regard to this matter. When writing in support of the metric system, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arnold</inline> Foster, in referring to the Governments of. Great Britain, said - </para>

                        <para>No Government now ever seems to do anything because it is right or wise or logical or scientifically correct. Changes are made, not  because  they are wise, but because they are unavoidable. The pressure of public opinion, and the fact that it is more difficult and tiresome to refuse a reform than to grant it are now, in !M) cases out of 100, the prevailing motives which influence an overworked Administration. . . . Our system of government has advantages, but it is not conspicuous by its readiness to accept scientific opinion or to take a lead in any intellectual or scientific movement. </para>

                    <para class="block">I hope that that statement does not apply to Australia. I do not think that it does. It is because of that opinion that I am appealing to this. House to indorse the metric system of weights .and measures. When we recollect that every nation in Europe, with the exception of Russia, has made the use of this system compulsory, and that even Japan, in the march of her manufactures, ha&lt;s been obliged to sanction it, although it is only running to-day alongside her own ancient system of weights and measures, we ought surely to be impressed with its advantages. Japan has found it necessary to resort to the metric system in connexion with her trade in India. China, as I previously mentioned, has adopted it, but whether she will be able to enforce it I cannot say. Even in India, in very many cases, its use- has been made compulsory. Recently we have heard a great deal about the need for re-organization after the war in order that we may build up our industries and extend our foreign trade. I submit that to achieve our objectives we must use every means at our disposal, and certainly one of those means is to abandon our present archaic system of weights and measures in favour of -the scientific system which I am . advocating. The honorable member for Kooyong '(Sir Robert Best) smiles because I have characterized our existing system as " archaic." May I remind him that it has been described in much more emphatic language by other people. "Barbarous anachronism" was the description  applied  to it by one member of the House of Commons, and his description was not ruled out of order. The metric system is superior to our existing system of weights and mea.sures from the standpoint of every test that can be applied to it.

                            <para>- No. We use them because they have grown up with us. That is all we can say for them. The metric system has proved to be so much better in practice than our present system that since 1840, when its use was made compulsory in France, every intelligent country in the world, with the exception of the three I have mentioned, has adopted it. In the category of intelligent countries I include Australia, because as long ago as 1903 this Chamber unanimously affirmed the desirableness of adopting that system. Since then successive Governments have remained inactive, and apparently will continue to do so until they are compelled by the force of public opinion to take action. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, in 1903. It is significant that when this Chamber affirmed the desirableness of introducing the decimal system of coinage in the same year, the proposal was carried only by a very small majority, whereas the proposal in favour of adopting the metric system of weights and measures was carried unanimously. The metric system is better than the existing system because in the latter the units employed are of an arbitrary character. Some honorable members may reply that the metre is also an arbitrary system. Even if that be said, it cannot be denied that in our present system of weights and measures there are several arbitrary units as against only one such unit in the metric system. For instance, we have the dram and the gallon, the yard and the link, under the existing system, while under the metric system we have only the metre, which is the basis of the whole. </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that the metric system has only the one unit as against three or four independent units which are not correlated in any way under the existing system. The. litre, which is the unit of volume, is the cube of the tenth part of a metre; and the gramme, which is the unit of weight, is one-thousandth part of the weight of a litre of distilled water. So that all come back to the one standard of the metre. There have been many who have declared that they could find a better standard, but they have failed to do so. I advocate the. adoption of this system, not. because the metre is the only standard which can bc adopted, but because it is the one decimal system of weights and measures which is so universally used that it would be wise for us to fall into line with other countries rather than try to establish a separate standard length of our' own. The inferiority of the existing system of weights and measures is too plain to permit of argument. The multiples run through the whole range of numerals. We have, for example, 3 feet to the yard. Even the multiples are not all integral, some are fractions. For example, there are 5-J yards in 1 rod, pole, or perch. So that, instead of having one decimal system rising by tens, we have an arbitrary system, under which 12 pence make a shilling and 20 shillings make a pound, while 3 feet make a yard, and 12 inches make a foot. In all these arbitrary subdivisions in the existing system of weights and measures we find further argument in favour of the simplicity of the metric system. It is so simple that there is no difficulty in acquiring a knowledge of it. ' It has been variously estimated that by the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures anything from one to three years will be saved in the education of our children. The Director of Education in Western Australia expressed the opinion that the saving would amount to two years of a child's educational life. Some time ago New South Wales appointed a Commission to inquire into educational systems, and that Commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> was a member, recommended that for the present the metric should be taught alongside the existing system in order that the children might become familiar . with it. Arithmetic to-day is sheer drudgery and devoid of all intelligence. The fact that the introduction of the metric system would re- . suit in a great saving of labour in connexion with education is a. strong argument in its favour. I have already era- 1phasized the extreme simplicity of the system and the ease with which it is un- 'derstood. Gradually it is commending itself to the whole world. I said that America, Russia, and the British Empire are the only countries in the world that have not adopted the metric system, but I omitted to say that both Great Britain and the United States have le- ' galized  the system, although they have not made its adoption compulsory. We in Australia have waited too long for a lead from the Mother Country, and the  time has come for us to do the right thing in the interests of our children, our trade and commerce, and the general advancement of the Commonwealth. One of the great objections urged against the system is the expense and the disorganization of existing relations which it is feared might follow its adoption. It is interesting to read a statement made 'by Professor Ross, of the Perth. University - </para>

                        <para>The chief opposition had come from engineers, the 'Lancashire textile traders, and shopkeepers. Since 1907, however, engineers had in many cases voluntarily adopted the metric system, and the great engineering societies now approved of the scheme. The question of the Lancashire cotton goods production had been carefully examined, and it was now recognised that there would be no need to alter the 750,000 looms, as the quarter variation allowed each" way in spinning numbers allowed adjustment to metric "counts. Moreover, the action of the East Indian buyers of silk and cotton yarns in insisting on metric numbers would now simplify manufacturers' work if  the metric system were adopted. Professor Boss gave interesting particulars- of inquiries he had made into the cost of alteration of weighing machines in the city of Glasgow shops. A few years ago, out of nearly 25,000 weighing machines in use, from 85 to 86 per cent, were beam balances, counter scales, or deadweight machines, and these would be unaffected.. Some 10 per cent, were platform or weighbridge instruments, and these  would  require alteration of the steelyard or dial. Spring balances and steelyards only amounted to 3 to 4 per cent., and while they would be rendered useless, the cost of replacing them was not great. From figures supplied by Messrs. W. and T. Avery Ltd. it had been calculated that a change to the metric system would entail an expenditure amounting to about 8 per cent, of the annual shop rental in the case of butchers, 4 to 6 per cent, in the case of grocers and fruit and vegetable dealers, 2 to 3 .per cent, in the case of hardware merchants, and under 1 per cent, in most other cases. These figures had been calculated on statistics compiled in Glasgow; but the percentage would probably be lower in Australia,  in  view of the higher rentals and despite the somewhat larger number of spring balances. </para>

                    <para class="block">These facts tend to prove that the objections are not insurmountable, and that the time has come for us to take action. The metric system, in spite of the opposition to it, has, by its qualifications for meeting the needs of the day, forced itself upon the greater part of the world. Over 450,000,000 people are to-day using the system, and, in addition, between 200,000,000 and 300,000,000 have sanctioned its use, though they have not made it compulsory. If we are to gain and hold that place in the trade of the world which we so earnestly desire, we must adopt a system of weights and measures which is scientific, and which will be a help rather than a handicap to us in the' attainment of our objective. As long ago as 1860 Richard Cobden,', having been sent to France to arrange the details of a Treaty with that country, experienced such difficulty through the lack of an identical system of weights, measures and moneys that in his last speech in the House of Commons he said - </para>

                        <para>.- 'I have pleasure in seconding the motion, although I confess that I am not sanguine that it will be carried with any great amount of enthusiasm at the present time." In spite of all our pretensions to be an advanced people, we in Australia are a very conservative community in many ways. In some regards conservatism is an eminently good thing, but it seems to me that a considerable amount of ingenuity is required to discover anything to justify the continuance of the present remarkable methods of calculating and naming our various weights and measures. Any one who takes .the trouble to study the history of these will realize, in what a higgledy-piggledy fashion they have grown up; they have been forced upon the community by sheer custom. Custom is a very strong influence in any community, and probably it is as strong in a British community as anywhere else in the world as regards adherence to things which our fathers, grandfathers, and even great grandfathers, regarded as eminently suitable in their time. </para>

                            <para>- Commercial competition is becoming so keen in the world now that the British Empire cannot afford to put aside any method by which its inter- course with other parts of the world, with regard to trade and commerce generally, will be facilitated. It is .admitted by nearly all business people who have international relations in trade, that our present system of weights and measures undoubtedly offers a somewhat serious obstacle to the prosecution of trade relations with other parts of the world. It is quite true that up to the present we have had a large share in international trade. That has not been due to the existence of our remarkable method of weights and measures, but has been achieved in spite of it. Any one who has given consideration to the simplicity of the metric system, and places it alongside the very complicated and unscientific methods that we have in vogue at the present time, will realize the tremendous advantage that the more modern and more scientific system gives in any kind of international trade whatever. America, it is quite true, has not seen fit to adopt metric weights and measures, although it has adopted decimal coinage. There will, admittedly, be in the change a considerable amount of difficulty to many, and a considerable amount of confusion; but any old-established' custom necessarily implies some difficulty in changing it, and sooner or later those countries which adhere in such conservative fashion to the old methods of reckoning weights and measures will have to put them aside. If such is the inevitable future, then we may fairly argue that the sooner these difficulties are faced and overcome the better. It is largely a matter of prejudice that has to be overcome, and it is not always reason which overcomes prejudice. It is the force of circumstance that does so, and probably the change will come only when we of Australia, in common with other parts of the world, realize that we are falling behind in competition with more scientific nations in the effort to win or retain the world's trade. Then we shall have the change. But it is the duty of those who believe in the change to urge it as often and- earnestly as they can, so that we may not lose way in the course that the British Empire has successfully maintained in the world's trade up to the present time. </para>

                            <para>. -  If the metric system had a percentage of the virtues assigned to it by my good friend the proposer of this motion, I am certain that the benighted British Empire and the United States of America would not be found at the present time not only rejecting it, but strongly protesting that to adopt it would be seriously detrimental to their best interests. Many who have given great consideration to this subject regard the metric system as a glorified fad. ' No doubt, that view may be the result of strong prejudice, but it has never yet been established, from a real, sound, practical stand-point, that the metric system would be more suitable to the necessities of the British -speaking people than the system of weights and measures which has been in vogue for such a lengthy period. As a matter of fact, it has been adopted by various nations, as has been mentioned by the proposer of the motion, but it has been only partially adopted in most of the countries to which he has referred, and even in France it is worked side by side with the British system. In France, they have their measurement of the inch just in the same way as they have the measurement of the metre; but in America and Great Britain, where there has been a considerable agitation in favour of it, it has never been put into actual operation to any substantial or serious extent in the way of trade, notwithstanding the fact that it has been duly legalized, and can be operated voluntarily. The metric system suffered a blow when it was definitely established that the .metre, the unit of the system, did not represent a definite portion of the earth's surface. It was supposed to represent, if I remember, rightly, one-ten-millionth part of the quadrant of the earth. It has been conclusively demonstrated and established that this new unit, which really forms the basis of the metric system, is not a natural one, or a definite portion of the earth's surface, as claimed, but is a mere arbitrary assessment, in precisely the same way as are the inch and the yard and our various other measurements. </para>

We must not consider either system from the point of view of fads or theories. It has been dealt with very effectively in much literature that has been recently circulated. It is a singular fact that some little time ago there was initiated in San Francisco a hurricane campaign in favour of the metric system, and propaganda literature was spread throughout the length and breadth of America. It aroused the people of America to a very great extent, and the manufacturers became dismayed at the possibilities of it being seriously considered. The <inline font-style="italic">Iron Age,</inline> a well-known and ably conducted magazine, took the trouble, in order to bring' the matter down to actual practical considerations, to show the chaos that would be involved in daily life. These are a few illustrations, just to show what the metric system would mean in ordinary every-day affairs - </para>

I desire, however, to specially bring before the House the fact that this question has been the subject of a very careful and close investigation by a British Committee of experts appointed to inquire and make recommendations to the British Parliament. The Committee in its report dealt with all the claims that had been made for the system and the effect of its operation on British trade.

                        <para>Having given very full consideration to the subject we are unable to recommend the compulsory adoption of the metric system in this country. In our opinion, it is absolutely certain that the anticipated uniformity could not he obtained for a very long period, if ever. There is, further, the serious objection that if we induce the above-mentioned countries to change over to the metric system we should be surrendering to Germany the advantage which our manufacturers now enjoy over hers, both in their markets and our own. We aTe informed that even in France, which has made the metric system nominally compulsory for more than halt-a-century, the  "pouce"  (or inch) is used in textile manufacture, and numerous local measures still survive. </para>
                        <para>In referring to these considerations, we have to point out that there is no unanimity even as to the theoretical merits of the metric system as compared with our Own. The practical argument that its adoption is desirable, in order to secure uniformity in the markets of the world, has been shown to be unfounded.

There is scarcely a Chamber of Commerce or a combination of manufacturers in America which did not take up a strong and decisive attitude on the subject. The threat was made by Representative Vestal that he would introduce in Congress a measure having for its object the compulsory adoption of the metric system. A howl of indignation followed the announcement. Merchants and manufacturers showed that such a change would mean a loss of billions of dollars to them.; that it would mean " scrapping " the whole of their machinery and the disruption and disorganization of their trade. Various institutions took up the proposal, and the outcry against it was so strong that the Bill, although introduced, was abandoned. The proposal was pushed as far as possible by those who favoured the metric system, but the Bill was not proceeded with. The disastrous effect that the change would have on American trade was proved most conclusively. The American Institute of Weights and Measures advanced five arguments against the compulsory Bill before Congress - </para>

                            <para>- They know exactly what they are doing. When it was felt that this radical change was about to be made the manufacturers were aroused, and it was due to the strength of their protest, notwithstanding the concentrated effort of the other side, and the opportunity offering to bring the matter before Congress, that the advocates of the metric system were overwhelmed, and the proposal to make the change was never proceeded with. The point I wish to make is that it would be well for us to know when we are well off. Our present system of weights and measures has served our purpose remarkably well. The merchants and manufacturers of America, and of the Mother Country, are possessed of sufficient ability and business acumen to be able to realize what will best serve their interests, and I venture to say that when they are convinced that the present system can be improved upon then will be the time to make a change. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not propose to discuss the motion at length. The metric system must ultimately be adopted. I fully support the motion which has been submitted. I  wonder whether the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has any idea of the number of different bushels in use in the United Kingdom. Would the honorable gentleman be astonished to know that there are in use in the United Kingdom no less than 1,000 different varieties of bushels, or would he be astonished to learn that at one time 20,000 different bushels were in use. To-day it is very hard to say what the weight of a bushel of wheat will be in the different States of the Commonwealth. A bushel of wheat of fair average quality may range in weight from 58 lbs. to 62 lbs. or 63 lbs. No one can definitely say what a bushel of wheat will weigh next year, but if we adopted the cental for measuring wheat we should settle the question for all time. We should be able then to say what a cental of wheat will weigh 10,000 years hence. I am at a loss to account for the arguments adduced from the United </para>

                        <para class="block">States of America, where they _ have adopted the decimal system of coinage. Here we have to add up farthings, halfpennies, pennies, shillings, and pounds. The difficulties this gives rise to are eliminated altogether by the use of the decimal system of coinage. In 1880 I visited Norway at a time when a change was being made to the metric system, and I found that the change did not cause any difficulty. The only experience I have had of the decimal system of coinage was gained in the few days during my passage through the United _ States of America, but with that experience I had no difficulty whatever in counting the Norwegian coinage. I may inform members that I went with a friend to a bank in Norway as he desired to obtain Norwegian currency. When he had been attended to I said that he had received £5 too much. He said, "You always know things. I think that must be an Australian characteristic." I happened to be the first Australian he had met. I said, " I assure you that you have been given <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> too much." He replied, " We shall go to the hotel quietly and count the money." He counted the notes that had been given to him three separate times, and then used paper and pencil, and said, " You are right." He embarrassed me by refusing to return to the young man who had served him, until next day. As an illustration of the courtesy extended to British people, I may say that when I asked the bank official whether he was not afraid that he had lost the money he said, " No, I knew you were English and would come back." There are thirty different varieties of bushels in use in the United States of America, and when I tell honorable members that they vary in weight from 14 lbs. to the bushel of red top and blue grass seed to 70 lbs. to the bushel of corn in the ear husked they will realize what a ridiculous system of measurement this is. </para>
                        <para>Professor Luff, who is now one of the shining lights of the scientific world iii London, has said that he could teach decimals to his students of chemistry in an hour, whereas it is impossible to teach all the combinations of the ordinary system of weights and measures in a lifetime. Let honorable members consider what a saving of time to scholars in our schools the adoption of the decimal system would effect. There would then be no compound multiplication, addition, subtraction, or long and short division. The adoption of the system would do away with the necessity for teaching about one-third of the arithmetic which is now taught to children, and which it is not worth their while to learn.

I commend the honorable member who introduced this motion, and, as I understand the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> in whose name the next motion on the business-paper appears, is absent because of illness, I think it would be well if his motion were considered along with that now before the House,and the two agreed to at the same time. </para>

                            <para>.- Unlike the honorable member who. has just resumed his seat, I am very pleased that the two motions are to be dealt with separately. One of the chief objections I have always had to proposals for the adoption of the decimal system of coinage has been that those responsible for them have always associated with them the introduction of the metric system of weights and measures. There can be no doubt that the adoption of the decimal system of coinage would save a great deal of trouble and time, not  only  in our schools, but in our offices. The principal objection to the metric system arises from the difficulties to which its adoption gives rise in connexion with the transport of goods. </para>

                        <para>I think it is right that we should commend the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> upon the research work indicated by his remarks in moving the motion now under consideration. There was one statement he made which seems to me to discount all that he said. He told us that practically all the. smaller countries throughout the world had approved of the metric system of weights and measures, but that the three largest - the British Empire, the United States of America and Russia - had all declared against it. The reason is very plain when we come to consider the question of the transport of goods over the enormous areas controlled by the countries referred to. For the transport of goods, the cubic system, if one may so describe it, is infinitely better than the metric system. Where you have measurements of four, eight, twenty-four, and so on, goods can be packed in solid blocks, but if you have parcels with measurements of five, ten, fifteen, they take up a tremendous amount of room, and are very much more difficult to pack for transport. This difficulty accounts for the resistance in the three countries referred to to the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures. </para>

I found that everywhere the cubic system was preferred by those handling goods, because, under that system, it is possible to pack stuff solidly, so that it will hold together. </para>

                        <para>The' honorable member who introduced the motion told us that in some countries the two systems are operated side by side. That. appears to me to be the solution of the whole trouble. The metric system can be advantageously applied to all goods that do not require to be transported, whilst the cubic system should be applied to all goods that have to be moved from one place to ^another. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has already traversed a good deal of the ground I intended to cover. The honorable member who moved the motion told us that the system in existence in Great Britain, the United States of America, and Russia, has grown up. But that is its recommendation. It has grown up from practical use; it has been found, by the people who handled these matters before the office became the controlling interest, and when the outside work was the chief matter of consideration, to he the most practical way of handling goods. Our present day civilization may have overcome the difficulties with which our forefathers had to contend, but we are not yet at that stage when we ought to allow the theory of the office to destroy the results attained by practical experience in the field. </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, he quoted authorities to show that the metric system did not have that support it was expected to receive from Commissions appointed in Great Britain and the United States of America. I must confess, however, that in the latter country the authority quoted did not appear to me to make out  a  good case. It demonstrated that already there is legislation in existence in America dealing with the matter, and permitting the extension of. the metric system to weights and measures, but  a3  we were not shown the extent of the exercise of that legislative power, it raised in my mind a feeling of doubt as to the actual result of the Commission's recommendation. The honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> has referred to transport difficulties, more particularly in regard to the packing of goods, hut there are many variations in the sizes of cases, and, as  a  matter of fact, it is largely a question of building one's case to suit the packages to be transported. </para>

It is merely a question of adopting the size of the case to the habits of the community.

                                <para>- When loading larger sizes for transport by sea, rail, or motor, it is not a question of cubing, it is  a  question of how best to stow the various sizes of packages to be moved. On the whole, I cannot see how any alteration in the system of weighing and measuring' would apply in this respect. While I was in France, it was a strange experience for me to nave to handle goods under the metric system, or to have to think of distances in metres and kilometres. But the method was not unworkable. My difficulty was only that I had not been accustomed to it. The mention of the French system leads me to remember that, although the United States of America have not adopted the metric system as applied to weights and measures, they have applied it to their coinage. I can hardly reconcile these apparently conflicting ideas on the part of the American people. It is a very difficult matter to explain the uneven gradations of our system to a visitor from a country where the decimal system of coinage has been adopted. We have first the halfpenny as the unit; we double that for the penny; we treble the penny to make threepence; we double the threepence to make sixpence; and double the sixpence to make the shilling; double the shilling we call the florin, and two and a-half times the shilling we call half-a-crown. With decimal coinage there is far less trouble. The gradations pass . smoothly from the cent to a hundred cents. </para>

                        <para>I am sorry that the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> has been prevented from attending here today because of a severe attack of influenza. He had given notice of the following motion : - </para>

                            <para>That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the Commonwealth adopt a system of decimal coinage based upon the British sovereign. ' </para>

                        <para class="block">And it appears next on the business-paper, as a result of an understanding between the honorable member for Illawarra and the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> the idea being that the two subjects, which are so closely connected, might be discussed on the one day. No doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would have been requested to permit of the two matters being handled together. </para>
                        <para>Unless some further effort is made to give effect to the motion submitted by the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden.)</inline> ,  its adoption will be merely beating the air. As the honorable member pointed out when introducing the subject, a similar motion was carried by this Parliament in 1903; and it is rather disheartening to find that -that unanimous vote of seventeen years ago has not, in the intervening period, received greater attention from those responsible for the control of the affairs of this country. Unless a serious effort is made to ascertain the feeling of the commercial community and the general public, it is idle for us to agree to this motion. We should follow such a step by the appointment of a parliamentary 'Committee of investigation, or by action on the part of those interested in the adoption of the metric system in an endeavour to popularize it, by a series of meetings, which would enable the attitude of the commercial community to be thoroughly determined. </para>
                        <para>I feel sure that strong reasons will bo advanced against the adoption of the decimal system of coinage, and that there will be hostility towards having two systems of coinage in operation at the same time; but it will be quite "practicable to bring about the introduction of the decimal value of our coinage. It will only mean the removal of a small percentage of the coins now in use. For example, instead of the shilling representing twelve pennies, it could very well be made to represent ten pennies; instead  of the sixpence representing six pennies, it could represent five, and so on. With the halfpenny as the unit, it would be necessary to have' a coin representing five halfpennies. </para>

                                <para>- It does not really affect the issue whether we start from the half-crown and work downwards, or start from the halfpenny and work upwards ; but I think it would be simpler to commence with the halfpenny as the unit and work upwards to five units, ten units, twenty units, and so on. Although honorable members may be averse to the metric system as applied to weights and measures, they might not take the same view in connexion with the decimal system of coinage. I commend this question to them for their serious consideration. </para>

                            BOWDEN  (Nepean) [6.211.- The honorable member for Kooyong
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline>
                            was scarcely correct in saying that Great Britain and th© United States of America had' condemned this system. As a matter of fact, they have been forced by circumstances to indorse it and are using it alongside their own system. The objection that the metre does not represent any definite portion of the earth's surface seems to me to be altogether beside the mark. The French authorities endeavoured to get the exact length of a quadrant of the earth's surface, in order to arrive at the ten-millionth part, and it has been demonstrated that on account of the scientific instruments then available to them a mistake in the calculations was made, so that it is to some extent true that the metre is an arbitrary measure. Nevertheless, this standard has been adopted by all the countries that have adopted the metric system. The honorable member for Kooyong said that France was running our method side by side with the metric system. That is true only in so far as certain manufacturing industries are concerned, because Great Britain and the United States of America want to buy according to their own systems. I have not read the report of the Commission to which the honorable member referred. I tried to get it, but it was not available. In reply to the argument that it would be impossible to enforce the system, I may point out that when Germany launched her manufacturing campaign to capture the world's markets in trade, she adopted this system, though at that time nearly every province had different weights and measure systems in operation. Within about five years - and certainly within ten years - the new system was universal in Germany. If such results as these can be achieved in Germany, surely they can be achieved here also? The objection that the adoption of this system will be playing into the hands of the Germans is on a parallel with arguments that were used in connexion with the break of gauge problem in this country. Some people contended that with a uniform gauge in Victoria and New South Wales certain articles of manufacture in Victoria would find a market in New South Wales, and, on the other hand, that the Riverina trade would certainly come to Victoria. We are now called upon at great expense to remedy the mistake then made. I was staggered at the argument that the decimal system has not the advantage of simplicity as against the system of vulgar fractions, because everyone knows that it is much easier to work a sum in decimals than in vulgar fractions. The honorable member for Kooyong has said that the housewife's tape measure would need to be altered. The other day, when I went to use my wife's tape measure, I found centimetres on one side and inches on the other, and if honorable members will look at the rulers which the children are using in our schools in New South Wales they will find that in many instances the centimetres are marked on one side and inches on the other.

                            <para>- I strongly object to the Government altering the order of business without giving reasons. It is due to the House to have some explanation. The Government, no doubt encouraged by their success in proceeding in an arbitrary way, are treating the House with absolute discourtesy. I came this evening fully prepared to discuss these notices of motion, and I am now informed by the Minister for Trade and Customs that the order of the business is to be altered. Surely honorable members are entitled to some consideration and courtesy. Why is it not necessary for the Minister for Works . and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> to proceed with his motion to have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1918? The second notice of motion is for the Minister for Works and Railways to have leave to bring in a Bill for an Act relating to industrial matters and the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. I ask the Minister in charge of the motions if he will not have the courtesy to give some reason why the order of business should be altered in this manner? I trust honorable members will see that they are not treated in this cavalier fashion. The Government have been going on for a long period doing exactly what they like without consulting Parliament or giving any reasons for their actions, and when we object to this procedure we are told that we are wasting time. I am not wasting time, but protesting in the interests of the country. I shall not be treated in this way, and every time similar tactics are adopted I shall take the opportunity of protesting and endeavouring to get other honorable members to assist me. This is not the first time that this procedure has been sprung upon us, and the Government should give reasons to justify their action. Why should honorable members be asked to proceed with the consideration of the second reading of the Institute of Science and Industry Bill? </para>

                            <para>- This is the stage when we define the scope of the order of leave and what will subsequently be dealt with by the House. I wish to have something to say on the scope of the motions to be moved to enable the House to define the scope of the measures. It may be that the Government will introduce Bills, if these motions are carried, containing specific clauses, and owing to the order of leave being limited, it might become impossible for honorable members in Committee to move amendments which we desire to include. I object to these motions being relegated to an obscure position to enable them to be rushed through without discussion. They are of the utmost importance, and, no doubt, other honorable members will be actuated by the same motives as I am. </para>

                            <para>- The Government propose to depart from the order of business without assigning any reasons for doing so. This is the third time since the recent adjournment that they have treated the House in this cavalier fashion. Only last evening the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> asked, as a matter of urgency, that the business should be arranged in the form in which it now appears upon the notice-paper, and I protest against the action of the Government in departing from that arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- I made no reference to what the States were doing. I am dealing with the importance of the application of science generally to our undertakings. I take it that the Government will see that the work of the States is not only carried on, but is even assisted to a very much greater extent than at present. I am convinced that the cooperation of- the Federal Institute with the States will lead to a great amount of good for these engaged in our primary undertakings. I propose to quote a notable instance to show what better methods mean to this country. We are dealing with a measure which goes to the very root and foundations of our prosperity, because it means the education and advancement of our people. If we do not legislate for the benefit of those who are to follow us, the sooner we get out and allow "somebody else to come in who will do so, the better. </para>

                    <para>I desire to give an instance of the results of the application of scientific methods which relates in the first place to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> dairying industry, but the lesson can be applied also to all our undertakings. A demonstration was carried out in the Tweed and Richmond River country, in the electorate of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> The results are shown in the report of the Tweed and Richmond River Herd-Testing Association, and are really extraordinary. They show that the application of better scientific methods has been of the most salutary benefit to those engaged in the dairying industry. If those methods lead to increased production in Australia, surely honorable members will agree that it is a very good and desirable thing to adopt them to the widest extent possible. This particular instance was tha result of a competition which I started on the North Coast. The report is as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The figures in the " Hay " competition are compiled in such a manner as to embrace the Annual Statistics of the Council. 'During the year there were tested by the eleven associations in operation 285 herds, embracing a total of 17,348 cows- average 60.87 cows per herd. The official testers of the various associations possess certificates of competency granted by the Department of Agriculture, and the general manner in which they have performed the duties allotted to them is highly creditable. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The figures show that the cow which gave the lowest yield produced "S2 lbs. of butter, and the one which gave the highest produced 720 lbs. in the year. This means that, taking butter roughly at 2s. per lb., the first returned <inline font-style="italic">£8</inline> 4s. for the year, while the second returned £72 for, the year. If a result of that kind is produced by investigation and experiment, the benefits to the country must be great, and those engaged in industries must be- induced to give deep thought to their undertakings. If a wheat farmer averages 11 bushels to the acre, and it costs him 10 bushels to produce, he has. a profit of 1 bushel to the acre, but if 'by greater knowledge and improved methods he can produce an average of 12 bushels to the acre, he has doubled his income., I received the following letter from 'the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly,</inline> who was the Director of the Bureau of Science and Industry: - </para>

Your account of the testing qf herds on the northern rivers is really remarkable, not on  account  of its magnitude only, but on account of the results. That sort of thing must give a tremendous fillip towards the introduction of scientific methods. Keep the' ball rolling. With your influence among producers you can do a great deal. They would be less suspicious of' you than of the purely academic type of scientist. </para>

                    <para>I arn sorry the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> is not present to hear another instance which concerns operations in his electorate. The mining industry in our State has drifted into a condition of 'little or no production. One of the reasons, clearly, is that the most modern scientific methods are not being applied to the recovery of metals. The great Cobar mine in one of our most important mining centres, is now hovering on the brink of extinction. There is no reason why that should be so, or why the interests in that very important town should disappear, or why those engaged in production should cease to be so engaged. I am carrying on similar undertakings in that belt; and I suppose I am the only copper producer in New South Wales at the present time. By applying modern scientific methods to production, I am able to carry on profitably on the same values of ores as the Cobar people are unable to treat profitably, because they employ obsolete methods. </para>
                    <para>It cannot be denied that it is necessary to get this country into a new frame of mind. John Bunyan speaks of having seen a slough, which was named "Despond." There is undoubtedly a. feeling of despondency on the part of a great many of our people who are engaged in production. They see no hopeful prospect. What with price-fixing and legislative interference of various kinds, they do not know where they stand. Notice has been given of a motion by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> providing for the purchase, securing, and holding up of our wheat for future years. I am convinced that if such legislation is passed in Australia our wheat production will decrease. What the primary producer wants to-day is freedom. He wants the world's parity for his produce and nothing else. Unless we can secure that for him, and increased yields by the application of improved methods applied to agriculture, our production will go down. </para>

                            <para>- I am discussing the application of science to industry. Our water conservation schemes are among the greatest of our undertakings to aid the producer, but unless we have still further applications of science to primary production, I do' not know how many of our people will be able to carry on. Unless improved methods are applied to the cultivation of the soil those engaged in agricultural pursuits will either disappear from the land or require a guarantee as to prices. We all know that those engaged in. primary production work for hours which they never take into account, and if it were not for  the support they receive from their families they would not be able to carry on. All this is because of want of better methods. If we have further legislative interference with them we shall have to pay at least double the price demanded to-day for their products. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> at the last general election spoke of 5s. a bushel being paid for wheat. If further restrictions are imposed upon producers we shall have to pay1 not 5s. but 15s. per bushel. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I am satisfied that the States will not regard this as a measure designed to interfere with existing State institutions. If the Director, when appointed, has the good sense to consult and confer with experts engaged on behalf of the States in work of this kind, the States will hail with delight an Institute of this character, which will act generally for the  whole  of Australia, and co-ordination and co-operation will rapidly result from its creation. In addition to consulting with those who are engaged in our agricultural colleges, the Director will have to invoke the aid and advice of the Director of Education in one of our chief States. In other countries the work of an institution of this kind is carried right to the doors of the public schools. The impressionable mind of youth is interested and young people are so induced to further qualify themselves for the undertakings ahead. </para>

                        <para>In the field of agriculture we have agencies and instrumentalities fortunately such as no other country in the world can show. The Department of Agriculture is, undoubtedly, the greatest practical and scientific agricultural organization in the world. Its total annual budget of $40,000,000 (£11,794,872) has been  increased  during the last four years more than 72 per cent. (£20,287,179) approximately. It has a staff of 18,000, including a large number of highly trained experts, and alongside of it stand the unique land-grant colleges, which are without example elsewhere, and the sixty-nine State and Federal experimental stations. These colleges and experiment stations have a total endowment of plant and equipment of $172,000,000 (£44,102,564), and an income of more than $35,000,000 (£8,974,395), with 10,271 teachers, a resident student body of 125,000,- and a vast additional number receiving instruction at their homes. Counting agents, joint officers of the Department of Agriculture and. of the colleges, arc everywhere co-operating with' the farmers and assisting them. The number' of extension workers under the  Smith-Lever  Act and under the recent emergency legislation has grown to 5,500 men and women working regularly in the various communities, and taking to the farmer the latest scientific and practical information. Alongside these great public agencies stand the ; very effective voluntary  organizations among the farmers themselves, which are more and more learning the best methods of co-operation and the best methods of putting to practical use the assistance derived from governmental sources. </para>

                        <para>The education which the farmer needs is that which will give him more real appreciation of the progressive and scientific spirit of the age in which he lives; will arouse a keen interest in the facts and principles of science as related to his vocation; will show him that in agriculture there is ample opportunity for life-long study which may refresh and delight the mind, as well as minister to material success, and in general will lift agricultural practice out of drudgery into a domain of intelligent and hopeful labour. This is our hope in Australia. Ocassionally wo hear disparaging remarks as to the lack of appreciation of modern methods by our farmers - their narrow conservatism and indifference, but such are wrong. All honour is due to our pioneers who have suffered isolation, who, with stout hearts, industry; and extraordinary patience, have bravely made homes under the most adverse and discouraging circumstances. The dull routine of the untrained farmer must cease with his generation. It is our duty to see that his children are not deprived of refinement and culture, and are given that conception of advanced ideals which education alone can convey. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I need not quote further. It is quite clear that, in connexion with modern advanced ideas on the subject of agriculture, education has taken root, and is bearing fruit most abundantly. If we are to succeed in Australia, we must apply the same methods as those which are being applied so successfully elsewhere. I am convinced that, before very long, we must send a representative Commission to the United States of America to inquire into these undertakings, in order that we may be able t o adopt the scientific principles which are being successfully applied in those countries where modern conditions obtain. </para>
                    <para>It is said that war is the foundation of all the arts and sciences that belong to mankind. If that be so, we have surely had sufficient war recently to have brought into existence a great many new arts and sciences. I am satisfied that if our people generally will apply the arts and sciences to undertakings in Australia, we shall very soon find our affairs in a very prosperous condition. I am convinced, as I am sure my honorable friends opposite must be, that the . time has arrived  when we must eliminate from our counsels the extreme men on both sides. The old Tory must go, and the extremist on 'the other side must also go. The time has come when we must find the key to open- the door to enable common sense to enter .and deliberate upon what is the best to be done for this country. I trust that honorable members will realize the gravity of this question ? I hope that they will consider that this measure is designed to benefit their children. Education will form a very important part of the work to be done under it, and I personally hold the view that the man who will not support a measure of which education is a prime feature is not of very much use to this country. </para>
                    <para>I hope that when the Bill gets into Committee the Minister in charge of it will consider any reasonable amendment in order that when it leaves this Chamber it shall bear the hall-mark of the approval of the people, and if it does it will be of great advantage to Australia. </para>

                    <para>I opposed the Bill that was before the House on the last occasion, but I did not do so because I was opposed to the spread of scientific knowledge or the application of science to our primary and secondary industries. I believe in that thoroughly. I believe that the application of science to our primary and secondary industries is not only useful, but absolutely indispensable. I know from practical experience that it is indispensable to primary production. I opposed the last measure of this kind because, with several other honorable members, I was not satisfied that the proposed Bureau of Science and Industry would be conducted, not in opposition to or antagonistic to, but in co-operation with, similar institutions established in the States. If instead of hampering or limiting the results of State activity, it is designed to supplement them and to secure' economy by preventing overlapping, it will give us the best assurance of good results. There was a suspicion 'in my mind, and in the minds of some of my friends in this House, when the original Bill was introduced, that there was a desire to create a big central Commonwealth Department. I have no fear of that to-day, because we have had the fullest assurances that that is not intended. If I thought that was intended I should oppose this measure. </para>
                    <para>The time is ripe for development. The honorable member for New England in commencing his speech last night said that when discussing these matters with the producers of the country he preferred to speak rather of " improved methods" than of scientific methods, because rural producers seemed to have a considerable objection to science as he understood it. I want to say Chat so far as rural producers in South Australia, and I believe in Australia generally, are concerned that prejudice against the application of science in rural industries is gone completely. </para>

Than feeling of prejudice has disappeared now, and the farmer, generally, not only believes in the 1 application of scientific methods to his work, but is satisfied that he cannot succeed without their application. As the honorable member has pointed out, we cannot hope to grow wheat in this country with success unless we apply the most improved methods. </para>

Without the exercise of that spirit of co-operation this institution will not be a. success. .The attitude of the Minister who' will be in charge of this branch of the Commonwealth's activities should be " the Commonwealth for all," and not " the Commonwealth over all." The display of that spirit of co-operation ought to lead to the achievement of the very best results for Australia. </para>

However, in such matters there are often mistakes on both sides. There must be give-and-take on both sides, if success is to be achieved. More than one honorable member has raised the question of economy; but the expenditure on this institution, if it be conducted on right lines, will be real economy. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for New England has  refered  to the splendid work done by agricultural colleges and agricultural schools in the various States, work which has contributed enormously towards increasing the wealth of Australia; but these colleges have not done all they are capable of doing, and no one knows it better than those who are responsible for them. For one thing, they have not the best equipment that they might have to enable them to do so. There is room for great improvement in the matter of scientific education, and, at the same time, room for the exercise of real economy in the direction of co-ordination in regard to detailed expenditure. </para>

I am not satisfied in my mind that there was sufficient reason for the step which has been taken by such an eminent man who has rendered excellent service during the past three or "four years, but I am glad to know that the great body of men throughout the States who have been associated with the promotion of this good work, and to -whom Ave are indeed grateful for the <inline font-style="italic">great</inline> assistance they have given to the Commonwealth, are earnestly desirous that it shall proceed.

                        <para>.- While T indorse what every honorable member who has spoken to the measure has said in regard to the great need for applying science to our industries, both primary and secondary, I arn not satisfied that we are doing the best we possibly can to give assistance to those industries by the establishment of an efficient institute of science and industry unless we are assured by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> that there is some clear understanding between the States and the Commonwealth Government as to the work it will carry out. It is idle to say that we ought to have co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. We all realize the necessity for that. If we pass this Bill we shall be establishing another Department; and, as honorable members must know, there will be no limitation to its extension. At present we have in the States all the institutions necessary for the development of our industries; and I want to know what scheme the Minister has in mind for the co-ordination of all this very important work. It is idle to say that this country is faced with a very heavy financial responsibility, if we are not prepared in connexion with this Bill to prevent the establishment of another Commonwealth Department, because this will not' only involve the Commonwealth in unnecessary expenditure, but will cause friction between State institutions and this proposed Commonwealth Institute. I believe the Minister's intention is to secure coordination, but we know what happens in practice when we .set up a new Department. I feel sure it will not be long before the Commonwealth Institute will be working side by side with the State institutions of a similar nature. </para>

                            <para>- What the honorable member says is quite true. If we cannot get their co-operation in the development of this scheme it will not be a success. Therefore, it would not be wise to pass the Bill before we arrive at some understanding on this important matter. It would be much better if the Minister would agree to take the Bill up to the Committee stage, and then, in cooperation with State representatives, devise a scheme that will not overlap the work that is at present being done. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite so sure about its location, but we do want one main institution; and I make the suggestion to the Minister, not in a spirit of antagonism to the Bill, but in order to insure the success of the scheme. In the State which I have the honour to represent we have established a Department of Chemistry, which is doing very good work indeed. The creation of that Department was an administrative act of my own, when a member of the State Government, so honorable members will realize that I have a keen appreciation of the work of scientists, and if I offer opposition to the Bill in its present form, it is because I foresee the danger of proceeding with the scheme in the absence of an understanding with the various State Governments. Clause 12 provides that the Governor-General may - not shall - arrange with the Government of any of the States for the utilization of State research departments. </para>

Even now, in South Australia, there are two similar Departments, one controlled by the Commonwealth and the other by the State Government, building soldiers' homes, and by their competition making it more difficult for the men to secure homes. </para>

I was sorry to read an announcement in the newspapers quite recently to the effect that Professor Orme Masson has resigned, because if there is not to be a cooperation of. practice and science in this connexion our efforts .will be in vain, and the results, as negligible, as some of the opponents of this Bill hope. </para>

                    <para>I desire to congratulate the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay)</inline> on the excellent speech he delivered in connexion with this proposal, and especially would like to. mention the fact that he. has embodied .in. actual practice the value of science when applied to primary production,  and even to the secondary -industries of this country.. , He has demonstrated in 1 practice that the application of science to industry - especially to primary industries - is of great benefit'. He has also shown us' a method to burst up big estates, with satisfaction to the original owners and. profit to the country. On' his. own estate 100 freeholders are working happily and prosperously "under the most improved methods, simply be1 cause he has done what the Government is asking this House to enable it to do for the farmers throughout Australia - apply science and better methods to farming. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to be able to support the Bill, because I realize that , the existence of .such an Institute will bc of great benefit", to the Commonwealth. During the past four years the Institute has, unfortunately, been dragging on 'in 'a most unsatisfactory way, simply because it has been unable to receive proper consideration. ;at. the hands , of : the' Government and of Parliament. If the -Institute  succeeds the people of Australia will be able to take a proper perspective of our national needs. Recently I noticed a report in an Empire number entitled <inline font-style="italic">Finance'? and</inline><inline font-style="italic">Bullionist</inline> of last July, which showed that there has been in existence in Canada for the last eight or ten years a Commission, which, to all practical purposes, -is similar to the Institute we propose establishing. The work of this scientific Commission consists of .a proper tabulation of the country's resources, and in the issue of the publication to which I have referred, one page was allowed each Dominion to enable it to advertise its resources. Canada utilized its page by showing the number of million horse-power that could be developed by harnessing its wasting waters and the horse-power that had been developed. On the page allotted to Australia appeared a picture of Australia House in London, and underneath it a photograph of our High Commissioner. That seems to typify the different outlook that obtains in Australia in regard to these matters. </para>
                    <para>Much of the" opposition that has been hurled at this measure is due. to the fact that we have grown to regard - both in the press and in politics - the political rather than the essential side of our development as of most importance. Those who are opposing propositions such as this are always urging that it is economy not to spend money in this way, but they must remember that true  economy  is not to be effected by reducing wages, but by eliminating waste and securing the maximum efficiency from every effort that is put forward to increase development and production. To obtain the maximum efficiency from effort it is necessary that we should have full and complete knowledge of all the facts, and there is no way in which that can be done other than by means of organized research. I noticed that the <inline font-style="italic">A ffg</inline> newspaper five or six months ago referred to what it called the failures of  this  Institute. It showed how bread could be baked under an improved system, but took six hours longer; and how plates could be produced from a substitute for tin, but at a much higher price. These failures are due merely to inefficient methods and to insufficient support and under' different circumstances the more satisfactory results could be achieved; This is one of the most important measures that could occupy the attention <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> this Parliament, and it can be shown that on it not only depends the national development and prosperity of the Commonwealth and comfort of every  indivi-dual,  but the security of the Empire. </para>
                    <para>Travelling throughout the country, as I have had the opportunity of doing during the whole of my life, I have noticed the needless drudgery and waste that occur on farm, in mine, in every shop, simply because there has been no 'proper tabulation or indexing of the country's resources that would have enabled wasting powers to be harnessed to the service, of man. It seems scandalous that there should not be a means of bringing before the young minds of this country the opportunities of national prosperity simply because we have no such institution as that now proposed. </para>
                    <para>Take the' question of electricity. One can go to Japan, Canada, or Western America and then he will find that the water-power resources are tabulated, and in practically the smallest hamlet electricity is harnessed for the service of the people. In Australia that is almost unknown even in fair-sized towns, simply because the latent power in our waters has not been exploited. Our mineral beds have not been fully explored, their possibilities . have not been indexed, neither have they been brought before ' the responsible authorities. If ever there was a time when our national resources should be recorded it is surely now, when the war is over and we are on the verge of a new era. It is more than necessary at the present juncture that. we should have a national Institute to enable the whole of the facts to be placed before the people. </para>
                    <para>When I was in Canada I found that owing to the activities of the Federal Government ten or twelve years ago in establishing a national physical laboratory they had been able to convert iron ore, which contained a high percentage of sulphur, and which had been regarded as absolutely useless, into the best steel through the use of electric furnaces. That was accomplished as a result of the work of a scientific institute similar to that which we propose establishing here. The remarkable fact is that, although this was brought about by the activities of the' Dominion Government in Canada, by reason of the failure of private enterprise in the country to follow the Government's lead, Germany and the United States benefited. There are .other instances which could be quoted. For example, in the mines of Spain they found, that they had been .wasting 7,000,000 tons of sulphur valued at £14,000,000 simply because of the faulty methods employed in handling the ore. ' That has been corrected, "and now their sulphur is a marketable commodity. Only this morning a gentleman informed me that sulphur was not produced in- Australia, and he was desirous of having certain amendments embodied in the Tariff on that account. At Mount Lyell, and at many other copper mines in the Commonwealth, the whole of the . surrounding country is devoid of vegetation simply because the sulphur fumes are allowed to escape instead of being converted into a marketable product. The same is happening in the tin districts of  Tingah,  where they are also at the disadvantage of being unable to handle low-grade ores. Because of the want of co-ordinated Government activity which would supply our mines with cheap power, they are unable to handle ores which otherwise they could treat profitably. .Six or eight, months ago the owners of mines in the tin districts of New South Wales told the Government ,©f the State that if water-power were supplied to them from the Clarence, at a place about 70 miles away, they could employ 6,000 additional men, work three shifts, and save £125,000 a year in expenses, at the same time handling profitably " dirt " of about a quarter of the value of that with which they were dealing. There is continual waste for lack of the coordinate development of oUr resources. What is needed is a National Bureau for the tabulation, and indexing of the natural resources of the Commonwealth. , The war demonstrated, if demonstration were needed,  the  absolute and imperative, necessity for  such an  inventory-. .  As .the war pro,gressed .we found ourselves getting short of all sorts of things, many of which we could have supplied ourselves with very easily had applied science been used to come to our aid; At the present, time paper is costing perhaps 700 per cent more than it cost before the war, and it could be produced here at a quarter the price with proper encouragement. Now, associated with the production of. paper is a host pf minor industries, none of which has been established, here, but alL of which we should have were we producing news print on a proper, basis. Then, a few weeks ago, a big firm, that had a million of capital to invest, came to Australia, but, finding that there was here no tabulated index and record of our resources and situation of necessary materials such as is obtainable in the United States of America, Canada, and other parts of the world, went away, instead of establishing, works that would have been of great benefit to the community. </para>
                    <para class="block"> Members generally are, no doubt, ire' agreement on the principles of the- Bill ; but in considering it the question arises r Is the problem that we have to settle being .attacked in the best way? Have we already in existence agencies that can. do the work that needs to be done? If we have these agencies, are they adequate and properly equipped, and are they doing what should be done? To ascertain the exact position, we must find out what is being done by the States and by the Commonwealth, and obtain the opinion of independent experts who have studied the question that we have to face. The report of the Dominions Royal Commission, which was presented three or four years ago, is, in this regard, a very valuable document. Our next consideration must be the methods of procedure- followed in countries like Canada and the United States of America, where, as here, Governments control enormous territories. A moment's reflection "-must convince any one that what is needed is a Federal institution. The problems that, will require investigation are not bounded by 'State borders. Insect and other- pests' do not regard artificial lines of demarcation, but spread over wide regions, unhindered by the boundaries which mark the limits of State control. In the district which I represent pests are doing great damage to industries that are com- mon to both New South "Wales and Queensland. There are diseases affecting the sugar cane and the banana plants, and there is the tick disease infecting the cattle.. No doubt the State Departments are doing useful work; but a Federal institution is needed to gather up and coordinate the present departmental activities of the States, so that they may be utilized to the fullest extent. For want of co-ordination there is a shocking waste of effort, even in the Departments of a single State. We have scientific ' or highly trained men in the Departments of Agriculture, Works, Mines, and so on, collecting and tabulating data, and yet we experience the greatest difficulty in obtaining a complete and comprehensive statement of the resources of a . State. . About two years ago, when the paper shortage became acute, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> who was then Premier of New South Wales, suggested that paper might be manufactured in that State ; but no one Department of Government could supply information which could settle the question, and he had to appoint a Commission, whose members were drawn from five different Departments. There could not have been a more striking illustration of the need for coordination of the activities of the Departments of the State Governments. </para>
                    <para> In support of the measure, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has read the opinion of the late Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Peake),</inline> the Premier of this State <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lawson),</inline> and others, all of whom have asserted that the proposed Institute must be national in character if die .best results are to be secured from its establishment. Some four years ago scientific men from all parts of Australia met together and insisted that the proposed Institute should be national, and not provincial. I should be loath' to see established' an Institute which would be, to a large extent, administrative. Those connected with the proposed Institute will be engaged largely iri research work, and I hope it will be made completely independent of political interference. -.This, I understand, is provided for, though die machinery of the Bill seems- to me inadequately' outlined. We need, as the' honorable member- for Adelaide- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. -Blundell)</inline> lias said, to co operate first with the State Departments, and secondly with the Universities. The Institute ' will not require legislative powers, and will want very few administrative powers. Its work will be the collection of exact information, and its experts will have to deliberate upon, digest  and assimilate that information, so as to make it of practical benefit to the country. They will have to advise on all questions of policy ' which may arise in connexion with the active administration of our natural resources, their effective conservation, and economic use. But to obtain any satisfactory result the Government must be in possession of reliable data upon which to base their conclusions. In this connexion a comparison between the Commonwealth and the two great Federations of the United States and Canada will prove interesting. The middle western and far western States of America were settled at periods which exactly correspond with, those of our Australian settlement. A similar remark is applicable to Canada. The development of science has been so rapid during the past few years that even late-comers like ourselves are still able to get in on the ground floor if we act promptly. In 1906 or 1907 it was decided that a thorough inventory should be taken of the whole of the resources of the United States of America. Incidentally, I may remark that this was the first inventory ever taken of a nation's resources. The  President  of the United States called together the Governors of the various States, as .well as representative scientific men of those States; and these persons affirmed that the first practical step in the direction suggested by this Bill was to obtain a proper inventory of their own resources. They recognised that the question of scientific development and progress is one which concerns not only the country which is being developed, but also, its neighbours, and, indeed, the whole world. As a result, they asked that a North American Congress should be summoned. After a united conference, both Canada and Mexico moved in the same direction, with a view to  securing Institutes' of Science and Industry, which are practically on all-fours with that sought to be created under this" Bill:  Only the.. other, day the 'Americans-, decided to' summon a pan-Pacific Congress to meet at Honolulu next month, at which the whole of the scientific research workers on the shores of the Pacific, who are vitally interested in this matter, will be represented. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future date. </para>

                    <para>. -There is just one matter which I desire to mention, and to which I was prevented from referring earlier in the evening. Whilst; politically, we may disagree with each other there is no member of this House who can accuse me of ever having failed to use my best endeavours to induce an honorable member who had used unparliamentary language to withdraw it. At the same time, when an honorable member transgresses in the heat of debate, as many of us do, it is only fair that he should, after a brief interval for reflection, be allowed an opportunity to withdraw his unparliamentary language and to apologize for his offence. No honorable member should be suspended from the service of the House without first being offered such an opportunity. I cannot recollect any occasion upon which I have been named by the  Speaker,  although I have been threatened frequently enough, either deservedly or otherwise. But the point I wish to stress is that any honorable member who transgresses our Standing Orders should be afforded an opportunity of withdrawing and apologizing before being suspended from the service of the House. </para>

                        <para>- I quite expected my honorable friend was going to say that. He repeats the statement like a parrot about every other day. But I should like to say that I never received more consideration or courtesy at his hands than he has received from me. I do not believe that any honorable member opposite has ever received less courtesy than I did during the period that I sat in opposition. Yet I never squealed about what I got, though I used to get it "in the neck" pretty often. But I stood up to it. The honorable member knows that the case of. the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> is a particularly aggravating one. The latter indulges in the same sort of conduct almost every day of his life. However much I regret the incident of this evening, it must be distinctly understood that that sort of unparliamentary conduct must cease. I make every allowance for what takes place during the heat of debate. </para>
