            <para>- Iwish to make a personal explanation. I was absent from the House last week during a very important debate. My absence is recorded by the press, and it is stated that I did not vote on the motion for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon&#39;s</inline> expulsion. I desire to explain that I was making a visit of inspection to the Murray River irrigation settlements, and that although I left authority with the Government Whip to pair me, he was unable to get a pair for me on the divisionon that motion. I have no desire to shirk responsibility for any decision of the House, and I therefore say, for the information of the general public, that I would have voted for the motion to expel <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon.</inline></para>

            <para>- I was one of those who took part in the visit of inspection to the Murray irrigation settlements, to see what has been done there for the  returned  soldiers ; but, before going, I asked that a pair should be provided for me. I am  sorry to read  in the press that a pair was not obtained, and that, therefore, there is norecord of my attitude towards a  very  important motion. As I do not believe in sailing under false colours, I wish to say that had I been here I should, under the circumstances, have voted for the expulsion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mahon.</inline></para>

            <para>.- It was my privilege a little more than twelve months ago to introduce to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> what was probably the most representative deputation  of  trade union officials that had ever waited upon a Minister of the Crown in this  country- The deputation, which was representative of organizations that were loyal to the principle of arbitration, and anxious that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court should be a success, asked that the Government should appoint a Commission to inquire into the whole question of the minimum or basic wage, in relation to the cost of living. The Prime Minister agreed to the. proposal, and in the course of his policy speech, delivered at Bendigo, on the 31st October, 1919, referred to the matter in these words - </para>

            <para>Measures must be found which will insure that the minimum wage shall be adjusted automatically or almost automatically with the cost of living, so that within the limits of the minimum wage at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of necessaries of life. The Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated, during the war, and also bow the basic wage may be adjusted to the purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. The Government will at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. </para>

It held only one or twO&#39; meetings last year ; but it has since taken evidence, I believe, in every State in the Commonwealth. While Statisticians in many countries have prepared tables showing the purchasing power of the sovereign in relation to various commodities, I do not think there has been made in any other part of the world so complete an investigation on the subject as has been carried out by this Commission. I am asking that the basic wage, as determined by the Commission, shall be applied not only to public servants, but to the workers generally. It was the intention of the deputation which waited upon the Prime Minister that the basic wage as fixed by the Commission should rise or fall automatically according to the rise or fall of the cost of living, and should be the standard wage fixed in all arbitration awards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cheney,</inline> who was a member of the deputation, and was subsequently appointed to the Commission, put before the Prime Minister a comprehensive review of the situation, and said that the Arbitration Court Justices had asked that steps should be taken to provide them with a fair basis upon which to proceed in determining the rates of wages to be paid. Doubtless the agitation that has recently taken place amongst public servants has brought prominently before the public the work of the Commission. I am anxious that the report should be published and effect given to it, so that those who take their cases to the Arbitration Court will know that in any event the purchasing power of the minimum wage fixed will be as great as was the purchasing power of the minimum wage of 7s. per day originally decided upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Harvester case a good many years ago. The workers want to know where they stand, and if this can be done the position of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court will be immeasurably strengthened. </para>

            <para>. -  I am utterly at a loss to know why the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has moved the adjournment of the House ou this matter. He does not allege for a moment that the Government have received a report from the Basic Wage Commission. He has told us that this Commission was appointed in pursuance of a promise made by me when before the electors twelve months ago, and he admits that the Commission has not yet presented its report. The honorable member says nothing as to why there has been delay, but he hints that, for the last two months, the report has been delayed for some reason; he does not say so in so many words, but he infers that that delay has something to do with the Government. Let me put the facts quite plainly. When the honorable member waited on me, I told him that I had already brought the matter before the Cabinet, and that the Government were in favour of a readjustment of the basic wage to existing circumstances. I think the honorable member will say that I was entirely sympathetic - that I was, at least, as much in favour of that course as any man present on that occasion. </para>

          <para>I appointed the Basic Wage Commission as I had promised. The Commission has not been hampered in any way, but has pursued its inquiries without let or hindrance. It is, as will be admitted, a representative Commission. I myself, in this place, complained six months ago of the delay in the presentation of the report. That complaint, however, was regarded by honorable members opposite as a censure on the Commission, and I have refrained from saying anything in reference to the matter since. The honorable member for Yarra says that the report will be a comprehensive one. I hope it will. He has asked me to say what I propose to do. What I propose to do with what? With a report I have not yet received? I know nothing .of the recommendations of the report. It has not yet been presented. I cannot answer such questions. There is only one question I can answer, and I give it on the authority of the  chairman  of the Commission, who saw me on the matter last evening. I was asked last week by, I think, the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> when the report would be available, and I said that, in reply to earlier questions by that honorable member, or some other, I had informed the House that when I last saw the  chairman  of the Commission he told me ho thought the report would be presented in about three weeks. On that, I said I thought the report would be ready in about a week. As I say, the  chairman  of the Commission waited on me last night and said that &#34;the report would be available about the end of this week. When I receive it I propose to read it, and then pass it on to my colleagues. When we have had an opportunity to consider it we will come down here with a policy in regard to it. That is the position. I am not going to commit myself in any way, or take on myself any responsibility for delay; that responsibility does not rest on my shoulders. When the Commission presents its report, no time will be lost in dealing with the matter, and honorable members will have an opportunity to discuss it. </para>
          <para>May I remind honorable members opposite that when I put forward this proposal for a Commission at the election, they sneered at it. They had quite a different way of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. But they have lost the keys of .their paradise; they now say that this Commission is the thing to save Sodom and Gomorrah. When I receive the report, and it has been considered by my colleagues, I shall state the intention of the Government; more than that I cannot say. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> said in Sydneythe other day that twenty-five honorable members were going to vote for the adoption of the report of the Commission ; they do not know whether it recommends &#163;2 per week or not - all the same, they are going to vote for it. It has also been said that &#39;the report has been presented and sent back to the Commission. There is ,.not a word of truth in that allegation. I have not seen the report, to say nothing of sending it back. I know no more than Adam what is in the report. The  chairman  of the Commission last night point blank declined to. indicate, even approximately, what are theintentions of the Commission. </para>

            <para>.- A very undesirable state of affairs prevails at present throughout the Commonwealth Public &#39;Service. Discontent is rampant. At the earliest possible moment the Government should give favorable attention to the findings of the Basic Wage Commission, when its report shall have been tendered. I desire to refer to certain branches of the Defence Department, and to deal especially with the case of employees in Ordnance Stores. These men arte chiefly returned soldiers, who are married. Their pay is considerably lower than the wages of permanent employees of the Defence Department, and is a great deal less than the rates payable to men doing similar work outside of the service. I have received considerable correspondence in this matter, and have been furnished with full information concerning the men&#39;s grievances. I direct specific attention to the situation at the Ordnance Stores, Keswick, South Australia, but I wish to mention that similar conditions prevail in other ordnance stores throughout the Commonwealth. At the South Australian stores men are engaged as temporary labourers, but they do the work of storemen and packers. They do not receive even a labourer&#39;s pay. They are getting nearly five shillings a week less than the poorest paid labourer in the land; yet they are returned soldiers and married men. For  a similar class of employment the minimum rate of pay in wharf stores is &#163;4 14s. per week. The temporary employees at Keswick, however, are receiving only &#163;3 10s. 6d. I should mention that after they have been engaged for six , months in the service of the Department and are deemed suitable for their work, they receive an additional 2s. 4d. per week. Even then there is, of course, a grave difference between the weekly wage of &#163;3 12s. lOd. and of &#163;4 14s. Altogether, the position is anomalous. Commonwealth laws, passed by the Commonwealth Government, control wages and conditions in employment generally throughout the land. The Commonwealth Government  require  private employers to pay certain rates of wages and to observe specific conditions of employment; yet it appears to me that the Government almost without exception endeavour to evade those same responsibilities in respect of their ;own employees. The temporary hands at Keswick forwarded a petition to the responsible Minister on the 26th September last, but they have received little or no satisfaction as an outcome of their fair and proper representations. These men, when they complain of their conditions and point out that they are not receiving the consideration which the Government force private employers to observe, are told plainly enough that if they are not satisfied they should know what to do. That is net the right attitude for the Commonwealth authorities to  adopt  towards their returned soldier employees. There is a regulation having to do with the civilian staff as follows : - 86a. Temporary employees shall be paid the rate of wages prescribed by law for the trade o or calling in which they are employed ; providing that where no statutory rate exists the chief officer shall record, and the Minister will prescribe., the wages to be paid; and provided that the Minister may, under special circumstances, prescribe special rates of wages, allowances, or privileges for temporary employees. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That the Government treat their employees upon a different basis from that which their laws enforce private employers to adopt is shown by the fact that storemen in naval establishments have been entitled to an additional shilling per day for nearly twelve months past, and that the Navy Department refuses to sanction the payment of the extra sum. Unless the Government  are  deliberately trying to create an upheaval in the Public Service, it is difficult to explain their motives and intentions. There appears to be a gross indifference on the part of responsible Ministers to seeing that those in the employ of the Commonwealth receive their dues. Every branch of our Public Service is in a state of feverish unrest. Discontent isrife in it. The question, therefore, must be regarded as one of great urgency, especially when honorable members are the recipients of such tangible evidence of that dissatisfaction as was supplied to them by the numerous communications which reached them only last week from public servants throughout the Commonwealth. Our employees are justified in demanding from Ministers an explanation of why there is continual delay in awarding them what are their rightful dues.  The public servant is subject to exactly the same conditions of life as those to which other citizens are subject. He is not  immune  from the high cost of living any more than is the ordinary citizen, and the abnormal conditions which have resulted from the war have rendered it impossible for him to meet his obligations and to maintain himself and his family in a reasonable degree of comfort. As the employees in the Ordnance Stores of the Defence Department are returned soldiers&#39; and married men, they ought to become permanent officers from the date of their appointments, and to be entitled to participate in the benefits of sick and annual leave, proportionately to their length of service. But it has been the practice in Government Departments to engage men continuously for ten or eleven months, and just when they were approaching the period when they would become eligible to receive annual holidays or sick leave, to suspend them for a week, or perhaps a  month,  in order to break their continuity of employment, and thus deprive them of these advantages. Irrespective of what may be the recommendations of the Basic Wage Commission, there are many anomalies in our Public Service which could be remedied by sympathetic administration. I hope that the Government will see whether it is not possible to afford immediate relief in the direction  which  I have suggested. </para>
          <para>There is just one minor matter to which I desire to direct attention. It is permissible for the clerks in the Keswick </para>
          <para>Military Barracks, South Australia, to smoke during the performance of their official duties. This privilege, however, cannot be enjoyed by the employees in the Ordnance  Stores, because of the inflammable character of the materials amongst which they are required to work. To compensate for this deprivation, I suggest that they should be granted reasonable &#34; smoke-ohs.&#34; I hope that the Government will give earnest consideration to the request which has been made in order that satisfaction may reign throughout our Public Service. </para>

            <para>.- In my judgment the Government ought long ago to have taken action to insure the payment of a decent living wage to Commonwealth public servants. They should not have remained inactive for practically twelve months simply to enable a Commission to tell them what should be the basic wage for Australia. Every honorable member knows that our public servants to-day are receiving only a starvation wage. The least the Government can do is to see that they are paid a decent living wage. Surely there was no need for Ministers to defer action for twelve months until a Commission had investigated the articles of clothing that one wears, and the number of pieces of bread and butter that his children eat! Why these things should have been inquired into, I cannot understand. Everybody knows that the public servants of. the Commonwealth are miserably and inadequately paid. Now we have the Prime Minister excusing himself- </para>

              <para>- Then here is an opportunity for the right honorable gentleman to cover himself with glory. Why does he not put the coping stone upon his great career by granting our public servants the required increase of salary ? He controls the public purse. He needs only to say to his colleagues, &#34;Here is the  money with which to pay our public servants a decent living wage,&#34; and the thing will be done. It is idle for him to tell us that years ago he did many good things. If one analyzed his career, it would doubtless be found that the right honorable gentleman has since attempted to undo many of the good deeds which he performed during the earlier years of his political life. The Government have endeavoured to excuse themselves for their inaction by affirming that the Basic Wage Commission has not yet presented its report. Let us accept that position. But- the report of the Commission, we are assured, will be forthcoming by the end of the week. Then .the Prime Minister tells us that he will read it and take it to the Cabinet to consider, and the Cabinet will give to it all due consideration. They will, I suppose, ponder over it, and the &#187; various Ministers will discuss it in all its details. The Treasurer will consider whether he has sufficient funds available and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> will view it in the light of how it will affect his Department, and ascertain whether it will take money away from his Department to give to somebody else, and so we shall have the whole of the members of the Ministry fighting one against the other, some pulling one way, and some another, and thus causing delay. It is quite plain to anybody who follows political tactics closely that the reason the Government are playing for delay is that this House is likely to rise within a couple of weeks. If the Government can avoid a decision on this  matter until the House has adjourned, there will be no hope of the public servants receiving the fair and decent wage which they ought to have. Will the Treasurer, or any other member of the Government, rise in his place and assure the House, the officers of the Public Service, and the community generally, that the Government will undertake to see that the basic wage is paid, and that it will be given effect to before the House r  rises? </para>

              <para>- If the Government reduced them any lower than they are to-day, the men would die of starvation. As it is, Government employees and their wives and kiddies are only hanging on to the verge. They are just on the brink. It is all very well for the Treasurer and other honorable gentlemen to smile, but it is utterly ridiculous and absurd to expect married men to maintain families on a wage running from &#163;3 2s. to &#163;3 8s., &#163;3 9s., or &#163;3 10s. per week. We all know that children cannot obtain the ordinary necessaries of life, and cannot be given food sufficient to build them up into strong and healthy men and women. It is utterly impossible to provide the merest necessities on such a ridiculous wage as the Government are paying. I should think the Government would guarantee, through the Treasurer, not to reduce wages ! They will get very few people to take on jobs in the Public Service unless they are prepared to give a much better wage than they are paying to-day. </para>

              <para>- My word we did, and with both hands, too. It is a pity the public servants could . not show the Government exactly what they want, and demand it, and make the Government give it to them. It is a standing disgrace to any Government, National or Labour, to keep its employees working on such an inadequate wage as many of our public servants are receiving, and the Government should not hesitate a moment about taking action. There should be no waiting for the Commission&#39;s report. The Government should give the public servants a fair and decent wage, straight off. In New South Wales, the basic wage is &#163;4 5s. per week. If I were in power, instead of waiting for the final report of the Commission, I should say,. &#34; Nobody shall .be paid less than the New South Wales basic rate for the time being.&#34; When we received the report of our own Commission, which we have very good reasons for believing will recommend a basic wage of something over &#163;5 per week, I should simply lift the wage up to that level. But, first of all, I should undoubtedly drag it up from the present starvation level to that of an ordinary, decent living wage. I hope the Government will no longer delay taking the necessary steps to bring abou.t  reform. Above all, I wish, to give the Government a word of warning. If they allow the House to adjourn before they give effect to a decent living wage for the public servants, they will create increased unrest and turmoil, and bring about things which may lead to even greater trouble and disturbance than we have yet had. I hope, therefore, the Government will take the earliest opportunity of seeing that the public servants are paid a decent and reasonable wage. </para>

            <para>.- I support the motion as emphatically as is in my power, and shall be extremely sorry if we do not reach a vote on this question, which involves the responsibility of each member to the great bulk of the community within and outside the Public Service. The Basic &#34;Wage Commission  was appointed twelve months ago or more, and started out to discover the basic wage for the whole of the Commonwealth public servants and other people. Its members have travelled all over Australia, and taken evidence, and have gone to great pains in arriving at a conclusion. But there has been an extremely long, in fact a significantly long, time between the date on which the taking of evidence ceased, and the present day. All kinds of things are said. One is that the report has been received, perused, and discussed by the Government, and returned to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Commission, with a request to him to review or reconsider it. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether the Government have had the report or not, but I am inclined to think that it could very well have been published by this date. I believe the Government are afraid of it. I believe, also, that they will&#39; close this part of the session before the report is made available to the public, and keep Parliament closed for probably six months, in order that the public servants may not be able to draw attention to such, a report as that which we anticipate. From what one can learn, it is expected that the Commonwealth basic wage will be over &#163;5 per week, and for that reason the Government in all probability are making sure that the report will not be made available until the House rises. If it is the intention of the Government to prevent the House from discussing the report of the Basic Wage Commission I can only say that there will be grave industrial trouble throughout th,e Public Service. When the Government went before the people at &#39; the last election they made certain definite promises, most of which, of course, have been broken. They promised that a Commission would be appointed to determine what were fair living conditions for persons in the Public Service, and that as soon as the report of this Commission was made available, it would be given effect to. The Government have not attempted to keep their promise, and apparently they do not intend to do so, but are backing and filling, and expecting to get into recess in order to avoid some of the odium that must fall upon their heads. To-day the Prime Minister informed us that the report will b&#171; considered by him and his colleagues. There was not a word about giving effect to his pledge, made during the election. The Government must know what the report contains. Apparently they are appalled by it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> and his fellow Commissioners, after travelling throughout Australia in the course of their inquiry, have arrived at certain definite conclusions based upon the evidence tendered to them. So far as one can learn, all the evidence points to the conclusion that  nothing less than &#163;5 a week is to be regarded as the living wage for the people of this country. </para>

              <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. If the Basic Wage Commission have decided that &#163;5 a week is a fair living wage, it means that all of those in the Commonwealth Public Service getting less than that amount are on a starvation rate. For many years the stronger and more militant unions outside the Public Service have been fighting for improved conditions. They have either approached the Arbitration Court or have struck, and they are in a much better position - although their position is bad enough, Heaven only knows - than persons in the Public Service. Whilst I deprecate strikes, and will do everything possible to avert trouble by this method, I say that unless the Government give some relief, the time must come when our public servants will have to tak&#169; drastic action. When the report of this Basic Wage Commission is made available the Government must be asked if they intend to give effect to its recommendations. If they refuse to do that, I would say to the public servants - &#34; Strike, and hold up the business of this country.&#34; I do not say this heatedly; I say it quite calmly and dispassionately - I say that unless the Government are prepared to pay a living wage to their employees, they will deserve no better treatment than to have the whole of the Commonwealth Public Service held up. The Australian Workers Union, the wharf labourers, the coal lumpers, and all the outside militant organizations would not tolerate for one moment the sweated conditions that are imposed upon the Public Service. Our public servants will be compelled, by force of economic circumstances, to display some of that militancy which has brought members of outside organizations up to something like a decent standard of living. The Government recently appointed a gentleman called Starke as a Judge of the Arbitration Court. Apparently he thinks that &#163;3 per week is sufficient for a single man to live upon, and that &#163;3 15s. is enough for a married man, with perhaps four or five children to keep besides providing for house rent. Do honorable members supporting the Government think that these conditions can continue much longer ? They cannot and must not. I have in my possession several letters and telegrams bearing upon this subject, but it is not my intention to read them all. Apparently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke was appointed to his present position to give effect to the policy of the Government. If the Government desired to keep wages down they could not have secured a better servant; but I remind them that Justice Starke&#39;s recent award will do more than anything else to precipitate an industrial crisis in Australia. The more militant unions, including my own, will probably be before Justice Starke shortly, and if he follows his present line of reasoning, and persists in making awards lower than basic wages already fixed, it will be extremely difficult to get the workers to agree to it. He will drive us out of the Arbitration Court altogether. If the public servants of this country are depending upon Justice Starke to &#34; award them fair and reasonable conditions they are depending upon a very rotten reed indeed. So far  as  we can  see  they are debarred, by a recent award, from gaining anything whatever from that source, so they must either get relief from the &#39;recommendations of the Basic Wage Commission or go on strike. The sooner they recognise this fact the better it will be for them. It  is  of no use whatever thinking that the Government are in any way sympathetic towards them. Here is a letter which I shall quote - it  is  only one of many- from a gentleman whose name I shall not disclose - </para>

            <para>About twelve months ago, a Commission was appointed to declare a basic wage for the Commonwealth, and, from what I hear, the Commission is still at Brisbane. Could you give any idea when the Commission should give their decision? Why I write to you is because, being a postal employee, the decision might benefit me. You are, I know, well aware of the princely salaries given to. postal officials. For instance, at the age of twenty-one years your salary becomes &#163;132 per year - 50s. a week. Second-class board now costs 30s. per week in most places. &#163;132 per year is for a single man. A married man, of course, would receive &#163;150 a year -  a  splendid salary for a married man to live on and keep his wife and children respectable, is it not? The New South Wales basic wage is &#163;201. Postal award,&#39; Federal, &#163;150. From &#163;132 per year a man goes on till he reaches &#163;168 per year. He gets &#163;6 per year rise, from &#163;132 till he gets &#163;168, and then anchors there. He is six years obtaining &#163;168 per year from when he gets &#163;132. Maximum, &#163;168. New South Wales basic wage is &#163;201. Of course, I am referring to assistants and postal assistants - the backbone of the Postal Department. The telephonists are even poorer paid than us. We got a bonus of &#163;12 about sixteen- months ago (granted by the Court) before you were entitled to &#163;12. It was necessary to be twenty-  five years or over; then we got another &#163;8. Then, last month, another &#163;12; making &#163;32 per year in bonus. My salary is &#163;174, plus &#163;32 bonus - &#163;206 per year. </para>

            <para>.- I join very heartily in supporting those who have spoken in favour of this motion. We cannot hide from ourselves, or from the public generally, that there is an &#39;absolute maelstrom of discontent existing in our midst in consequence of the awful rise in prices of food, shelter, and clothing when .there has not been an equal rise in wages to meet the increased costs. I cannot but repeat again the words of that caustic, witty philosopher who wrote that, &#34; If God had placed the  creation of the world in the hands of a Commission, it would never have been completed.&#39;&#39; That clearly illustrates the position that, when the Government desire breathing time in dealing with any particular question, they appoint a Commission to make inquiries. That is what happened when the late Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> arranged for a number of departmental officers to vis&#233; the report of the Commission upon the Federal Capital. The delay in this instance has not been occasioned by the Royal Commission, as we understand the report has been handed to the Government. Why have they not presented it to Parliament? </para>

              <para>- Then, if that is so, I must correct my statement. Previous inquiries into the question of the minimum wage were based on the requirements of a man, his wife, and three children; but I am standing up for the rights of my fellow Australians, who have to support four, six, eight, or even ten children. To me there appears to be only one way of treating such cases fairly, and that is by settling an amount upon the man and his wife and allowing it to stop there. The wife, if a mother, should then receive, as a right, an allowance for every child she has, as each child is a future unit of the State, and has rights which no parent or no Government should deprive it of. The primal right of a child is that it should have sufficient food, shelter, and clothing to enable it <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> grow up in health and strength and so become a valua ble asset to the country. The present position to me is ridiculous. Are the Government directly or indirectly endeavouring to limit families? I will not think for one moment that that is their intention. In connexion with the payment of military pensions, they went as far as the fourth child; but why should there be that limitation? Every member of this Chamber, irrespective of the side of the House on which he sits, knows that it is the desire of every mother to rear her children in healthy and comfortable surroundings, so that they will not only be a credit to her, but to the country.

          <para class="block">That shows that the Government, which should set an example, are not paying the rates which are being paid by private and other employers. Until recently the public servants of the Commonwealth have never been supporters of the party to which I belong, and honorable members must be keenly aware of that. I know that in my early political career I had to fight them very severely in order to win a seat in the State Parliament; but I believe they have now seen the error of their ways, and have found that their aims and ideals are similar to those of the party with which I am associated. Have honorable members forgotten what occurred in Western Australia a few months ago, when the activities of the Government were held up for weeks by a strike, which was, I think, unique in the history of any Government? Surely the Government do not want to precipitate similar action ? As a Labour man, I gladly voted for the Arbitration Bill which was brought into this House in 1904, but it must be admitted that our present legislation is not perfect. We, as the framers of such Statutes, should so amend them that every man and woman in the community may enjoy full citizen rights.  and should have the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court absolutely without expense. This is not unknown in the Councils of <inline font-style="italic">prud&#39;hommes</inline> in Trance, or in Denmark, where legal expense is made as little as possible. I understand that in the civil courts of Denmark a legal man is not permitted to appear except as a witness, that is, in the first court. The National &#34;party in Victoria has adopted the referendum and initiative, and,, I believe, the recall, and this House has unanimously agreed to them. No amount of explanation can expunge from its records that resolution. This Government is wholly National, and I remind Ministers that the planks of its platform, if given effect, would relieve them in very difficult circumstances. No word of mine can be construed as captious criticism of the Government, but were the creators of Parliament to have the control over it during the whole of the three years of its existence that they possess on election day, it would relieve the Government in, its present troublesome position. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and for that they have my commiseration to a certain extent. I know that the Labour Governments which I supported had sometimes to face very difficult  situations. But were it realized that behind the Government is the people, who pay for everything, and that to them an appeal could be made to decide what shall be the basic wage throughout the length and breadth of Australia, how much simpler the position would be for Ministers! The Government might say to the people, &#34; The adoption of a certain rate will mean a large expenditure,&#34; but the reply of the people might very well be that, as in time of war a nation whose existence is at stake will do many things which it would not otherwise do, so in this instance the welfare of the community is the paramount consideration. Speaking with the knowledge obtained through my medical studies, I say that the greatest asset of this our Australia is the Australian baby. He is our best immigrant. But we cannot expect children to grow into healthy men and women if in their tender years they do not possess the advantages which every individual in the community should have.  It seems to me that .the intelligence of the ants might well be copied by us in this matter. &#34;When we look into their nests through the eyes of science, accepting what has been told us by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Lubbock, Grant Allen, and other men famous in scientific research, we see that never in the history of a nation of ants does the young or the worker suffer privation. Furthermore, when one tribe of ants fights with another, though it is death or slavery for the conquered, a logical conclusion which we do not accept in warfare, yet the curse of having to pay interest on the money expended in fighting the war is not laid on future generations as it is with us. I say, let the creators of Parliament, those who pay for everything, have the controlling voice in these questions. That will relieve the Government of great difficulties, and will make Parliament a happier body. Whatever rate may be fixed, if the people accept it, they will have to pay it. The principle of the referendum has been too long on the fighting platform of the Labour party without being given effect, and has been accepted by the Nationalists. </para>

We have been told that the report of the Basic Wage Commission has not yet been presented, and that, therefore, no basic wage has been proclaimed. This afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that when that report is presented he will read it - he made that remark rather significantly as though reading it were a different matter from putting it into operation - and would afterwards confer with his colleagues about it. I have heard several honorable members opposite say that they believe that certain principles should be laid_ down by the Legislature: that the Legislature should declare the number of hours of a working week, and the basis  upon which the living wage should be established ; whether upon the amount necessary to maintain a man and his wife, or a man and his wife and child, or a man and his wife and two children, and so on. They have said on several occasions that these matters should be laid down by Parliament; but when, some tune ago, they were offered an opportunity to lay down some of these principles, they ran away from their position. We had before us an arbitration measure affecting the Commonwealth public servants, and honorable members opposite voted against the proposal that the Arbitrator who was to be provided for should not fix a wage lower than that recommended by the Commonwealth Basic Wage Commission. An amendment wasmoved by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> which will be found on page 4321 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of this session.

          <para>At Bendigo, the Prime Minister mads a promise which was referred to this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition. He promised that there should be an investigation to discover the proper basic wage, and that the result of that investigation should be put into operation. This afternoon, however, the right honorable gentleman did not speak of putting it into operation; allhe said was that when the report of the Basic Wage Commission was presented, he would read it, and would confer with the Treasurer about it. In the meantime, a real injustice is being suffered by our public servants. As I pointed out during the discussion of the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill, there are in all the States - I spoke particularly of Queensland, of whose conditions I have the best personal knowledge - Commonwealth public servants who are getting far less than the employees of the State Governments, and much less than is being paid for similar work by outside employers. There are married men with wives and children who are not getting a living wage. Surely the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> would not suggest that &#163;3 8s. per week is a sufficient wage for a married man to live on, if he has a wife and two or three children to support? Yet in the Commonwealth Public Service there are many such cases. </para>
          <para>The position of Government servants is somewhat different from that of other employees, since the Government have complete power - there are no constitutional difficulties in the way - to lay down what shall be the rule governing their employees. They have complete power to set out by legislative enactment and by regulation what they, as &#34;model employer&#34; should do. But instead of doing that, they have removed Commonwealth public servants, without consulting them, from the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable member may get it in later on, but not at the present moment. The Government have removed Commonwealth public servants from the benefits of the Arbitration Court. They have driven out the  President  of that Court, and have stood against giving a direction to the Public Service Arbitrator that he shall not award less than the basic w&#39;age. As a matter of fact, the Treasurer,, when I was speaking on the question in the House in September last, desired to know whether I seriously contended that any Governmentshould bind themselves to give a wage at least equal to that which was laid down by the Basic &#34;Wage Commission. I certainly do suggest that the Government should bind themselves not to pay less than the basic wage laid down by the Commission. It is a properly constituted tribunal, and has all the facilities for ascertaining what is a proper basic wage. We have to bind ourselves beforehand by the decisions of the Arbitration Court, and why should we not also be bound by the decision of the Basic Wage Commission? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The fact is that the Government find themselves under the influence of outside pressure. Some of the big employers outside do not want to see this basic wage established in connexion with the Commonwealth Service, and the Government, of course, willingly obey their behests. That, at all events, is how the matter presents itself to me. It is shocking that we have in power a Government which allow themselves to be fettered by the fact that the report of the Commission has not yet been presented. This injustice has been going on for months. Are we to tolerate the statement of the Government that they cannot remedy it? The Prime Minister has treated the matter as if it were a joke. When it was brought forward this afternoon he asked, &#34;What is it you want me to remedy? I have not the report.&#34; He has not the report, but this injustice is being done to women and children, and it is our duty to see that it is remedied. We have the power to remedy it. A majority of hon orable members can compel - or if the House would wish me to put it in an-  other form, can &#34; persuade &#34; - the\ Government to grant justice to these people. If a sufficient number of honorable members from the other side would join with our party, we would have power to persuade the Government to act, not at some future time, but now. We could require them to act within twenty-four hours, otherwise they could not remain in office. Whether the Prime Minister had made a pledge or not, I think it would be our duty to be speaking and acting in this House with respect to thi? matter. It would be our duty to see that justice is done to these employees of the State. </para>
          <para>Instead of setting an example, the Commonwealth Government are lagging behind private employers and behind State Governments. When the Leader of the Opposition moved this motion, the Prime Minister said - &#34; What do you want me to do <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What am I to do about it? I have not the report.&#34; But the fact remains that he has power to do justice to these people without waiting for the report of the Commission, since he knows that the report must be in favour of a higher wage than the men are now receiving. It is impossible to conceive of a report being brought in for a lower wage. That would be unreasonable. For these reasons I put it to the House that Parliament should do its duty in this matter. It is, after all, a question for the Parliament itself to determine.&#39; So far as I understand the agitation raised by Commonwealth public servants, they are looking to this Parliament, and looking to it in no party spirit. They are looking to the Parliament because they say they have been done an injustice. Surely it is our place to see that justice is done them. It is not as if some very highly-paid servants were asking for this consideration. These people are asking only for a basic wage- a living wage - which will enable them, with their wives and families, to live in comparative comfort. Are we going to sit idly by while this injustice is going on? Are we going to tolerate a Government which say that they have not the report of the Com- - mission, and that, when it is presented, they will read it, talk it over amongst themselves, and will then come down to Parliament, not this session, &#39;but, per&#39;haps, next session- </para>

              <para>- That may be, but if honorable members are serious in their support of this claim, they will see to it that Parliament does not adjourn until the grievance is remedied. Instead of allowing this injustice, the Commonwealth Government should be leading the way in reform. We find them, however, lagging far behind other employers. It is sad that we should have such demonstrations as are now taking place in the Commonwealth - demonstrations, the justification for which no one can deny. I challenge any honorable member to say that the complaint of the Commonwealth public servants is not justified. I marvel that they have been patient so long. They have been content to send us a few telegrams, and those messages- are evidence to us that they feel the situation. I hope that the possibility, to which the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> referred, will not eventuate. I should be very sorry, indeed, to see a strike of Commonwealth public, servants, or of any part of the Commonwealth Public Service, and the Government cannot suggest that there is any threat of a strike held out to them. They cannot suggest that the public servants of the Commonwealth have not been very patient with them. For these reasons I hope we shall see this state of affairs&#39; remedied at the earliest possible moment. It is in our hands to remedy it, and it is for each individual honorable member to say whether or not he stands for justice to our public servants. </para>

              <para>- Did they ? Then they did not know that they had it. They kept asking for something different. The honorable member will call down on his head, not the blessings, but the condemnations of those who are in this agitation. They have told him flatly, face to face, that they do not want any party capital made out of this appeal. Will any one say that the honorable member&#39;s speech this afternoon was anything but an <inline font-style="italic">admisericordiam</inline> appeal to the party feelings of the House, and particularly to honorable members over here? &#34; Come over and help us,&#34; he said. &#34; Come over and help us to put the Government out, so that these people mav get justice.&#34; </para>

              <para>- &#34; And so that the women and children may be looked after as they ought to be.&#34; May I suggest to the honorable member that neither he nor his party has a monopoly of sympathy for the women and children of the continent. There is at least as much sympathy for &#34;them over here as there is on the other side of the House. What honorable members on this side of the House are not prepared to do, however, is to make party capital out of the sufferings of these women and children. They decline to demean themselves by taking advantage of any suffering *of the kind. </para>

He challenges the House to a test of its sincerity, and the test of its sincerity is as to whether or not honorable members on this side will vo&#39;.e with the Opposition to dispossess the Government. </para>

The very last thing they desire to do is to give rise to a crisis over this matter. They are simply trying to make a little party capital out of the agitation. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for West Sydney also complained that Commonwealth public servants had been removed from the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, as though that were an injustice to them. One of the arguments addressed to me with the greatest force yesterday was that public servants had not been able to get justice at the hands of the Court. I was told that their cases were held up so long that before one matter could be settled another set of grievances was cropping up. They declared that the Court, so far as they are concerned, has been a failure; but the honorable member&#39;s complaint is that we have removed them from the control of the Court. That is not aa injustice; indeed, they say it is not, but, rather, that it is an advantage. I remind the honorable member that, although we are removing them from this Court, we are taking them to another  which we hope will deal with their grievances with greater facility, swiftness, sureness, and reasonableness than the bigger Court with its more slow moving methods. </para>

              <para>- I know that the honorable member always believes that other people should be liberal. However, I should like to let the House know how the case stands as far as we can ascertain. A little while ago I pointed out to honorable members that the awards of the Court alone were costing to-day about &#163;1,200,000 extra as compared with the beginning of the war period; and this, I said, represented an increase of about 37 per cent. I am speaking now of the permanent officers; but, in addition, there is a small army of temporary men. As to these latter, the rule is to pay whatever is the ruling rate in the various States. For instance, our own people, engaged temporarily in New South Wales, receive the basic wage of that State; and we pay the ascertained rates in the various States. I have been informed that further awards have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke, which involve another &#163;356,000 per annum, making a total increase of close on 50 per cent. </para>

The deputation to me insisted that it did not want any party agitation in the matter, and told me that they were doing their best to keep party politics out of it. I believe the members of the deputation; but those gentlemen opposite insist on &#34;butting in &#34; where they are not welcome. They are told to keep away, and they refuse to do so. There is politics in this, and they &#34;butt in&#34; whether they are wanted or not. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that honorable members who voted against the proposal to imprison children will be sympathetic with the view that persons shall not be required to undergo the ordeal of having thumb-prints taken. The securing of finger-prints is part of the process of identification of criminals. We have legislation for the purpose of preventing criminals from entering the Commonwealth. What is the need, therefore, for the proposition contained in this clause? It is a most objectionable form of registration. Photographs and other stipulated methods of identification are quite sufficient for keeping track of individuals who may wish to enter the Commonwealth from other parts of the world. Why should we humiliate any person by the institution of the fingerprint business? </para>

It does not matter what is the practice, the law depends upon the Minister who has the enforcement of it, and the law provides for the taking of the finger prints of every alien who enters the Commonwealth.

          <para>.- I think that the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> is hypersensitive in suggesting that there is any humiliation in asking an alien who has to be identified to furnish an imprint of his fingers. The object of the clause is to insure the identification of aliens, and one of the most deadly methods of securing identification is that of finger prints. I know that from my experience upon the criminal side of our Courts. A signature may be forged, but a finger print cannot be. </para>

It is a method which is universally re cognised as a very sure method of identification, and as such it should be retained in the clause. </para>

          <para>.- I have no desire to treat any person coming to Australia as a criminal. Why should we not be more generous in dealing with the admission of aliens into the Commonwealth ? Every man who can mount a soap box, or a stump, or attend a prayer meeting to-day, tells us that the crying need of Australia is population. Yet we are proposing to insult aliens who desire to settle here, although they may possess all the qualifications of good citizens. I recollect that in my boyhood days  great indignation was aroused in the Old Country because of the obstacles which were placed in the way of people travelling freely from one country to another. This sort of legislation is calculated to perpetuate that objectionable practice, and to still further inflame the feelings of hatred and revenge which are cherished by many people outside of our own nationality. We ought to be above imposing unduly harsh restrictions upon aliens. </para>

            <para>- Oh yes. To-day we are supposed to be living in an entirely different age. As a matter of fact, we are going backward. The Government have been seized with a sort of panic. They lack the grasp of public questions which they ought to possess. If I had. my way I would consign this Bill to the wastepaper basket and would welcome to our shores people of all European races with whom we can inter-marry without sacrificing our ideals. Of course, I have a rooted objection to the free admission of Asiatics. For instance, I would not like my daughter to bring home a Chinaman and to say to one, &#34; Dad, this is my young man.&#34; If the Government had  the courage to stand up against the practice of requiring the finger prints of aliens to be taken, simply because it has been adopted in some other part of the world, I believe they would be setting an example which would, sooner or later, be followed by other nations. Why should we interpose nonsensical obstacles to the increase of our population ? Of &#39; course, I recognise that honorable members OPPO. site have not very much breadth of vision. Their mental horizon is practically bounded by their own backyards. Just imagine a learned professor from1 France or America being subjected to the nonsensical restrictions which axe embodied in this clause. Thirty or forty years ago there was an agitation in the Old Country in favour of the removal of all obstacles to a recognition of the brotherhood of man. </para>

            <para>- Then it is very peculiar that the Government have had to bring forward this Bill. I cannot follow the Government in this proposal. If- it were necessary for the protection of Australia, I would go with them, but the Bill lays it down that no matter who the individual may be he must go through this process, which I may describe as part punishment and part fad. It is put forward in pursuance of some whimsical idea from the other side of the world, and does not emanate from Australia, because it is not in keeping with Australian sentiments or ideals. It does not square with a clear understanding of what a Democracy is. It is absolutely repugnant to the Australian spirit. On a wet Sunday recently I looked out some literature, among which was a very high-class journal. In this was an article dealing with a measure similar to this one, as introduced in the British Parliament. The writer stated that such a proposal would never be tolerated in an Australian Parliament. That is a compliment for us. The writer was appealing to the intelligence of the </para>

        <para class="block">British people, and trying to impress upon the  dullheads  in .the British Parliament that the Bill was not in keeping with the march of civilization, or with the spirit of &#39;brotherhood which should be created within the Empire. The amendment of the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> aims at liberalizing the Bill, and points out to the Government one way to bring about a better feeling  among the different nations, and the higher form of civilization about which so much is said. I may be a little more advanced in my thoughts than the general run of members, and, therefore, I endeavour to bring them up to my way of thinking. I want them to look at these national questions with a broad and open mind, so that they may instil noble sentiments into this young nation of ours, and lay such a foundation for Australia that other portions of the Empire will look with admiration at the advanced and noble spirit actuating the Australian people. I am willing to help  other members to impose any restrictions which are considered necessary to prevent persons of ill repute from entering Australia. It must, however, be proved that these persons are of obnoxious character. It is not sufficient to say that they&#34; have made speeches that did not please the Government in power. I am prepared to vote for any amendment that will make the whole of this Bill look ridiculous, and I  believe  my action in opposing it will, in later years, meet with the admiration of all those who look up the records. I object to decent people who want to come into our free and enlightened Australia being submitted, like criminals, to the humiliation of having their thumb prints taken. I wish I could get a sufficient number of honorable members of the same way of thinking as myself, so that we could throw out all the Bills of this character which we have recently been asked to pass. I know how in my young days restrictions of this sort on the continent of Europe interfered with trade and commerce, and prevented that free interchange of knowledge and sentiment among the people of different nations which it should be the endeavour of all intelligent persons to promote. All legislative proposals of this sort have arisen out of the spirit of hate and &#39; revenge which is actuating men who&#39; should be above it. This Bill breathes the same  spirit as the Peace Treaty, which will never stand, and Bills of this character will never stand, because all such things are conceived in a spirit of hate and revenge. I wish this Parliament would throw them all on one side, and allow the free and intelligent people from all other parts of the world to come into Australia, if they desire to make their homes here, without being subjected to humiliating restrictions. , After all the stuff preached to us about what was going to happen after the war, which we were told was to be the final struggle for liberty and freedom, almost the first thing that this Parliament is asked to do is to pass a measure which will compel an American lady of culture who wishes to enter Australia to register her thumb print on a document, to have her photograph taken, and to answer, all manner of insulting questions, such as whether her parents were married before she was born. ls not the proposal absolutely ridiculous when you look into it? I wish I could get my fellow members to realize what they are doing. After all, members of Parliament are supposed to bo leaders of thought, and it is our duty to&#39; the people whom we represent, not only to give utterance to noble sentiments, but to act on them. I have said nothing this afternoon, &#187;I am sure, which will not meet with the admiration of the most intelligent among our citizens. I am sure the day is not far distant when the sentiments to which I have given utterance will bear fruit, and a better, nobler, and broader view will be taken of what we owe to people who come to this country. We should not nut humiliating conditions upon people just because they did not happen to be born in the same country as ourselves. We should welcome them, so long as they are good-living citizens, and we should put no impediment in their way, if they belong to the white races, and especially to those races with which we were allied in the recent war. </para>

            <para>- In that case the officer would have reasonable grounds for believing that the alien was actually committing an offence. I could understand arrest without warrant in such circumstances when they get a person <inline font-style="italic">in flagranti delicto</inline> - in the act of committing an offence. If, however, an officer merely suspected that an alien had, at some previous time, committed an offence, he should be required to get a warrant before making an arrest. </para>

            <para>- An alien on board a ship tied up to a wharf might wish to leave the ship for some purpose of his own, but not with the object of defeating the law. In such circumstances the power to arrest without warrant could be exercised, because the officer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the alien was committing an offence. But the clause gives an officer power to arrest without warrant if he believes that an alien has committed an offence, andI contend that in the case of any previous offence the officer should be required to obtain a warrant before arresting the suspected person. I do not recollect, at the moment, any instance in which power is given to arrest without warrant except in the case of a person actually committing an offence, or when an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that he is about to commit an offence.

It would be unreasonable to expect an official to obtain a warrant when he saw a person deliberately leaving a vessel without authority.

            <para>. -  In asking the Committee to pass this vote I desire to give a few reasons why the Government consider it necessary that this amount should be granted for military defence purposes. The amount is not excessive, and I ask honorable members who may intend to oppose the expenditure to give careful consideration to one or two factors, particularly the depreciation in the purchasing power of the sovereign. I think it has been  shown by the Government Statistician that the purchasing power of money has been decreased to such an extent that it now requires 35s. lOd. to purchase what could have been obtained in 1914 for 22s. odd. In other words, if &#34;we were asking for &#163;4,200,000 this year it would be only equivalent to the amount granted in 1914. We are, however, only asking for &#163;3,200,000, and .more than half of that amount has already been agreed to, leaving a balance of &#163;1,550,000. We have &#34;also to consider that last year, and during the period of the war, a large amount of defence expenditure came out of loan money, and, therefore, did not affect revenue. In perusing the military expenditure during pre-war years and comparing it with the vote now proposed, honorable members may say that the Government are asking for more than has been previously granted; but such is not the case, as no money is being taken from loan. </para>

          <para>This year we are only providing for eight days&#39; camp training for one quota of our trainees, and a similar period of training for the militia. We have been forced to do that in an endeavour to keep the military expenditure down to an absolute minimum. I, therefore, ask honorable members to seriously consider the position before they move for a reduction in this vote, or offer any obstruction to its passage. I feel sure that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> who is at present leading the Opposition, will assist us. </para>

              <para>- I am glad&#39; to have that assurance. I cannot imagine objection being taken to that item of expenditure, because we must surely advance in matters&#39; of military and naval defence, and if we take into consideration the depreciated value of money the sum we are asking for this year is less than was granted in prewar days. Had we gone on with our cadet training this year on the lines adopted prior to the war the amount required would have been much in excess of &#163;1,550,000. </para>

          <para>In this connexion reference may be made to the perturbed state of international affairs, which is a good  reason  why we must at all hazards maintain the efficiency of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. We are a mere handful of people, and may not be able to provide an adequate force to fully protect ourselves; but we must &#39; do something every year to maintain a certain state of military efficiency, otherwise the time may come when we shall find ourselves completely at the mercy of some foreign power. I ask honorable members, irrespective of party, whether they as business men would hold a valuable property without protecting themselves by adequately insuring it? Why does a business man insure his warehouse? Is it because he believes that it is likely to be destroyed? I do not think so. </para>

              <para>- I believe the cure would be worse than the disease. The establishment of such a guard would not be any protection against fire or even brimstone. I trust honorable members will allow this vote to pass without very much delay. In my opinion, it is essential that we should have the amount of money that is asked for. Comparing these Estimates with pre-war expenditure, and making allowance for the decrease in the purchasing power of money, what is proposed to be spent this year is not as much as we formerly spent. </para>

              <para>- You cannot have an efficient military force without an efficient staff. All who&#39; have had experience in military matters know that nearly everything depends on the proper staffing of a force. The best and bravest men in the world are useless without a proper staff. I do not wish to go into details, or I could mention instances in the campaign in which I recently took part where we absolutely failed because those at the head of affairs did not know their job, not having be.en trained in staff duties. It is no absurd thing to say that almost a life-time is required for the training of a perfect staff officer. A good staff officer cannot be made in a f,ew years. Ho is a specialist, who needs an extraordinary amount of training. Every individual member of a force may be willing to fight like a  tiger,  but unless the force can be moved expeditiously to where it is needed, and unless the interior economy of the regiments and brigades is efficient - and for that a good staff &#39; is needed - the soldiers are helpless, and the force must degenerate into practically a rabble. </para>

              <para>- These Estimates contain several amounts running into thousands of pounds for bonuses given in accordance with Arbitration awards. I do not see how honorable members can pronounce the Pub.lic Service to be underpaid, and, at the same time, say that the Defence Estimates are too big. What are you going to cut down? Honorable members may think that the sum provided for munitions, which is a very large one, is too big; but it is useless to have a Military Force Unless that Force is provided with everything it needs for fighting. We maintain a Military Force on the supposition that it may be necessary at some time or other to employ it in the defence of Australia; but out Force would be useless if, when called on to fight, it had no ammunition or big guns. We have already voted a large sum to provide big guns and big-gun ammunition, to build up a reserve, which is vital to our defences, supposing that we treat the subject of defence seriously. I look upon  defence as a serious matter, and I say that to defend Australia we must have a reserve of munitions. </para>

I shall be prepared, as occasion arises, to give any information that may be asked for, andI hope that the Estimates may be speedily passed. </para>

            <para>. - The Estimates relating to the Defence Department need more careful scrutiny than do those relating to any other branch of the Commonwealth Service. The Defence Department, above all others, is out for spending. So far as it is concerned, it is a case of &#34; all cop and no give.&#34; I was hopeful that, the war being over, we would have a big drop in our Defence Estimates, and that the finances of the nation would thus be afforded an opportunity to recover from the severe strain put upon them during the five years of war. Butwe are doomed to disappointment. I am not opposed&#39; to the Government&#39;s defence policy; I believe that we should have a Defence Force; but, having regard to the disturbed state of our finances, care should have been taken to cut down these Estimates to the very bone. If necessary, some of the bone should also have been removed. After a financial slump in Queensland, many years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIlwraith, who had just been returned with a majority, proposed to cut down, as far as possible, the spending Departments. With that object in view he sent for the State Commandant, who was an Imperial officer, and made known to him his wishes. The Commandant assured him that he and his clerical and military staffs had gone very carefully through their Estimates, and had cut them down to the bone.Sir Thomas McIlwraith, having glanced at the Estimates, said, &#34;If this is what you call cutting them down to the bone, we shall have also to cut out the bone.&#34; And they did. </para>

              <para>- That was done, with the result that, although the noncommissioned officers and the rankers in the regiments about Brisbane were done away with, the general staff was retained. It was this incident which led me to make the comment that the Queensland Forces consisted of officers without any privates. Our Commonwealth Defence Forces are rapidly assuming the same form, and the Estimates certainly need to be carefully scrutinized. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I find it difficult to account for the alteration of the form in which the Defence Estimates have hitherto been put  before the Committee. Previously, the Commandant and staff of each State &#34;were grouped in separate divisions, so that honorable members who were familiar with the services in the respective States could tell exactly where reductions might reasonably be made. This year, however, the whole of the services are lumped together, and so the  Estimates are camouflaged. It is quite impossible to pick out items relating to specific positions in the different .States, and the only course open to us, therefore, is to move for a lump sum reduction. I have spent over an hour in searching for certain items in these Estimates, and have made but little progress. I find, however, that, instead of reducing the staffs to pre-war conditions, the Defence authorities have increased the whole of them. In pre-war days we had to provide for a few colonels and majors, but to-day &#39;we are called upon to make provision for field-marshals, major-generals, lieutenantgenerals, and other officers of high rank. I recognise that we must have brains in the service; but, even if it means that some of these gentlemen must go back to civil life, where they might hold more lucrative positions, we ought to cut down the staff. </para>
          <para>I do not propose to move that the Estimates be reduced by even one penny, because, as I have said, I believe in the Government&#39;s defence policy; but there is certainly an opportunity, particularly in relation to the reserves of munitions, to make reductions. If there is to be no war, why provide on these Estimates for big supplies of munitions? </para>

              <para>- But no one knows better than does the Minister that in a climate like that of Australia munitions quickly deteriorate. Some twelve years ago case after case of ammunition that had been sent out to rifle clubs had to be returned as unfit for use. &#39; We had built up large reserves, only to find when the time came to use&#39; them that they were unserviceable. It is not merely a waste of money, but a criminal act, to serve out such ammunition to our men. Now that the war is over it will not be out of place for me to remind honorable members of what happened in regard to the ammunition supplied to the forts at Sydney Heads just before the war broke out. It was not creditable to the Government then in power nor to the Labour Government previously in office. I have no desire in any way to discredit the Defence Department, but I am prepared to join with others in cutting out unnecessary expenditure, and particularly in reducing the proposed vote for munition supplies. It is upon the latter itemthat we should concentrate our attack. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am also at a loss to know why we require many of the officers for whom provision is made. I recognise that we must have an efficient staff - that our staff officers represent the eyes and the brains of the Army - but some of these items will need a lot of explanation. It will be admitted that we cannot touch those portions of the Defence Estimates which relate to the clerical staff who are under the Public Service Act. We should see, however, whether savings cannot be effected in connexion with the joint head-quarters staff. In Division No. 56 - Central Administration - we have provision made for an InspectorGeneral of Administration, a Director-General of Medical Services, a Chief Supervisor of Physical Training, a Director of Physical Training and Chief Instructor of Physical Training Instructional Staff, a Director of Equipment and Ordnance&#39; Stores, a  Deputy  Director of Equipment and Ordnance Stores, Ordnance Officers, Director of Supply and Transport and Chief Instructor of Army Service Corps Training,: a Director of Veterinary Services, an Inspector of Physical Training, a DirectorGeneral of Army Reserve, a Director of Military Operations, and others, the proposed vote being &#163;7,113, as against &#163;18,314 spent in 1919-20. From this it would appear that there is a reduction in round figures of &#163;10,000 on the previous year&#39;s expenditure. That, however, is mere camouflage. Most of these officers are now transferred to the Staff Corps. Their names have simply been taken out of this division and added to that relating to the Staff Corps. That is how the reduction is made. </para>

              <para>- But the Assistant Minister says these officers are required, and it is only natural for him to say so; I should take the same stand if I were in office, and I think I would be able to make out a very good case. I feel sure, however, that honorable members on both sides desire to see the Defence Forces reduced to something like normal proportions. If we had plenty of money to burn, as we hadprior to the war, we might go in for spectacular display; but under present circumstances, we have to get right down to &#34; tin tacks.&#39;&#39; I do not know why the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has allowed the retention of the services of these gentlemen to pass unheeded. </para>

              <para>- So I do; but I also believe in brains, especially in the scientific branches of the Service. We cannot pick up men in Collins-street or Bourke-street to do engineering and artillery work on the scientific side; they must be educated, and if the sons of working men are to enter the military profession, they must be given a chance to attend these colleges. </para>

              <para>- There are; and one year the cadet who came out top at Jervis Bay was the son of a locomotive engine-driver on the VictorianRailways, and a youth who took the same position at Duntroon was the son of a carpenter.

              <para>- There is plenty of time for that. So long as we are in a position to make our own ammunition, and be independent of outside sources, we should be content to crawl before we walk, particularly in view of the present state of the finances. The Government should really do something in the way of reducing the amount spent on the ammunition branch of the business; indeed, it would not do anybody an injustice to reduce the vote by half. I recommend the Minister to take this suggestion into consideration, and give us some idea of what the Government intend to do in this regard. </para>

The sum of &#163;36,000 sounds like a lot of money for &#34; tucker.&#34; What does the Minister intend to do about the Survey Corps? Altogether, the total contingencies amount to more than &#163;48,000, Cannot something be cut out? </para>

The Treasurer&#39;s Department was very amiss.

          <para>It is of no use to ask the Defence Department to cut down its Estimates, for it will not do so. Its officials furnish estimates which the Treasurer knows full well involve about three times as large a 6um as the &#39; country can afford to pay. At the same time, however, there are certain branches of the Service which should not be starved. Those are the Staff and the Aircraft section of the Defence Force. The Defence Department is a spending Department; it has net got to raise the money. It is not called upon to bear the odium of applying increased taxation. We cannot do without a Defence Force of some sort, and I am satisfied that the Government are working along the right lines. I am confident that before long Australia will reinstate herself, not only in respect of financial matters, but as a nation in every way. </para>

              <para>- I am very sorry that our military expert, the honorable, member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> has had cause to make that unkind remark.  I am not such a lunatic as to imagine that Australia can afford to face the world unprotected. Whatever party may be in power, we must have a defence policy. If this country is worth living in, it is worth defending, and the time may not be far distant when every man will have to take up arms in its defence. It is idle for us to bury our heads in the sand, like the ostrich, and imagine that we are safe. If the honorable member for Ballarat has a better defence policy, from the Labour point of view, than I have, good luck to him. Let him bring it forward. I. have always been in favour of a defence policy for Australia, and I am satisfied that the defence policies of the Governments which held office during the war materially helped to win that war. None of them disgraced itself. Personally I have no regret whatever for the part which I took in assisting in the establishment of a Citizen Force in Australia: </para>

Nearly every session there is a debate thereon. But it is not always that we have the same opportunity for discussing it at length that we have at present. To me it seems strange that, whereas last year &#163;750,000 was voted under this heading and &#163;942,000 was actually expended, for the current year the proposed expenditure is set down at &#163;1,392,000. I have paid some little attention to this matter, and I candidly confess that I am not in a position to say which officer can be dispensed with, and which officer must be retained. </para>

              <para>- I do hope that the Government will not retain a single man in this Department simply because he has been there for some time. I trust that no more men will be kept than are absolutely essential. When our soldiers returned from the war they were demobilized as rapidly as possible. I trust that the same policy will be pursued in regard to those persons who occupy very much higher positions. I do not think that a single man should be kept on the Defence staff if his services are not required. One cannot fail to be struck with the enormous number of officers for whom provision is made upon these Estimates. I cannot  say which of them should be dispensed with, and I doubt whether any private member is in a position to do so. </para>

              <para>- That is not the question, because every expenditure during the past few years has been abnormal. I have no hesitation in saying that the rifles which we are now producing at a cost of &#163;13 each will be manufactured in the older countries of the world immediately normal conditions re-assert themselves for about half that amount. I doubt the wisdom of manufacturing rifles year after year from one pattern, because long before they may be required for actual service they may have been discarded as obsolete. The rifle that we were producing at Lithgow prior to the war is certainly not one which can be classed, as modern to-day. </para>

It would be the acme of folly for us to continue to manufacture rifles at the terrific cost of &#163;13 each when they may never be used in actual warfare. A similar remark is applicable to the manufacture of ammunition. Our attempts during the war to manufacture shells were certainly not creditable to us. At that time we were turning out shells by the thousand, although we knew that they  could never be used. </para>

              <para>- These shells were condemned as useless by experts, and yet the authorities continued to manufacture them. These are some of the directions in which the Government should exercise the closest supervision. We are exceedingly fortunate to have as the Minister in charge of this Department in this House, and for the first time, a gentleman who has had experience of active service abroad, and who therefore brings to bear upon these matters an intensely practical knowledge. I hope he will keep a close watch over the manufacture of our small arms and ammunition in order that these branches of our Defence Department may be kept quite up to date. I understand that practically the whole of the ammunition which we are manufacturing is intended for reserve purposes. That being so, I trust that we shall not continue year after year to manufacture from a stereotyped model of rifle or of ammunition, lest after the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds the reserve which we have established may be found to be useless. </para>

The aeroplane and the submarine will constitute Australia&#39;s chief defence, and, moreover, they will be our cheapest form of defence. With our enormous sea-board, the greatest of any country in the world, it will be absolutely impossible for 5,000,000 people to maintain a Navy which can adequately defend Australia in case of war. </para>

              <para>- Just about the same fight as we should have to put up if we had a Navy that was &#39;not sufficiently strong to prevent a hostile force from landing. With the submarine and the aeroplane, however, the whole condition is entirely altered. I doubt if any nation would think of transporting millions of fighting men thousands of miles over the sea to attack Australia if they knew that there would almost certainly be a hostile force awaiting them under the water and in the air. I differ entirely from the honorable member who has spoken. If there is one branch of defence we must encourage, it is the Air Force. The only way we can ever get an Air Force in Australia is to encourage as far as possible the commercial use of aeroplanes. In the near future, I believe regular mail services will be carried by aeroplanes over the enormous tracts of Queensland and Western Australia, and in the interior of other parts of Australia at much more frequent intervals than is the case with the present methods of delivery. In this way, the outlying portions of Australia will ba brought into much closer touch with the big trading centres. Aeroplanes have travelled without any difficulty between the mainland and Tasmania, and a practical offer has been made to the Government to establish a mail service by aeroplane across Bass Strait. By this means, the mails will be taken over, under ordinary conditions, in about three and a-half hours. The only way Australia can ever afford to create an air defence force is by utilizing aeroplanes for the mail services in the interior and in its commercial operations, and linking them up with the Defence Force as far as possible. We have made a huge mistake in spending &#163;3,500,000 on a Navy which, to put it in the very mildest way, is not up to date. Instead of spending that money on the class of boats we have, it would be very much better to use it for aeroplane and  submarine services. These would constitute the real protection of Australia if ever she were attacked by a foreign force. </para>

          <para>Parliament must in the near future deal with the question of military camps. I am not enamoured of the proposal to put boys, at just the age when it is most dangerous to take them away from their homes, into camps for the length of time which has been suggested. When Parliament has an opportunity of dealing with that matter, I sincerely hope that it will direct the Defence Department to curtail considerably the period proposed. I very much doubt the wisdom of putting boys of tender age into military camps under military discipline. They could be trained in other ways; and Parliament should be exceedingly cautious, in the best interests of the boys and of the future of Australia, about adopting any principle which will take them away from their homes at a tender age, and put them into camps under military rule. </para>
          <para>The money spent on the rifle clubs of Australia is quite as well spent as any other amount voted for the whole of the Military or Naval Forces. The man behind the sun counts. for a lot; and I have heard over and over again, not only from Australians, but from British officers and privates, that there were no better snipers in the whole of the. armies of Europe than those who went from Australia. I find, also, from conversations with our own fellows, that men who were good shots on their local rifle ranges proved themselves exceedingly valuable in the fighting line wherever Australians had to serve. I congratulate the Government on the assistance they propose to give to the rifle clubs. We obtain excellent value for the money. </para>
          <para>There are no items in the whole of the Estimates which I feel so incompetent to discuss or criticise as those under &#34; Defence.&#34; We must, to a great extent, accept the Estimates as proposed by the Government. The only way we can ever decrease items in Departments such as this is to strike a lump sum off the total, and leave it to the Minister and his officers to make the reduction effective. As the Committee refused to take that course, I do not feel competent to move reductions on individual items. As we are giving the Government practically a free hand in establishing this new Department after the war, we can, as it were, place them on their honour that not one officer will be kept on the list whose .services are not absolutely required, and that the money spent on the arsenal and munitions will be used to provide only up-to-date materials. I trust we shall never have a repetition of what happened at the outbreak of the war, when we were spending good money, that was badly needed for other purposes, in turning out useless shells. I exceedingly regret the increase in these Estimates. The time is very near when this Par Iia- . ment will have to take stock very carefully. We shall be compelled before long, by force of circumstances, to put a stop to the riotous living that we have had in the way of public expenditure in Australia. But while I regret the increase, I candidly confess that I do not feel in a position to say which of the items can be reduced, or which of the officers- can be dispensed with. It is not fair to ask a Committee such as this to take that responsibility. We must hold the Government responsible, and they, in turn, must hold the heads of their Departments responsible. We can say to the Minister in charge, &#34; We are allowing these items to pass because we are not in a position to decide where reductions should be eff ected,&#34; at the same time giving the Government to understand that we shall hold them absolutely and completely responsible for the expenditure in the Naval and Military Departments. </para>

            <para>.- Very few members of this Committee know the real necessity or otherwise for the vast number of amounts provided in these Estimates. I take it that with a Department like Defence the duty of the Government is to put a good Minister in charge, and I think we have a good one in the present Minister. He knows that the responsibility rests on his shoulders of seeing that no unnecessary expense is incurred. We must trust him, just as the managing director of a large concern is trusted. It is folly for us to say that we regret that there is an increase or decrease in Estimates when they are framed by those who have the practical knowledge of what is essential to build up a sufficient defence for this great continent. It may be argued that the main way to defend Australia is by air and under the water, but, with a long coast line such as ours, consisting of thousands of miles, we want something more than the submarine and the aeroplane. We must have men properly trained as soldiers to defend the country should an enemy force ever land in it. We should, therefore, educate our boys in the business of defending the country that belongs to them, just as we educate them and fit them for other walks of life. We have learned by experience the value of this training. I know that 80 per cent, of those in my electorate who were trained in the use of the rifle volunteered for service during the war, and gave a very good account of themselves. It stands to reason that one man who thoroughly understands the use of the rifle is, in war time, as good as two inexperienced men. I observe that the efficiency grant of 5s. per man is now included in the total of &#163;50,000. I hope this amount will insure adequate supplies of rifle club ammunition and for expenses. I do not know of any men who gave a better account of themselves during the war than the volunteers from the backblocks of Australia; men who were experienced in the use of the rifle and accustomed to hardships. - 1 do not agree with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> in his objection to continuing the training of our young Australians. I can see no hardship in requiring our young men to go into camp occasionally. When I was fourteen years of age I had to undergo a good rc;any privations in the western part of Queensland, and I am none the worse for it to-day. It is far better to accustom our lads to a little training of this nature, because it will tend to make them stronger and better fitted, if ever occasion requires, for the defence of this country. I trust that the Minister will explain in more detail than appears in the Estimates how the sum of &#163;50,000 is to bc spent, because I am keenly interested m the question of adequate encouragement being .given to the rifle club movement. &#39; Our young men are imbued with the right spirit, and if ever they are called upon will prove thoroughly efficient in the defence of this country, of which they have reason to be proud. </para>

            <para>.- At the outset, I should like to refer to an interjection. I made while the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> was speaking. He stated that he agreed with the defence policy of the Government in every respect, and I then hart the temerity to say that the policy  i?f  the Government was not the Labour policy, which is to amend the Defence Act so as to secure tho deletion of all sections relating to compulsory training and military service. That is not the policy of the Government. As one member who has signed the Labour platform I am standing by it to-day. I feel sure also that the time is not far distant when the majority of the people of Australia will be siding with the Labour party in their hostility to any form of compulsory military service. </para>

            <para>All branches at Head-Quarters have grown tremendously since the war. During the war most of the heads got away. They were somewhat alarmed on their return that there might not bo enough fat billets to go round. But with a soft Minister, the shortage of billets has been overcome, and. they are now all strutting around Head-Quarters living on the fat of &#39; the land and looking forward to the new Defence proposals to open up new avenues for generals, &#38;e. </para>
            <para>It is a notorious fact that they have all hung to their war rank, and have not dropped back like the warrant officers and other members of the Permanent Forces. If the warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, or private who obtained rank on service has to drop  back  to his pre-war rank, why in the name of all that is fair do not the officers do likewise? </para>

          <para>I think that, if an inquiry is made, it will be found that the Military Head-Quarters </para>
          <para class="block">Staffs have been doubled, or trebled, since the war. When danger was over, positions were found for many. But the Government have not treated the unfortunate  non-commissioned  officers of the Instructional Staff in this manner. I have instances of men who at the outbreak of the war could not get permission to go abroad because they were required here for the training of officers; subsequently they got away. I know of one man who gained his commission in the Australian Imperial Force, was twice wounded in France, and, just before the armistice, was recommended for the rank of major. He did splendid work, but when he came back to Australia &#34;he was immediately reverted to the rank of warrant officer, and was required to salute a Duntroon College cadet, who, in the new order of things, had become his superior officer. He was not permitted to wear the uniform of his rank, but by the grace of God and the authorities of the Department he was allowed to wear the two stars of an honorary lieutenant. As the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> knows, the sergeant-majors were the backbone of the British Army, and likewise, during the war, they were the backbone of the Australian Army; and it is disgraceful that those who were finally permitted to go to the Front, where they rendered a good account of themselves, should, upon their return, be reverted to the rank of warrant officers. I have the case of a captain in Ballarat. This man gained his commission in South Africa. When war broke out, he was retained in Australia to instruct officers, bin ultimately was .sent abroad, did splendid work, gained his captaincy in France, was wounded, and, before he had properly recovered, was in action again, and was wounded a second time. When he came back to Australia, he had. to revert to his former rank - that of sergeantmajor - and to salute a-lad who had been trained at Duntroon College and sent to Ballarat as an officer. I do not speak disparagingly of the trainee, because probably he was too young to go to the war; but it is a most insulting and degrading state of affairs that men who did good service abroad should be treated in this way. The trouble is that the Minister is controlled by a few officers at </para>
          <para class="block">Victoria Barracks; by men who have no sympathy with the non-commissioned officers, and who do not wish promotions to come from the ranks. I cannot understand how a Labour Government and a Labour party came to pass the Defence Act, under which the Duntroon College was established, because it  has denied the ranker all opportunity of promotion. The sooner the Duntroon College is abolished, the better it will be for our defence system. The war proved conclusively that the men who enlisted, and who had never had any thought of war, were more capable than those who had been trained. Many of those who were most successful abroad had never been through Duntroon. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. It has been proved time and again that those who performed the most meritorious feats had risen from the ranks. Great Britain, in all her great wars, has never been in a winning position until the conflict has progressed for some time. In every war in which she has engaged she has been in a losing position at the outset, largely because her military operations were directed by men belonging to an official military clique. As the conflict progressed, and the men who enlisted in the ranks became officers, her prospects improved, and her armies were ultimately victorious. </para>

            <para>There is just another matter I would like to bring under your notice, and that is that members of the. Instructional Staff lose their identity in so far as rank gained on active service is concerned. In my case I was the senior captain in my brigade, and recommended for rank of major at the time of the Armistice^ and as arrangements were being made for all 1014 officers to return to Australia on six months&#39; leave, my prospects were exceptionally good, but with the inopportune signing of the Armistice all hope &#39;of further promotion was gone. Now all permanent officers, Citizen Force officers, and Duntroon graduates, who were members of the Australian Imperial Force, wear their badges of rank  gained  in the field, and are noted as honorary rank, whereas I, with many others of the In1structional Staff, are not permitted to wear on our uniform the badges of rank gained in the field (captains&#39; stars) ; but as an act of grace we are permitted to wear the badges of a lieutenant, and are noted for rank as honorary lieutenants with the pay and status of a warrant officer. The question is: Why are \vc not permitted to wear our badges of rank gained in the field, and, like all other members of tlie Australian Imperial Force, be noted for honorary rank? </para>
            <para>Now all that was done for the Instructional Staff was to grant forty-two commissions as adjutants and quartermasters, namely, twentytwo permanent commissions and twenty temporary commissions, the latter to be dispensed with as graduates from Duntroon become available for absorption. I might state here that this is only a side issue, as the rate of pay is fixed at &#163;300 per annum to a maximum of &#163;400 per annum; therefore they are debarred from tlie privileges of taking rank and pay as permanent officers of tlie Defence Department. The selection was made from those who held most senior rank in the Australian Imperial Force. Colonels and majors in Australian Imperial Force were given rank as honorary majors. Captains appointed were given honorary rank as captains. All captains who did not come within the forty-two above mentioned were given what is called &#34; a grace &#39; of God commission,&#34; <inline font-style="italic">i.e..</inline> their substantive rank is warrant officer, but permitted to wear the badges of a lieutenant and to be known as honorary lieutenants in the Citizen Forces. </para>
            <para>In my case, although I held a commission in two campaigns, I did not come within the forty-two most senior ranks of the Australian Imperial Force. Therefore I lose any chance of ever gaining a commission in the Permanent Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">That is the point I wish to make, and it will be seen that, quite apart from the right to retain their rank, they are denied promotion. They are an absolute fixture, and, in times of peace, they cannot receive any promotion whatever. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> if that is a fair proposition, and whether it is a just way to encourage the Instructional Staff. I trust the Minister who represents the Department of Defence iri this Chamber will have a searching inquiry made to see if, in these two instances, something like justice cannot be done. I would also be glad if an investigation were made into the question of allowances. Under the present regulation, brigadiers-general  have fixed their own travelling allowances at 20s. per day, although their salaries may be &#163;1,000 or &#163;1,500 per year; but a warrant officer, who is in receipt of a very low remuneration, receives only 10s. per day. It is time this class distinction was swept overboard. </para>

          <para>I also wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the position of the boys at present imprisoned at Pentridge. I must say that I was surprised at the reply given by the Minister to a question I submitted &#34;a few days ago. I took the opportunity of interviewing some of these lads, and I would like honorable members on both sides of the House to remember that the war is well behind us, and that we are approaching the festive season. I sincerely trust that, for once, we shall be able to sink our party feelings and endeavour to give these men a fair deal. I direct honorable members&#39; attention to the case of Henry Jones, of the 5th Battalion, who was thirty-nine years of age when he enlisted and who served for two years in Egypt and France. This unfortunate man was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years&#39; imprisonment. I was informed by an official at Pentridge that if Jones had been found guilty of a similar offence under our civil laws he would already have served a sufficient period of detention. I interviewed Jones, who seems to be a very decent fellow. </para>

              <para>- Let me inform the &#34;honorable member that he is not conversant with military law, and that in the Army it does not require much evidence on which to convict a man. It was proved that a number of other soldiers were shooting rabbits in the vicinity. The evidence disclosed that Jones was intoxicated and totally incapable of doing injury to any one. He was asleep when arrested, and he was court martialled, and sentenced to ten years&#39; imprisonment. Even if he was responsible for the deed, it was committed when he was intoxicated, and the AssistantMinister for Defence knows that France was not the most sober place during the war. Before I left Australia I .thought that I had seen a lot of whisky, but at the Front I saw it, not only in bottles, but in scores of cases. If Jones was responsible for the deed, he has already suffered a good deal. It is two years since the armistice was signed, and this man&#39;s family is suffering to-day. He left Australia with the best of motives, and even if guilty, surely he has paid the penalty. </para>

          <para>There is also the case of a man named Moore, of the 5th Battalion, who enlisted at seventeen years of age. His mother is a widow, and he is one of a family of thirteen. Prior to the signing&#39; of the armistice, he had scarcely a black mark against him, but after that event he was found guilty of robbery in Belgium. When the cessation of hostilities was being celebrated, every one was excited and overjoyed, and I believe if every one had his dues there are others who should be imprisoned for the extraordinary and extravagant acts that were committed. The nerves of the men who had been in the fighting line were not in the best of condition, and whatever character this lad had at the signing of the armistice the horrors of war were responsible for it. The war is responsible for all the bad that may be in him. We consider ourselves Christians, and yet we allow to remain in prison a little lad, who, atseventeen years of  age,  when practically a baby, not knowing right from wrong, left this country to fight for it abroad. He did his duty nobly, but when the fighting was over, he committed &#171;a crime, and now, two years after the fighting has ceased, he is still in Pentridge, and his old widowed mother is breaking her heart in consequence. Never mind what your military chiefs may say, let that lad out, so that he may rejoin his family before Christmas. Let him out immediately ! </para>

              <para>-Another case is that of Alfred Lloyd, 1st Division Ammunition Column, who was seventeen years of age when he enlisted. He left on the first boat that went away. Before the Armistice he received two years for &#34;A.W.L.&#34; He was sent into the compound atRouen, and every Australian boy that went there was brutally treated by the British staff-sergeants. I have known boys to be kicked and beaten there, and on a cold winter day to have only a dirty sack for covering. I have known them to be wakened by having a bucket of water thrown over them. This lad escaped fromRouen, and was captured after the signing of the Armistice. He was charged with threatening, with intent to shoot, the military police that sought to arrest him. Members of this Committee who saw service know that the soldiers did not like the military police. There was no love lost between them. This lad, I am told, could easily have shot the military policeman. </para>

He was charged with fighting another private on the way home in the boat, and received twelve months for it. His offence was committed after the war was over; and it must be remembered that itwas the fighting spirit that made the Australian Force such a potent factor in the war. </para>

              <para>- I do not think he was to blame; this man was the aggressor. Another case is that of Hugh Smith, No. 1114. I did not know when I went to Pentridge that I would meet any one that I knew, but this boy came to me when I was at Havre. He had then done twelve months in the compound atRouen. He enlisted at the age of fifteen years, and his statement to me was that he was found drunk during a march. </para>

          <para class="block">I remember him telling me that at Havre.  His  statement the other day corresponds with that which I entered in my diary at the time. He said that, although he was drunk, he had marched 47 miles carrying a full pack, rifle, and 250 rounds of ammunition.  He  did his time inRouen, and then saw further service with the Australian Imperial Force. On returning to Australia he got into trouble on the boat, and received two years for assault. He is in Pentridge to-day. I trust that honorable members will unhesitatingly join with me in asking the Minister to release these boys without making further inquiries about them. Every one of them has done his bit. Every one of them has seen fighting, and has been in a &#34;hop-over.&#34; Most of them are now suffering for offences committed after the war ended, and three or four of them enlisted and left Australia between the ages of fifteen and seventeen years, a fact which should convince honorable members that they were good lads, and that if they, have deteriorated in character, that deterioration is due to the associations of camp life and militarism. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that the honorable member mentioned that. If an officer commits a crime, there is no gaol for him. He is not even degraded to the ranks, and his offence is not published broadcast, as have been the offences of these boys. Officers who did wrong were returned to Australia as first class passengers, and continued to wear their stars and their stripes on the boat. They came back under the best conditions, and were quietly and secretly dismissed from the Force. Contrast their treatment with that of the privates. Not one officer went to gaol, but thousands of our Australian boys were imprisoned. </para>

He will see that they are not criminals, but good Australians.

              <para>- I will rest satisfied with that statement if I get the promise of the Minister at the table that no preparations will he made before next June for the carrying out of this scheme of training; that positions will not be found for officers whose duty it will be to make arrangements for putting the youths into camp. If we passed .these Estimates, there would be nothing to prevent the Department from marking preparations for doing what I object to. </para>

              <para>- I think that the honorable gentleman could promise that nothing would be done until Parliament had discussed the scheme. Is it to be thought that Parliament will surrender its responsibilities to the Minister for Defence and the little clique at the Victoria Barracks? It is said that the Department is controlled by Tommy Trumble, Tommy Dodds, and Tommy Lawson; but I am not prepared to hand it over to these three Tommies, or to any one else. Major-General White was absent from Australia for such a long time that he does not know the feeling of Australians to-day. He is the originator of this training scheme, and is a good soldier, but has been out of Australia for nine years. </para>

              <para>- I can rely on the man who supplied me with this information. At all events, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Major -</inline> General White has been away for nine years, or only nine days, I do not hesitate to say that the people of Australia are practically unanimous in their opposition to the creation of a military caste in this country. They are not going to allow boys of eighteen years of age to spend seventy days a year in a military camp. If those of our clergy who went to the war and saw the demoralizing effect of camp life on our boys, were to tell the people of what happened in the camps, I am satisfied that there would be no chance of any youth of eighteen being allowed by his parents to spend seventy days a year in a military camp here. Only to-night the Minister has had to send to Broadmeadows Camp officers to investigate charges of the most revolting and serious character, and as one who knows something of what occurred in military camps during the war, I tell the honorable gentleman that if I can prevent it he will never get a boy of eighteen in my constituency to go into a military camp for seventy days a year. There will be open revolt and mutiny before that is possible. </para>

              <para>- Column after column has appeared in the newspapers with regard to such a scheme, and preparations have been made for it. The military authorities are constantly going about the country, and talking about the possibility of our having to defend ourselves before long, and telling the people that they ought to be ready and willing to agree that their boys shall go into camp every year for a period of seventy days, I am hostile to the proposal. What I have seen of military affairs is not very much; but I know that our boys did not have much military training before the&#39; war, and yet rendered magnificent service. Those who had had no military training whatever before the war were splendid soldiers within a month or two of their taking up military duties, and our men generally showed that they would compare favorably with the best fighting troops of the world. There is., however, at the Victoria Barracks, St. Kildaroad , a little clique who insist upon telling the people that it is necessary to have military camps at which boys may be drilled in military evolutions such as &#34; left wheel &#34; and &#34; right wheel,&#34; &#34; right turn&#34; and &#34;left turn.&#34; In modern warfare, however, that sort of thing does not count. When men are marching up the line, no one cares whether they are in step or out of step. They are either dodging shells or watching aeroplanes from which bombs are being thrown, and no one gives a thought to the question of whether or not they are marching in step. What they need to be taught is how to use a pick, so that they may dig themselves in. It is absurd that our boys, at the most critical period in their lives, should be asked to waste whole months every year in a military camp; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Government as a whole, should recognise that the people of Australia are absolutely against this proposal. They will not allow their boys to become professional soldiers. </para>

          <para>I agree with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> that our principal need is to develop our submarine system and air services. We do not want any more vessels of the type of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> nor do we require any standing army. We ought to specialize in submarines and aeroplanes, and see to it that we have heavy artillery for land defence purposes. Save in those directions, we require no defence expenditure; but Australia ought certainly to be able to manufacture everything that is required for her own defence. We do not want to be at the mercy of any country when war breaks out ; but I do not think that there is any fear of war for the next twenty years, so far as Australia is concerned. </para>

          <para>If we give the military authorities an opportunity to spend &#163;1,000 they will spend &#163;10,000. They have no responsibility in regard to the finding of the money, and they practise but little economy. I would be willing to vote to reduce the Defence Estimates by at least one-half. If we allowed the Defence authorities to carry on with one-half of the expenditure for which these Estimates provide we would do no injury to our defence system. The effect, on the contrary, would, I believe, be rather beneficial. I shall conclude with the hop-i that the members of our Instructional Staff, now that the Minister is seized with the facts as to their treatment, will get a fairer deal than they have hitherto received; that immediate  attenion  will be given to the case of the unfortunate soldiers now lying in Pentridge, and that there will be no attempt to force our own lads into military camps for a period of seventy days a year. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. It has already been mentioned that officers who gained rank in the field have been allowed to retain their honorary rank. I know Lieutenant-Colonel Somerville very well. He was in my brigade, but his permanent rank in the service here is only that of a captain, and he receives the pay of a captain. He is in the Inspector-General&#39;s Department, and attends chiefly to matters relating to hospitals, and also to administrative details. Lieutenant-Colonel Hurst also has only the permanent rank and the pay of a captain. Although he is an honorary lieutenantcolonel he receives only the pay of a captain, and is looking after artillery matters. Smith, I think, is only a major. I am not quite sure on the point, but he is certainly not a lieutenantcolonel in the Australian Forces* He has an honorary rank. </para>

A native came up in order to prevent him, and seized his disc with a view to identification. This soldier rode back to camp, got his rifle and cartridges, returned to the grazing ground, found the native, and shot him. These are absolute facts. </para>

              <para>- All the cases in Pentridge to-day have received consideration and reconsideration. Every case has been before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran and the Minister, and there have been reductions of sentences for Armistice Day, along with other deductions granted by the Governor-General. I do not think the sentences that these men are called upon to serve are too heavy for the crimes committed. In fairness to the men who &#34; played the game,&#34; and committed no crime, these guilty men ought to be punished. If those guilty of crime are to go unpunished, what incentive will there be for any man to go straight all the time? I have for a long time intended to visit Pentridge, and I shall go there at the first chance that offers. I shall have a look at these men, inquire into each of the cases, and see if anything possibly can be done for them. If I think there is a case deserving of any. further consideration. I shall be only too pleased to have the matter thoroughly investigated. </para>

            <para>- When the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> visits Pentridge, I hope he will inquire into what I believe to be one of the most infamous cases of ill-treatment that has ever come under my notice. The honorable gentleman may recall that some inmates there were doing a &#34;hunger strike,&#34; and, while I do not approve of that sort of thing, I wish he would inquire into an allegation that the medical man stopped the prisoner&#39;s supply of water. It is well known that if a person be deprived of food and water he cannot live longer than seven or eight days. Of course, if the medical man took that step under orders he is innocent, but I wish to know who gave the orders. The Assistant Minister for Defence, in his first speech as Minister, was man enough to say that he would teach a lesson to any one who &#34; sold him a pup &#34; in his Department; . and, therefore, I ask him with confidence to look into this case. In the Home Land the authorities allow any one to starve who is foolish enough to do so, but they never stop the supply of the life-giving fluid, water. Personally, I cannot believe that any medical man would give such an order without authority, and the case certainly requires thorough investigation. </para>

            <para>.   -  I desire to say a few words regarding the military prisoners in Darlinghurst Gaol. They are not very desperate characters. There is only one man among the handful who has anything like a list of previous convictions.  His  trouble was that he was left an orphan, and, owing to the company he kept, he got into trouble subsequently as a soldier. The men in Darlinghurst, if they had been convicted under the civil law, would have been free long before now because of their good conduct. I want these men to be released from the stigma of being detained in a military prison. Theacts which placed them there were ill-advised and deserving of some punishment; but in New South Wales to-day crime is being very largely wiped out. We can afford to do without some of our gaols. One prison has already been turned into an agricultural college, and I want to see Darlinghurst Gaol made over into a technical college. We cannot advertise Australia better than to tell the world that our people are so law-abiding that we are turning our prisons into colleges. There is another reason why some people want Darlinghurst to be changed from a gaol to a college, and the old marks of its history as a prison removed. At Darlinghurst there is a wall which is about 30 feet high. The convicts who. built it used to mark their initials upon the wall and place the broad arrow beside them. At Darlinghurst today there are seventeen officers looking after eight military prisoners and some stores. Those officers do not want to remain on that job ; they would prefer to be placed in some more pleasant occupation. I do not wish to be always catechising the Government, but I want them to perform some good act. I make this appeal because I think that the Assistant Minister is rather favorable to it. I hope that he will take no notice of those persons who wish to &#34; sell him a pup.&#34; I feel sure that if he complies with my request his action will bear good fruit. </para>

            <para>.- I have no desire to repeat the arguments which have been so well put by honorable members, that the Defence Estimates have not been reduced to the extent that they should have been - in other words, to something approaching our pre-war expenditure. But there is one matter to which I wish to direct special attention, namely, the advisableness of permitting our soldiers to cash their war gratuity bonds. It cannot be said that this question has no reference to defence, because our soldiers who went to the Front rendered service to this country, to the British Empire, and to civilization generally under our Defence Department, and the war gratuity was given to them in recognition of that service. May I look for the aid of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> in urging upon the Government the desirableness of permitting these war gratuity bonds to be cashed - at all events in oases in which their holders find persons who are willing to give them the face value for their bonds ? I do not ask the Government to cash the bonds. My purpose is rather to urge that the holders of the bonds shall be able to negotiate them with persons who are willing to pay their face value in cash. </para>

              <para>- If the Assistant Minister suggests that they may be cashed under the lap, and that those who purchase them will not be prosecuted, it would be much better for the Government to announce the fact openly, because the idea that persons may be prosecuted for cashing the bonds leads to the holders of them being taken down , to some extent. The Government policy in connexion with this matter should be made known. </para>

But the rich holder of war bonds is able to negotiate them. </para>

I am stating what everybody knows - that  the soldier holder of a war gratuity bond is in a different position from the civilian holder of an ordinary war bond. If I judge public opinion correctly, the public desire that those soldiers who wish to negotiate their bonds at the market rate should be given an opportunity of doing so. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member did not say anything of the kind. The conditions are quite plain for anybody to understand, but the trouble with the honorable member is that, when he is given a statement, he will not take it. He keeps on with his own assertion. Here he is again wanting to make another trouble about the cashing of war gratuity bonds. He is all the while exploiting the soldier for political ends. He does it every day of the week, every time he is here, on every occasion that he rises to his feet. He has done it already to-day, and is doing it again now.  His  troubles about the soldier and his bond; his troubles about anything but getting over here; and he is further off it than ever. That is his only trouble. He cares as much about the soldier as he does about anything else.  His  one aim is to make political capital out of him, and it is just as well that the soldier should know what a great champion he has in the honorable member. </para>

He can always get what he gives, if that is what he is out for; but I shall not permit him to make the absolutely  incorrect statements about the soldier and his bond that he is continually repeating in this chamber. I tell the honorable member once again that we will not agree to make these bonds such that they may be manipulated by designing persons to the detriment of the  soldier. </para>

            <para>. - It is easily seen that we should have adjourned at the usual time of the Tuesday night&#39;s sitting. We are dealing with the biggest spending Department of the Commonwealth. We have been discussing these Estimates for two and threequarter hours. The Government promised a full discussion on financial issues, and, apparently, they think that two and three-quarter hours is quite sufficient to devote to the most spendthrift Department that we have. If they are of that opinion, I am not. I have quite a number of items to discuss ; but I wish to discuss them within reasonable hours. It is only fair to ask that we should be allowed to deal with these Estimates at a time when we can do so most intelligently. Quite a number of honorable members on this side, and, according to their professions, quite a number on the other side, were going to pounce upon the Defence Estimates whenever they saw the light, and attack them tooth and claw. I notice a number of headings in the introduction to the Defence Estimates. They deal with the year 1920-21, and the figures for 1919-20 are also given. There are two other columns, one showing increases and the other decreases of expenditure, as compared with 1919-20. One heading is, &#34; Aviation Instructional Staff.&#34; </para>

              <para>- It appears under, the heading of &#34;Defence.&#34; It, therefore, should be competent for an honorable member to refer to it for the purpose of making some comparison of defence expenditure. In connexion with this vote for the Aviation Instructional Staff it would appear that this year there will be a saving of &#163;26,813, though honorable members have indicated clearly that development in connexion with aviation and submarine defence should be upon more vigorous lines than, perhaps, in any other branch of the Defence Department. </para>

              <para>- I find also that in connexion with Central Administration, whatever that may mean, there is an apparent increase of &#163;33,505. Salaries and all other expenditure in connexion with Central Administration appear to be going up, while in connexion with other and more essential matters, expenditure appears to be going down. The Royal Military College shows an increase,  a3  compared with the previous year, nf &#163;4,348, and the Cordite Factory a decrease of &#163;7,067. If the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> were here he would no doubt have something to say in connexion with the latter factory. My complaint is that if the military officials require anything, they can obtain it; but if money is needed for the development of Government enterprises on the civil side it is not available. The honorable member for Hunter  made a very valuable suggestion in connexion with our Cordite Factory. It is well known that a number of chemists employed there are doing valuable work in the preparation and testing of munitions for defence purposes. I believe that with a very small additional expenditure their services could be utilized with advantage in the testing of locallymanufactured explosives for use in mines and other occupations. This is a work which the Government might very well take in hand. Of course, the Government might ask why they should undertake this work. I am satisfied that, if a fee were charged, it would be willingly paid. At present we have no testing station for locallymanufactured explosives, and as State legislation prohibits the use of any explosives that have not been tested in some recognised testing station, all explosives at present used in our mines and other occupations are imported, because they bear the hall-mark of some British testing station. </para>

          <para>The activities of the Harness and Saddlery Factory, established primarily for the supply of equipment to our troops, might also be extended for the benefit of the general public. It was my pleasure during the Royal Agricultural Society&#39;s Show in Melbourne a month or two ago, to visit the shop erected by the management of the Commonwealth Harness Factory. There was a magnificent display of harness, leggings, boots, &#38;c, and the officials in charge were doing a roaring trade. I could not help thinking that, after all, the Government were making good use of the factory by supplying these articles to the returned soldier f armers, who were getting them at a price lower than that at which they could have been obtained elsewhere. I was glad to know that the Government were doing this, but I could not help thinking that they might well go further, and from this well-equipped factory supply articles to the general public. It would pay the Government to develop the Harness Factory along these lines. </para>

              <para>- The Government have been doing it for a certain section of the population - deservedly so - and if they can supply returned soldiers surely there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent you from supplying others. A farmer named Jones may have been over age, and not able to go to the war, but he should be supplied with saddlery and leather goods from the Commonwealth Factory just the same as Robinson,, who was a younger man, and who served his country at the war. Surely there is no reason why these governmental activities should not be increased. I would rather see money spent in extending these factories to benefit the civil as well as the ex-soldier population than on items which I think mean merely catering for the whims of the war maniacs and panicky people we have in our community. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not; but we were anxious that similar factories should be established on the Parramatta and elsewhere. The mill at Geelong performed splendid work during the war period, and has been doing so ever since. I know that many returned soldiers have received cloth from that factory at a rate and of a quality that will compare more than favorably with anything obtained elsewhere. I trust that the extension of the Geelong Woollen Mills is an indication that the Government are prepared not only to supply soldiers with material, but every one else who desires it. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> had been in the chamber a few moments earlier, he would have heard my references to the Cordite Factory, and my suggestion that a valuable service would be rendered to the community if a little additional money were expended in the erection of a testing station where Australianmade explosives could be tested. I understand that, according to a New South Wales Statute, only tested explosives can be used in the mines ; and as we have no such station in Australia, we are preventing a number of our own people being employed on this work. </para>

          <para>On perusing the Estimates, I find that on many items where expenditure could be judiciously increased, a saving is being effected, and that where a reduction could reasonably be made, increases are shown. Here is one item that may seem a very small matter. There is an item on the Estimates to cover the expense of providing certain uniforms to members of the Railway War Council, who comprise the different Railways Commissioners, and perhaps some of the engineers engaged on railway work. Is this country going to expend a sum of money in supplying these officers with military uniform? simply because they happen to be advisers to our military authorities? These men might well go without uniforms, and the money be ex- .pended in some useful direction. </para>
          <para>There is a number of items&#39; that one might discuss in connexion with these Estimates, and I fully expected that we would have had a full-dress debate on our war expenditure. I agree with the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> that Australia is not likely to be at war for another thirty years. I trust it will be longer. It is time we gave close attention to our military expenditure. We know that the Minister in charge of these Estimates has a military title, and deservedly so; but I repeat what I said some time ago : that I believe Australia, by. the steps she is taking, and led by her Government, is becoming as great a military nation as any other country. We are indulging in huge military expenditure, and allowing ourselves to be controlled by a military caste. Every one knows the position in which the junker class placed Germany, and which ultimately led to her ruin. Any country controlled by a military caste needs careful watching, particularly in regard to the expenditure of money. Nations that begin speaking of war are more likely to become embroiled than those who remain silent. We have only to look at the smaller countries to realize that those which do the least to protect themselves are the safest. Consider the small countries in Europe, and the immunity they have enjoyed when war has been raging all around them. </para>

              <para>- The countries of Europe with small and  unwar-like  populations did not suffer in the war; it was the other countries, which, as generally happens with those who are always looking for fight, got more than they wanted. An attempt is being made to rush through the Defence Estimates by manufacturing scares about the evil intentions of this country and that. Such attempts have been practised by the military caste in all countries from time immemorial. A Parliament such as this, however, is not so faint-hearted as to be frightened into approval of expenditure by such threats. We are supposed to have just finished the war that was undertaken to end war. Australia is far removed from the war -like countries of the world, though, I admit, not far from the coloured races; yet we are spending money on war-like preparations which would be better spent on the development of our resources. Probably the bulk of out returned fighting men would say that it is time that something was done for Australia on real developmental lines. T shall vote for the amendment, not only as a protest against the non-negotiability of the war gratuity bonds&#39;, but also as a protest against this defence expenditure. </para>

          <para>I was glad that the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> McGrath)  got a statement from the Assistant Minister about the compulsory military training proposals. He was told that no steps would be taken this year to enforce the seventy days&#39; training scheme, about which so much has been said and written. I. tell the Government that they -are in for the most troublesome time they have ever had if, next financial year,. they insist on giving our youths seventy days of continual training. It has been the boast of Australia that our soldiers, like our workmen, are as adaptable as any men on the face of the earth. Experts have testified that with very little training the Australian soldier could do as well as, and in many cases better than, any other soldier taking part in the war. All that the proposed scheme of training would do would be to provide fat billets  for officers who are well looked after, while the rank and file are allowed to scratch for a crust. Although I do not detract from what individual officers did at the Front, I say that they were well paid for it, and are being provided for now that they are back. I ask, however, whether honorable members &#39;think that the next war will be like the last one. It will not be like it. We had to scrap our old methods, and to adopt the new methods of the enemy, before we could make any headway, and it will be the same in the next war, if there is to be one ; though God grant that it may not come for many years, if it comes at all. Although the last war was to be the last of all wars, Australia, in proportion to population, is making more extensive military preparations than any other country ; and we do wrong in building up a strong military caste here and allowing it to rule the roost. </para>

It was published broadcast to the world that the last war was to end wars. The Treasurer gasconaded about the country, asking men to go to the war because it would be the last; but do these Estimates evidence any belief in that statement? No. On the contrary, Australia is showing a more military spirit than any other country of her population. We have our military junkers, and a disaster like that which overwhelmed Germany will befall  us if, like Germany, we pay heed to our junkers. </para>

The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has said that he supported the amendment which has been moved by the honorable member for West Sydney as a protest against the nonnegotiability of the war gratuity bonds, and also as a protest against the whole of our Defence expenditure. </para>

              <para>- I am not going to be led into that position. Although I agree with the honorable member for West Sydney in regard to the bonds being made negotiable, I have no intention of supporting a proposal to reduce the present Defence Estimates. There are two, and, perhaps, they are the best, arguments against spending money on defence in Australia. The first is furnished by the League of Nations - though, frankly, I do not myself believe in the League. The only league I believe in consists of Great Britain herself, the Dominions, and, above all, the British Navy. To any one, however, who does believe in the League of Nations it affords, perhaps, the best argument. </para>

              <para>- Quite so.; and I think I would be prepared to vote against money being spent on our representation at Geneva or anywhere else. However, the second argument which might be advanced against spending money on defence in Australia - and this, perhaps, is the best of all - is that this country is particularly well situated, in that she, has now, and will have for the next twenty years, a large number of veteran soldiers. That, in itself, is a great safeguard, but, of course, it will eventually die away.  I  wish we were able to reduce the Defence Estimates, but in the present position of the world I am not willing to take the responsibility of voting for a reduction. I have spent a good many of my years as a soldier, and I can assure the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> that the more I see of soldiering the less I like it - that the more I see of military life the less it appeals to me. I can also assure the honorable member that there is no danger of the bulk of our soldiers ever becoming &#34;junkers.&#34; I am a great believer in the citizen soldier, and the more we study military history the more we realize how extraordinarily well he acquits himself in warfare. I think one can say without egotism that this remark is particularly applicable to the Australian, who, and especially the bushman, is naturally a good fighting man. I have great faith in the citizen soldiers of Australia, and for that reason I was pleased to hear the few words from the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> on behalf of the rifle clubs. I know that the rifle clubs have a good friend in the honorable member, and I am pleased to know that the Government are able to be a little more generous towards them. I should like to suggest to the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> that the scope of the clubs might be a little enlarged. To my mind, if Australia ever has to fight a defensive warfare, the machine gun will prove to be the very queen of weapons. I am convinced there is no weapon so suitable, especially for defence purposes, in Australia; and I have often wondered, since returning to Australia from the war, whether it would not be possible for the Government to spread a knowledge of its construction and use amongst the members of rifle clubs. I fancy the study would be readily taken up by the riflemen, and there is no doubt that this would form a wise and effective addition to our defences. </para>

              <para>- Much has been said regarding the Labour party&#39;s attitude towards compulsory training. With very rare exceptions, the whole of the Labour |pa(rty, both parliamentary re-   preservatives and rank and file outside, have been in the past whole-heartedly in favour of a Citizen Force, and the compulsory training of our youth. But, like quite a number of people in the community, the Labour party has been compelled, by evidence, to alter their views, opinions, and policy on the question of compulsory training. It is only about two years ago that, in our conference, I personally advocated as strongly as possible the compulsory training of our youth; but I am of a totally different opinion to-day. I believe, in the first place, that such training is not necessary, and, in the second place, I am not prepared to perpetuate the evil of the military system and militarist class in Australia. Quite a number of honorable members on the Government benches have also changed. There is, for instance, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who has altered his opinion with reference to the Australian Navy. He has, in fact, turned a complete somersault. Then, there are many other of the Government supporters who have completely changed their political views, policies, and programme; they have not only changed in regard to a section pf their views; they have cast the whole down and grabbed up another set. When people talk reproachfully about the Labour party having changed their minds, they should at least consider whether they also have not changed. After all, it is only fools and dead men who do not change their minds. </para>

There is a rumour, supported by responsible officials, that long periods of training are to take place, and if that be so, the Committee should be given definite information on the subject.

              <para>- Are we to take it, then, that,, after June, there will be long periods of training ? I am certain that the indignation, not only of the Labour party, but of those interested in farming and pastoral pursuits, and also in the commercial business of the country, will be so great that the Government will be compelled to drop the proposal. In the farming and pastoral industries, there are periods when the young men therein employed would find it impossible to give the time required for training, and the same remark applies to business interests in the city. Australia cannot afford these long periods of compulsory training, and I hope that the Government will not persist m their idea. </para>

          <para>I should now like to say a word in reference to gratuity bonds. Some few months ago I received certain letters, and I made certain representations to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> I also asked the right honorable gentleman questions iu the House with regard to the cashing of the bonds. I asked whether it was a fact that financiers - the Jews of the country - were making unduly high profits out of the unfortunate plight of some of our returned soldiers. The Treasurer stated that if I had any specific case to give he would have it investigated. On the face of it, that was a proper attitude; but the information which I have already given in this House, and which I now repeat, is that insurance companies, land-dealers, and unscrupulous furniture-dealers are taking advantage of the returned soldier. Many of these furniture-dealers have not a stick of furniture, not even a shop, but, in their dealings with the bonds, they are selling &#163;20 worth of furniture for &#163;60. Insurance companies are charging three years&#39; premium. </para>

              <para>- They should be, promptly. I have been told of an insurance firm, doing business at 31 Queenstreet, Melbourne, which had five or six agents out. These parties were not paid any salary by the companies; they got sufficient from the soldiers to make handsome wages for themselves. They took the &#34; Diggers &#34; to the insurance people, and - apparently with the consent of this Government - the company was allowed to demand three years&#39; premiums from the soldiers. Why should a soldier who has a &#163;100 bond be compelled to pay three years&#39; premiums in advance. Do the Government stand for that? It is, apparently, part of the policy of the Government. Why should there be discrimination between citizens and returned soldiers ? Had the Government accepted, the advice given them by this party, such things would not have occurred. I realize, of course, that, no matter what the Government had done, there would have been wholesale robbery of the soldiers; but while furniture dealers are allowed to sell furniture at twice its value, and while insurance companies are free to demand three years.&#39; premiums and to hand out only a certain proportion of cash to soldier clients, the Government are doing nothing to stop this robbery. Journeying from Sydney recently, there was a real estate agent who told me he had seen what was going on in the land business. He stated that land was being sold to returned men at about four times its value. So rotten was the whole situation that he was coming over to Melbourne to find out what was actually the position. That man refused to have anything to do with cashing soldiers&#39; bonds; the business was so  &#34;smellful.&#34;  If honorable members can find out these things, so can the Government. </para>

              <para>- It is impossible for me to do so. I am asked, &#34; Have you. investigated this and that?&#34; Do the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> and others, who doubt that this robbery is going on, deny what I have said of the insurance companies ? If they accept my word, or are aware of the facts from other sources, do they consider that the soldiers are being given a fair deal ? The sooner the Government appoint a Commission of inquiry to go into the whole matter of cashing gratuity bonds the better for our soldiers and the country. A soldier who is hard up gets into the hands of the Jews. He does not say anything about it, although he has to pay through the nose, just as any one else must do who goes to the Jews. The soldiers are being robbed right and left every day; and, if the Government will not appoint a Commission, or Select Committee, to probe the many charges which are being made, it will be all the worse for those of our returned men who are still seeking cash for their bonds. </para>

              <para>- This is quite a distinct case from that to which the Treasurer refers. It is the case of a returned soldier who complains that he wanted cash for his bond. A certain land agent came along and made representations to him about the value of a piece of land and its proximity to a railway station. A? a result the soldier purchased it. He now states that he was charged for it an amount, altogether in excess of its value. A letter from the land agent was enclosed in my letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mulvaney</inline> to-day. The soldier complains that he- has been very badly treated. </para>

The amount of his gratuity was &#163;80. . . . He did not know how to cash his gratuity bond, and was persuaded to go to a metropolitan firm, which, he was informed, would negotiate it for him. On making inquiry at the firm&#39;s premises, he was told by one of the principals that it would be necessary for him to purchase goods to the value of &#163;33 before they could give him the balance of the &#163;80. As he saw no other way of getting the money he required, he consented to make purchases to the amount stated, and he. bought a quantity of clothing, some of which he was in need of, but of which the larger portion was superfluous. The price of each article appeared to him to be extortionate. The following is a list of most of the articles supplied him and the prices: - </para>

              <para>- I shall be a representative of the people most of the time that I am here, but if I can get cash for my bond I shall be a Federal servant. If there were no difficulty about the matter, quite a number of persons would gladly cash gratuity bonds for our soldiers. I cannot understand how such an arrangement would interfere with the finances of the Commonwealth. .We merely ask that our soldiers shall be allowed to do just what they please with their bonds. I have already cited the case of a returned man who is in receipt of a pension of 21s. per week. . I do not think that he will live for three years. He has applied to the authorities to obtain cash for &#39;his bond, but his application has been refused. I appealed against that decision, but it was re-affirmed that this was not a necessitous case. Gash will not be of much use to that soldier when he is dead, but if he could get it to-day it might prolong his life by enabling him to obtain medical attention and necessaries of which he is badly in need. I admit that there is a danger that if the bonds are made negotiable some people will make money out of them. </para>

              <para>- They can. There are a few here and there who will lose if this proposition is carried, but the groat majority know how many shillings are in the pound., and how much interest they are entitled to receive from their bonds. Very few of them will be robbed, especially if the &#39; transaction is conducted in the open. No one has more to do with gratuity bonds than I have. Every day I go to Ballarat at least fifty soldiers ask me how they can get cash for them. Any number of the bonds arc changing hands to-day with the permission of the Treasury. The soldiers are signing a statement that they are getting full face value and interest, but they are also paying &#163;10 or &#163;15 back to the purchaser. That is being .done every day. The soldier is being robbed of his &#163;10 or &#163;15 because the avenues by which he can get cash are so limited. He is badly in want of the money, and cannot get it from the Treasury, so he enters into a secret arrangement of that sort. </para>

              <para>- As a man of the world the Treasurer knows what is going on. It is fair and .reasonable to ask that instead of having one customer for his bond the soldier should be given an opportunity to have the whole of the financial community as purchasers. He would then be in an infinitely better position than he is in to-day with his restricted opportunities for selling. I trust that the Assistant Minister for Defence and the Treasurer will allow the bonds to be sold on the Stock Exchange of Australia in the open market by soldiers who need cash, and who want to be treated as the soldiers in every other part of the world have been treated. Nowhere else were soldiers paid in bonds. Here, as we have paid  them in bonds, let us be fair to them by making the bonds negotiable and exchangeable on the open market. </para>

              <para>- It is not -fair to the people, or to the members of the Committee to expect fifty-three pages of Estimates to be put through in two hours. No one could give them in that short time the consideration to which they are entitled. The Government seem to be intent on rushing the Estimates through without allowing the opportunity for that free discussion which the amount of money involved warrants. Some members ask, &#34;What does it matter?&#34; </para>

              <para>- These things are linked up with one another. If the Treasurer persists in saying that the question has no relation to the Defence Estimates, he is practically censuring you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter,</inline> for allowing the discussion to go on.  You  have already ruled that the subject is relevant to the Estimates. If members of the Government continue to object, I take it that they are reflecting on you. I resent being told that the question is not relevant to the Defence Estimates, when you. have said distinctly that it is relevant. The reasonable request of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> is justified by the facts that are brought to the notice of honorable members every day. We continually receive requests for the cashing of war gratuity bonds, and every day we find those requests turned down by the Treasury. The Government do not speak with one voice on this matter. The Treasurer says that the policy of the Government is soandso. The Assistant Minister for Defence says, &#34; That is not the policy ; the policy is quite different.&#34; The Assistant Minister for Defence said that in about 5,000 cases people have cashed war gratuity bonds without permission, and have not been prosecuted. </para>

              <para>- The Minister admits that bonds are being cashed by unauthorized individuals, and that no action is being taken to prosecute them. The Treasurer said that was not the case. Who is right and who is wrong? What is the policy of the Government? Why should I have to write to the Treasurer for permission for one soldier to obtain cash when others are able to cash the bonds, and nothing is done to them? When we raise the question we are met with all sorts of sneers from responsible Ministers. The members of the Labour party pointed out what was likely to happen when the War -Gratuity Bill was being put through. We were assured by members on the Government side that no such state of affairs could arise, yet day after day we find that the things which could not happen are happening, with resultant loss to the men concerned. It is of no use to blink the position. We know that the men are being done out of pounds and pounds because they are not allowed to sell their bonds openly to anybody they choose. I have seen several cases where men have had to purchase Chinese-made furniture at exorbitant rates to enable them to get a few pounds of ready cash. I saw chairs honestly not worth more than 10s. sold for 25s. It is the poorest man that is the hardest hit. </para>

              <para>- I am pointing out to honorable members opposite the inconsistent position they take up. It is very hard to understand why they disagree with your ruling, and try to block discussion. As a matter of fact, they are reflecting upon you, sir, by endeavouring to prove that you were wrong. These cases come before honorable members every day. A lady, who did not know much about the procedure, called to see me to-day. She had a bond worth  &#163;84 belonging to ber son, who was away up-country, and whose wife had died. His mother had arranged for the burial, and was being threatened with eviction if she did not find the necessary money. The son, it appears, had applied for cash, but his request was refused, and he was given a bond which his mother is now endeavouring to cash, hers being a very necessitous case. </para>

              <para>- I admit that in certain circumstances the Treasurer has been pleased to give permission for the cashing of bends; but large numbers of unauthorized persons are also cashing these bonds, and if action were taken against them I am satisfied that ample evidence would be obtained of the underhand work that is going on, by means of which bond-holders are being victimized. These unauthorized men who are cashing bonds are adequately remunerated. They take good care to cover themselves. Make no mistake about that. So much for that side of the question.  iSo  far as the Defence policy is concerned, we find that the predictions of members of the Labour party are being borne out by the Estimates now before us. We stated that It would be impossible to confine military expenditure within reasonable limits, and there is no doubt that a large amount of unnecessary expenditure is being incurred. There can be no justification for an expenditure of &#163;10,000,000 over and above the amount required in pre-war days, nor can there be any justification for the seventy days&#39; continuous military training of our young men. Only a few days ago we had protests against this policy by the Methodist Conference, setting out the injurious effect which a long period of continuous training in military camps would have upon the character of the youths of Australia. We must remember, also, how this continuous training will dislocate industry at a time when the utmost production is required to enable us to carry the burden of  unreproductive  debt, mentioned by the Treasurer as having been laid upon the people of Australia because of our participation in the war. It is impossible to put thousands of our lads into military camps for a period of seventy days without seriously interfering with their ordinary avocations or their education, not to mention the probable effect upon their character at an age when the utmost care should be exercised for their future welfare. The protest by the Methodist Church shows that the stand taken by the Labour party is indorsed in other quarters. I take it that honorable members supporting the Government will not scoff at the considered judgment of a body  of highly trained men whose particular work it . is to give consideration to the education, training, and moral welfare of the youth of Australia. I hope, therefore, that the Government will give careful consideration to their pronouncement upon this subject of continuous training. They cannot say that it is a party matter, because among the gentlemen who comprise the Methodist Conference there are, no doubt, many Government supporters. Evidently they have weighed this matter very carefully, and decided that seventy days&#39; military training in military camps would not be in the best interests of our young men. With that opinion, members of the Labour party agree. </para>

          <para>There is another side to this question. We may train our young men in the particular method of warfare that prevails to-day, but if ever war threatens us again they may have to unlearn all they learned, because the best military authorities- appear to be agreed that- the next war will be fought in the air.  Towards the close of the last war, which we were told was a war to end war, but which, unfortunately^ did not bring about that desired result, Great Britain and America were preparing to attack. Germany from the air on a scale hitherto unheard of. To-day we have the backwash of that movement in the fact that about 130 aeroplanes, together with perhaps &#163;500,000 worth of war equipment, have been sent to the Commonwealth by Great Britain. If we take into consideration the fact that land forces would not play a very great part in the defence of Australia, we should extend our activities in the development of those industries which embrace metal working and the higher mechanical side of engineering. The range of aeroplanes and the amount of damage they could do, as well as their comparatively low cost as compared with other methods of warfare, must not be overlooked. In the event of an engagement the number of lives involved would also be relatively small. Bearing these facts in mind it is in the interests not only of our fighting men, but of the civil population, to pay attention to the engineering side of our industries, and to make provision for aerial warfare, instead of training our Australian youths on military lines that may be practically useless by the time the next war eventuates. The whole of our energies should be directed to paying off our burden of debt, which is seriously retarding the peaceful progress of the country. </para>
          <para>I indorse what has been said by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> regarding the work done by the Commonwealth Saddlery and Harness Factory controlled by the Defence Department. As a farmer, I viewed with admiration the work of the Department exhibited at the Royal Agricultural Show, and it would be a great pity if anything were done to interfere with its operations. It would be preferable to have an extension of its operations so that others apart from returned soldiers could benefit. While we on this side welcome the extension of governmental activities I think it is recognised as hopeless to expect any general support in this direction from members opposite, although they have been forced tosome extent in this direction because the War Service Homes Commission has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds in the purchase of timber areas and mills to protect the people from the actions of certain Trusts and Combines. It should be our endeavour to utilize the energies of our people in the right direction, and protect them by establishing and extending Government Departments where necessary. </para>

              <para>- I cannot agree with a Minister who makes his refusals at the instigation of military officers who are continually keeping their military status before any one who approaches them. They &#39;are well entrenched in the Victoria Barracks, and perhaps if the Assistant Minister visited that establishment and brandished an axe we might get something reasonable out of them. They do not seem amenable to anything but force, and are well bound up with red-tape. The case I have in mind is appalling, and I have been waiting for a decision for four months. It would be better to have a refusal than no decision at all. </para>

The Board sits in the Victoria Barracks, because there is accommodation for it there, and it obtains information from the Defence Department; but it is wholly a branch of the administration of the Treasury. </para>

              <para>- The interjection shows that the Minister does not know the kind of work done at Garden Island. The Garden Island yards are used wholly for repairs; no constructional work is done there. Surely the Minister would not have us believe that if these Estimates are not rushed through at this unreasonable hour of the morning urgent repairs to the boilers or engines of warships will be held up. Such repairs are provided for on emergency out of Contingencies or the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. </para>

              <para>- I fail to follow the reason of the Minister, seeing that the weekly wages of the men employed in the dockyards are now being paid. The future welfare of Australia depends on an adequate naval defence policy. This is an island continent, removed by many thousands of miles from other centres of civilization, and our strongest protection must be found on the water. In the light of the lessons of the war we have to consider what are the best and most economic methods of defence to be adopted; and one of the greatest is that it is almost impossible for a purely naval attack to be successful against decently equipped land forces. This was clearly demonstrated in attacks made by the Allied Fleets on various enemy ports. This nonsuccess was due, first, to mine fields, and then to land fortifications; and a striking illustration was afforded at the Dardanelles. Some of the greatest naval engines of war the world had ever seen were then pitted against almost puny land defences ; but the guns on shore were able to command the range of the hostile vessels, and, with the aid of mine fields  i  and torpedoes, the efforts to force a passage were rendered unavailing. With all these facts before us, it is well that the Estimates for the Navy should be most carefully considered. It is not fitting that &#34;we should rush through proposed expenditure totalling over  &#163;2,000,000,  showing an increase of quite  &#163;750,000  as compared with what we were asked to vote last year. Is it not reasonable for us to endeavour to ascertain in what way this extra amount is being used? Is it being spent in a sane and economical way? The people of Australia, who have to find the money, ought to be assured that they receive an adequate return. Can the Minister tell us, for instance, what steps are being taken to provide for proper submarine defence, or what provision is being made for mining the various vulnerable points around our coast? Surely the Government, have some settled policy. </para>

              <para>- Did the Minister give details as to where the mine fields are to be placed? Of course he did not. Is the Department providing for a proper system of mining on the coasts of the  northern portions of Australia, from Queensland right round to the north-west of Western Australia? Are all arrangements made so that when the time comes the Government can, without hesitation, go ahead on a well-defined policy of mine defence? I am not so foolish as to ask for details as to the actual spots where it is proposed to lay mine fields; but the Minister should be prepared to give honorable members all reasonable information upon which to work. He should furnish assurances that the whole of these matters have been taken into consideration ; that the Naval authorities are ready with their plans, that their mines are ready, and that necessary provisionhas been made by which to have the mines transported without delay to the spots where they are to be employed. We hope the time will never arrive when their use for the defence of Australia will become necessary. Meanwhile, however, let us not be unprepared. </para>

          <para>Aerial defence is another highly important factor. The value of aeroplanes i? not merely in attacking an enemy; they are the eyes of our Defence Forces, by land, sea, and air. It would be of comparatively little use, however, if we had our aerial scouts watchfully guarding Australia, but had inadequate means of communication. What is the use of aerial eyes if there is no means of corn,municating those &#39; things which the eyes have seen? Wireless stations should be&#39; installed throughout Australia and all round our coast-line. </para>

          <para>With respect to the Navy Estimates, I do not ask for a detailed statement of policy, but would like to be assured that the proposals are adequate for our safety, in the opinion, not merely of the Australian Government, but of the British expert advisers who investigated the provisions for the defence of Australia. It is bad economy to try to cut down one&#39;s insurances; and our Defence Estimates, military and naval, are Australia&#39;s insurance. The provisions set out in the Estimates are considerably below the suggestions furnished by Viscount Jellicoe. I would like to be assured that the Government are indulging in no ill-timed parsimony. </para>
          <para>With respect to civil aviation, an amount of &#163;100,000 has been set aside for its encouragement. I hold that we should do still more. We have in Australia a country peculiarly fitted for, and requiring, air communications. Many of our aerial pilots who were trained during the war are now dropping out of flying activities, because no inducements are offered them to remain. Numbers are getting married, and are being dissuaded by their wives from having anything more to do with aviation. It is all-important that Australia should have a well-developed system of aerial communication. More should be done to encourage enterprising firms and individual promoters who are initiating aviation enterprises in different parts of the Commonwealth. Is the provision of landing places to become a matter of State or Federal jurisdiction? I would like an assurance that expedition will be used to obtain finality in regard to the question of landing places. If this question is to be remitted to the State Departments, and they are going to delay us in the way that they have delayed us in regard to repatriation matters, it will be a long time before we secure a satisfactory solution of the problem with which those who have already purchased aeroplanes for their own private use, are at present faced. But if steps are taken to secure landing places at the earliest possible moment, a great many more private individuals will purchase aeroplanes in the immediate future, some of which will doubtless be utilized in connexion with our mail services. </para>

            <para>. - I have pleasure in assuring the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that we have in our Navy at the present time a most effective means of defence. The very best use is being made of our ships at this juncture. We are of opinion that it would not be advisable, under present circumstances, to launch out upon any considerable expenditure, seeing that an Imperial Conference will take place next year, at which the whole question of the defence of the Empire will doubtless be discussed. It has been alleged by some honorable members that the flagship <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> has been scrapped. As a matter of fact, that is not so. We have reducedthe <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the flagship to a. nucleus crew consisting of 400 of the very best men. But within a very brief period that vessel could be made a most effective fighting ship for defence purposes. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> stated this evening that our ships are inadequate for the defence of Australia.  His  statement is not correct. The <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne, Sydney,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> all belong to the British <inline font-style="italic">Birmingham</inline> class of cruiser, whilst the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> is an improvement upon that class. The <inline font-style="italic">Dublin</inline> is another vessel of the same type. She is in the Mediterranean&#39; in full commission to-day; while the <inline font-style="italic">Lowestoft</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Birmingham</inline> are upon the African station. In Victorian waters we have four effective submarines, and two others in another place. We have been fortunate enough to secure a very fair submarine base at a small cost to the Commonwealth. The Geelong people have treated us remarkably well. They have given us a big area of land fronting Corio Bay, and also a house in which to accommodate the crews of the vessels which are there at the present time. Four ships are nightly lying in CorioBay, and during the day theyengage in exercises in Port Phillip. They are there with the parent ship <inline font-style="italic">Platypus,</inline> and are doing most effective work. There are 13 fathoms of water in Port Phillip Bay, so that the ships are  able to engage in naval exercises with, the utmost freedom. I am assured by an expert that there are only two ports in Australia where such exercises can be carried out - on&#169; of which is Hobart, which,  I  regret to say, is too far from the mainland to render its selection as a submarine base advisable. </para>

The British Government, however, are most anxious to induce him to return to Britain, because of his very great abilities. He is. one of the most able men in the service of the Empire. In reference to aviation, I would point out that that matter does not come -under the control of my Department. But a Board is at present being formed, and the whole question of aviation is being thoroughly inquired into. Meetings have been held between representatives of the Army and the Navy, and I feel sure that the day is not far distant when we shall have a very fine aviation corps upon the coast of Australia. </para>

            <para>. - The statement of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Laird Smith)</inline> has relieved me of one of the great difficulties that I have experienced in connexion with this naval vote. He has intimated that it is intended to regard our present Navy merely as something which should be continued until the Imperial Conference has been held, at which all these matters will be dealt with.&#39; That is a very proper course to follow, because, with a coast-line such as we possess, it is absolutely impossible for Australia, with its 5,000,000 inhabitants, and in the shattered condition of its finances, to attempt to provide an adequate Navy for our defence. With all due respect to what the Minister has stated, I think that our Navy as a fighting force- is a negligible quantity. The people of the Commonwealth should not be permitted to think that we have an adequate Navy in the ordinary sense of the term. But, if we maintain it until the Imperial Conference has been held, and if, in the meantime, we concentrate our energies upon what must be our chief defence in the future, namely, aeroplanes and submarines, we shall be acting wisely. Presumably, some arrangement will have to be made with the rest of the Empire to secure for us a fighting force such as will be needed to meet our naval requirements. How many of our vessels would it take to stop the <inline font-style="italic">Renown?</inline> Why, the whole of them would be blown out of the water before they could get sufficiently close to brush the paint off the sides of that vessel. Upon the other hand, the <inline font-style="italic">Renown</inline> would be just as inefficient if she. were required to face some of the super-dreadnoughts which have been recently built. Of all the Departments which figure, upon these Estimates,, that of the Navy will afford the least satisfaction to the people of Australia. This is not the result of administrative ineptitude, but merely because we have not the punch that would be requisite if we were called upon to defend Australia upon the seas.&#39; It is only the explanation of the Minister, to the effect that the whole matter of the defence of the Empire will be considered at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, which induces me to accept these Estimates. One honorable member, in dealing with the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">League of Nations, said that the league upon which he built his faith was that between Great Britain and the rest of her Dominions. I think that that is the league to which the people of the Empire must look for their protection. In my judgment, it is a league which is big enough and strong enough for the defence of Australia as it is for the rest of the Empire. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It would have been very helpful to honorable members if the Minister had made a brief opening statement in explanation of the Estimates of his Department. We should then have been able to grasp where increases or decreases have taken place. I join with the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> in protesting against the discussion of important Estimates at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. I do not think that it is a proper thing. It is not a proper thing that the Committee should sit all night over the discussion of matters of such importance to the welfare of the general community. The Government should have been satisfied with the progress made after 11 o&#39;clock at night. I was also given to understand that an arrangement was actually made that an adjournment should take place. The Government have not carried that out, and we find ourselves discussing this important matter at an early hour of the morning when proper attention cannot be given to it. I join with the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> in protesting against it, and hope we shall have no repetition of sittings of this sort, which arise out of a desire on the part of the Government to &#34; shove &#34; business through- at times when they can do so without much discussion. Recently, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(.Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> moved the &#34;gag&#34; as soon as an awkward question arose. </para>

The Treasurer seemed to feel aggrieved that I should have underestimated his ability. I think I have formed a very fair estimate of his ability.

              <para>- We have never been actually allowed to come to close quarters with it, or to have a vote taken. All that was done to-night was to &#34;gag&#34; the discussion. If that is the type of ability that the Treasurer prides himself on, he is welcome to the reputation. All I desire is that the public shall know that the Treasurer particularly excels in burking discussion, or in allowing it only at 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, when there is not the same publicity for what goes on. So far as I am concerned, the same thing can take place on this vote. The Government have the numbers to &#34;gag&#34; every item. If they want to &#34;gag&#34; them all through, they are welcome to do so, so long as the public are made aware of the tactics adopted. I do not propose, in view of what I know the tactics of the Government to be in this matter, to move a specific reduction of the vote, although I think it might very properly be done, to enable an adequate discussion to take place upon the subjects that have been mentioned by honorable members who preceded me. </para>

I do not suggest it, but that is a possible explanation.

I should have liked to hear something about the quality of the ships that were presented to us. &#39;Canada refused those that were offered to her. I presume they were refused, not through any feeling of disloyalty to the Motherland, but because Canada did not think they were a good business proposition. I suppose no one in this Committee will suggest that the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada refused them because of any disloyalty, but I have no doubt that if it had been urged here we should have been charged with disloyalty, and with trying to break up the British Empire. We could, with advantage, hear something now about the quality and character of the ships that were given to Australia. Were they of the same character and type as those refused by Canada? This would be a matter of great interest to the public of Australia. </para>

              <para>- It is the purport of what the honorable member said. The only reason why Canada did not take the ships was that she did not wish to inaugurate a new naval policy until the whole question had been discussed at the Conference to be called early next year - only that, and nothing more. Canada, therefore, merely postponed the acceptance of the gift and the institution of a navy of her own on the lines laid down by Lord Jellicoe, until the whole matter could be discussed at the Imperial Conference to be called early in the year. </para>

          <para>As to the quality of the ships that we have accepted, that were given to us generously by the British Government, and that amount in value to about &#163;3,500,000, they are the very latest of their type, and amongst the last to be constructed in the light of the experience of the war. The submarines are the latest thing in that class of warfare. The honorable member may, therefore, make up his mind that there is nothing wrong with the ships. Everything is right with them. They are the very latest expression of naval efficeincy and of naval warfare. I hope that assurance will calm the honorable member&#39;sperturbation. </para>

              <para>- Yes, two of them are there as casualties of war. The very reason why we accepted the new boats from the Britsh Government was because we felt that we should be doing an excellent thing for Australia in accepting vessels which had just been built according to the very latest type of Admiralty construction, to take the place of our own, which were already getting a  little old. They -were not obsolete or useless, by any means. They were still good fighting material, but they were not the latest expression of naval efficiency. The idea of accepting the latest type  of boat to take the place of those others, and putting the others into reserve, struck me as being a very excellent bargain. I do not know what else the honorable member wants to know. </para>

            <para>. - I also protest against these important matters being decided at halfpast 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, although the tone of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is different now from what it was a couple of hours ago. If he had only been in that frame of mind then, and given honorable members the information they desired, he would probably have got his Estimates through much more easily than is likely to be the case now. The objection to passing votes amounting  to millions of pounds without adequate discussion applies equally to the Navy Department as to the Defence Department. No doubt, from the &#60; Government&#39;s point of view, the less the discussion the easier it is for them; but the great body of the people, who have to pay the money, will be quite right in wanting to know where it goes, and in asking members what they were doing when the Estimates were being passed that they did not keep their eye on them, and endeavoured to obtain the necessary information which afterwards will be demanded of every member by some of his constituents, if not in one form at least in another. Members are bound to be asked to explain the increase in the expenditure required to run the Commonwealth. Every honorable member knows /he campaign of misrepresentation that goes on regarding the Commonwealth on the part of partisan political journals, particularly one printed in this State, which has at all times misrepresented the position of the Commonwealth, and is doing a great deal to retard Australian nationalism by the cold water it throws on the amount of expenditure which the people of Australia are called on to provide to run the Commonwealth. The expenditure, of course, must go up with the growth of the Commonwealth Departments. Every power which the Commonwealth Parliament obtains from the States must mean an increase in the cost of the Commonwealth Government. With the socializing of the community, more State Departments must be created, and consequently increased expenditure incurred. The Navy Department&#39;s expenditure this year shows an increase of about 30 per cent., notwithstanding that the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> has a reduced complement of about 400 men. The Minister says that the vessel could be  recommissioned  in a few hours; but I doubt whether we could expect the same efficiency with only a nucleus crew. Danger to Australia may, I think, be expected only from the north - from Japan; and the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> would be obsolete in any conflict with the later type of ships now being constructed in Japan. The same applies to our submarines. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that the submarines now in Australia represent the very last word in efficiency. They are nothing of the kind. The <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> type of submarine now being constructed in Great Britain - and the same policy must be carried out in every other naval nation - carries 10 and 12-in. guns; so the submarines now in Australian waters would not last twenty-four hours. </para>

              <para>- No. It means that expenditure is being incurred on obsolete vessels. The Minister&#39;s statement that it would not be advisable to quarter submarines at Hobart because they might possibly get bottled up there indicates, to my mind, that our submarines are not the last word in naval construction, as the Minister suggests. We have heard rumours that some of them are obsolete. I merely give this statement as it was given to me, and I feel sure that the Minister for the Navy will ascertain whether it is true or not. </para>

It would be far better to have one ship of the very latest type - as we found when war was declared - than to have five or six obsolete vessels. </para>

              <para>- We might just as well do that. Suppose, for instance, that war broke out between Great Britain and Japan. What would be the use of the obsolete scrap-iron, in the way of fighting ships, that are now in Australian waters ? Our submarines would be outranged in speed and power. Our destroyers would not be fast enough, nor would they be armed heavily enough. The <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> would be blown &#39;to atoms before she could get within range of Japan&#39;s latest ships.

              <para>- Even if, as the honorable member for Franklin suggests, there should be a conflict between Great Britain and America, all that I am saying would hold good, because if the American naval policy is to be carried out, within two years the United States will have the most powerful navy in the world, unless, in the meantime, Great Britain alters her naval policy so as to maintain her predominant position. It would be idle, therefore, to contend that the expenditure on our Naval policy is justified and in the best interests of Australia. </para>

          <para>There is an item of &#163;2,000 for the aerial wing of the Naval Forces, and, as the allowance for an adviser will absorb &#163;1,000 for the ensuing twelve months, there is only &#163;1,000 for other expenditure. This appears to be altogether inadequate. We have been informed, on very reliable authority, that recently a fleet of aeroplanes successfully launched torpedoes on a British fleet in Portsmouth Harbor, registering six hitsout of seven torpedoes fired under actual war conditions. </para>

              <para>- I am citing the incident in order that the Minister for the Navy may make inquiries as to whether the report is correct or not. If it is correct it shows that an aeroplane costing &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000, with only one man on board, could torpedo and send to the bottom of the sea a battle-ship costing &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5,000,000, with a complement of 1,200 or 1,300 men, thus indicating the need for a careful review of all proposed expenditure on war-ships that are obsolete or likely to become obsolete. </para>

              <para>- I also wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the matter of wireless workshops, where thereis a fine field for training our young men in the higher branches of mechanical engineering, which will always be of use in time of war. The same could be said of our naval dockyards and naval workshops. Under the present policy of the Government, the dockyards which are available are quite inadequate to accommodate vessels of any size that may come to the Commonwealth to assist in protecting us. If we intend, as some honorable members suggest, to rely upon the British Navy, vessels of the <inline font-style="italic">Hood</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Renown</inline> class could not be berthed in our docks. In time of war it is only natural to suppose that some of the fighting units would become disabled, and, if we had no docks available in which to effect repairs, they would be taken&#39; out of commission, merely because there has been a lack of foresight on the part of the responsible authorities. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Provision is also made for the expenditure of &#163;500 for the mine-sweeping section; and, if we intend to rely upon mines to any extent, that amount is. absolutely inadequate. The value of mines and mine-sweepers is generally recognised as of vital importance in the defence of any country, and it was the most effective means of defence that Germany adopted for keeping the vessels of the BritishFleet from her main naval bases. The German minefields extended for many miles, and played a big part in the battle of Jutland. We understand that there was a conflict of opinion between the Commanders as to whether they should have risked the minefields or called off the chase when they did. That is sufficient to. show that British Naval authorities recognise the value of. mines in matters of naval defence; and here, as in the case of aeroplanes, the expenditure of a few hundred pounds may be the means of disabling a vessel costing many millions. In the event of a naval attack being made on Australia, mines would prove of great value, and I would like the Minister for the Navy to explain why such a small sum has been provided in this connexion. </para>
          <para>There is also an amount of &#163;1,700 for theRoyal Australian Naval Reserve, and when we consider the present purchasing power of money, it is easy to realize that such an expenditure would not provide anything like an adequate amount for the maintenance of a Naval Reserve that would be of any use in time of war. - </para>
          <para>The expense of medical services is to be met by the expenditure of &#163;16,000, and the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> was very critical . in his remarks concerning medical services. The honorable member fully understands this important branch, and I feel sure that his caustic remarks would not have been made unless he had good grounds for submitting them. </para>
          <para>Defective judgment has been shown in the past in connexion with the establishment of wireless stations. The wireless scandal was fully debated in Parliament some time ago, and to-day there is a station, installed with modern appliances,  idle simply because it is in close proximity to another important station. I would like to know why the Minister for the Navy does not seriously consider the transfer of this plant to some other portion of the coast where it could be profitably utilized, instead of allowing it to remain as a monument to the incompetence of a former Administration. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but in time of war it is controlled by the Department of the Navy, and the work of the different stations should always be laid before the Minister for the Navy. It would be useless to allow the PostmasterGeneral to carry on with obsolete installations, as they would be practically useless in the event of war. I believe that in the future our main lines of defence will be by submarines, aeroplanes, and wireless telegraphy. The submarines could be used for protecting the Australian coast, the aeroplanes for scouting and for launching aerial torpedoes against hostile troopships, and wireless plants for communicating quickly from one end of Australia to the other. I regret to see that no provision has been made for any expenditure in connexion with wireless telephony; and, as this has now passed the experimental stage, it is time the Government gave it their serious attention. </para>

              <para>- If it comes to that, I entered the train at Sydney at 25 minutes past 7 on Monday night, and travelled all night. This is my second night on end. I protest, against important business being pushed through rapidly in the early hours of the morning without opportunity being given for the proper consideration of details: but I cannot do. more than protest, since the business &#34; the Committee is in the hands of the Government. If honorable members generally protested determinedly, no doubt the Government would yield to their wishes. If the members of the Country party desire to assert themselves, they can insist on having the Estimates discussed at a more seasonable hour; but it is not for me to tell any member what he should do, though, of course, the public will know later what attitude each man took in regard to this matter. </para>

            <para>. - I would have preferred a better opportunity to address myself to these Estimates,&#34; because I desire to speak about the subsidy to the States for the treatment of venereal diseases, and to discuss what has been taking place during the past twelve months in connexion with this matter. Recently the British Medical Association met in Queensland, and arrived at certain conclusions. They passed resolutions of an extremely constructive character, drafting what is practically an Australian health programme. In it the way in which several diseases should be dealt with is set out clearly. I have learned from the newspapers that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston,</inline> our Chief Quarantine Officer, made a report to the Government, and I have been waiting patiently to hear that the report had been received, and would be laid on the table. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to have that information. The public health is a subject that has interested me for years, and long before I entered this Parliament. No matter what legislation may be passed for social and industrial improvement, the community, unless the public health is good, cannot fully enjoy its benefits. Ours is far from being a healthy community, and I have on two previous occasions dealt with one phase of our ill-health, when speaking of the treatment of venereal diseases. Practically all the States have passed legislation for the compulsory notification of venereal disease and the compulsory treatment of patients suffering from it, and the sum of &#163;16,200 is set down in these Estimates for a subsidy in aid of what is being done. I think, however, that until the Commonwealth has taken over the whole of the hospitals in Australia, and the general control of medicine, the best interests of the nation will not be properly conserved. Health is a national matter, not a State matter. </para>

              <para>- I am in favour of the nationalization of medicine. The effect of venereal diseases on the Commonwealth purse is very marked - we having to find many hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum to provide pensions for persons suffering from it. Something like 22 per cent. of our blind owe their condition to venereal diseases, chiefly to gonorrhoea, and 25 per cent. of the inmates of lunatic asylums owe their condition to venereal diseases. Then, according to an unquestioned formula of  eminent  syphilologists,  based on the percentages of deaths from certain diseases, every year 7,000 persons in Australia owe their death to some form of venereal disease. Such a mortality in a population of about 5,250,000 proves the need of Commonwealth attention to the treatment of these diseases. With the exception of white plague, venereal diseases have the highest mortality of any that afflicts our people. Its effects may be slow, but they are inevitable. The proposed subsidy to the States is not sufficient, and I hope that a considerably greater sum . will be provided. The legislation of the six States is, to some extent, uniform, but only to an extent laid down by the Commonwealth, and the co-ordination is only that which the respective Health Departments of the States will enter into with the Commonwealth. There has been great difficulty in getting the States to pass generally uniform legislation on this subject. We1 must go further than that. The Commonwealth has a duty to perform to the public, because of the great amount of money which the ravages of venereal diseases compel it to spend, and because of the enormous mortality which is attributable to .those diseases. The methods of treating venereal diseases and.. other diseases, which know not State boundaries, must be investigated, and for that investigation money is needed. For years I have advocated the establishment of a. central laboratory. While the research work of private scientists is great and valuable, it is essentially the duty of the States, or of the Commonwealth - I think of the Commonwealth - to support the research. The British Medical Association has definitely and without qualification stated that if the Commonwealth would follow its suggestions, and allow it to give effect to its ideas, it would rid Australia of the hook-worm within four years. The average medical man and the average medical congress are very conservative, and not likely to make statements which are. not without firm and solid foundation. </para>

              <para>- Of course, I have not seen the official reports, which will not be ready for probably five or six months, and I have had to depend on newspaper reports, which, apparently, convey a wrong impression. But the Medical Congress, it would seem, is not satisfied that the campaign is being adequately covered by the present arrangements; and, personally, I believe there should be some Committee or Commission - I am not particular what form the body takes - consisting of, say, the Chief Quarantine Officer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Cumpston),</inline> the Chief Medical Officer of each State, and, perhaps, one or two others. It is necessary there should be co-ordination of the Health Departments of the States in order that the highest possible efficiency should be reached. The Commonwealth, with its established laboratories, should be the main channel for the interchange of ideas, and for the distribution, ultimately, of all the requirements of the medical services throughout the country. That could be, and should be, done, and i3 being done so far as vaccines are concerned. The serums turned out by the Commonwealth to-day are all that can be desired from a medical point of view; so much so that their importation has practically ceased. We were forced by war conditions to take up this matter, and, as I say, the materia&#93; turned out in the Commonwealth laboratories meets with the approbation of the medical fraternity generally. I have no doubt that the manufacture of chemicals and other hospital requirements could also be very well provided by the Commonwealth ; it is simply a question of staff and the organizing of the necessary laboratories and factories. But at present the system is to have a quarantine officer with no power, and, practically, no mission; and the co-ordination is merely of a friendly character. It seems to me extraordinary &#39; that health administration should be mixed up with Customs administration. I have no desire, however, to see a Health Ministry created at this particular stage, but I certainly think that the Commonwealth should lay down guiding principles with a view to that co-ordination which is so emphatically necessary. Such coordination would prove a groat saving to the Commonwealth in pensions and in mortality, providing the right man is put in charge of the work. So far as I can see, there are plenty of men whose services could be obtained; and I am satisfied that,&#39;, with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> as  chairman  of any body created, or as a member of the body, everything possible will be done to conserve the health of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask one or two questions regarding certain resolutions carried at the recent Australian Medical Congress at Brisbane. One resolution dealt with&#39; the establishment of country laboratories at various large towns, to be supported and subsidized by the Commonwealth, thus enabling practically country bacteriological clinics .to be established, which would lead to the decentralization  of the process of preparing autogenous  vaccines and bacteriological diagnosis to be brought about. That resolution was carried by the Public Health and Pathological Sections, and&#39; unanimously recommended by the Congress. I should like to get from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> some idea as to whether any progress has been made in .the establishment of country laboratories ; and, if so, when we may expect to see the first of them in operation. There has been great difficulty, and, I venture to say, considerable loss of life in the past, owing to the fact that the only places in which proper bacteriological tests can be made are in the capital cities. In. remote country districts of Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, particularly,&#39; diagnosis of the diphtheria and various growths are frequently not possible owing to the fact that exact information may be available only at places many days distant in point of time. Under the circumstances, although cases are urgent, proper, treatment cannot be applied. That was the real reason that caused the Congress to pass the resolution; and, if immediate effect is not given to it, we may lose the opportunity of securing the services of a great number of men who have had special training during their war service in special hospitals abroad. &#39; These men may settle in various localities, and may not, in time to come, be available for service with the Commonwealth Health Department. I commend this matter to the notice of the Minister, and trust that some action will be taken shortly. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Then I should like some information regarding the Bureau of .Science and Industry. When may we expect some appointments to be made in connexion with the Institute ? I do not think that I ever travel from Sydney to Melbourne without having inquiries made of me when such appointments are likely. Many men, especially those associated with agriculture and technology, are of opinion that this Bureau represents probably the most important legislation this year; and they are anxious to see the Institute placed on a good footing. </para>

Distinguished visitors to Australia are appalled at the lack of co-ordination amongst the various State Governments in regard to many developments, such as power, forestry, and in the tabulation of the resources of the country; and I think that very little is likely to be done until we have a Bureau of Science and Industry in being. </para>

              <para>- No doubt, there should be Commonwealth action, and effective action, in regard to venereal disease. The failure to carry out an effective .venereal disease campaign is responsible for a very large tax, direct, in the way of pensions and so forth, and indirect in the disability that results from the spread of the disease throughout the community. As to preventive medicine, the Commonwealth is the proper body to deal with the whole matter; but I think it will be a good many years before we reach the stage at which nationalization of therapeutic medicine can be established. </para>

            <para>. - In May last, I asked certain questions regarding resignations from the Public Service, and was furnished with the information that, for the financial year 1917-1S there were 658 resignations; that in 1918-19, there were 936 resignations; and that for nine months of 1919-20 there were 1,037 resignations. Those figures suggest that there must be something wrong with the Service. Tt would appear, not only that the Service, itself is in such a state that its employees cannot get sufficient wages on which to live in. comfort, but that they are compelled to seek for better conditions outside. The facts are a very grave reflection upon the Public Service, and constitute a serious loss to the Commonwealth. The officials who have resigned have received, in the main, from five to twenty years&#39; training, and those who have left the Postal Service to gain higher remuneration privately must have left gaps which have been somewhat serious to the community. I have been waiting for some time to hear a pronouncement by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> concerning his intentions in this regard. After securing the information concerning the resignations which I have&#39; just given, I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> what was the intention of the Government in the matter of remedying this extraordinary exodus. The right honorable gentleman answered that it was his intention to introduce an amendment of the Public Service Act. He hoped that the whole position in regard to salaries would be gone into, and that Parliament would decide what was to be done. That answer was given in May last. Nothing has yet been done. The Prime Minister said - </para>

During the visit to New South Wales of the present King and Queen - then the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York - circumstances arose Which compelled me to relieve at one time and do the work of the postmaster, the assistant, and telegraph operator for a fortnight (though classed as junior letter-carrier on 30s. per week). I had, in order to get through the work, to attend at the office from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily (Sundays too); carried out all without mishap or complaint from public or Department. </para>

Honorable members have been kept here against their wishes until close upon 4 a.m. If the Government had agreed to adjourn at about 11 o&#39;clock last night, as was generally desired, there would have been sense in the procedure.

              <para>- I wish honorable members would not threaten me. Although the hour is late it is  a  common practice for the House of Commonsto adjourn at this time; indeed, most, of the Estimates there are put through at such an hour. a3 we wish to finish the business outstanding after a very longsession, I think that the course which has been taken to-night is not an unreasonable one. I hope that honorable members will come prepared to finish the consideration of the Estimate* to-day. </para>
