                    <para>.- The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> on Friday last, intimated that the Government could not see their way to accept my amendment. I still take the view that the words which I propose to omit would give to the Commission too wide a power, and I shall vote against their retention. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> that it would be dangerous to retain these words in sub-clause 1. Our object at the present time, when we hear on every hand a cry for economy, should be to prevent the creation of new Departments. From small beginnings a Department quickly develops into one of great magnitude. It begins with an office, a table, and a chair, and a departmental head having been appointed, he must have a messenger to announce callers, and to ascertain whether he is in a suitable frame of mind to receive them. The departmental head cannot take off his own coat and hat ; he must have some one to do that work for him, and he must have a clerk, a lady typist, and other officers. A new Department having been created, it becomes necessary, in order to justify its upkeep, to transfer to it duties previously performed, perhaps quite satisfactorily, by other Departments. The work of the Commission should not extend over many years. For instance, vocational training will not occupy its attention for more than a couple of years, and, although it is proposed to transfer the administration of war pensions to the Department of Repatriation, I think such a transfer is unwarranted, and should be opposed by the Committee. If the subclause were allowed to stand as it is, it would be possible to transfer to the Department almost any duty. It would even be possible for the Minister to take upon himself the construction of a railway line. I am opposed to the creation of a large Department; expenditure saved is revenue gained, and the Minister should agree to give the Departments only the ordinary opportunities of making regulations instead of conferring upon them this unlimited power. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause gives certain rights of action to the Commission in respect of matters over which the Government previously had control. The effect of the amendment is to so widen the operation of the clause as to affect all transactions from the commencement of repatriation by the State War Councils and other organizations. I see the necessity for the Commission being able to follow goods, advances, and so forth in its own Department, but I do not wish it to have power to deal with what may have been done in a voluntary way before the Commonwealth Government took a hand. </para>

                        <para>- I can see necessities for power  so  far as concerns operations and money granted under Acts passed by this Parliament, but I do not wish to see power on the part of the Commission to go right back to the inception of repatriation on a voluntary basis, when there was no clear definition of what was a gift and what  was a  loan. For instance, in the case of widows, the State  War Councils  made absolute gifts of money for the purpose of erecting homes, and I am apprehensive that these gifts may be treated as advances. </para>

The Boards' duties would be as efficiently carried out by one man as by three. In fact, the work probably would be more speedily attended to. The large annual expenditure in connexion with old-age pensions requires the supervision of only one Deputy Commissioner in each State; and hitherto the duties surrounding the administration of Repatriation have been adequately carried out by one Deputy Comptroller in each State, assisted by an honorary committee which, in some instances, has been a committee of delay. I do not see the force of appointing eighteen highly-paid officials for the whole of Australia, whose work could be more efficiently done by half-a-dozen. </para>

                        <para>- In the larger States the whole of the time of the Board, probably, will be occupied; but in the smaller States such may not be the case. That is why the Bill does not provide for the payment of fixed salaries. It may only be necessary to make payments of fees, on the basis of so much per sitting. </para>

One Deputy Commissioner in each State has been carrying out the work attached to the payment of old-age pensions in every instance faithfully and satisfactorily. I fear that the appointment of  a  Board of three in each of the six States will merely establish the nucleus of  a  considerable array  of  officers entrenched within  a  'big Department. The more closely one examines this measure the more is one impressed with the danger of creating  a  source of heavy and permanent departmental expenditure.  The foundation work of repatriation has been already completed. It seems absurd, , therefore, that a great Department of State should now be reared. </para>

                        <para>- If the work has been done in an honorary capacity hitherto we have all the more reason for avoiding the creation of unnecessary expenditure now. We ought to seriously consider whether it is essential to have in each State a Board of three. There will be a number of officers under the Central Commission, and on top of this 'staff each State Board will have its subordinates, so that we may be creating an endless number of officials. In my opinion, one man can deal with requests from returned soldiers more expeditiously and more fairly. than can two or three. At the present time the war pensions are under review. Thousands of cases are dealt with each week. If two men, sitting on opposite sides of a table, were dealing with them, and discussing whether this man should receive so and ' so, or his dependants such and such, they would certainly occupy a great deal more time in reaching finality than would one man. I think one. Commissioner in each State will be quite sufficient. My great desire is to avoid the serious delays that will occur- if there are three members on each' State Board. A gentleman who is dealing with pensions in one of the States, one of our finest officers, and one who knows all the ramifications of these soldiers' cases, and how long it takes to deal with them, is emphatically of opinion that the soldiers will have to wait an unduly long time for the redress of their grievances if there is more than one man dealing with them. If the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> will move an amendment to reduce the number of members of State Boards I shall support him. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that the Government should also he .represented; but what is to prevent them from appointing a returned soldier in each State as 'Commissioner or  Deputy  Comptroller? I shall be only too pleased to hear further arguments from the Minister, but it seems to me that if we pass the clause as it stands, we are creating superfluous billets for two men in each State, when all experience goes to show that, in the matter of carrying out instructions given by a Minister or a Central Commission, one man is more fully responsible, and can do the work better, than three men. I seriously ask the Minister to postpone the clause for the time being, and give it further, consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not at all satisfied with the reasons given by the Minister for having three members on each Board. In fact, the only reason he has advanced is the desirability .of having a returned soldier on each Board. At the same time, he claims that the Government should have representation. Surely that is not sufficient reason for creating a number of Commissions, each consisting of three men, where one man would be sufficient to do the work required to be done? The Government will have all the representation they desire if they appoint a returned soldier as Commissioner in each State. There are sufficient returned men who could do the work well and satisfactorily, not only for their fellows, but also for the Government. I shall support any amendment to reduce the number of members of State Boards to one. If the appointment of three men would expedite the work of repatriation, I would he prepared to support the clause as it stands; but I am not at all satisfied that three men will do the work any better than one could do it. Again, if the members of these bodies were to be given the administration of the War Service Homes Act, or the control of land settlement, I would willingly support the proposal to have three Commissioners; but, in my opinion, the limited amount of work they will have to undertake is not sufficient to warrant the appointment of seven Commissions to administer repatriation in Australia. In Tasmania the main difficulty lies in the fact that it sometimes takes months for a returned soldier to get a reply to a communication addressed to the Repatriation Department. Sometimes no reply is forthcoming. We have looked for the appointment of a Commission that would co-ordinate the work, render it more efficient, and deal with it more expeditiously than has been possible under the existing method. I regret that the Boards will not have full control of land settlement, though I recognise that the difficulty in giving them that control has been created by the indisposition of the State authorities to surrender their control. I am <inline font-style="italic">sorry,</inline> too, that the Boards will not have the . supervision of the war service homes scheme. But if their powers are to be limited, I think it will be sufficient to appoint one officer for each State, and I shall support an amendment to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- I think that Boards of three are provided for because of the opinion that there should be a returned soldier on each of these Boards. Undoubtedly, the Minister will in any case control the Commission, and the Commission will lay down lines of policy which will apply to all the States. It is not to be supposed that the State Boards will each lay down a special policy for its own State. We could not, for example, have one set of conditions applying to New South Wales and another to Victoria. This being so, there is no reason why the State officials should be very highly paid men. Whoever may be appointed, they will not be better than those who now administer the Pensions Department, and they will not have to deal with cases any more difficult than those which are submitted to the Pensions Department. </para>

                        <para>- Under the State Boards are the Local Committees, which have wished for powers which have not been granted to them. Now we are starting afresh with what will be a new Department. The Minister will be bound to direct the policy of that Department, and it will be for the three Commissioners to give effect to his policy. But the same lines must be followed in each State. I am sure that we do not need State Boards of three members each merely to give opportunity for the appointment of returned soldiers. There are many returned soldiers in the Public Service who could do the work. I appeal to the Ministry not to say bluntly that they will not accept any modification of the proposal, and I suggest that the matter should be withdrawn for the present, so that it may be reconsidered. It is too much to have a Commission and six Boards, consisting in all of twenty-one persons, administering this Act. The expenditure which this arrangement would impose upon the country is unwarrantable- </para>

                    <para>. - I support the Government in this matter. It is easily conceivable that the continuation of local administration will secure greater efficiency and give greater satisfaction than anything else. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has recently had for his motto "Decentralization with economy," but in this matter he seems to be advocating centralization and the disregard of economy. I ask honorable members to remember the excellent work that has been done by the Repatriation Committees in each State, where the greatest brains have been at the service of the Government, and the greatest devotion to duty has been shown. It is undoubtedly better that administration should be as far as possible in the hands of local bodies in each State, administering the Act subject to the Central Commission. I am not prepared to hand over the interests of returned soldiers and others entirely to the Central Commission, when they can be better looked after by local bodies. In the long run the system provided for in the Bill will prove economical. It is not proposed to set up a salaried Board in each of the six States. The honorary work done in the past has been very efficient, business men having given an enormous amount of time to it, for which the community should be grateful to them. In the future there will not be so much to do ; but the work ought to be paid for.  I  ask the Minister whether those who do it cannot be paid much as directors are paid, amounts being set down for the year which may not be exceeded. </para>

At present there is a Central, Commission consisting of seven members, and State Boards, each having seven members, and then there are the Local Committees, the intention being to secure the framing of uniform regulations by the Central administration, and to leave it to local bodies to administer the law according to the needs of the case. That organization has done excellent work. The State bodies have not been associated with the administration, which has been left entirely to the Minister and his officers. The Minister, however, now sees the need for reorganization, and it is proposed to create a Central Commission, which will be charged with the administration of the Act. It will consist of three persons, and will be subject to the Minister, so that parliamentary responsibility may be preserved. The Commission is to have not merely advisory powers, but administrative powers also, and therefore it is necessary to make it as thoroughly representative as possible, and strong enough to properly administer the Act in the interests of the soldiers and of the community. The intention of the arrangement was to vest in one authority the control of the many different matters affecting the well-being of the soldier, so that those concerned could go to that one authority  instead of having to apply, as now, to several. </para>

                        <para>- There may be good reasons for rearranging the areas of jurisdiction; what is now under discussion is whether one or three persons should be appointed at the head of affairs in each State. In view of the adjudication powers which are vested in the State Boards, we think that they should consist of three members. The applications for assistance made on behalf of soldiers are innumerable. All these applications, together with the pensions applications, will be dealt with by the Boards. It would be ridiculous to leave these matters to the decision of one man in each State, and yet to have Local Committees of fifty or sixty members to determine questions of minor importance. Take, for instance, the position in Queensland, which is hundreds of miles away from the central administration: </para>

There is much to be said in favour of dividing a large State like Queensland into three provinces for some purposes, but that is not the point immediately under consideration. We have to decide whether it. would be wise to leave to the decision of one individual all repatriation matters arising in a large State like New South Wales, with its vast population and varied interests. </para>

                        <para>- Let us deal with one matter at a time. In the interests of the soldiers themselves, it is desirable that we should have State Boards of three members. I recognise that the State Boards have been acting in an honorary capacity, and have done magnificent work. In Queensland, but for the way in which members of the State Board have subordinated their own interests to the public welfare, much of this work would not have been carried out. There is a limit, however, to the extent of the sacrifice we may require of public-spirited citizens. The work ought to be well done, and we should pay for it. The scheme for which the Bill provides will allow of the appointment to each State Board of a representative of the soldiers, who will be able to appreciate their "trials and difficulties, and who will be looked up to by them. It will also enable the appointment of a man of business capacity to advise upon each application, and the appointment of a third man to deal with other phases of repatriation. Our object should be, not to reduce, but to strengthen as much as we reasonably can the collective wisdom of those engaged in the administration of repatriation. Western Australia, like Queensland, is remote from the Seat of Government; and if we had there a Board of one, he might hesitate to decide questions of importance, and refer them to the central administration. This would lead to delay. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot approve the arguments put forward by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> I would' remind the honorable gentleman, who has made it clear that the State Boards will have to deal with war pensions, that in New South Wales, the largest State of the group, the administration of war pensions has been carried out by the officer in charge of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department. In addition to his ordinary duties, he has had to deal with thousands of applications for war pensions, and has fixed the allotments for widows and children of deceased soldiers. This work he has almost completed. There now remain only five hundred or six hundred men in the Randwick Hospital whose claims have to be decided ; yet it is proposed to create a State Board of three members to deal with the work. The honorable gentleman says there is safety in numbers, and that therefore we should have three members on each State Board. I would point out in reply that the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions in New South Wales has so' far administered with the greatest satisfaction the invalid and ola-age pension scheme, as well as war pensions. Neither he nor his staff has been compensated for the additional work thus carried out. Why does not the Minister go further and urge that we should have three Deputies Postmaster-General in each State? </para>

I hope that we shall decide against the appointment of three members to each State Board, since I am convinced that the men will get a batter deal from one man than they would be likely to secure from a Board- of three members, who, in many cases, would be haggling with each other as to what should', be done. </para>

                    <para>.-I regret that I cannot bring my opinion on this subject into conformity with that of the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> The honorable gentleman is to be complimented upon his statement of the case, but it must not be forgotten that repatriation has hitherto been administered upon a voluntary basis in each State. The local voluntary committees are not to be abandoned. Hitherto there has been no permanent paid officer at their head in the several States. There will now be in each a permanent responsible officer, and, to my mind, the whole question of efficiency ag well as of economy will depend upon the selection of a capable man for the administration of the Act, and the regulations drawn up under it. We could certainly afford to give a better salary to one than we could' give to three. If it is difficult to obtain the services of one capable man for such a duty as this, it will be still more difficult to secure three. Much time will be spent in discussing the issues at stake if the members of the State Boards do not clearly understand the Act and the regulations. The administration of one good man .is generally more  expeditious than that of three. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but I am bringing forward this matter at the request of another honorable member. At a large conference of representatives of Repatriation Committees held in Perth, it was moved that an allowance in respect of stamps and other out of pocket expenses should be made to secretaries of Local Committees, but that motion was rejected. Now that the war is over some of the committees are becoming somewhat weary. They have done excellent work, and it would not be out of place for Parliament to carry a resolution thanking them for their splendid services during the war. I put it to the Government that some of the money that it is now proposed to expend on State Boards of three members might well be devoted to the giving of some slight consideration to those who have hitherto worked in a purely honorary capacity as secretaries of Local Committees, and who have paid their own out of pocket expenses.  If three commissioners are to be appointed for each State, a staff would be necessary. I would infinitely prefer to select a staff capable of carrying out the routine functions well, and to have one executive mind controlling the Department. With a competent staff, a commissioner in each State would be able to direct the whole of the work of the Department more efficiently than would a Board of three. If such a scheme failed we could pass an amending Bill providing for the appointment of a Board of three members in each State. I think it wise to start with a Board of one. </para>

                        <para>- That is true, but it must be recognised that the men on the State Committees to-day give their time. The administration of repatriation cannot be compared with the administration of the Postal Department. The Repatriation Boards will be dealing with all sections of the community, and if we do not get representatives of the trade unionists and the employer to work together we shall not make a success of the scheme. In the various States the Repatriation Committees deal with the technical and vocational training of soldiers, and it is essential that upon the Boards there should be representatives of others than returned soldiers, so that the case for the worker and the employer may be put. If only one  Deputy  Commissioner is appointed he will be a Government representative, and the two big interests which are essential to the success of repatriation - the trade unions and the employers - will have no representation. The two work well together to-day, and for that reason no trouble is experienced in placing men in different avocations. They meet at the committee table, and decide matters for their State without appealing to Melbourne. Yet it is proposed that all this responsibility should be vested in one man, without giving representation to the other interests whose co-operation is essential to the success of our repatriation effort. Some honorable members have objected that the Bill is creating new officers, which will mean additional appointments. That is not so; the three members of the Board in each State will take the place of the existing Committee of six in each State, and I assume that the officers who act to-day in conjunction with the State Committees will continue to act, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> will continue to be the official head of repatriation in South Australia. </para>

                <para>I hope honorable members will not ride to death the doctrine of economy. It is absurd to talk about economy when we are asking men to give up their time to assist in the administration of this repatriation scheme. I do not think it will be necessary in a State like South Australia to pay the members of the Board a regular salary, but .it is essential to pay them a regular fee, so that when they sit all day they will not be out of pocket. Of course, if the representation on the Boards is restricted to a certain class, men will be found who will do the work without remuneration ; but there are other desirable men who cannot afford to give their time for nothing. The Government recognise that fact to-day, and many men who represent working-class interests on the Repatriation Committees and other bodies are paid for their time. All that the Bill proposes to do is to reduce the membership of the existing Committees from six to three, and to settle definitely that we shall recompense each member for time lost in doing this work. </para>

                    <para>.- The plausibility of the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> did not carry much weight with me. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> has drawn the attention of the Committee to the various Departments in each State that are successfully administered by one  Deputy  Commissioner. The Commonwealth Bank is a noteworthy instance of that policy. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> referred to the attitude of the Senate, but it must 'be remembered that the Senate has not the financial responsibility that this House has. If I thought that the appointment of a Board of three would conduce to greater efficiency I would support the. clause, but I am convinced that better results will follow the system of control by one  Deputy  Commissioner iri each State. The local organizations in Sydney have done splendid work, and laid the foundation upon which the State Boards can build. They have been of great assistance to the soldiers, but they have had no definite policy laid down for them by Act of Parliament. They have had to create special machinery, and to make the soldier understand that the  State was prepared to do as much for him as possible, but that there was a limitation to the assistance it could render. All tha State Boards will have to do will be to administer in accordance with the guiding principles laid down in this Bill. They cannot create any precedents or do anything other than what the law prescribes. People will think this Parliament has lost its sense if it creates Boards comprising twenty-one members for the administration of the Repatriation Department. Even the Board that controls the Australian Navy comprises only three members. The State Boards will have before them a definite policy laid down by the Act, and certain regulations framed by the Commission. </para>

                    <para>, - The Committee is animated with the idea of securing the utmost efficiency in the matter of repatriation, and the question is whether the greater efficiency will be obtained by the appointment of three men or of one man. So far as one can gather from the Bill, the main functions of the Boards are merely of an advisory character, for there is no administration permitted to them. It is quite true that by clauses 19 and 26 certain functions are delegated to the Boards, the latter clause giving them power, subject to appeal, of adjudicating so far as the pensions are concerned, upon the capacity or incapacity of the soldiers, and so forth. The Boards are entitled to exercise those powers in addition to such other powers as may be prescribed by regulation by the Commission itself. From the point of view of decentralization these Boards are vital to the efficient working of the Bill. I have the utmost confidence in the Local Committees because of the local knowledge they can bring to bear in furnishing the Boards and the Commission with information and advice. The State Boards will have to concentrate the work done by the Local Committees, and the latter will be responsible to the Boards, and, therefore, it is of the utmost moment that the Boards should be of a representative character. This I regard as the real point of the whole scheme. If a Board consists of one man alone, he will probably be a departmental officer, and largely subject to departmental views. He will, of course, take his instructions from the Department and from the Commission, and will consciously or unconsciously be permeated with the ideas of the Department. If, on the other hand, each Board consists of three men we are enabled at once to have a representative body. </para>

                        <para>- The first essential is a representative of the soldiers who will supply information of a personal character, and be the link between the local Repatriation Board and the various organizations of the soldiers. Then, again, there should be on the Board a man of business capacity and special experience in repatriation work, selected from outside; and doubtless his position will be of an honorary character. The third representative will be a departmental man, and the three will constitute a Board of a comprehensive and highly representative character. I repeat that a representative Board such as I have indicated is the greatest guarantee of efficiency, and is more calculated to give complete satisfaction than could possibly the autocratic adjudications of any one individual, </para>

                <para>The most humorous suggestion made in the course of this discussion is that the appointment of representative Boards involves extravagance. Surely such a view as that cannot be seriously advanced? The members of the Boards will doubtless be paid by fees of, practically, a nominal character, and will be capable of giving more valuable advice, I venture to say, an any single departmental officer could do. Representative Boards should be the guiding principle in our decision in this matter, and, therefore, I think the Government are acting wisely in the proposal they have made to the  Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- The special pleading in connexion with these proposed Boards is surprising. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> is apparently able to give the Committee more information regarding the payments to be made to the members of the Board than the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> himself is in a position to afford. Not a word have we had from the Minister as to what these payments are to he - whether so much a sitting or by way of fixed salary. It would appear that the honorable member for Kooyong has not studied the Bill, for, as a matter of fact, provision is made for the appointment of members of the Public Service, who may be returned soldiers; and if the Boards are to consist of three members each, the work will be sufficient to take up all their time, for which, of course, they must be paid. It is already rumoured that the  Chairman  of the Commission is to be paid  £1,500,  and his two colleagues  £1,000  each; and I suppose that the  Chairman  of a State Board will be paid  £800  or  £900,  and the other two members, probably,  £600.  One would think from what has been said that the duties of the Board extend to every kind of provision made for returned soldiers, whereas their duty, practically, will be to decide as to the pensions. </para>

                <para class="block">If the honorable member for Kooyong is relying on what is to be prescribed by regulation, this only shows that the information giventotheCommittee is faulty. I take it that the duties I have just read are the principal duties that the Boards will have to perform. At the present time, a member of the staff of the Old-age Pensions Office in each State is doing the work; and I ask honorable members whether a Board of one or a Board' of three is the more likely to result in the greater expedition? The complaint in the past has been that of delay in almost every branch of repatriation administration, and particularly in connexion with land settlement, where, indeed, it is so serious as to appear almost deliberate. The officers at present doing this work are men experienced in work of a similar kind; and we should be incurring unwarranted expenditure if we appointed Boards consisting of three members. It is true that the returned soldiers have asked for representation on the Boards; but I am sure that the great bulk of them, if they were consulted, would tell us that it is delay of which they have to complain, whether it be in connexion with pensions, vocational training, land settlement, or any other branch of the work. I do not wish to ride the " economy" horse to death. There is economy and economy. Some phases of economy pleaded for by certain honorable members find no support from me, but there is one form of economy the practice of which at this moment is essential in the interests of the country and of the returned soldiers. There will be more appeals from a Board of three than from the decision of one man. </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that whether we appoint one man, or three, or six, the Board will be largely dependent, for its actions in respect to every returned soldier, upon the records of the Defence Department - upon the papers presented by the soldier himself. Ministers appear to object to the considerable care which honorable members on both sides are seeking to give to this measure. When the Bill was being dealt with at its second-reading stage, Ministers emphasized that it was one which lent itself readily to consideration and improvement in Committee. The second-reading debate was concluded, therefore, with as little delay as possible. Now it is for the Committee, in its combined wisdom, to endeavour to mould a satisfactory measure. We know the fate always in store for an amendment moved from this side; but it would appear that even when an amendment is proposed by an adherent of the Government its chances are no better. The party whip is cracked, and the clause must pass as the Cabinet has framed it. That kind of thing was never tolerated by this side. I recall divisions, when Labour was in power, when followers of the Government crossed over in support of the Opposition against their own Government. Nothing like that ever occurs nowadays. The whip is cracked, and docile followers of the Government to-day immediately come to heel. </para>

                    <para>.- Were the appointment of State Boards to be considered only in relation to the matter of pensions,I would vote against this clause as drafted. But in view of the tremendously wide scope of the activities of repatriation I intend to support the Government in its proposal to establish State Boards having a membership each of three, which will take the place of the present voluntary Boards of seven. I hope the Government, in making the appointments, will have regard not only to the soldier aspect, but also to the broad principle of making effective the scheme of repatriation. I am impressed with the necessity for appointing an industrialist upon each State Board. Vocational and technical training is a very important phase of the work, and will be the longest surviving feature  of repatriation; and I know of no individual better equipped to advise than one who is familiar with the ramifications of industrial life, and is sympathetic with the view-point of trade unionism in relation to vocational training. I regard the State Boards as being the direct link between the soldier and the benefits to be conferred upon him under the Act. It will be the Boards, and not the Commission, or the Minister, which will determine every individual case. It will be highly unsatisfactory, and indeed foolish, to appoint only one man for each State, whose erroneous judgments might cost the repatriation scheme vastly more than the salaries of a Board of three. The Boards will require to have regard for the welfare of returned men in every avocation. Considerable knowledge, experience, and sympathy will be among the attributes of a successful Board. Are these not likely to be combined more adequately in three than in one person ? </para>

                    <para>. - In my view only one honorable member has touched the vital point at issue in respect to whether the State Boards shall comprise three or consist of only one man. I refer to the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> but I do not agree with his argument. This Bill has been drafted with the object of fully and adequately repatriating our returned men. The question is, will the " digger " be more content with a decision given upon his case by one man than by three? I feel sure that he will prefer to be dealt with' by three rather than be turned down upon the judgment of one. I am confident that a State Board, constituted as the Bill proposes, will furnish considerably fewer appeals to the Commission than would one individual. The appointment of only one man for each State will involve hundreds of appeals, with consequent considerable delay in dealing with the cases of hundreds of returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong remarked that there would be a representative of the soldier, then a business man, and then an official. Where will the worker come in ? Unless there be an industrialist upon each Board, who will be able to contribute the benefit of his knowledge of trade unionism, and of the practical side of vocational training, I feel confident that the unions will not be prepared to accept the proposed new organizations - at any rate, with the same readiness as in the past. When trade unionists have been asked to appoint their representatives they have done so forthwith. When cases arising in specific trades or callings have required consideration, unionist workers have appointed their representatives long before the employers have seen fit to do so. Numbers of men desired, upon returning home to Australia, to enter the boot trade, and in this connexion a Shoe Trade Industry School has been established. The workers have voted £200 or £300 to assist in its establishment, and they have a representative on the sub-committee controlling it. The vocational training schools will not work as smoothly if a State Board is to be constituted as the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> has suggested, but no exception would be taken to the appointment of one Commissioner in each State, whether he be an employer or an employee. All sorts of sub-committees could be appointed for the various industries. They exist to-day. The committee in control of the building trade vocational school does not exercise any control over the bootmaking vocational school . </para>

The number of appeals will depend upon the success of preceding appeals. If the Central Commission reverses the decision of a State Board, there will be numerous appeals from the decisions of State Boards. If, on the other hand, the judgment of the State Board is upheld, there will be very few appeals lodged. I have already asked for information as to the salaries to be paid to members of State Boards. </para>

                        <para>- These Boards will be called upon to deal with a certain number of matters. Administration of war pensions will be continuous work. Pensioners are obliged to go before a Medical Board from time to time to be examined in reference to the state of their disability as compared with their condition at the granting of their pensions. Evidently the Government believe that the work of these State Boards will be completed much more speedily than that of the Central Commissioners, whose term of office was to have been five years, because they propose that the tenure of office of a member of such a Board shall not be more than two years. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> was successful in having the period of office of a Central Commissioner reduced to three years, but in defending the Government's proposal the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> asked whether it would be possible to get good men to accept appointments for the limited period, whereas, apparently, he now contends that the Government can secure the services of good men on State Boards for the limited term of two years. We are told that the  Chairman  of a State Board is to be paid £800 or £900 per annum, and that the other members of such Boards are to receive £600 or £800. </para>

If the salaries which have been mentioned are to be paid to members of State Repatriation Boards, whose principal work will be to administer war pensions, then I claim that the  Deputy  Commissioners who have hitherto been doing this work so smoothly are altogether inadequately paid at £500 per annum. Furthermore, as the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> has pointed out, if it is deemed necessary to appoint a Board of three to administer war pensions, why should we not also appoint a Customs Board in each State to replace the Collectors of Customs? I shall vote for the amendment, because I believe that better work will be done by one man than by three. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that " may," not " shall," is the proper word to use in enactments affecting the Crown, but that "may" in these cases means " shall." My object is to give to all soldiers, whether members of organizations or not, an opportunity to vote for the selection of a representative on their State Board. Whatever difficulties there might be in the way of balloting throughout Australia for the selection of a Commissioner, they will not be so great in regard to ballots confined to the various States. There are returned men who have declined to join the soldiers' organizations, looking to Parliament to do the right thing for them. Quite a number of trade unionists are in that position. I believe that there are at least four soldiers' organizations, and under the Bill as it stands each would send in lists of names.  </para>

The Committee has already determined the method of appointment of the Commission, and although it is true that the specific issue in this instance was not put to a vote, the principle for which the clause provides has in reality been affirmed. The proposal made by the honorable member is quite impracticable. It would be very difficult to devise the necessary machinery by which every returned man would be able to record his vote, apart from any organization. We could not! get into touch with the men unless they were registered by an organization or some other authority. </para>

                        <para>- They may be on the rolls, but there is nothing to show who amongst those on the electoral rolls are returned soldiers. The clause as it stands provides for the efficient representation of returned sailors and soldiers by means of a selection made by organizations constituted by the sailors and soldiers themselves. </para>

                    <para>.- I am pleased that the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has again brought forward this proposal. I supported the claim that soldiers should be allowed to choose their own representative on the Commission, irrespective of whether or not they belonged to any organization, and despite the Minister's statement I can see no objection to the adoption of the same principle in this case. On one of the State rolls crossed swords appear opposite the name of every returned man. In that State we thus have a ready-made roll of returned soldiers. Even in the absence of such a guide we could adopt the procedure followed at mass meetings of returned men, and restrict the admission to the various halls at which the voting took place to those who could produce their discharge. If that course were adopted, it would be immaterial whether a man belonged to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, the recently-formed Returned Sailors and Soldiers Democratic League, or any other association formed to safeguard the rights of returned men. He could vote quite independently of any organization. There are" quite a number of these associations in the» States, and they could meet in conference and determine upon the selection of a representative for the whole of the returned soldiers on each State Board. The amendment provides for the recognition of a democratic principle that is observed in connexion with all working-class organizations. In all industrial organizations it is recognised that those whose interests are most concerned should have the  right to select their own delegates. There is no real obstacle in the way of this' proposal, and neither the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> nor any one else should attempt to cloud the issue. The question is whether the returned men themselves shall select their own representatives or whether the Minister or Commissioner shall make a selection from eight or ten names submitted by the various organizations. If the final selection were left to the Minister or the Commissioners, the man most amenable to them would secure the selection, irrespective of the wishes of the rank and file outside. If it is right that the returned men should be represented at all on these State Boards, it is right they should select their own representatives. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> has just claimed that since all democratic organizations select their own representatives, the returned sailors and soldiers should be allowed to select their own representatives.  That is what is proposed in this case. The whole tenor of the honorable member's argument was that democratic organizations throughout Australia had no difficulty in choosing their representatives for any purpose, because they were organized. The Government propose to allow organizations of returned men to select those from whom they think a final choice should be made. They do not propose to allow the whole scheme to fail for lack of organization. If, as proposed by the Opposition, we extended the principle beyond the organizations of returned men, and provided that a ballot of all returned sailors and soldiers, irrespective of any organization, should take place, the scheme would' break down. Every one knows that our returned men are scattered all over Australia, and that it would be quite impossible so to reach them as to secure their fair representation on these Boards except by means of their several organizations. I should be glad if it were possible for every returned man to vote directly on the question .of representation, but I recognise that it is not. We must allow their organizations to make a selection, just as selections are made by industrial organizations. </para>

I  notice that there has been a strong tendency on the part of honorable members of the Opposition to cut down the benefits of the Bill as much as possible except in relation to the machinery for voting for representatives on the Commission and State Boards. They have tried to cut down everything making for the benefit of the returned man and the broadening of this measure. If they would allow the organizations of returned men to do this job for themselves, and would broaden their own views as to the benefits to be obtained by returned men under this Bill, the men would be very thankful. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not enter into a controversy on the point. The whole question at issue is whether we desire to have on each State Board a man who will be acceptable to the rank and file of the returned sailors and soldiers, or a representative of the " blue ribbon " of the organizations - a representative of a particularly strong organization with a political colouring - the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. The argument advanced by the honorable member for Robertson was one that should induce him to vote with us on this question. He says that there are so many organizations of returned soldiers that it would be impossible for each to have a representative on these Boards. That being so, the individual organizations cannot determine the selection. They will simply send in the names of two or three men, and an arbitrary decision will be arrived at by the Minister. The organization that can present the best case, politically or otherwise, to the Minister will very likely secure the selection of its nominee. My desire is to lift this question out of the ruck of party politics, and consequently I hold that satisfaction can be given to our returned men only by allowing every soldier the right to a direct vote on the question of who shall represent him. If that were done, neither the Ministernor any one else could challenge the right of the man elected to sit on the Board. It is quite idle to talk about the impossibility of reaching the returned soldiers in connexion with the taking of a vote of this kind. The Government can find the returned men very quickly when they want them. There is no organization so effective and complete as. that of the military. To each soldier a ballot-paper could be sent, and his discharge would be his elector's right. In constituting this Commission we should aim at avoiding bickering and giving as much satisfaction as possible to every returned soldier, regardless of the organization to which he belongs. The only way in which that can be done is by giving every man a right to ballot for his representative on the Commission, the man chosen -to be beyond the Minister's power of veto. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members opposite are indulging in a lot of make-believe and raising imaginary difficulties in the way of taking a' ballot of all the returned soldiers. The soldiers who were flesh and blood, and did such good work at the Front, seem to have suddenly disappeared; we are told that many of them cannot be found. Yet only a few days ago this House passed a Bill for the payment of a gratuity to soldiers. If there is anything in the point raised by the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> how shall we find the soldiers in order to pay them their gratuity bonds? The soldiers can be easily found; all that is necessary is an intimation through the public press that they are entitled to record their votes as to who shall represent them on the Commission. An easy and ready way of tracing every soldier would be to publish an announcement that on a certain day the soldiers would be paid their gratuity in cash; I predict that if that were done not many would be missing. </para>

                <para class="block">This provision appears to be in accordance with a similar section in the Constitution as applying to members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I desire the paragraph to be deleted because a representative of the soldiers on the Board might find himself, through no fault of his own, but by reason of his position as a member of a soldiers' organization, the subject of legal proceedings, the result of which might be his declaration as a bankrupt. Under such circumstances, if the clause is allowed to remain as drafted, he would lose his position as a member of the Commission. For instance, it will be remembered that some little time ago the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League took action against certain of its members, and legal proceedings were threatened against officers of the organization. One of those officers happened to be a member of Parliament, and though he may not have known of the action taken, or have been in favour of it, he might, by reason of it, have been placed in the position of a bankrupt, and, therefore, I contend that the clause as it stands is not reasonable. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that in nearly all the States the company laws, particularly as regards proprietary companies, differ. In Victoria there may bo proprietary companies in which 90 per cent. of the shares are hold among two or three persons. Those individuals probably would be those most closely connected with the business, and, apart from the advantage accruing to themselves in safeguarding their interests, there is a considerable factor of safety also for the employees. It is obvious that if the majority interest in a concern were taken out of the hands of those who had been carrying it on, some change might be brought about whereby employees would be dismissed or would suffer some other serious disability. For the purposes of this clause I would prefer the membership of an incorporated company set forth as " consisting of more than fifty persons." </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause contains the definite statement that " a Board may exercise such powers and shall perform such duties as are conferred on it by this Act." There is only one clause in the Bill which confers any powers on the Boards. That is clause 26, which provides for the Boards to deal with pensions. The object of this particular clause, however, is to enable the Boards to deal with all those matters, under the regulations, such as the present State Boards have been accustomed to handle. The amendment of the honorable member for Yarra, if agreed to, would have the effect of depriving the State Boards of their powers.  His  intention, however,  is  that the Boards shall have conferred upon them the fullest possible authority, under the regulations, to deal with the innumerable classes of soldiers' applications which will be constantly coming before them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill makes no attempt to define the duties of State Boards, but under clause 12 the- Commission is given a power of delegation, and its functions may be passed on to State Boards. I had expected the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> to explain whether there was to be any variation in the functions of State Boards as compared with the existing Boards. There is to be a vital difference between the newly-created Commission and the old Commission. The latter had the power of formulating policy, but the Minister was a member of the Commission, and the Commission's policy became the policy of repatriation. Under this Bill, however, the Minister is to solely determine the policy of repatriation, and the Commission will merely give effect to it and use the State Boards for that purpose. In the past the complaint of the State Boards has been that they have been somewhat of an excrescence on repatriation work. Men with a good general knowledge have been acting .on the Boards, but they have not had the power of initiation, and have had very little power of recommendation. On one occasion the Victorian Board resigned, feeling that it was quite useless for the purpose of carrying out any functions. I hope that the Minister will give us the carefully-considered policy of the Government in this regard. I hope that the State Boards, which will be in close touch with the soldiers, will be real active administrative bodies, and if direct powers of administration are not conferred on them, I trust that under the delegated powers they will be effective bodies, and not merely consultative </para>

                    <para>. - Since this Parliament has assembled we have heard a great deal, particularly from the gentlemen in the corner, about reverting to constitutional government. The War Precautions Act was a very small measure with very few clauses, but it will surprise honorable members in the corner to know that the regulations issued under it would fill this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who was the Prime Minister when that measure was passed, and his Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> tola the House that the Bill would be all right and that the Act would be carefully and properly administered; but as it has been administered honorable members of the Opposition have been practically leg-roped and hamstrung. My idea is that we should put as much as we can into the Bill and have very few regulations. I noticed in the press about a fortnight ago that all the soldiers in this House had formed a party. What does the  chairman  of that party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> think about this measure, which so vitally affects returned men ? Is he fighting for the soldiers or for regulations? I represent a lot of returned soldiers, and they have been in communication with me about the Act. I want to see them get a fair and square deal. We can only do it by ' cutting out as many regulations as possible and putting the provisions in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- No one knows better than the Acting Attorney-General that the less regulations there are the better the Statute is. The regulations issued under the Public Service Act are scandalous. One week a regulation is gazetted, the next week it is altered, and the following week it is repealed and a fresh start is made. The same thing will occur under this Bill. The measure should be made as simple as possible, so that anyone and everyone may understand it. The nick and shovel work of repatriation has already been done, and well done, by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline></para>

                        <para>- But that does not matter. The Minister knows well that regulations may be made to upset the purpose of an Act. I agree with the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> that the State Boards should be given as much power as possible, because they know more about the conditions and the individuals in the various States than can be known in Melbourne. At the same time I want to see their powers set out in the Bill itself and not in regulations. I want this measure to be a model Bill for the repatriation of our soldiers, and I sincerely trust, for the ,saKe, not only of politicians, but also of the soldiers, we shall have as few regulations as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment shows that the Government's chickens are now coming home to roost. It is- true that an Act cannot be administered without regulations, but the amendment is easily understood in the light of the history of this Administration. As the Minister pointed out, almost every Bill introduced by Labour Governments contained -the necessary power to make regulations, but it is not to the discredit of Labour Governments, as it is to the discredit of this Government, that that power was misused, and that regulations were secretly made which had the most far-reaching and, in some cases, most oppressive effects. This Government has carried the practice of legislating by regulation to such an extent that now it is content to present the mere shell of a measure for indorsement by Parliament, leaving the actual legislation to be done under rules made " as may be prescribed." That is a sufficient reason for the amendment, which is designed to direct the Government -ho put its legislative intentions into print for the consideration of Parliament. </para>

The Government should .have told the Committee what the powers of the Commission and of the Boards are to be, and not, as the Minister for Works and Railways has suggested, wait until Parliament is in recess to legislate in regard to them. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister, in an interjection, asked what was to be done when Parliament was in recess, when they may want to pass regulations which Parliament would not have an opportunity of discussing. As a protest against the action of the. Government in presenting a mere legislative shell, leaving the actual legislation to the framing of secret regulations, I shall vote for the amendment. I want Ministers 'tlo' understand that we have not forgotten recent history, and that from now on we shall insist upon our constitutional right to have legislative proposals submitted in print for our consideration in this Chamber, instead of having legislation, turned out in secret from a sort of sausage machine. Men have been arrested, tried, and imprisoned under regulations of which they may have had no knowledge, and which the Government would not have dared to bring forward for discussion in Parliament. </para>

Whenever a certain amount of public excitement arose, and there was some little agitation at a public meeting in the city, representations were made to the Prime Minister, who immediately turned the handle of the machine and put into force what was virtually an Act of Parliament in the guise of a regulation. The Opposition reminds the Government of the past, and invites it to amend its ways in the future. It asks also to be told what is meant by the Bill, and refuses to give the blank cheque that is asked for. </para>

                    <para>- Some of those associated with him have declared that the Bill should not. be regarded as a party measure. Yet, because of something that was done under an Act passed by a Labour Government, they refuse to give to this Government a power which the honorable member for Batman admits to be essential to the working of any Act. To vote for such an amendment would be to pass a vote of censure on the Government. The honorable member has declared it to be the purpose of the Leader of the Opposition, not to perfect the Bill, but to show the public that his party has . no confidence in those who will be responsible for the regulations made under it. That is to drag the measure into the arena of the impurest party politics, and there is nothing that we should be more reluctant to do, seeing that the measure was introduced to benefit our soldiers, who came, not from one party, but from all the parties in the Commonwealth. No one knows better than the Leader of the Opposition that power to make regulations is essential to the working of an Act, and he has introduced many Bills containing practically the same provision as that to which he now objects. The finest thing that Parliament did during the war was to pass a Repatriation Bill which was a mere legislative skeleton, leaving it to the Minister and his officers to work out the whole scheme. The success which has attended their efforts is far beyond the expectations of those who passed that Bill. If the question is asked, " Can we trust this Administration to make regulations in the interests of the soldiers?" I would remind the Committee of the gibe of the Leader of the Opposition the other night, that this Government was here merely to register the decisions of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League. That association gives probably a truer reflex of the opinions of our soldiers, both inside and outside of it, than can be got from honorable members opposite. </para>

                    <para>.- The more we intrust to an executive power to make regulations the more we barter away the rights of Parliament. No Act can be worked without regulations, but to give a blank cheque in regard to the power to make regulations is to let the control of public affairs pass altogether out of the hands of Parliament. I object on principle to government by regulation, and shall vote for the amendment, because I think that the words " as prescribed," which appear here, there, and everywhere in the Bill, allow for the framing of regulations which may surprise even the honorable member for Kooyong. Even he will have no opportunity to object to regulations framed under this power. They will be turned out in recess by the printing press, and I believe that steps will be taken to do by regulation what really is not provided for in the Bill. That has happened in the past. Already notice has been given of the intention to bring in a Bill to indemnify a number of persons who committed illegal acts in the name of the Government. Is it not time that we ceased to allow Governments, Labour or otherwise, to rule the country by regulation ?Whenever I can cast a vote to curtail the power of the Executive, and to increase the power of Parliament. I shall do so. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret to have to oppose the amendment. A new Department has been created in which a number of employees have been engaged for several years. The amendment would offer a convenient means of getting rid of some of them. For instance, an age limit might be prescribed which might exclude a large number of the present officers, some of whom are good men, with ripe experience. I am not very favorably disposed towards Public Service examinations. Once a man has entered the Service by examination, he is there for life; at any rate, he cannot be shifted without a lot of trouble. Under the system proposed by this clause an officer can be employed as long as he gives satisfaction, and when his services are no longer satisfactory the Commission may discharge him. </para>

                        <para>- The Government propose that the Repatriation Commissioners shall take over the administration of war pensions. Under the pension system the magistrates are, I think, in every case public servants. Are we to create an additional set of magistrates in addition to the men who have been doing the work, who understand it, and who know exactly the type of claimants they have to deal with? We have already safeguarded the positions of members of the Public Service who enter the service of the Commission by guaranteeing them their accruing rights. </para>

                        <para>- I know that; but the Bill preserves the rights of the appointees under the Public Service Act. Honorable members will see in the Public Service Commissioner's report that at least one-third of the officers of the Service are temporary or exempt. Of course, a lot of them are filling such positions as those of cleaners, and are necessarily exempt. Any person appointed by the Commission could be made exempt likewise. If it is desired- that these appointments shall be only temporary they can be made so as readily under the Public Service Act as under the clause that is proposed. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Public Service Commissioner may appoint any person temporarily for not more than six months. The appointment may then be extended for three months, and if it is shown- as it would be shown by the Minister in respect of appointments under this measure - that it is advisable in the interests of the Department that the officer's services should be further retained, that can be done. For instance, skilled men who were engaged in the vocational training of returned soldiers could be made exempt officers. I have no desire to displace any man who is already employed in the Department, but we should be careful not to open wide the door for political patronage. Honorable members recollect the abuses that took place in the State Public Service under the old system of political appointment, and any member who has had Ministerial experience will admit that those who have entered the Public Service by examination are at least as good as those who entered by other means. </para>

                    <para>.- Why is there a difference between the treatment of 'Commonwealth officers who may be appointed Commissioners or members of Boards under clause 20, and the treatment of subordinate, officers referred to in clause 21? By clause 20, if an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service is appointed Commissioner or member of a Board, his term of service counts as if he had been in the Commonwealth Public Service throughout, although he is not a Commonwealth public servant during that term. In clause 21, however, which deals with subordinate officers, the same language is not adhered to, nor is the same result achieved. These officers retain all their accruing rights to the date of appointment under the Bill, but the period of appointment does not count subsequently as if they had been members of the Public Service to the same extent as in the case of the Commissioners. They are given leave of absence during their term of office under the Bill, but there is a difference between the treatment they receive :.and the treatment given to officers who may be appointed Commissioner or member of a Board. 'There is no doubt from <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> wording of the clauses that this difference is designed, and it means that the subordinate officers are not given such favorable consideration under this measure as are the more highly-paid officers. </para>

                <para class="block">This is what I desire to have explained. There seems to be power vested in the Public Service Commissioner, under clause 21, to appoint the officers to positions at an advanced salary subsequently; the Public Service Commissioner is given a discretion. In the case of the higher-paid officers, however, the Bill itself defines what their position shall be, and they are to be considered as having been Commonwealth public . servants throughout their period of service under the Bill. I suppose that there may be a considerable advance in salary of a public officer appointed a Commissioner or member of a Board. Will such officers continue at the higher rate of salary when their period of service under the Bill expires? If so, why does not the salary of the subordinate officers continue likewise at the higher rate, assuming that there was an advance when they were appointed under the Bill? Then, again, sub-clause  4  of clause  21  provides- </para>

                    <para>.- - The Minister failed to touch the point which I specifically raised. I pointed out a distinct difference between the treatment proposed to be meted to the Commissioners and members of the State Boards, and to the lesser officials. Clause 20 proposes to confer better conditions upon a Commonwealth public servant who may be appointed a Commissioner  or  member of a Board than clause 21 essays to give to subordinate officers  of  the Commonwealth Public Service who may be appointed  to  subordinate positions under the repatriation scheme. . It is laid down distinctly in clause 20 that, although the Commissioners will not be officers under the Public Service Act, their services under the provisions of this measure will be taken into account in ascertaining their existing and accruing rights. At the termination of their period of service under the repatriation legislation, will the Commissioners continue to be Commonwealth public servants? </para>

                        <para>- Then he may return to a lower salary than he has been drawing hitherto. That is not as I read the clause, however. I read it that his service as a Commissioner will count as though he were a Commonwealth public servant during that period, in order to ascertain what are his existing and accruing rights. But a subordinate officer's period of service, apparently, is not to fully count as though he had remained throughout that term a Commonwealth public servant. He may be given leave of absence when this measure becomes an Act. ' </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for West Sydney has made it clear to me that there is a distinction contained in clause 20, as against the phraseology of clause 21, giving preferential treatment to the higher-paid officials. The difference between the clauses is that all the accruing rights of the man in the Public Service receiving £800 a year are preserved just as if he were still a public servant until he returns to the Department in which he was employed prior to his appointment as Repatriation Commissioner - if his accruing rights amount to £100 or £200 per year he will get them - but a junior officer, a clerk in the Pensions Branch of the Treasury who is transferred to the Repatriation Department, is not to have his accruing rights protected. Upon his return to the Treasury Department he will get just that treatment which the Public Service Commissioner chooses to mete out to him. If there is to be no distinction between the two classes of officers, why should not both clauses be the same ? The officer occupying a junior position in the Service should get the same fair; square deal as is meted out to the " top dog." </para>

                    <para>. - This clause affords the Committee the first opportunity it has had of separate reference to the "administration of war pensions. I hope that we shall have from the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> a clear enunciation of policy, that there will be no overlapping of Departments. There is already a branch of the Treasury Department administering pensions, but apparently, in order to group all soldier activities under one head, it is now proposed to transfer the administration of war pensions to the Repatriation Department. I voted with the Government on clause 21 against the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> feeling that in voting for the amendment 1 would have been supporting the creation of permanent officers under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and it would then have been too late for me to raise a protest against this portion of the Bill. I want to hear a statement from the Government that the period of service of the officers appointed under the Repatriation Commission to administer war pensions will cease when the general activities of repatriation cease, and that automatically the pensions work will revert to the Treasury. Otherwise, we shall again be creating what the country has been objecting to for years past - namely, the duplication of Departments, not merely the duplication of Federal and State Departments covering one sphere of activity, but ridiculously creating two Pensions Departments in the Federal sphere of activity, I object to the appointment of further permanent officers when we already have permanent officers for the administration of pensions generally, and it has been the experience of honorable members on both sides that so far the work has been satisfactorily performed. No assurance has been given that greater facility or expedition will be provided or displayed by the transfer of this branch of pensions work to the Repatriation Commission. I would oppose the transfer if it were merely to be done for the purpose of justifying a paid Repatriation Commission, and I would seek to have Part III. of the Bill omitted. I want the Government to say that they do not propose to create and perpetuate two Pensions Departments in the Federal sphere. If they propose to do so, I cannot support this portion of the Bill. If, on the other hand,' the Minister says that, having carefully considered all the needs of the soldiers, he finds that it will be more economical and effective, and of greater advantage to' the soldiers, to have the whole of these activities grouped temporarily in one Department, I cannot press my objection. </para>

                    <para>. - I sympathize with the contention put forward by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline> I do not like the complexion given to this Bill that the proposed transfer of the pensions administration will take the form of the creation of a permanent Department. The work of repatriation is of a temporary nature, although it may continue for a very considerable time. We have recognised the temporary character -of the Department's work in the creation of the controlling authorities, but should we take from the Treasury the administration of war pensions, and hand it over to the Repatriation Department, we should give to_ the latter a permanent character. The interests with which the Department will have to deal are sectional, and some of them may cease to exist after a comparatively short period of years ; but the administration of pensions must continue for many years. I wish the Minister to satisfy the Committee that there is a sufficient reason for transferring the War Pensions Branch from the Treasury Department, where it has been exceedingly well administered, to the Repatriation Department. I am as strong as anybody could be against the creation of unnecessary Departments, and the country is making its voice heard unmistakably on the question. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I have had letters from soldiers, portions of which I have had to re-write because they dealt with a number of matters which had to be referred to different Departments. One letter might contain matters which had to be referred to the Defence, the Treasury, and the Repatriation Departments. I am informed by those who know more about repatriation than I do, that what is proposed will not entail any disturbance of the present existing pensions machinery, and will not disturb the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Pensions Department; that it ip a change of roof rather than a change of <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> that is proposed. The proposed reorganization will insure to the returned soldier and' his dependants economy of working, and expedition in dealing with the business in hand. Under the present arrangement two or three Departments have to be communicated with, but under the proposed arrangement everything can be done by communicating with the Repatriation Department. What is proposed will not duplicate the pensions staff, or increase it, and will insure greater expedi- tion in settling claims. </para>

No Parliament, however, would allow an unwarrantable duplication of Departments to continue for any length of time. In the meanwhile, it will be a great advantage to have pension matters dealt with under the same roof as other repatriation matters. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time, so far as Melbourne is concerned, all pension matters are dealt with in the offices in Brooks Robinson's buildings in Elizabeth-street. Now, according to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when introducing this Bill in the Senate, there are only 17,000 soldiers to return to Australia, "and the bulk of the sick and wounded have already returned, while the cases of the dependants of those who were killed have been dealt with. At least 75 per cent, of all pensions cases in every State have been finished, and to hand over the administration of war pensions' to the Repatriation Department would be a mistake. As the honorable member for Wakefield has suggested, it would give the Repatriation Department a justification for continuing in existence after its real work had been done. Honorable members know what a scandal attached to the pension system of the United States of America, where forty years after the Civil War there were more pensioners receiving war pensions than there were persons who had fought in the war. </para>

                <para class="block">Department of the Commonwealth ha3 worked better than the War Pensions Department. What is proposed is the transfer of a certain number of officers from the offices in Elizabeth-street to the Repatriation Department offices .in. St. Kildaroad. If this would benefit the soldiers or their dependants in any way, I would not object to it, but I cannot see that it would. The only difference it will make to a pensioner will be that, instead of presenting himself at the end of six ' months in Elizabeth-street, he will have to present himself at the St. Kilda-road offices, where he will be examined by the same men as under the present arrangement would examine him in Elizabeth-street. As for the paying .of pensions, that is done throughout the Commonwealth at the various post offices. Nothing will be saved by the proposed change, and I fail to discover any justification for handing over the pensions administration to the Repatriation Department, when not more than one-fourth of the whole number of cases remains to be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not satisfied with the form of the assurance given by the Minister that we are not to have at the end of the repatriation activities of the Commonwealth two distinct pension Departments, with a commissioner and deputy commissioners, together with their respective staffs, dealing with invalid and old-age pensions, and a Commission and State Boards dealing with war pensions. The hesitancy shown by the Minister leads me to believe that we are to have two Federal pensions Departments controlled by two separate Ministers with separate staffs and different methods of ' adjustment. If it were not for the schedule provisions already agreed upon and which vastly enhance the pensions and allowances hitherto provided for, I should move for the. omission of the whole of Part III. of the Bill. To do that, however, would be to strike out the new pension rates provided for in the schedule, and I am not prepared to take that responsibility in order to bring about a change of administration. The responsibility is too great. I hope, however, that the Government will recognise that many of their supporters, firmly object to the duplication of Federal Departments. It has been bad enough in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I have risen to suggest that an arrangement be made for loaning to the newly-created Department so much of the staff of the pensions branch of the Treasury as may be necessary to administer the war pensions. These officers might very well be loaned to the Repatriation Department until the dismantling stage is reached. Apart from the fact that the Commission will have to deal with the remaining 25 per cent, of claims yet to be disposed of and to carry on technical and vocational training, the major portion of its work will be that of dismantling. It should arrange with the States to carry out the final administrative work. It should arrange, for instance, with the State medical institutions to take over the residue of the work on the medical side, and I see nothing to prevent officers of the Treasury Department now dealing with war pensions being loaned to the Repatriation Department to carry on the pensions branch. When the great bulk of what I may describe as the soldier work of the Commission had been completed those officers would be able to return to the Treasury. There can be no justification for two separate Federal Pensions Departments. </para>

                    <para>.- The provisions of the Bill providing for further duality of Departments occasion me much anxiety. My experience has not been such as to make me welcome any interference with the present system of administering war pensions. In New South Wales we have a Pensions Department second to none in the Commonwealth. I cannot say what has been done in the other States, but no Department with which I personally do business can claim anything like the capacity and efficiency of the Commonwealth Pensions Department in New South Wales. Punctuality, courtesy, promptness and efficiency constitute apparently the keynote of the service. If there is any delay in connexion with it, it is usually due to medical officers or magistrates who have to conduct examinations in country districts. In New South Wales during the last four years over 90,000 applications for war pensions have been received and dealt with. The war pensions now current number 67,000, and represent an annual liability of £1,925,000. This work has been dealt with in addition to the ordinary work of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Branch. Over 50,000 old-age and invalid pensions are current in New South Wales, representing an annual expenditure of£1,970,000. We have altogether 117,000 war pensions and invalid and old-age pensions in New South Wales alone, representing a yearly expenditure of £3,900,000. In addition the Department has to deal with something like 50,000 applications a year for the maternity allowance, involving a further expenditure of about £250,000. They are doing that work now. The machine is absolutely efficient. No matter what duality of Departments is created, it is certain that we cannot better the efficiency now shown by the Pensions Department in New South Wales. That being so,  is  there any necessity to create a second edition of the present Department? Every honorable member has had experience of the Repatriation Department generally, and my experience is not at all a happy one. You send your letter along, and you may get an acknowledgment, or you may not. Even if the matter is finalized, in most cases the member making the representations receives no word from the Department. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The thing is done direct with the applicant, leaving the member who has the matter in hand absolutely in the dark as to what has become of it. We have horrible examples of duality in the State and Federal Taxation Departments and Electoral Departments, and here the Government are creating still another Department to bring about more confusion. It may make jobs for a few more returned soldiers, but I venture to say that the administration of the war pensions under the new system will not be to the benefit of the soldiers themselves. I want to test the feeling of the Committee on this matter. I am not sure that the Committee will welcome the transferring of the war pensions from an already efficient Department to a department not yet created. If the change is made, a certain number of officers should be transferred from the Pensions Department in each State to the Repatriation Commission. If that is not done, it will be the same as with other Repatriation Departments throughout Australia. My idea is to ask the Committee to leave out the whole of clause 22, leaving the Government to withdraw the Bill and redraft it. There is ample power under the War Pensions Act to-day to bring the new schedules into being by means of regulations. As, however, there are provisions in the clause which, perhaps,should be preserved, I shall move, as a test - </para>

                    <para>. -  I intended to propose an amendment which would take precedence of the amendment of the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley).</inline> My idea was to insert at the beginning of the clause the words, " This part of this Act shall be administered by the present Pensions Department." The objection I see to striking out the whole clause is the probable loss of the clauses and schedules relating to an increase in the pensions. I am sure the honorable member for Darling does not desire that. </para>

But honorable members must recollect that there lies upon us an obligation to do a certain amount of work before that happy period arrives. I appeal to honorable members to help us to push through some of the measures so that we may have a longer holiday. To-morrow private members' business will take precedence until the dinner-hour, after which, I understand, grievances will be discussed. I suggest that, in view of the urgency of this measure and of other urgent business to be done before the House takes a holiday, honorable members should forego their grievances to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members had two grievance days recently on the Estimates, I am. only appealing to honorable members to help us tomorrow, and to finish the Repatriation Bill this week. That is a fair request to make in the circumstances, and I make it very earnestly and in the interests of the business of the country. </para>

                            <para>- It was an accident so far as Government members were concerned, but I. do not know of any Opposition member who wished to speak, and was absent when the opportunity arrived. So far as the Committee stage is concerned, I think that when we have disposed of the principle which was being discussed when progress was reported we shall have broken the back of the Bill. I am surprised that the Minister for the Navy after his long experience in Opposition should ask honorable members to abandon their opportunity to air grievances to-morrow. Three weeks ago we had no grievance day, and I do not think we had one six weeks ago- </para>
