                            <para>- That is a very satisfactory state of affairs, taking into consideration the drought conditions which obtain in two of the States. I am hopeful that in a few days we shall be able to announce that the whole amount has been contributed. I would like, however, to say that there must be quite a number of pastoralists and others who have not yet subscribed to this loan, and since part of the wool money has already been made available - that is to say, I believe that it is in the hands of the banks and other financial agencies - I hope they will do so. Although the formal date for the closing of applications has expired, I trust that they will believe that we shall not refuse any money that they are good enough to send along. I do not propose to say to-day whether we shall extend the date of the closing of the loan. I shall Say more on that subject to-morrow; but I make an urgent appeal to all those who are receiving the windfall - for such it is - in the shape of this wool money to send us a good contribution out of it. We need it. There is every reason for congratulation that the people of this country have not yet allowed their sense of what we owe to our soldiers to become dimmed, and that they have again stood nobly to their duty. I sincerely hope that I may be permitted in the course of a day or two to announce that the whole of the loan has been fully subscribed. </para>

Think it would be advisable to urge the Prime Minister to make public announcement on this point especially as regards money to be received from profits under Imperial war contract.

                            <para>- Whatever money is received by way of bonuses on the sales of wool will be in the same category, and carry the same obligations, as any other profits received by the pastoralists. I should think that the pastoralists would not seriously make the proposition that this windfall should escape the taxation which they have cheerfully paid in respect of amounts already received: As to the time when the second half of the wool dividend will be paid, I think the matter has already been stated clearly enough for all purposes. I do not know that the Prime Minister' (Mr: Hughes) could make a more definite announcement. It seems to me to be fairly definite that the money will be forthcoming during the course of the next month. Now that these bountiful rains have come, the graziers of Australia might well' " bank " a little on the future in this and other respects. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to make a correction, and also to state the intention of the Government in regard to the payment of a bounty for the discovery of oil. I find that a statement on the subject which appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> of 14th May last, page 2141, is ambiguous. Honorable members will recollect that the Government originally intended to pay a reward of £10,000 for the discovery of commercial oil on the mainland of Australia. The statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is, however, that " We shall increase the reward offered to those who find oil in payable quantities, either on the mainland, or in New Guinea, or German New Guinea." That is not so. What we propose to do is to increase to £50,000 the reward to those persons who find oil on the mainland of Australia, where our original offer holds good. I wish to make that quite clear, because the Company is being paid for its work in Papua. The offer to pay a reward does not apply where the Company is working. </para>

                            <para>- It is not the practice to answer hypothetical questions, or to announce the policy of the Government in regard to hypothetical positions. I may point out, however, that as this is a question affecting the interpretation of the Constitution, an appeal to the Privy Council will lie only by leave of the High Court. If an application for leave to appeal is made, and is granted, the Commonwealth Government will, of course, consider their position. Speaking broadly, the Government will most jealously guard and protect all the powers of the Commonwealth, and will always endeavour to uphold the most liberal interpretation of the Constitution in regard to those powers. </para>

If so, will the right honorable gentleman inform the House whether honorable members will have an opportunity to ratify the contract before the Commonwealth is committed to it. If the Government are committed to the purchase mentioned, will the Treasurer be good enough to state under what authority the expenditure has been incurred ? </para>

That is the intention, in order that we should be satisfied that each proposal of the kind shall be fair to the returned soldier. The understanding is, fundamentally, that the returned soldier shall not pay more than the market price for anything he purchases with his war gratuity bond. If the honorable member can furnish me with instances in which this has not been carried out, I shall be glad to have them investigated. The sooner the intention of the Government in this regard is given effect to, the better. </para>

                            <para>The information is not available. The British authorities have not adopted the practice of treating each season as a separate business. The wool has been dealt with indiscriminately as it came to hand without the slightest regard to the clip to which it belonged. In all essential respects the four years' operations have been continuous, and must be regarded as one and indivisible. On the grounds of equity as between the various growers there is no objection to this practice. </para>

                        <para>.-Honorable members who were in the first Commonwealth Parliament will remember that when the original Public Service.. Bill was before the House a very long discus-  sion took place in regard to the method df fixing the remuneration of public servants, and the present Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> and I  were active in securing the insertion of a minimum wage clause. Later we took a further step forward, and the Government, of which the Prime Minister and I were members, decided that public servants should have the same right as every other individual in the community to have their claims heard by the Arbitration Court'. This Bill proposes to take from them that right, and to place them in a separate paddock. The Prime Minister proposes to do to the Commonwealth Public Service precisely what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine did when he, as Premier of Victoria, disfranchised State public ser,vants as ordinary electors, and gave them separate representation in the Legislature. This is an attempt to separate the sheep from the goats, and there is no justification for it. Public servants have the same rights as have other sections of the community, but simply because they are not in the employ of private individuals or State Governments, they are to be set  apart  from all other employees. It is true that the Bill proposes to establish an Arbitrator for the Public Service, , but he will not have the same status as a Judge of the Arbitration Court. I know that a large number of cases are pending before the Arbitration Court at the present time, and this proposal to constitute a separate Tribunal may relieve the work of the Court, but I understand that the public servants are practically unanimous :n preferring to remain under the Arbitration Court rather than to pass under the jurisdiction of a separate Arbitrator. I think their objection is sound and logical. The report which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> prepared for the Government and Parliament shows that in 1903 the Commonwealth Public Service comprised 11,374 officers, and the total salary bill was £1,521,000. On the 30th June, 1918, the number of employees had increased to 23,424, and the salary bill to £3,943,000. The explanation is that 'the number of Departments has increased. There was no Works and Railways Department in 1903. </para>

                    <para>Mi-. TUDOR. - That Department, too, has increased. In 1903 the Department of the Treasury employed thirty-four officers; to-day the total is 1,127. Why has this 'increase taken place? Simply because the biggest employing branches of the Treasury are those dealing with taxation. Does any honorable member suggest that they should be wiped out? The employees in the Trade and Customs Department have also increased simply because Quarantine and other subDepartments have been added to it. But the biggest increase has undoubtedly taken place in the Postal Department, which in 1903 contained 10,022 employees, where-  as to-day it numbers 19,500, or nearly double that number. Will anybody affirm that we ought to curtail the activities of the Postmaster-General's Department? I know that some persons hold that public servants are chiefly distinguished by the anxiety they exhibit for the arrival of the luncheon-hour or the knock-off hour. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. So far as my experience of public servants is concerned, such an idea is an entirely erroneous one. I have had the privilege of visiting every Customs House in the Commonwealth from the north of Cairns to Fremantle, and my experience is that the men who are in the employ of the Government are at least the equal, if not the superior, of those who are engaged in private employ. It may be suggested that a member of Parliament is afraid to express views which are antagonistic to public servants, because of the well-organized Public Service vote. But if there be any Parliament in Australia which is free from Public Service influence, it certainly is the Commonwealth Parliament. No member of the National Legislature need fear to express his views of our public servants with the utmost freedom. </para>

                    <para>At the present time no less than four measures dealing with the Commonwealth Public Service are awaiting our consideration. There is the Bill which we are now discussing, the Public Service (Board of Management) Bill, a measure relating to a superannuation scheme, and another dealing with the question of dual furlough. In considering all these measures we. ought to be animated solely by a desire to mete out even-handed justice. We have to ask ourselves whether it is wise to transfer our Commonwealth public servants from the Arbitration Court to another Tribunal upon which a special arbitrator is to adjudicate. </para>

                            <para>- I have never been able to see any valid reason why different treatment should be meted out to our public servants from that which is meted out to any private individuals. In this connexion I may be asked what attitude I shall adopt when the Bill dealing with superannuation comes before us. My reply is that I am prepared to give every private individual the right to contribute to an insurance fund the same proportion of his salary as I am willing to allow a public servant to pay into a superannuation fund. </para>

The scheme embodied in it will be like a snowball - the farther it goes the bigger it will grow. Those who follow closely the proceedings before the Arbitration Court must have noticed the reference which was yesterday made there to the case of the Builders' Labourers. That body is one of the most militant organizations in Australia, and its secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Smith, stated only yesterday that they had been waiting since 1915 to secure an alteration of the award. </para>

                            <para>- It may have been. When men have to wait so long before they can get access to the Court they are likely to become fractious, and to kick over the traces in their desire to obtain a speedier method of settling their grievance. We all know that the Judges of the Arbitration Court are at present working at high pressure in an attempt to dispose of the accumulation of business. Quit© recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke, "who is dealing exclusively with Public. Service cases, sat at night in an endeavour to dispose finally of some of the cases claiming his attention. Only the other day, when I was returning from the Ballarat election, I was a. passenger in the same train as  His  Honour, who had been to Port Augusta and Western Australia in connexion with the railway servants' case. </para>

                    <para>I would like to know why the public servants of the Commonwealth should be treated differently from persons who are in private employ. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> who is a very estimable gentleman, and who was a good officer of the Commonwealth, was always opposed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> our public servants being allowed access to the Arbitration Court. . But because we esteem that gentleman we are not bound to agree with his views. It is quite possible that, to some extent, the difficulties which have arisen in connexion with our Public Service may be due to the number of important offices which are being filled by acting heads. For example, more than four years have elapsed since we had a Public Service Commissioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards</inline> has been acting in that capacity during the whole of that period, and many other positions which have been vacant for a considerable time have not yet been permanently filled. I remember once working for an employer who was generally regarded as a model man. Everybody whom I met outside described him as a "fine boss," and I was frequently assured by people that they had never met his equal. My reply was, "Did you ever work for him?" That makes all the difference. In much the same way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> as Public Service Commissioner, might have been a very different man to a member of Parliament from what he was to the public servants who had to work under him. </para>

                                says that the Arbitration Court " has found the greatest difficulty in following the intricacies of Public Service organization, with the result that awards have been productive of many anomalies and inconsistencies." I suppose that public servants, being human, do not fail to point out any " anomalies and inconsistencies " that they find, just as members of Parliament would under similar circumstances. If a Judge had to fix the parliamentary salary instead of our fixing it for ourselves, and he made the amount in New South Wales different from that in Victoria, and so forth, I think we should take precisely the same attitude as that taken up by the public servants.

                    <para class="block">Of course, I do not know what happens in the Public Service in this regard, but I know what happens in outside employment. Foremen on buildings are members of the same unions as the men, and this was the case, for example, when those fine buildings facing Lonsdale-street were erected by day labour for the Melbourne Hospital. The clerk of works on these buildings was the  president  of the . Bricklayers Union, and also the  president  of the Building Trades Federation of Victoria. When I worked in a mill the foremen were members of the same unions as the men, and they reaped the reward of any advantages which the men obtained through their organization. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> thinks that a public servant, because he is in a higher position, ought not to be a member of a union of which those below him are members. I may say that the public servants deny that recognition of public service associations "has resulted in reduced efficiency and a slackening of discipline in a Department," or that " those conditions have been accentuated by controlling officers joining the same unions as their subordinates." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> proceeds - </para>

Are letter-carriers, who deliver letters to bricklayers or coal-miners, not earning their living just as much as are those bricklayers and coal-miners? I do not know that many of the Public Service organizations are affiliated with outside labour unions, but, however that may be, we have no right to restrain them from affiliating. </para>

                            <para>- I have not said anything against the gentleman personally. But, no doubt, the public servants will be able to look after themselves. I recall that at a smoke social of Customs officials I once remarked that I was aware that under our Public Service laws departmental officers were prohibited from taking part in political matters. I reminded those present that, while opium was a prohibited import the Chinese in Australia, who wanted to smoke opium, did not seem to be effectively prevented from doing so. I have not the slightest doubt that public servants, who so desire, do take an interest in politics; and, of course, we have no right to separate them from the general body of the public in this respect. </para>

All that is required to meet the present situation is to appoint more  Deputy  Judges, so that the Public Service cases now awaiting consideration may be speedily dealt with.

                    <para>I take it that Commonwealth servants will have no opportunity or right of going before the industrial peace tribunals, but I do not know that definitely. The trouble is that numbers of public servants do not know exactly where they stand, or under what body or award - if any - they may benefit. Employees connected with the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, for example, do not know where they are. I have a file of correspondence before me which emphasizes that point. I wrote to the manager for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers on. 27th July as follows: - </para>

I am, however, not clear as to the nature of the claim which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walters</inline> litis put before you. Apparently he is claiming certain benefits under an award for temporary clerks; but he was a permanent employee of this line, and, as such, received all the benefits which accrue to the permanent members of the staff. You will appreciate, therefore, that I experience some difficulty in understanding the claim put forward under the award for temporary clerks. </para>

                        <para>We informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walters</inline> that, in our opinion, ho was not entitled to the benefits for which he was claiming, and in this opinion we were guided by the following facts: - " The employees of this line are in an entirely different position to that of temporary employees in the Commonwealth Service. The latter are employed only for short periods, whereas employees of this line are assured of permanent employment so long as they show themselves capable of carrying out their duties. Further, a temporary clerk is defined in the award of the Temporary Clerks Association as a person temporarily employed as a clerk in clerical work in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, or in the Navy or Defence Departments. " Since the Public Service regulations do not apply to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, we take it that the award governing the service of permanent Government clerks does not apply to the officers of this line." </para>

                    <para>The Bill dealing with the conditions of employment in the Public Service makes provision for an arbitrator. It is the unanimous request of the Service that the Arbitrator should be assisted in his duties by one representative from the officers and one from the Government to be elected jointly by the various Ministers and the Public' Service Board. We feel that if the Arbitrator had the assistance of these officers he would be able to more effectively discharge his duties. </para>
                    <para>In the Arbitration Court of Western Australia the organizations and the employers  have a representative on the bench to assist the Judge. In the Victorian Railways Classification Board, which deals with the conditions of employment of all Victorian railways officers, Judge  Winneke is  assisted by representatives from the Railways Union, and representatives from the Railways Commissioners. The New South Wales Board of Trade, which fixes the living wage for the workers of that State, is similarly constituted. The Federal Basie Wage Commission, which was appointed by the Commonwealth Government, consists of an independent Chairman or Arbitrator, together with representatives from the employees and the employers. This practice is generally followed in Arbitration Court proceedings and Wages Boards throughout the State of Victoria. </para>
                    <para>I agree that the men in the Service .are in a better position to know more of the actual work performed than it is possible for any outside person to know, but. I do not agree with the suggested method of appointing the Government's nominee. No doubt Cabinet would be guided by the Public Service Board provided for in another Bill, but Ministers themselves should make the choice. I  hope  the Government will give consideration to the suggestion for the appointment of  assesors.  so that the- Arbitrator may be able to inform himself in the best possible way by securing the expert advice of assessors as to the conditions applying in the Public Service. In my opinion, provision should be made in the Bill prescribing that award rates will be payable to only members of organizations, which bodies are put to a great deal of expense in fighting arbitration cases. At the present time the Victorian Railways Union are fighting a case at Spencer-street, and the letter carriers are fighting another case before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke in the Arbitration Court. It is unjust to them that any person who chooses to stand outside an organization, not contributing a penny to the cost of fighting a case, should reap any of the advantages gained. We are told by the Treasurer that if people do .not give voluntarily to the Peace Loan they will be compelled to contribute, on the ground that they have gained advantages through the efforts of our men who went overseas to fight. The unions take up the same attitude in regard to arbitration proceedings, and contend that only the members of those organizations who fight their cases through the Court should obtain the benefit of any increases awarded. I regret exceedingly that it has been found necessary to bring in this Bill. I trust the Government will still consider the advisability of appointing one Judge to get all these arbitration cases out of the way, and so deal with the Public Service exactly as other members of the community are treated. The Public Service to-day cannot be said to be a place that is attracting and keeping those persons who used to  flock to it in the past. I know that for years when telegraphists were wanted in Queensland they had to be sent from Victoria and other States. Victorian boys who passed the entrance examination for the Service would receive a communication to this effect : " Are you willing to take service in New South Wales, Queens- land, or Tasmania (,as the case might be) ? If so, you can be given an appointment there&gt; whereas if you wait until your turn comes here, the chances are that you will not be appointed at all." They were also told that they would be kept in the State to which they were appointed for a certain number of years, and then they " might " obtain a transfer back to Victoria. Many boys whom I knew personally have gone in that way to other States. </para>

                            <para>- The point I was making was that it was easy enough to get a transfer from Victoria to Queensland, but very difficult to get a transfer back from Queensland to Victoria. Perhaps that is what the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> was thinking of. The position to-day is that, within six months, according to an answer given recently to the honorable member  for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Blakely),  over 1,000 employees have left the Public Service because they could do better outside. If we are to have an efficient and first-class Service we must improve the conditions which we have to offer.

                            <para>- The revenue is, perhaps, £24,000,000 now, largely owing to the inflation of values, a condition which is apparently likely to last for some time, and owing also to the fact that we are importing some things which we ought to be producing in Australia. Whatever the revenue may be, the Minister, for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will agree that we must have efficient men in the Department to value the imports. We must have good men, and we must make the Service sufficiently attractive to keep those who are in it. There is no party politics about that question at all. If this  Bill will tend to create a discontented Service we shall not do wisely to pass it in its present shape. We must keep the best men in the Service, and we must have a good Service, because without it the wheels of the Commonwealth will not run as smoothly as they otherwise would. 1 regret that the Bill has been brought forward, but, as it has been, I trust that we shall be able to amend it in Committee in such a way that it will give* greater satisfaction to that body of men who do such good work for the Commonwealth, that is, the public servants of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- If the statements upon which presumably this measure is founded are to be taken literally, then we want something very much more drastic than this proposal. If, as we are given to understand, the Public Service is suffering from an incapacity to do work, and an inordinate desire to increase its remuneration, if it suffers also from what, to my mind, is the most serious offence of all, disloyalty to the Government and to its superior officers, then the mere appointment of an Arbitrator will not mend the situation a.t all. </para>

                    <para>While it is the fashion to throw stones at public servants, just as it is the fashion to throw somewhat bigger ones at members of- Parliament, I must confess that throughout the whole of my experience I have not found the bulk of the public servants of the Commonwealth one whit less conscientious or capable than men of similar occupation and rank of life outside. I have seen a good deal of the Public Service in one way or another during the years I have been in this House, and <inline font-style="italic">.1</inline> confess my inability to discover any deterioration of the wholesale character that has been attributed to it. There are, no doubt, in the Service, as everywhere else, individuals who are anything but a credit to it, and it is one of the defects of the system that w© have not had a more direct and effective method of dealing with the waster who may have got into the Service in some fashion or other, or who may have developed, after entering the Service, certain defects of character that were not obvious when he first came into it. It is, I know, exceedingly difficult to get rid of  such  individuals. There are some of them about. I have come across two or three of them in my experience, and I have always regretted that there was not a summary method of taking them by the scruff of the neck and throwing them out. That is a matter which I think the bulk of the  public servants would be very glad to see improved, because they do not want to  be  disgraced by the average waster. The majority of them want to do their work  in  a way that will be satisfactory to their own consciences, and creditable to the country and to the Service as a whole. If there are any individuals in the Service who come under the category of " slackers," I do not think they are to  be  found among those who have gone through the usual channels of appointment by examination and promotion by merit. There are at the present time in the Public Service, as we all know, a good many individuals who came in by "back doors" or "side door's" of various kinds during the war. There are a good many of them still in the Service who are simply keeping their positions comfortably for themselves, with very little advantage to the country. The sooner they are got rid of, and the Service goes back to what I might' call the standard official, the better it will be for the country. There has been gross abuse of the power by which these casuals have been brought into the Service, especially during the course of the war. One appointment after another has been made of individuals whose qualifications were more than doubtful, and whose recommendations to those positions were such as could not always creditably be made public. As to the Service as a whole, I have every reason to believe that to-day as good work is being done by the public servant as ever, and if there are any troubles, as we know there are, the public servants themselves are not entirely to blame for them. There has been general unrest throughout the community, and the public servants have to some extent been affected by it. The fundamental trouble as regards the Service is that, whilst salaries were rising outside, they were not accompanied by corresponding increases within. I believe that is at the bottom of nearly all the trouble we have had with the public servants during the past few years. The heads, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> and those under him, have not observed the repeated increase in pay that has gone on outside, or, if they have, they have not considered themselves justified in following it up in the case of the public servants. Hence they became dissatisfied, and naturally appealed to the Arbitration Court, with the result that they obtained substantial increases which we have every reason to believe were justified on the evidence. If there has been confusion - and undoubtedly there has - concerning the various awards, this surely is not the fault of the public servants. Of course, they would all like their remuneration and conditions of employment to be on a uniform basis, and the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has made a very practical suggestion to this end, namely, that the whole of the arbitration work in connexion with the Public Service should be undertaken by one Judge. If this course were adopted, I feel sure that much of the confusion resulting from what appear to be inconsistent decisions will be brought to an end. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but under the present Act they are decisions by a Court of justice, and under this Bill they may be determinations of a person to be appointed, and I submit that much greater danger may be apprehended from bringing a determination of an Arbitrator before Parliament for review than from submitting a decision of a Court of Arbitration. I contend, therefore, that until more justification is shown for the change it would be better to adhere to the [present system. We are sanctioning a good' many experiments in connexion with the Public Service generally. We have introduced certain Tribunals, we are going to have a Board of Control, and in this measure we propose to appoint an Arbitrator. I feel sure that if we dispense with the proposed Arbitrator and vest control in a well-chosen Board, supported by an efficient Court of Arbitration, the position will be much simplified, the Service will be more contented, and the position generally from the public point of view will be much more satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to offer my strongest opposition to this measure. I do not know how the members of the Public Service voted at the last election, but I -do know that a Public Service candidate who opposed me was very badly beaten. This proposal was strongly opposed on a former occasion by the party now in power, and after a considerable amount ' of discussion the then Labour Government decided to place the Public Service under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, for the  reason that members of the Public Service really occupy the same position as ordinary citizens. If it were otherwise; if we lay it down as a principle that there must be a distinction between members of the Public Service and ordinary citizens, we might as well provide separate gaols for public servants convicted of crime, and even separate burying grounds when they go hence. But in a democratic community such as ours there should be no distinctions at all. The people eat together, they .drink together, they sing together, and they marry. All salaries should be based on the same conditions of service. The public servants do not claim to be the darlings of the Commonwealth, and only ask to be fairly dealt with. If it is not the intention of the Government to mete out justice to; them by adequately remunerating them for the work they are performing, the Government will have to shoulder the blame. Why do not the Government allow the public servants to continue to have their cases heard in the Arbitration Court as the members of other organizations are allowed to do? There should be no distinction between those who are employed in the Commonwealth Public Service and those who are performing similar duties elsewhere. It is our desire to have an. efficient and contented service, and unless we have that it will be impossible for the Government to receive a fair return for the expenditure incurred. A Bill of this character would never have been introduced if the Labour party had been returned, because a Labour Government would legislate on democratic lines. Th Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> says that the Bill emanated from Mr:. McLachlan's report. </para>

                            <para>- Does the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> think that I am so blind or so stupid that I cannot see that the Government are endeavouring to introduce something in&gt; place of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> recommendation? The Government have not the1 courage to do what they know to <inline font-style="italic">la»</inline> right. I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),.</inline> who said" that the present congestion and difficulty in the Arbitration Court could be overcome by appointing an additional Judge to deal with Public Service cases. It would be preferable for the public servants to have their cases heard by a Judge possessing a knowledge of outside conditions, because he would be in a position, to compare the conditions prevailing in the Service with those outside. A specialist is not required, and surely honorable members will admit that it would be desirable, taking into consideration the manner in which Australia is propressing and the Public Service expanding, that all similar callings and occupations should be dealt with by the one Court. I would prefer to see the public servants compelled to join outside organizations. I had many opportunities of joining the Public Service, but refrained from doing so, because it did not offer sufficient inducements to men of culture and ability. This measure will not be the means of making the Service so attractive that capable and intelligent men will be encouraged to join it. I do not know whether it is too late for -the Government to withdraw the Bill, but I sincerely hope they will do so, and introduce a measure to increase the number of Judges, and allow the public servants to continue to approach the Arbitration Court in the ordinary way. The Government, by this Bill, are making undesirable class distinctions when they should be doing all in their power to create solidarity and harmony. If the Bill will be the means of giving public servants privileges that others do not enjoy, or of depriving, them of advantages which others possess, its effects will be very detrimental. I believe it will create dissension and distrust, and I can only repeat that it has been introduced because the public servants supported the present Government. If that is the case the public servants are now being punished. If the Bill has been introduced to assist in keeping this Government in power.  it is not in the interests of good government. </para>

                            <para>- There are many other matters to which the Parliament might more profitably devote its time instead of discussing a measure which will have the  effect  of creating a class distinction as between public servants and the general body of workers. Some beads of Departments do not approve of public servants having the right to go ' to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the redress of their grievances. They think that they would' be able, so to speak, to " pull the leg " of an Arbitrator appointed to deal only with Public Service matters. The Ministerial party went to the country with the cry that they were out to secure economy; yet we have them proposing here to create a new Department. The Arbitrator for which this Bill provides will require a registrar, a chief clerk, a second clerk, and also a Couple qf messengers - one to deliver his letters, and the other to open the door and hang up his coat for him. He will  require  a staff of officers; so that this Bill will really lead to the creation of a new Department for the expenditure upon which there can be no justification. The </para>

                    <para class="block">Country party have also declared themselves in favour of economy, and that being so I find it difficult to understand on what grounds they are prepared to vote for this measure. Something like thirty-five years ago, the -late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, in reply to a deputation, which made a very modest request to him, said, " I do not know where this is going to end. 'In the name of goodness, do not ask me to create another new department!" Public Departments since then have grown enormously. I am satisfied that this is not an honest attempt to deal with public servants as they deserve to be dealt with. It is merely a' measure to please those who object to public servants having the right to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. There are some heads of Departments who desire to keep the control of their staffs entirely in their own hands. Some public servants who are not allowed to appeal to the Court have been very badly treated, and this Bill will merely afford another opportunity for the treatment of public servants in a way to which I am sure the outside public object. The Bill will not add a penny to the revenue, or promote the progress of Australia. It will not reduce the cost of living, or serve any other useful purpose. Instead of being asked to deal with it, we should be invited to consider more substantial measures such as a Bill relating in the finances of Australia. A measure of that kind would lead to permament  prosperity, and secure for us the blessings of the people. </para>
                    <para>I am one of those who anticipated that proposals of this kind would be brought down by the present Government. Many of the electors refused to accept my advice, and they are being punished to-day for their failure to do so. This Bill is hot in the best interests of Australia. We should endeavour to encourage the belief that public servants are on the same footing that other workers occupy. I do not indorse much that is said to the detriment of public servants. I know that many of them are as faithful as are any men in private employment. I supported the Bill which enabled public servants to go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, believing that whether a man was employed by the Crown, by a. municipality, or by a private  employer,  he should have the right to appeal to that Court. Can any one tell me why the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government propose that there shall be an Arbitrator to deal specially with the grievances of public servants? Some people will probably say that the Bill is merely brought forward to find a job for some one. When a party is in power it certainly does not look after its political e opponents. One of the foundation planks in the platform of our party is, " Equal opportunity for all," and I hope that Ministerial supporters will not be so far forgetful of their responsibilities as representatives of the people as to disregard that cardinal principle. Under this Bill, a young man who has entered the Public Service will be debarred from approaching the Concilia-1 tion and Arbitration Court, while his brother, who is in private employment, will be able to do so. Why should such a distinction be made? In these enlightened days when practically every one' can read and write,- a measure of this kind is an insult to the intelligence of the community. I do not know who is to receive the appointment of Arbitrator under the Bill, but there will be as many applicants for the position as there are persons seeking admission to a music hall every evening. The Government should not proceed further with this Bill. No private citizen would father it. </para>

                    <para>I do not know much about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> but I do know that when he was Public Service Commissioner it was the idea of the party opposite that he should be regarded as the great panjandrum and autocrat of the Public Service, who should be the only person entitled to decide any question affecting employees of that Service. Honorable members opposite were opposed to the Labour party when they introduced the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill, but now, apparently, they are in  favour  of arbitration of some kind for the members of the Public Service, possibly because of the congestion in the Arbitration Court. If I were a supporter of the Government I should long ago have demanded to know why they did not appoint an extra <inline font-style="italic">Judge to</inline> relieve the Judges of the Arbitration Court. Unfortunately, there is not a strong man in the Government at the present time if I except the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who, I believe, is much stronger in this House dealing with the Opposition than he is outside this House when dealing with the officers of his Department. This Bill is not based- on any sound principle, and its operation might possibly be absolutely dangerous to the public servants. On these grounds, as a public man and a representative of the people, I feel that I shall be justified in offering all the opposition I can to it. I see no reason why members of the Public Service should be treated differently from other members of the community. The Arbitration Court, that is intrusted with the settlement of the conditions of. employment of professional men, journalists, mechanics, and wharf labourers should also be intrusted with the settlement of the conditions of the public servants. No reason has been advanced to show that public servants should be asked to go for redress of their grievances to a special Arbitrator. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a Bill with which we can deal more effectively in Committee. I cannot agree with what has' been said by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West).</inline> There are certain aspects of employment in the Commonwealth Public Service which, I think, should be brought under the notice of the House. We have recently been considering the question of conciliation and arbitration as applied to the settlement of the conditions of employment of all classes in Australia. The desire underlying all our legislation of this character should be for the settlement of industrial disputes in as amicable a fashion as possible. In speaking on the Industrial Peace Bill  the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> expressed himself as in favour of a system which would enable the. parties to an industrial dispute to avoid going to a- Court for its settlement. In my view, the establishment of Conciliation Boards or Arbitrators to deal with disputes in various industries and in the Commonwealth Public Service, without recourse to Court proceedings, would be a step in, the fight direction. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Members of the Public Service are aware of the great difficulty experienced in getting to the Arbitration Court. Whilst the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> suggested that that could be overcome by the appointment of more Judges, the difficulty today confronting the Public Service is that too many Judges have dealt with their cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke have each made .conflicting awards in dealing with Public Service cases. It should not be forgotten that the Commonwealth Public Service finds employment for a greater number of persons than does any other institution in Australia, and the whole of the time of one Judge or Arbitrator might be devoted to the consideration of difficulties arising in connexion with the Service. </para>
                    <para>Prior to the .passing of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act of 1911 we had a discontented  Service.  The Public Service Commissioner had then absolute control. Boards of Inquiry and Appeal were provided for, but the Public Service Commissioner had the right, to decide whether an employee should be given the right to appeal, and when an appeal was granted it was only from  Cæsar  unto  Cæsar,  which never took the public servants anywhere. Under the old system, when an appeal was granted it was to a man who, in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred, quashed the complaint. In 1911 the Government of the day gave the right to the public servants to go to the Arbitration Court, but they have felt that they have 'been retarded in their efforts to get to the Court. One disadvantageous result of the right then given them has been that the heads of branches in the Public Service have been obliged to join the associations in the Service. I do not see how it can be considered a good thing that the head of a branch in the Public Service should be placed in' such a position that he may be called before the authorities of his association to know why he did a certain thing. That is bound to lower the efficiency of the Service. The head of a branch in the Public Service may be called before the executive of his association, and may be expelled from it for having carried out certain action, and if he is expelled he is deprived of the advantage of any award by the Court, since awards are applicable only to members of the associations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> has said that it is advisable that every member of the Public Service should belong to an association within the Service, but whilst I agree with that, the head of a branch should not be liable to be summoned to appear before men serving under  him to know why he did or did not do a certain thing. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether it will or not. I can mention one award of the Public Service Arbitration Court which has certainly not tended to efficiency in the Service. The Court made an award which had the effect that a. post-office earning a certain revenue should be in charge of an officer of a certain grade and salary. Under this award, as soon as the revenue of the post-office is increased to a certain amount, the officer responsible for the increase is moved to another place, because the salary paid to him is not, according to the award, sufficiently high for the office in view of the increased revenue derived from it. The result of that award by the Arbitration Court has certainly not been to increase the efficiency of the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>

Having had twenty years' knowledge of the Public Service, I can speak on this question with some authority, especially as I have been closely connected with associations in the Public Service, and for eight years was secretary of one of the biggest associations in the Service. The delay in getting to the Court has been one of the greatest troubles. It is stated that the appointment of a greater number of Judges would overcome that difficulty, but I have already pointed out that that might only accentuate the trouble, and make for a discontented Service. If one inquired of the first 100 Commonwealth public servants he met, he would probably be provided with 100 different proposals for overcoming the difficulties of the Service. </para>

                            <para>- If it will lead to industrial peace within the Public Service, it certainly is necessary. I have mentioned that the honorable member for Wentworth suggested that better results in promoting industrial peace would probably be achieved if employers and employees could meet under conditions that would be as far as possible removed from any appearance of Court proceedings, and could hear evidence when lawyers and others were not present, who might make witnesses nervous. I met a deputation of Commonwealth public servants yesterday who told me that one award had cost them something like £1,400. If justice is to be done to members of the Commonwealth Public Service, they should not be called upon to pay any such price for an arbitration award. They should be able to get that without retaining lawyers and without having to resort to a Court at a cost of hundreds of pounds. Let us give to all employees, inside and outside the Service, easy access to some tribunal, so that they may get justice quickly and cheaply. </para>

                            <para>- That might be advisable if there were any likelihood of getting a united opinion from the associations, but that is not probable. As secretary, I convened a meeting of a council of organizations in New South Wales, but on not one matter did the council arrive at a consolidated opinion. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> hit the nail on the head when he said that there is a certain amount of class distinction in the Service. Yesterday an officer asked me why we did not appoint a Judge and two assessors to deal with all Public Service cases. I asked him who he would select as the assessor for the public servants. I pointed out that the General Division, being the largest numerically, would have a preponderating vote, and its delegate would be selected. The clerical officers would not be satisfied with such a choice, whilst if the selected man were a clerical officer the Professional and General Divisions would be dissatisfied. </para>

                            <para>- The principal cause of the trouble is the existence of different awards as to the living wage in various parts of the Commonwealth, and the fact that the Commonwealth takes no cognisance of any awards by a State Arbitration Court. In New South Wales the basic wage has been fixed at £3 18s. per week, but the Commonwealth will not recognise it. If the basic wage in New South Wales is £3 18s., and the basic wage in Victoria is £3 9s., and the Commonwealth raises the salaries of its servants in those. States to the minimum, the man in New South Wales becomes senior to the man in Victoria who is doing the same class of work. Seniority in the Service is always determined by the salary which an officer receives. A man who enters the Service to-day at £400 per annum becomes senior to a man who has been in the Service for twenty years, but is receiving only £300. </para>

                            <para>- For promotion to any vacant position throughout the Service. When the Commonwealth took over certain services from the States, it was laid down that the transferred officers should take with them their accrued and existing rights. That undertaking has not been honoured in regard to certain rights that were enjoyed by officers transferred from the New South Wales State Service. For instance, after twenty years in the State Service an officer is entitled to six months' furlough, and for every additional five years of service a further six weeks' fur- lough. Thus, a man who has been thirty years in the New South Wales Service is entitled to nine months' leave on full pay. That accrued right is not being conceded by the Commonwealth. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> said that he was opposed to coddling the Commonwealth public servants and giving them benefits that are not enjoyed by employees outside the Service. It is true that public servants are entitled to certain benefits not conferred upon persons in private employment, amongst them being sick leave, annual recreation leave, and long-service leave. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and I would like to see the same benefits extended to employees outside the Public Service. Every man who is working hard for his living is entitled to an annual holiday. At the same time, I think everybody knows that a Government employee is restricted in a way that private employees are not. I know of men in private employment in New South Wales who are able to earn a little extra money by night engagements, such as contributing musical items. In the Government Service earnings of that kind are forbidden. </para>

                            <para>- The present Arbitration Court gives awards which are binding on the Commissioner, but there is continual fighting as to what interpretation is to be placed on them. I have known an award to be interpreted in three different ways. If there were a permanent Arbitrator for the Public Service any controversial point in an award could be referred to him, and he would declare straightway what he meant. At the present time the Department, the Public Service Commissioner, and the employees may each take a different view of an award, and the only means of getting a definite interpretation is by resorting again to. the Court. That trouble would be avoided by the appointment of an Arbitrator, who would have his own Department. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. He should be a man who will be bound not so much by legal considerations as by the dictates of common sense. This measure seems to me to offer a means of bringing about industrial peace in the Commonwealth Service. The more we can get away from the atmosphere of a Court of law the better it will be. It will remove that feeling of restraint which members of unions have when they appear before a Judge. If we can establish in connexion with all industries non-legal Tribunals for the settlement of disputes we shall be conferring a benefit upon the whole community. If, for instance, the Government could appoint a man well acquainted with the iron industry to arbitrate in all disputes in relation to it they would be justified in doing so. In America the big industries have their systems of internal arbitration. In the big Ford Motor Works all complaints and grievances are dealt with by small Tribunals created within the works. We should adopt a similar system in Australia. In connexion with the coalmining industry in New South Wales, a Special Tribunal has been already created, and, although it is outside the Arbitration Act, nobody will deny that it is a wise innovation. I hope this Bill will promote industrial peace in the Public Service. If we can secure industrial peace in that Service by the appointment of an Arbitrator it will be a step in the right direction. </para>

The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has referred to the Tribunal which dealt with the mining industry last week. May I remind him that the employees in that industry are not a registered body under the Arbitration Act, whereas our public servants are. What is more they desire to continue under the Act so that their position is entirely different from that of the men to whom he referred. The honorable member further stated that there is no unanimity among the different sections of our Public Service in regard to this Bill. From information which honorable members have received we know that there is a disposition on the part of a very large number of them to remain under the Arbitration Act. I well remember that When our public servants banded together for the purpose of dealing with the differences which might arise between themselves and the heads of Departments they were told by this Parliament, " If you have difficulties which you desire to remedy, you must adopt the same method as is adopted by every other industrial body. You must go to the Arbitration Court." It was the deliberate act of this Parliament which forced our public servants to go to that Tribunal. Having compelled them to go there, the Government now propose to drag them away from it, much against their will. </para>

                            <para>- I do not quite understand it either. Under this Bill, the Government will select the Arbitrator who is to be appointed.  They may, of course, select the' best" man possible, but on the other hand they may select a man who the public servants may consider possesses a bias against their organization. Our public servants do not know who he will be, but they do know that under present conditions they must go before certain Justices of the Arbitration Court. This Parliament has already decided to appoint additional Judges in order to relieve the congestion of business in that Court. Seeing that we have enacted audi legislation it is very doubtful whether there will be sufficient work forthcoming to keep the Arbitration Court, the Tribunals to be appointed under the Industrial Peace Bill, and this Special Arbitration Court for public servants fully occupied. It is quite possible that in the near future there will be very little work for the Arbitration Court to do. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If that means be adopted there will be less work for the Arbitration Court to do. But we must always have at least three permanent Judges sitting in that Court. Is it wise, therefore, for us to make the departure that is proposed in this Bill, especially in view of the fact that our public servants do not approve of it ? The honorable member for Parkes has stated that there is no ' unanimity amongst them in regard to this matter. In reply to his contention let me quote the following paragraph from a letter, a copy pf which has been forwarded to every member of this Parliament : - </para>

                        <para> As public servants we do not admit the right of the Government to remove us from the Arbitration Court. We consider we are workers in the same  sense  as all employees in concerns outside of the Public Service, and as such demand the same Court or other such body as may be established from time to time to deal with any matters connected with our employment. We, however, are forced to conclude that the Government is determined to take this course of action, and we are consequently obliged to direct our energies to securing such a Bill as will provide fair and equitable means of dealing with such matters when they are submitted to the Arbitrator. </para>

When the head of any union speaks he does so on behalf of its members. Consequently, I assume that the men whose names I have quoted speak on behalf of their respective organizations. Here is another letter, dated August, 1920, which says - </para>

                        <para>The Bill dealing with the conditions of employment in the Public Service makes provision for an Arbitrator. It is the unanimous request of the Service that the Arbitrator should be assisted in his duties by one representative from the officers and one from the Government, to be elected jointly by the various Ministers and the Public Service Board. We feel that if the Arbitrator had the assistance of these officers he would be able more effectively to discharge his duties. </para>

                    <para>There is a good deal to be said in favour of that view. I do not care whether he be a Judge or a layman - it is impossible for any single individual to possess the qualifications necessary to enable him to have a proper grip of the conditions which obtain in all our huge public Departments But if he has upon the Bench assisting him men who possess a fair share of that knowledge, very much better decisions will be forthcoming than would otherwise be the case. The honorable member for Parkes stated that arbitration awards have worked injuriously so far as postmasters are concerned. I may be wrong, but I am under the impression that prior to any awards being made by the Arbitration Court, a similar state of affairs obtained. I have had many cases brought under my notice in which a certain revenue has been forthcoming from a particular post-office. A postmaster has been appointed to that office, and by his diligence and constant attention to duty has increased the volume of business passing through it, with the result that the revenue has correspondingly increased. Then it has been found that his classification did not entitle him to fill the position which he was holding, and he has been transferred elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly . There are many good men in the Service who have immensely increased the revenue from post-offices to which they have been appointed, and who, as a reward, have been transferred. Upon being removed to fresh localities they naturally say, "It is not to my advantage to improve the position of this post-office, otherwise it will get beyond my classification, and I shall be again removed." That is the position which obtained before the Arbitration Court was created. It is a question of classification which is involved, and I think that the honorable member for Parkes will recognise that. </para>

                    <para>In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan's</inline> criticism of public servants, when he states that they are disloyal and inefficient, he may have some isolated cases in mind, but my own belief is that our public servants are intensely loyal to their Departments, and render most efficient service to the Commonwealth. If there are any men in this country who have reason to complain of their "treatment it is our public servants. During the past five or six years of war conditions, no end of additional work has been imposed upon them. Yet they have never complained. They have done that work without any extra remuneration apart from the payment of a small bonus, and yet we are now told that they are disloyal to their Departments. Take the case of the postal officials. Many postmasters in various parts of Australia are to-day performing double the work that they were required to perform ten years ago. As the result of legislation which this Parliamentenacted, they now have to attend to matters connected with the payment of old-age and invalid pensions, not to mention a number of other matters. Nobody can estimate the amount of money which passed through our post-offices during the war period for the purpose of paying the allotments made to the relatives of soldiers who were absent in the fighting line. Upon top of all this additional work, postmasters were obliged to change their system of keeping their books and accounts. I know of postmasters who have almost broken down as the result of carrying out their duties during the past five or six years, and I have not hesitated to raise my voice in this Parliament upon their behalf. The cost of living has gone up enormously in the last few years, and if an inquiry were held to-morrow it would be found that the increases of salary in the Public Service have not risen in proportion. This affords further ground for complaint. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but the decisions of the Court have not been in keeping with the increased cost of living. The attitude of the public servants only displays their loyalty to the Government and to the country, and we ought to be proud of them. I have in my mind at least four or five men who have practically broken down in health through the excessive work imposed upon them during the war period, and servants who work like this for their country are worthy of some consideration. I do not at all agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> in his wholesale condemnation of the public servants. We are told that there are something like thirty cases awaiting hearing in the Arbitration Court; but that is no reason, if the men are satisfied with the present Court, why we should appoint an Arbitrator, and create another Tribunal. There ought to be no distinction made between one set of employees and another; the public servants should not be given different treatment from that afforded to men in other callings, but should be able to take full advantage of the Court as constituted. </para>

                            <para>- The numerical strength of a union is not the point. If there are 50,000 men in a particular organization, and in five years they increase to 100,000 men, the claims that come before the Court are not increased, for the same process serves whatever the number may be. If, instead of sectional unions, all the men were embraced in a large union, there would be fewer claims still. I see no necessity for the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I should be sorry to say anything that might have the effect of creating industrial unrest or breaking down the present harmony of any employees' organizations, whether in the Public Service or outside. It seems to me, however, that at present there is a tendency on the part of Parliament to unnecessarily create new Departments; indeed, I have noticed that tendency in operation since this House assembled after the elections. The great bulk of the electors outside, who have had to bear the burden of the war, and are now called upon - and are responding very willingly - to find the money to fulfil our obligations to the soldiers, will not, I am afraid, submit to this increase in the public expenditure  for  long. Every day we read in the newspapers that this Parliament should, as far as possible, economize  in  every direction. The Country party and. others were returned pledged to economy, and it is undoubtedly essential that economy should be practised, or the patience of the people, who have contributed splendidly to the present loan, will become exhausted in the near future. I do not desire to pit my experience against that of older members, but whether a man has been in the House for three months or three years, he cannot fail to have observed- that one danger ahead is this .tendency to unnecessarily create new Departments. During the last week or two we have had much discussion here on arbitration and conciliation and industrial matters generally, and there is no doubt that the destruction of our present arbitration system is involved - that has been the undercurrent throughout the debates. In this Bill we have another attempt to remove from the Arbitration Court a large body of men who do not approve of the step. Why should this new Department be created if the public servants deliberately declare that they are satisfied to work under the present conditions? It has been truly said that if the Government desire to relieve the present congestion in the Court, even a school boy could tell them that the proper plan is to appoint new Judges or deputies, and preserve the existent machinery. It is regrettable to me to have, to oppose measures introduced by the Government, as I have had to do once or twice lately, but I should fail in my duty as a representative of the people if I did not take a firm stand on such an important matter as the unnecessary expenditure of the public money. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> made a very weak attempt to justify this Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I have never been able to understand, or see any justification for, Governments making laws in respect of private employers and employees, and being unwilling at the same time to include themselves and their employees within the scope of the same set of laws. It is an inconsistency. There are laws' made for compulsory observance by private individuals, but the Government which has made those laws is unprepared to apply them to itself and to those whom it employs. Concerning the question whether any proof is forthcoming that the main body of our public servants do not desire to be withdrawn from the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, I hold in my hand a document which represents the indorsement of that view by 30,000 public servants. Not only has the subject-matter of this document come before the executives of the various associations concerned, but it has been considered and ap-proved also by the branches themselves. This memorandum was drawn up after due consideration, and, as. I have said, has received branch, as well as executive, indorsement. It will be well for the Government, and honorable members generally, to heed the requests of this considerable body of public officials who desire to secure and retain no more than their just dues.

                            <para>- That is not so, for in this Bill the .Government proposes to take to itself more direct control over the Arbitrator than it has ever had, or pro- ' posed to hold, over a Judge of the Arbitration Court. The Bill provides machinery for the re-appointment of the Arbitrator after a given number of years. It is only natural that, in such circumstances, the Arbitrator would be influenced to some extent by the consideration of his re-appointment. It is desirable that members of the Public Service should be placed in exactly the same position as ordinary " outside " employees who may desire to approach the Arbitration Court - a Tribunal which is absolutely impartial, is subject to no influence by the Government, and does not think, and would not think, of attempting to win favour with the Government by the nature of its judgments. </para>

                            <para>- As the Bill' is now  framed the Arbitrator may be regarded actually as a public servant. It is provided, for example, that he shall receive all the advantages accruing to an ordinary public servant in the matter of length of service. The position of a Judge of .the Arbitration Court is one of independence. He can be influenced in no way by the Government of the day. Can the same be said of the Arbitrator to be  appointed under the Bill? In such circumstances it is obvious that before ever the members of the Public Service enter this new Arbitration Court, now to be imposed upon them, they may have their minds prejudiced. It is not desirable that we should set up a medium of arbitration in respect of which those who are to be compelled to  approach  it for the settlement of their claims will be prejudiced against their Judge. I emphasize that the public servants desire to remain where they are, within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. They desire to retain the right to approach that tribunal just as freely and exactly in the same manner as ordinary private employees. Their circumstances, in the matters of wages, hours, and working conditions generally, are' substantially the same as those of private employees. It would be unjust, therefore, to differentiate, by setting up a separate Tribunal for each. </para>

                    <para>There are several provisions of the Bill which require amendment. The Arbitrator is to be given power to determine for himself what evidence he shall accept and what he shall reject. That implies that public servants may not be given opportunities which fairly should be theirs for preparing their case and demonstrating the justice of their claims. To a large extent they may be circumscribed by the views of the adjudicator concerning that which he may deem to be admissible evidence. </para>

                            <para>- I invite the honorable member to study sub-clause 5 of clause 12, which definitely sets forth- the powers of the Arbitrator respecting admission , of evidence.  If the Arbitrator should possess a prejudice against members of a certain branch of the Public Service he could be guilty of a grave injustice by ruling out evidence which they desired to place before him, so, at the same time, prevent-"' ing the public from becoming acquainted with what they considered their just claims. The Bill proposes to give the Arbitrator power to make a common rule in the matter of overtime and with respect to other factors governing working conditions in the Service. Let us suppose that the Letter Carriers' Association is applying to the Arbitrator for an award in respect of working- hours. Without calling evidence from other branches of the Service the Arbitrator might make a "common rule so that the hours scheduled for the letter-carriers would apply to the whole of the Service. If power is to be given for the making of a common rule, the Bill should contain machinery to provide for the whole of the Service expressing itself in the matter of the basis of the proposed common rule. Thus only could injustice be prevented. Another point is that no costs are proposed to be allowed in respect of cases coming before the Arbitrator.. It is to be presumed that evidence tendered on behalf of a Department will not come under that prohibition, but that witnesses for a Department will be paid out of Government funds. That is to say. public money is to be spent on behalf of one side only. In connexion with a Tribunal instituted in South Australia for the adjustment of wages and conditions  applying  to employees in the Railway Service, the wages, and all the expenses of witnesses for both sides, were paid by the Government. When the body which is defending a case is drawing from the .public funds, it is only just that those who are prosecuting the claim should also- have extended to them the privileges given by the Government of South Australia in similar circumstances. Sub-clause 3 of clause 20 provides that before awards shall be deemed to be authorized, they must lie on the table of Parliament for fourteen days, and if Parliament is in recess at the time a determination is arrived at, the award must be placed on the table when it re-assembles. Thus many months may elapse before an award becomes operative, and in the meantime the public servants are deprived -of any benefits it bestows. In Committee I shall move an amendment to secure to public servants the benefits of an award from the date of its determination. </para>

I would, as it were, apply the Golden Rule to political life. We ought to be just as eager to do justice to our servants as we are to do justice to. ourselves. It is my desire that the conditions of life governing the work of legislating for this country should be a standard to be enjoyed by the Public Service and the community generally. However, I shall reserve any further remarks until we reach the Committee stage. I content myself by voicing my protest against the Bill, because it seeks to deprive the public servants of the Commonwealth of their right to share in the forms of arbitration provided for those outside the Service, and have their claims heard by neutral tribunals free from any prejudicial influences and subject to no interference, which will hold the scales of justice evenly, and determine all claims before them on the evidence produced regardless of any pressure that might be attempted to be brought to bear on them, and doing only that which is right, and in keeping with the principles of justice. </para>

Then we amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and gave the  President  of the Arbitration Court power to vary awards, thus obviating the necessity for submitting fresh plaints and creating further disputes. All that legislation has tended to relieve the pressure on the Arbitration Court.. The main reason given by the Government for the introduction of the Bill is that it will settle a "large number of cases concerning the Public Service now set down for hearing in the Arbitration Court, and give those concerned facilities to get a decision more promptly. In the circumstances' the Government might just as well wait for a time to see how the Arbitration Court works under the amended arbitration law, and to see also the effect of the new Tribunals to be created under the Industrial Peace Bill, before they force the public servants into a special Court. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but they will relieve the pressure " on the Arbitration Court. If that is not the object of the Industrial Peace Bill, it is of no use at all. I am sure that it will relieve the Arbitration Court. The Government now propose to appoint a special Court to deal with the cases of Public Service employees. If they establish the principle that a special Court and a special Judge must deal with the employees of the Commonwealth, they must go a little further by establishing a special Court to deal with . each industry. The coal-miners have already taken the opportunity to come under a Tribunal on the lines of those to be created by the Industrial Peace Bill. If one man must be engaged wholly and solely on Public Service arbitration cases, I, as a member of the building trade, claim that that trade is important enough to justify the appointment of a special Judge to deal with it only. There are carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, plast- terers,  and other sections of workers concerned in it. Let one man specialize in building trade matters, if the arguments of the Government are sound, because as much technical knowledge is required to deal with that trade as is necessary in the case of the Public Service, and even more, as any one knows who, like myself, has been in the trade, and realizes the various technicalities that must be mastered before an award can be drawn up. If it is right in the case of the Public Service, and if it may be right in the case of the building trade, why not appoint another special Judge to deal with all the branches of the leather industry, such as tanning, saddlery, and harness making, boot making, and other technical operations of that particular branch of industry? There are hundreds of different technical matters to be mastered in connexion with the leather industry. We should also have a special Judge to deal with the iron trade, including moulders, engineers, fitters, brass finishers, and brass moulders. Then there is the shipbuilding trade. Why not appoint a special Judge for every avenue of industry, if the principle of this Bill is right, and so make the whole thing ridiculous ? I do not say that the principle of the Bill is right. Why not have another special Judge or Arbitrator to deal with the clothing trade? Why should the Public Service be picked out for a special Judge and Court to deal with its cases only? There is some ulterior motive behind that we do not understand. What is the reason ? </para>

                            <para>- Any Judge who sits in the Arbitration Court hears cases in all sorts of trades outside the Service, and his experience tends to broaden his views so far as industrial matters are concerned. He does not have to deal with cases only from a Public Service point of view. He is not in a narrow circle where he is compelled to decide a question from the point of view of its effect on the Public Service only. His eyes are not fixed only on the Service. He takes a broader view of things. He knows the conditions of industry outside. He is, therefore, a Judge with general knowledge, and the employees in the Public Service are far more likely to get a fair deal from him than from a man who is surrounded by red tape, and all. the time under the eye of the Government. Another objection is that if a separate Court is created, and a special Judge appointed to deal with the Public Service, it means building up another Department. </para>

                            <para>- We all know what happens. If the Government appoint a separate Judge, he must have a tipstaff, a clerk, and a typist, and he will gradually gather a Department around him. I am 'afraid of these growing Departments. We all see that the Public Service is growing to an enormous extent. Every Bill we  pass  seems to multiply the number of Government employees, and I regret the tendency very much. Here is a simple way out of the difficulty. We have an Arbitration Act in operation, and an Arbitration Court at work. All that is necessary is for the Government to say, " We will allow one Judge to take all the Public Service Arbitration cases until he wipes out the lot of them." </para>

                            <para>- I said that the Judges of the Arbitration Court have to deal with other cases, and will know the circumstances outside the Service. When the Judge who is specially detailed to finish off the Public Service Arbitration cases has completed the work, he can go back to the hearing of cases affecting other branches of industry. If one man is set aside to hear Public Service cases only, as this Bill proposes, he will not be doing the best thing in the interests of the country. We should not look upon those employed in the Public Service as our servants. They are the employees of the Commonwealth Government, and they have a right to the same justice as outside employees have. They are entitled to be brought under the same law, and to gain the same advantages, as any other employees in the country. If it is a fact, as it is, that there are thirty-three arbitration cases affecting the employees of the Commonwealth awaiting a hearing, surely those concerned deserve better treatment than to be brought under a separate Court. They have been waiting all this time, with the cost of living going up, as it has been, and have shown great patience, and we ought to give them every consideration. They tell us that they do not want to come under any other Court than the Arbitration Court, and we certainly ought to pay attention to their views. They have the best knowledge of their own requirements and feelings. One big organization, representing over 30,000 Government employees, has sent a circular to all members protesting against the proposed change, and asking to be allowed to remain under the Arbitration Court. Surely we can give some consideration to the request of those who are most affected. Can the Government show me, or the House, any advantage that will be achieved by this Bill? All it will do will be to put the employees of the Commonwealth under a particular Judge, who will himself become a public servant, and who will not be called upon to discharge any other duties. In the circumstances, it is a mistake to press the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- The appointment of two assessors to assist the Arbitrator would be an improvement. It is a dangerous principle to confer on one man, who will not have the same status as a Judge of the Arbitration Court, authority to decide all matters affecting the Public Service generally. I think I am right in saying that employees in the Public Service are against the measure, but if it must be passed, they would like to see two assessors, men from different branches of the Service, appointed to assist the Arbitrator. The Minister might concede this point to the Public Service. </para>

                    <para>MrRILEY.  -  The honorable member  forParkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> said he was opposed to the appointment of two assessors from the Public Service because those in the Clerical Division might object to a nominee from the General Division or the mechanical branch.  His  objection really is groundless, because in New South Wales the State Arbitration Court has authority to deal with every industry in that State, and assessors are appointed by all the unions that have access to the Court. The first assessor was elected from the Seamen's Union, the second from the building trades, and so on. These men were required to assist in determining issues affecting the mining industry, carpenters, engineers, and many other trades. I have no fear about the result if employees in the Public Service will have the right to select representatives to sit as assessors with the Arbitrator, because while some may be engaged in the higher grades of the Service, all are wage-earners. The measure should be referred to the Public Service to give its members an opportunity of indicating whether they approve of it or not. I shall oppose the second reading. </para>

                        <para>.- I must confess that I approach the consideration of the Bill with a certain amount of diffidence. Everybody desires to see peace within the Public Service, but, judging from the tone of the debate, there appears to be some doubt as to whether the Service ought to be removed from the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court or not. If there is any pronounced objection to the Bill, it would be a waste of time to proceed with it, but I do not think the public servants will be seriously prejudiced if cases affecting the Service are decided by a properly selected Arbitrator instead of a Judge of the Arbitration Court as at present. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly, and I admit that so far as the successful administration of the Bill is concerned, a great deal will depend upon the person to be selected as Arbitrator.  His  . appointment will  be for a period of seven years; but I think that if he had the security of tenure enjoyed by a Judge he would probably act with a little more firmness, and might resist any temptation to ingratiate himself with the authorities in order to secure re-appointment. Then, again, there is the question of the assessors. I approve of the principle, and if anything is going to be done to give effect to it, I would suggest that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> make provision at once, so that when the Committee stage is reached there will not be any danger of an amendment being ruled out of order. The Arbitrator will occupy a strong position, and I think it would be as well for the Minister to consider certain amendments that appear to be desirable. ' For . instance, the Arbitrator will have the right to determine the nature of the evidence to be admitted. </para>

                    <para>Then, again, clause 16 contains a provision that the Arbitrator need not be restricted to a specific claim or to the subject-matter of a claim, but may include in his determination any other matter which he thinks necessary in the interests of the public or of the Public Service. This principle, I think, might conflict with decisions of other authorities. For instance, I believe it is intended, in another measure, to provide for the appointment of a Board of Management, and it is quite possible that the activities of that body might be seriously hampered by determinations of the Arbitrator under clause 16. These are, however, matters that can best be dealt with in Committee, but I think the Minister would be well advised to give consideration to them at this stage, and particularly the question of appointing two assessors. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly that is so, but as I have already said, I do not think the Public Service will be seriously prejudiced by the appointment of an Arbitrator. If there is a section of the Service which considers that it ought to have its conditions altered it has only to file a plaint or memorial, and proceed to state its case. The Arbitrator then gives to the Minister or Commissioner notice concerning the points on which objections have been raised when a conference is called. Apparently at such conferences it is intended, as far as possible, that many of the points of dispute shall be cleared up, and that the Arbitrator shall settle those on which they do not agree. It is at this stage that the Arbitrator will be able to say whether certain evidence is necessary or not. I do not know whether it is altogether wise to allow the word " necessary " to remain, because without it the Arbitrator would have power to reject irrelevant evidence. </para>

                            <para>- An Arbitrator always possesses certain implied powers of that character, and perhaps no reasonable objections can be raised on that account. I do not think that the members of the Civil Service are likely to suffer by being excluded from the Arbitration Court. They will certainly possess the distinct advantage of having their cases dealt with more expeditiously than if they went to the Arbitration Court. While I am not altogether enamoured of the Bill, I do not feel disposed to vote against the second reading. </para>

                        <para>.- During the second-reading debate honorable members have had the opportunity of perusing a considerable quantity of correspondence, and some useful communications, from the different organizations included in the Commonwealth Public Service. I think every honorable member will admit, notwithstanding the comments that have been made, and the reports referred to in the House this 'afternoon, that the Commonwealth public servants are a very capable, patriotic, and obliging body of workers. Honorable members who have preceded me on the second reading of the Bill have not only dealt with its principles, but have also suggested amendments it may be desirable to move in Committee. I do not propose to labour the second aspect of the matter, because I think it has been very fully and clearly dealt with by honorable members on both sides who have preceded me, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr.Tudor), the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley),</inline> and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> . I desire to say in passing that the amendments from the Commonwealth Public Service Association are very useful, and embody suggestions which I hope the Government, if this Bill gets into Committee, will earnestly consider. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I am more concerned with the reasons for introducing the Bill. Why is it necessary to remove the Commonwealth Public Service from the jurisdiction and protection of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration? Why is this step being taken ? Why is this being done at a time when we are told that Parliament should be occupied with urgent measures affecting the public interest? Seeing that we are dealing with it at this stage of the session, the Government evidently consider that this is an urgent measure. I have not heard reasons advanced that will convince me that there is any urgency in the matter, and I am satisfied that this is a Bill which should be resisted by honorable members. We must not forget the circumstances under which the Commonwealth public servants were placed under the jurisdiction and protection of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. They were placed under the protection of that Court by the Act of 1911, and at that time very cogent reasons were given by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> why that particular measure should be. passed. There are one or two portions of the Prime Minister's speech to which I would like to call attention, because they are very appropriate at the present juncture. I am referring to a speech which appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 63, page 3631-2, where the Prime Minister was speaking on the Bill, passed in 1911, and which we are now practically repealing. The Prime Minister was then Attorney-General, and he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Bill rests upon the foundations of a sound principle. There is the right of appeal from the Public Service Commissioner to an impartial Tribunal; and there is the review of his decisions by the Parliament. The right to veto is one of which we ought not to try to divest ourselves. The public servants of this country have the assurance that their grievances will be investigated by an independent, impartial Tribunal, and that, subsequently, this House will, if necessary, exercise its right of supervision and veto. They are, therefore, given the assurance that the representatives of the people will see that they get fair play. The public servants need not go to this Court unless they like'. If, as we are told, they are satisfied with the Public Service Commissioner they will not go near the Court; but, if they are not, they will; and I feel sure we shall not be much older before they do go there. </para>
                        <para>This measure is urgent in many respects. It will cover 35,000 men who at present have absolutely no means of appealing from the decision of the man who employs them, which is a right denied to no other worker in Australia. No man that works for an employer in Australia is denied the right to go somewhere else over the head of the employer and ask, "Am I being treated justly? Are my rates of pay and conditions of labour those which ought to obtain?" The 35,000 public servants of the Commonwealth alone are denied that right, and are now being given it. Perhaps they do not appreciate it; but I say to them deliberately that it is a right of which, when they exercise it and experience its virtues, they will be found to be zealous champions. </para>

                            <para>- No. The Court is forbidden by this measure from making any award, affecting the Public Service. The Commonwealth public servants, whom the Prime Minister said would become zealous champions of the Act, are now being removed from the jurisdiction of the Court, and it behoves us, as guardians of the public interests, including the interests of that great body of public servants, to examine the reasons for this move, to understand the circumstances and why steps are being taken by the Government in this direction. </para>

                    <para>The first point I propose to examine is the circumstances that call for a change, and why a different policy is being adopted. Has the Minister who introduced the Bill or the Prime Minister placed anything before us to indicate the necessity for a change? We are told that an Arbitrator is required who has an intimate knowledge of the different laws and regulations governing the Public Service, and who will be able to thread his way through them ' and give decisions that will not conflict with "one another or with existing regulations. That has been put forward as one reason, but, if there was any difficulty- in that regard, it could be overcome by assigning Public Service matters to a particular Judge, who would make himself fully acquainted with all the details and ramifications of the Public Service. But that is not the real reason. The fact is that those who originally opposed the measure that was introduced in 1911 are responsible for the change that is taking place to-day. Those who informed public servants and- Parliament in 1911- that the public servants were satisfied with -the Commissioner are the ones who are desirous of getting back to the old state of affairs. This Bill is taking the Commonwealth Public Service back to its original state. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to show shortly that such is the case, because the so-called Arbitrator - he may be called any euphemistic term - will really be a dictator, although the Minister said that he will hold an impartial position. This Bill takes away from the public servants the right to approach the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and hands them over to the jurisdiction of some person who i6 not clothed with the same powers as a. Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The proposed Arbitrator may accept such evidence as he deems necessary and may not make any allowance for the expenses incurred in calling witnesses- whose evidence may be essential to enable him to come to a conclusion. That is a very drastic amendment of the law. If the Government contemplate, as I believe they do, taking away the Commonwealth public servants from the jurisdiction and protection of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, they can do so and hand them over to an Arbitrator. But the mere fact of calling him an Arbitrator does not make him one in the same sense as the Court is. We must not be led away by terms, and we have to examine the Bill to see what powers the Arbitrator is given. Who is he to be, and what salary is he to be paid? </para>

The public servants of the Commonwealth will find when this measure is in operation - I hope that I am mistaken - that the Tribunal for which it provides is a very different proposition from the existing Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. It is significant that when the Bill of 1911 was before the House certain honorable members now on the Ministerial side voted against its third reading. The honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> who has just resumed his seat was one of them. He was always opposed to the principle, and I do not wonder at his speech to-night in favour of this Bill.

                            <para>- I am merely giving the names of those now supporting this Bill who were opposed to the original measure of 1911. I do not wonder that they are anxious to continue the attitude which was then taken up by, not only them, but the Commissioner who made the report to which I have been referring. They were always opposed to Commonwealth servants having the right of other workers to go to the Court. </para>

I assert that the House will deal unfairly by the public servants of the Commonwealth if it removes them from the jurisdiction and protection of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I am showing that this Bill is different from that which was passed in 1911. I am showing the circumstances in which the change is being made. This proposal is brought forward after a most damning report against the Act of 1911, and the most active supporters of this Bill to-day are those who voted against that measure. </para>

                    <para>We have been told this afternoon that some honorable members of the Ministerial party really do not know whether or not the Commonwealth Public Service wants this Bill. They are inclined to think that, perhaps after all, they do not want it.

The great majority of our public servants have not approached the Court for five or six years, and, that being so, we should not hesitate to insert in the Bill a clause granting each and. every individual who appeals to the Court the right to secure a retrospective award. I have had a recent experience of the generosity of this Government in dealing with awards. I know of a case where a private employer is compelled to pay the basic wage laid down by the Board of Trade, whereas Government employees do not come within that decision, and the Government have made no pretence of agreeing that the award shall be made retrospective when the union concerned appeals to the Court. The position will be the same in regard to the Public Service generally. </para>

                            <para>- An ex-member might possibly have a knowledge of the affairs of the Commonwealth Public Service. If public servants were agreeable to the Bill, there would be no ground for complaint. The position is, however, that not one Public Service organization in operation at the present time believes that the Bill will prove to be in the interests of public servants. The Clerical Association, the Letter Carriers Association, the Postal Sorters Union, the Post and Telegraph Association, the Postmasters Association, the Federated Postal Sorters Assistants Association, the Customs (General Division) Officers Association, the Telephone Officers Association, the Postal Electricians Union, and the Postal Linesmen's Union are opposed to the measure, because they believe they will derive more satisfaction from  the  right  to  appeal  to the  Conciliation  and  Arbitration Court than they  are  likely  to  secure under  it. The  associations  to  which I have referred  are  associations of workers  in the  true  sense, and  their members as workers have as. much: right to' approach the Arbitration Court as a pick and shovel man has. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> mentioned that possibly the Bill was introduced on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> the ex-Public Service Commissioner, who recently reported on the Service. If honorable members analyze <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan'</inline> s report they will find that he has done grave injustice to many members of the Public Service. He has submitted a voluminous report condemning the Public Service in every way, asserting that there is mismanagement in every Department, that nothing is done as it ought to be done, that there is neglect, evasion of duty, impudence, and everything else to be charged against public servants, and no one has been given an opportunity to refute those slanderous statements. The case of the Government is particularly weak if the Bill really has been introduced  on the  strength of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McLachlan 's report. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not do so, but I intended to do so had you not reminded me of the rule. Under this Bill the Public Service Arbitrator may say what evidence he will receive. He has the right to set aside evidence with which he disagrees. Under the existing law the Arbitration Court will receive evidence from any person who has evidence to submit in connexion with any particular claim. It should be remembered that there is a certain amount of expense involved in submitting evidence to an arbitration Tribunal; but there is no guarantee that associations of employees in the Public Service will be allowed any expenses in connexion with the hearing of cases under this Bill. An association may be called upon to send a representative or a number of representatives over  a  considerable area, and may thus be  involved in a substantial sum for expenses, but there is no provision in the Bill for the payment of expenses incurred by associations. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>The Arbitrator may take evidence in connexion with a particular _ matter in only one locality, and upon that evidence he may make his finding a common rule. He may take evidence, for instance, in Melbourne, and although the conditions prevailing here may not be similar to those prevailing in other parts of the Commonwealth, he may make his decision, based upon the evidence of Melbourne conditions, a common rule applicable to Sydney and other centres of the Commonwealth. After the Arbitrator has taken evidence in a case, and given his decision, it is provided that thirty days shall elapse before his finding is given effect. It has to be brought before Parliament, and it is possible that Parliament may not be sitting for six months after the finding of the Arbitrator is arrived at. There is no guarantee under the Bill that the public servants affected by a finding will receive back pay if there is delay in giving it effect. That is one of the reasons why I have asked the Minister in charge of the Bill if he will consent to the insertion of a clause providing for the retrospective operation of all awards by the Public Service Arbitrator. I may mention that in some cases twelve months have elapsed from the pronouncement of a decision by the Arbitration Court or a Wages Board before those affected by it have received the benefit of it. </para><para>There is another matter of importance to which I ask the serious consideration of the Minister. Every member of the Public Service in the division or branch affected will, under this measure, be entitled to any benefits secured by any organization within the Service, irrespective of whether he is a member of the organization or not. I mentioned some time ago that if a person is not prepared to join an organization established to improve the conditions of the Service in which he is employed, he should not be allowed to participate in the benefits of an award secured bv the efforts of that organization. There are many public servants who go  to  work with a collar on who consider that their dignity would be lowered by joining a union. Many of them would be very much insulted if they were called upon to join a union. If those people are so dignified as to stand! aloof from the unions within the Service they should also be sufficiently dignified to refuse to benefit by awards secured by the efforts of those unions. I ask the Minister to carefully consider the  advis-ability  of introducing a provision to prevent any public servant benefiting from any award increasing wages who refuses to join an organization. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- No, but the principle involved is the same. It is that before a Bill is introduced dealing with the rights of persons under the existing law the persons affected should be first consulted. There is no distinction in principle. I am sure that the public servants of Australia would never put such a request to the Commonwealth Parliament. The honorable member who has moved the amendment is, always suggesting ulterior motives to the Government. May I ask him what is the motive behind his amendment? </para>

                            <para>- It is more to the point. However, let us get to the merits of the question. I intend to reply to various aspects of the discussion. First of all, the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> charged us with taking away from the public servants under this Bill something which at present they possess under the Arbitration (Public Service) Act. He says that this Bill is different from that Act. What are the differences ? The honorable member has not given the House a single illustration of a. difference between the two in support of his statement. I followed his speech closely and critically, and jotted down the points he made as he went along. He said that the Bill will not give the public servants their costs. Obviously, he has not read the Arbitration (Public Service) Act which is in force at the present time. It is provided by section 11 of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act of 1911 that " no costs shall be allowed in respect of any proceedings under this Act.", That section is reproduced in this Bill, yet he says that this measure is entirely different from the existing Act, and apparently refers to the fact that costs are not allowed the public servants under it as one of the differences. As a matter of fact, this Bill is the Act of 1911 almost in its very words, clause for clause, with the exception' of two clearly defined principles, which I shall mention. </para>

                    <para>It is proposed under this Bill to appoint a Public Service Arbitrator instead of asking one of the Judges of the Arbitration Court to exercise jurisdiction in Public Service cases. That is a distinct issue before the House. Is it right that we should make that particular appointment ? I shall give reasons why it is proposed. First of all, let me say that the Government, in introducing the measure, have been actuated by none of the sinister motives -suggested by the honorable member for West Sydney. The Bill is not introduced because of any lack of appreciation of the efforts of public servants. I was closely associated with the Public Service from 1917 onwards, during the war, and I say that we have reason to be proud of a great deal of the work done by the public servants of the Commonwealth. I know heads of Departments who, during the war, took Alien1 beds into their offices, and, in their devotion to duty, never left their offices for weeks on end. I am glad to 'find that, apparently, honorable members opposite have the same appreciation of the public servants that we have. Our desire is to do justice to them, to give them the benefit of fair standards, but those standards should be good and consistent, and should tend to the efficiency of the Service. </para>
                    <para>We are not taking away from the public servants any of the rights and privileges to which the honorable member for West Sydney referred. All the rights they possess under the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1911 are preserved to them. The only difference is that the determination of the rights of the public servants is to be left to the decision of a Public Service Arbitrator, whose sole function will be to deal with these matters which to-day are the subjects of some varying decisions by different Judges. All that can be done by a Judge of the Arbitration Court in regard to rights, privileges, conditions, and everything else in connexion with the Public Service may be done equally well by the Arbitrator. </para>

This appointment will do much to get rid of the congestion of business in the Court. There is another reason : The number of High Court Judges is limited, and, as honorable members know, their most important function is of necessity the constitutional and appellate work for which they were appointed, but at considerable inconvenience to themselves they have undertaken extra work. For the help they have rendered in this way they are deserving of the thanks of the country. But different Judges of the High Court are engaged in the Arbitration Court from time to time, and this has naturally led to some varying awards being made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> in his report on the Public Service, has drawn attention to that fact. </para>

                        <para>It would be tedious to recount all the inconsistencies which appear in the awards of the Court, but it may suffice to say that in such a matter as payment for holiday duty three different systems have been adopted by the Court, that the matter of granting allowances to officers acting in higher classified positions is dealt with in four separate ways, while some awards provide for granting of increments when so acting, while others do not. Overtime is determined in a multiplicity of ways, and this applies also to relieving allowances. Under some awards, travelling time is conceded, while in others it is not granted, although the circumstances are similar. Increments are  granted  from the actual due date, or from the first day of the month, or from the first day of the pay period, this being dependent upon the particular award governing the matter. In the same clause of one award provision is made that officers of the Clerical Division shall receive the adult minimum wage from the first day of the month following the twenty-first birthday, whilst those in the General Division are to receive it from the actual birthday. In one award the stretch of shift allowance is ls. per hour, while in another award it is time and a half. Increments are granted on different bases for no apparent reason. The inconsistencies of arbitration awards are puzzling in the extreme, and this feature alone has greatly intensified the difficulties of working the Public Service. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Because of the diversified nature of the problems with which the Judges have had to deal, these conflicting awards have been inevitable. Therefore, in order to secure uniformity in and justice to all sections of the Service, it is highly advisable that all claims should be dealt with by one Arbitrator able to devote his whole time to that particular duty. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members opposite have complained that we are treating the public servants differently from the rest of the community ; the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> said that- they are not to have the same right, as other people. That is not the problem with, which, we have to deal. In ordinary arbitration matters the Judge deals with an industry as a consistent whole. To-day it may be the shearing industry, to-morrow saw-milling, and on the third day some other industry, but he considers the industry as a whole, and makes the one award for the whole Commonwealth. An arbitration claim in regard to the Public Service, with its multiplicity of functions and its various Departments, all more or less interwoven into one huge system, is on an entirely different footing; and to continue the present system by which one Judge to-day hears a claim from one branch of the Service, and another Judge to-morrow hears a claim from another branch, would obviously lead to further inconsistencies in awards and wrong to the officers themselves. . To-day some are receiving benefits under an award which another award does not give to others. I ask honorable members to consider the wide ramifications of the Public Service, necessitating on the part of an Arbitrator a very close examination of the work of the different Departments and relationships of the Clerical, General, and Professional Divisions. Even in the Professional Division there is one award for the legal officers and another for draftsmen, architects, and other technical servants of the Commonwealth. Then there are awards for the linesmen and other employees of the Postal Department. Yet all these various officers are part of a great Commonwealth system governed by the Public Service Act, which confers upon them various rights and privileges in connexion with the carrying out of their duties. I was the Minister who in 1905 introduced into this House the first scheme for the classification of the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth. It was a task that occupied Parliament for some weeks, and I well remember, as I am sure does the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler),</inline> the difficult problems we had to solve in consolidating  the services, with their varying rates of pay, over the wide continent. We must not forget that we are legislating for a continent, and are seeking to do justice to men scattered all over Australia for carrying out the daily growing functions of the Commonwealth. Is this a problem that ought to be dealt with piecemeal, one Judge to-day dealing with the claims of postal assistants, and another Judge to-morrow hearing a plaint by the Professional Association or some other organization connected with the Service? In order to be just to the men, as well as just to the Commonwealth, we ought to appoint one man to deal equitably and justly with all these varying but related problems, so that right may be done to all parties. </para>

                    <para>I ask honorable members to consider what the procedure will be. This Bill is one of a series of three. The one dealing with arbitration generally has already been sent to another place. A second measure creating a Board of Management for the Public Service has come from the Senate to this Chamber. That Board of Management will take over the functions hitherto performed by the Commissioner. The duty of the Commissioner was to have regard to the nature of the vast Commonwealth Service, and frame a scheme for dealing with its members equitably. I agree with honorable members that no fairer, more capable, or more just man than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline> ever held a position in the Commonwealth Service. It was part of his duty to fix the salaries and conditions of the Service, but some of his decisions led to dissatisfaction, and it was felt that the Government employees should have a right of appeal from his decisions. Parliament accordingly passed the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill, which allowed public servants to refer their claims to the Arbitration Court. Thi3 Bill does not propose to alter that fundamental principle. The arbitration principle will , remain. After the Board of Management has similarly fixed the terms of employment of the officers, those organizations who feel that they are aggrieved in any way by the act of that public body may appeal to an independent tribunal in the person of the Public Service Arbitrator. We are proposing to give the public servant the best possible form of tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- There was a reason for introducing this Bill first; we desired to get it passed in order to relieve the congestion in the Arbitration Court as soon as possible. The Board of Management will consist of three independent persons. Their duty will be to perform the present functions of the Commissioner, which include grading and classifying the Service, and determining the rates of remuneration. In order to allow of an appeal from the decision of the Board we are proposing to constitute this special Arbitration Court, the necessity for which honorable members will realize if they will consider the complications and ramifications of the Service, the claims of which are necessarily in a category different from those of employees in one complete and consistent industry. </para>

Let honorable members' not think that I minimize the seriousness of a big award dealing with an industry like shearing; but that industry is a complete whole. In the Public Service, however, there is a series of associations, each calling for adjudication on different claims and problems. No less than thirty-three cases relating to various phases of the Service are listed before the Arbitration Court to-day. </para>

                    <para>It has been suggested by several honorable members that we should have a Court constituted of an Arbitrator and two assessors. But, obviously, two assessors could not possibly know everything connected with the whole of our Public Service. Of what use would be an assessor from the General Division in advising the Court how to classify professional officers ? The idea is an impossible one. The other suggestion is that assessors should be called in to deal with specific cases - assessors from the Professional Division to deal with cases in which professional officers are concerned, and so on throughout the Service. It is to this particular point that I desire to address myself. There is a departure in the Bill from the Arbitration (Public Service Act 1911, in that sub-clause 5 of clause 12 provides that, where a memorial has been filed asking for relief, the Minister or the Public Service Commissioner, or the particular person who is opposing the claim, may lodge an objection to it. When that has been done the obligation is thrown on the Arbitrator to convene a conference. To some extent this provision approximates to the idea which underlies the Whitley Council. As soon as an objection is lodged to any memorial the Arbitrator must convene a conference of both sides.This provision will give effect to the idea suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> who said that he would like to see the Public Service arbitration tribunal stripped of the garments of law as much as possible. </para>

                        <para>In the plaint of the Federated Public Service Association he considered that one-quarter of the evidence that had been called was not required. The case had therefore lasted far longer than it should have done, because witnesses had been called from here, there, and everywhere. They had, however, added very little to the case and very little to his knowledge of it. To specially call telephonists from New South Wales is almost ridiculous. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the view of a Judge of the Arbitration Court, and as honorable members opposite are pleading for the retention of his jurisdiction over our Public Service, it is only fair that I should quote it. In these cases, irrelevant and unnecessary evidence is sometimes called. Now the advantage of a preliminary conference in such cases will be the means of effecting a great saving to the organizations belong-' ing to our Public Service. It will mean that before the Arbitrator hears a case there will be a sifting out of irrelevant matter in order that he may focus his mind upon' the real vital issues of the plaint. In that way, a very great improvement will be effected. </para>
                    <para>I have now touched upon the main issues which have been raised by the amendment that has been submitted. But there are one or two minor matters that have been mentioned by honorable members to which I must refer. Complaint has been made that under the Bill the awards will be required to lie upon the table of the House. It is very strange that, although this practice has been followed since 1911, it is only now, when we are re-enacting a provision which has been in operation so long, that objection is taken to it. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> quoted the view expressed .by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when introducing the Act of 1911. Upon that occasion the right honorable gentleman drew attention to the absolute necessity of Parliament preserving this right of veto. It should possess it, because, after all, we represent the people in whose employ our public servants are. </para>

Suppose that on the 1st January a plaint is filed in the Arbitration Court, and that on the 1st May the Judge hears it, and decides that the award shall be made retrospective to the 1st January. He already has power to say - and the Arbitrator under* this Bill will have power to say - " This award shall date from the 1st January.'' Then, even if Parliament does not meet until the following December, the award will have a retrospective operation. </para>

But these are not cases in which men are living upon an absolutely starvation wage. Presumably, the Public Service Commissioner has fixed salaries which were fairly commensurate with the nature of the service rendered.

On the contrary, this legislation is distinctly in the interests of the members of the Public Service, and if it be passed as introduced it will provide some very useful machinery. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> referred to one case as having cost £14,000.

He has, I think, an abundance of power to make a good case if a good case can be made in support of the Bill. When I heard the interjections of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> - one of which was that this Bill will be of " distinct advantage " to the Public Service, and the other that it would be a " positive boon " to the Public Service - T marvelled how an ordinary member of Parliament, outside the Service, could appreciate the advantages of the Bill in a way that, apparently, not a single member of the Service itself can. </para>

                            <para>- That reminds me of the very curious and, to my mind, very regrettable fact that we have been tinkering with the whole question of arbitration by a number of Bills and subsidiary Bills when we might; in a comprehensive manner, have dealt with the whole question in one Bill. Not only have we introduced, if I may say so in. passing, unnecessary Bills, but, having already a useful measure on the Statute Book, which is serv-' ing its purpose in creating harmonious relations in the Service, we are actually now spending our time in repealing that measure, and substituting one which gives very little promise, indeed, of successful operation. The Minister says that the differences between the Bill and the existing Act are so slight that they are hardly worth argument. Yet nobody could fight more strenuously for the Bill than does the honorable gentleman. It is a sinister circumstance that he is getting the whole-souled support of all those persons who, in the past, have opposed the extension of arbitration, and have always tried to exclude the principle of arbitration from the Public Service. Are those gentlemen all silent who supported honorable members on this side in passing the Public  Service  (Arbitration) Bill, and now sit on the Nationalist side ? Where have they gone <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not see one in the chamber.- </para>

He is to be a new Commissioner with a new title, and an Act of Parliament all to himself - neither more nor less than a substitute for the Public Service Commissioner. All I can say is that I sincerely hope he will be a less autocratic, and less self-satisfied Commissioner than the gentleman who issued this report in such strong condemnation of men as good as himself in the Public Service. </para>

                    <para> The Minister said that one of the reasons for the introduction of the Bill is the congestion in the Arbitration Court; but that congestion appears to have troubled the Government very little during the months and years which went by immediately prior to the present session. It is. curious that the Government find it necessary to introduce this Bill when, as a fact, we have just passed an Industrial Peace Bill, and other industrial legislation, giving power to appoint  Deputy  Judges with the very object of getting over this congestion. I hope and believe that, if the Government are in earnest and sincere in regard to the appointment of  Deputy  Judges, the work will be coped with as occasion demands. The Minister also tells us that it is owing to the fact that different Judges have dealt with the claims of the members of the Public Service that inconsistencies have arisen. In my view it is greatly preferable that we should administer a system of arbitration which is uniform and just, rather than that we should set up a bureaucrat for the purpose of nominally acting as Arbitrator, but really acting as the Government nominee to discipline the Public Service. If there is one chapter in Victorian history which is anathema to the working classes of Australia - and when I speak of the "working classes" I include all who work - it is that chapter in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> as he then was, made the Public Service a class apart in connexion with the railway strike. I am well aware that it has been one of the penalties of the honorable gentleman who did that to have it more than once referred to in terms of condemnation in this House; but I refer to it again this evening for the purpose of pointing out the unpleasant analogy; namely, that the Government now propose to segregate the Public Service in a very objectionable manner - by giving them access to a special Court now to be created, and cutting them off from the superior tribunals open to ordinary citizens. And it has to be remembered that this is to be an inferior tribunal, because it is to be presided over by an officer with a limited tenure - of seven years, certainly, but still limited - as compared with that of a Judge of the High Court. The party on this side of the House very naturally object to such a proposal, and point out, as I point out, that we cannot deal with members of the Public Service and their claim, whether for better wages or better conditions, except, in the light of the general standard of living in all parts of the Commonwealth, and, perhaps, outside the Commonwealth. The public servants are only part of the whole; if the question of the cost of living arises, it affects those outside the Service on the same principle as it affects those inside the Service, and it is just as necessary that an Arbitrator for the Public Service should be capable of taking a judicious and judicial "survey of the whole of the industrial arena, as it is that he should be expert in the administration, in a particular way, of the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- The report of the ex-Public Service Commissioner has very properly come up for some criticism, and, again properly so, for some condemnation during this debate. It is said, of course, that he was an independent administrator. I venture to point out that he was an independent administrator whose views were well known to the Government who obtained that report from him. I invite the attention of the Minister to the fact that the Government has had this report concealed for many months, and that neither members of Parliament nor persons outside have been able to gain access to it; and, further, that the Government threw it upon the table only comparatively recently, when this present group of industrial Bills was about to be brought forward. There is keen point in the remark of the  honorable member for West.. Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> who has stated that, apparently, the policy of the Government is to give effect to the report of the, Commissioner, whose views were well known to the Government, and - probably - to some extent inspired by the Government in advance. I do not mean " inspired " in the sense of a conspiracy, but in the sense that the Commissionerknew what the views of the Government were, and that the Government knew what the views of the Commissioner were. It is said, and rightly, that it would be intolerable to have our Public Service become the victim of political influence or intrigue. But, while political influence in the Public Service is very objectionable, a bureaucracy and an autocracy are also objectionable. They are the two extremes - the one the antithesis of the other. My view is that the existing machinery of the Arbitration Act, giving equal justice - which is all we ask - to members of the Public Service exactly as to others outside the Service, has been an automatic correction of the autocracy of the Public Service Commissioner on the one hand, while at the same time preventing undue influence upon the working of the Public Service. That was as nearly an ideal set of conditions as one could hope for; and those conditions were in existence when the repeal of the Arbitration Act, in its relation to the Public Service, was proposed, and the enactment of this new measure was proceeded with. </para>

But, as a matter of fact, every case arising before the Arbitration Court, every industry coming under review before that Court, raises points for expert . consideration. The Judge requires to make himself, in the hearing of a case, expert with respect to the particular phase of industry upon which he is to adjudicate ; and. neither more nor less so than in connexion with the special claims of the PublicService. Indeed, the Service - being a matter almost purely of administration- does not require that measure of specialized and expert knowledge which a Judge needs to bring to bear upon cases arising out of industries, manufactures, trades and callings -some of them most intricate in character-in respect of which he has to make his decisions. And that is why I take the view that, in connexion with the Public Service as in connexion with all matters pertaining to arbitration, the Judge should approach the discharge of. his work with a full knowledge such as arises from association, not with one particular avocation or industry, but from a wide experience of the" industrial situation generally. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> put in a plea for our old friend preference to unionists. I do not propose to say anything further upon that question than to remind the House, and to remind the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Hon. J. M. Chanter)</inline> - if I may with propriety do so - that the honorable gentlemen themselves stood for preference to unionists in connexion with the Bill the predecessor of this, and in connexion with every Bill embracing the subject generally ; and that many of those honorable members associated with them did likewise. Does the head of the Government treat with ridicule and contempt the contention of the honorable member for Macquarie? If so, he ridicules himself. Or is this a Government which sends its Liberal members into the House to discuss those Bills, and matters generally, which are displeasing to the Labour section of the Ministry? I leave that matter just where it is. I have argued and pleaded for preference to unionists on the ground that preference was the natural corollary of organization and arbitration. I do not now propose to argue the subject again at length. Indeed, I intend to address myself no further to the second-reading than to sum up my objections to it in these words : That this Bill represents an attempt to segregate public servants . unfairly; that it will put them under the jurisdiction . of an Arbitrator, who will be little more than an officer of the Public Service, who by reason of' his tenure and position, will be practically a political representative and who cannot be expected, in the circumstances, to administer broad, even-handed justice to all members of the Service in that spirit in which the High Court Judges are prepared to administer justice, both to the members of the Public Service and to ordinary members of the community. And; in saying that of the members of the High Court Bench, I am not unmindful that those Judges cannot be accused of undue Labour sympathies. </para>

                            <para>- I  intend to  take  every possible opportunity to protest whenever there is a proposition for  the  fixing of a salary to an officer of the  Public  Service, or, by the Government, in connexion with any phase of activity,  of £1,000  or more. I do so on the score  of  economy, and for the reason that  the  people have no voice in the fixing of these high salaries. I maintain that the people should have the right to say what these public salaries shall be, from that of  the  Governor-General downwards. I do not think I received an accurate reply,  because  more than five men in the Commonwealth Service are receiving over  £l,50O  a year, with allowances. I shall, therefore, utter my protest at every  opportunity.  I am simply asking  that the  people who pay shall have the right  to  vote " Yes " or " No." </para>

                        <para>.- I  wish to bring under the notice of the House a question of great urgency. There  is  a likelihood of a serious industrial crisis being precipitated in  the  near future in the engineering trade. This has very largely been made possible by the fact that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers has  experienced  continued delay in the hearing of its case  in  the Federal Arbitration Court. It has on two occasions secured from the  President  of the Court an intimation of an approximate date for the beginning of the hearing. On one occasion the advocate was even told to prepare his witnesses on the Thursday for the following Tuesday, but now the possibility of the case being heard seems just as far off  as  ever, because when the latest request was made to the  President  of the Court he said he was not prepared to  fix  any definite date, owing to the uncertainty of his position. This afternoon  I  approached the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Hughes) on behalf of the organization with a request that he should receive a deputation from it, so that he might give the engineers an assurance that a Special Tribunal would assist in avoiding the industrial crisis which has actually arisen in the engineering trade in New South Wales, and which will spread to other States unless the Government are prepared to help to relieve the situation. The Prime Minister absolutely declined to receive a deputation from the organization, and practically said, "Let them go, let them go!" Apparently, little or no effort is to be made by the Government to avert the very serious situation now confronting the country in regard to the engineering trade. I enter my emphatic protest against the refusal of the Prime Minister to receive a deputation from the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He received  a  deputation from the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen, as he had every right to do, and I tender no objection, but rather support the claims of that organization; but if he receives one he should be prepared to receive another. It seems, however, that since the Amalgamated Society of Engineers took up an independent stand upon the shipbuilding agreement, unkindly feelings have characterized the Prime Minister's relationship with it. I urge the Minister in charge of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> to endeavour to secure from the Prime Minister, or from the Government generally, an assurance that the members of the organization will be met, so that the present difficulty may be overcome. I leave the matter with the Minister in the hope that he will use his best endeavours to induce the Prime Minister to receive a deputation at an early date. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think it goes without saying that anything any union asks for, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> should promptly grant. If they make a protest, and demand that he shall see them instanter, of course he must see them. Are they not the almightly power in this country at the moment, and is not the Prime Minister the merest adjunct of government! Is it not clear that the whole power of this country resides in the various Trades Halls and elsewhere? May I suggest to the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> in all seriousness, that he should adopt a little more reasonable tone, particularly when he is asking Ministers to grant interviews with these people? No Prime Minister that ever lived in this country has granted more interviews to the various outside bodies than the present one, and it. seems that the more he grants the more trouble he gets into. My advice to him would be to grant even less. </para>
