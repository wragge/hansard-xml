                        <para>- Some time ago a deputation from the Country party waited on the Prime Minister, and was assured that no further embargoes would be placed on the export of produce from Australia. Recently, however, I received from the Solicitor-General an intimation that an embargo would be placed on the export of lead ore from Western Australia. I ask the Leader of the House whether he will promise that this matter shall be definitely brought before Cabinet, and consideration given to my request that exportation may be free. </para>

                    <para>- On the 14th September I brought before the Assistant Minister for Defence certain circumstances connected with the return from the Front of ex- Warrant Officer Little, and asked that an inquiry might be made into his case. The honorable gentleman promised that he would institute an (inquiry, and go carefully into the matter. I have now received from the Defence Department a communication saying that the Department cannot see its way to institute a Court of Inquiry, as requested. I wish to know if that is the Department&#39;s last word on the case, and if this man is not to be given an opportunity of putting the circumstances of his return from abroad before a tribunal. </para>

                    <para>- I have given a great deal of care and thought to this case, and have had it before my executive officers for a long . time. It has been threshed out as thoroughly as a case could be threshed out, and I regret to have to say that the conclusion arrived at is that nothing more can be done. </para>

                        <para>- In to-day&#39;s newspaper it is stated that a number of soldiers who have received their discharge in Great Britain invaded the High Commissioner&#39;s office, demanding cash for  their war gratuity bonds, and left only on being promised that within a day or two &#163;25 in cash would be made available to them. If that statement be true, is the Government going to make &#163;25 in cash available to those soldiers who fulfilled their contract and returned to Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I again draw the attention of the House, as unfortunately I have had to do only too frequently during this session, to the fact that the asking and answering of questions should be listened to in silence, without interjections of any kind. I remind honorable members also that it is only questions on urgent matters of public importance that should be asked without notice. The system which has grown up of seeking to argue and debate subjects on questions without notice gives rise to more disorder than do any of the other proceedings . in this Chamber. </para>

It will be a few months before we meet again, and everything may be in the melting-pot in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>- I have explained to the honorable member that the delay which has occurred has been in consequence of the attitude of the unions themselves; otherwise, this matter might have been finalized long ago. As to the going on with the building of the large ships at Walsh Island, I cannot give a promise, seeing that a revised tender was at a price something like &#163;17 a ton in excess of that which was first agreed upon, and which I had announced to the House. Before I do anything, honorable members will be given an opportunity to come to a decision on the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Serious complaints are made about the service to the Pacific Islands carried on by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. It is said that the Government gave to that firm the right to carry mails, and to do other business with the Pacific Islands, without calling for tenders, and that the firm does not deal out even-handed justice to shippers. It is complained that certain financial interests control its operations, and receive advantages over smaller shippers. Will the Leader of the Government promise, on behalf of the Prime Minister, that an inquiry shall be made into the allegations, and have things rectified so. that all shippers may be on an equal footing, no monied men being given preference? </para>

It is not so much a matter of urgency, but I hope you will pardon the question, seeing that the recess is soon to deprive us, if I may say so, of your genial society. I desire to ask you a question with regard to these mysterious instruments which are suspended from the roof. Are they not, in a certain manner, an invasion of the privileges of honorable members, inasmuch as they are intended to convey their speeches directly from this Chamber to people outside ? Am I correctly informed, in particular, that the one hanging over the head of the honorable member for Barrier (Mr.Consi- dine) is specially intended to enable the Prime Minister to hear the speeches of that gentleman without running the risk of coming into the Chamber? </para>

                            <para>-  I am afraid that the honorable member has not been correctly informed in regard to every particular. Of course,  if  there is serious objection to this experiment being made, it will be discontinued, but a representative of the Wireless Telephony Company sought permission to make it in this Chamber, with a view to seeing if it be possible to transmit the speeches made here to other portions of the building, . and the temporary test is being made in the Prime Minister&#39;s room. I do not know with what degree of success the experiment has met, but honorable members might find it convenient, later on, perhaps, if wireless reports of their speeches could be conveyed to their own rooms without imposing on them the necessity of coming into, the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Whether or not the awards are laid on the table, their operation will not be interfered with. If necessary, the Government will come to Parliament and ask for indemnification for any action they may take to give effect to them, so the honorable member may, therefore, be quite easy in his mind. Some have already been laid on the table, and nothing will be allowed to interfere with the operation of any of them. I am not sure that I have not heard some people asking that these awards be not laid on the table of the House - that they be not approved. </para>

                            <para>- If this motion is carried and the House adjourns this afternoon or to-night, there will be no tomorrow. I object strongly to the motion, because if it is carried it will only give us one or two. hours in which to discuss this most important question of what should be the living wage for our public servants and for employees generally throughout the Commonwealth. The only alternative is to sit all to-night and right through tomorrow, and perhaps to-morrow night, until we eventually conclude the debate. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but last :night the proposal was quite different. We could have gone on with the debate and then adjourned it and met again, but if this motion is carried there will be no further sitting of the House until next year, and we shall be precluded from discussing the basic wage question unless we unduly extend this sitting in order to do so. I am strongly opposed to this motion. I think the House should proceed in the ordinary way to do the business before it. The Government and those supporting them are greatly mistaken if they think that the closing of this part of the session will solve the great problem of the living wage for the people of Australia. It is simply the attitude of the ostrich, which sticks its head in the sand, thinking that by doing so it has solved the problem, of how to escape from its pursuers. We may adjourn, but this great problem will still be facing us. Industrial affairs are becoming so unsettled in Australia that it becomes more necessary every day to make an attempt to solve this question, otherwise serious consequences will ensue to the people generally. It is useless to play the ostrich trick of closing Parliament, saying, &#34; That solves the difficulty.&#34; By discussing the question in a fair and open way we may arrive at a decision that will  insure to the people of Australia a decent degree of comfort in their general conditions of living. </para>

                            <para>- That would be a very unwise thing to do. Undoubtedly the public of Australia are very much agitated over the question of the basic wage. I moved the adjournment of the debate yesterday because I thought it inadvisable to have such an important matter discussed at an all-night sitting, and I would very much prefer to have it discussed until a reasonable hour this evening, and then again to-morrow morning) until the debate is concluded. Nothing will give a certain class of the community stronger cause for complaint than the fact that this Parliament, with such an important question before it, has rushed it through at an all-night sitting, as the motion suggests. When this sitting concludes this part of the session ends, and honorable members will not be called together until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in his wisdom, summons us to meet again. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the sentiments expressed by the honorable member forFranklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> but I do not agree with the method he has suggested for discussing this very important question of the basic wage - the most important ever launched in Australia. In response to a deputation the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> announced in his policy speech at Bendigo - and his promise was repeated by all of his followers - that certain steps would be taken to fix the cost of living, and a Basic Wage Commission has been for ten months engaged on the task of deciding what is the cost of living in Australia. Having concluded its labours, it has now presented its report to Parliament, and it is the duty of Parliament, I take it, to solve the question in accordance with the terms of the Commission&#39;s report. But instead of the House devoting sufficient time and proper hours to the consideration of this problem, the suggestion is made that we should sit on to-day and perhaps to-morrow to deal with it. The proposal does not appeal to me. This House, if it takes the report of the Basic Wage Commission seriously, and has any realization of the true position, will adjourn at a proper hour this afternoon and meet next week at a proper time; and if the matter cannot be settled next week, it will sit here during the following week and continue sitting until the subject is finally disposed of. In that way we shall be carrying out the duty which we are supposed to perform. We must have a reasonable time for discussing this matter. We are not yet on the eve of Christmas. I know that honorable members whose homes are far removed from Melbourne arc anxious to get away, but they must realize that never before has so important a problem confronted them. Yet we are asked to settle it in a few hours&#39; discussion or continue sitting all night and all to-morrow, and then adjourn for three or four months with the question still unsolved. What will occur in the intervening months? There is a state of ferment among both employers and employees in regard to this question. Are we to expect them to remain in a calm state of mind for three months while Parliament takes a holiday, shirking its duty upon the most important matter ever submitted to it? Let the motion be withdrawn and let those honorable members who want to go to their homes do so, while those who remain in Melbourne can meet here next week and the following week, and, if necessary, continue sitting right until Christmas if, by doing so, this important problem can be solved. </para>

                        <para>. - If sitting here next week, the week after, and through the Christmas holidays would mean the solving of this problem, and it were regarded as  unsolvable  otherwise, the desire of every honorable member would be to continue sitting; but so far from that being the fact, while these vehement speeches, addressed with one eye on Parliament and the other eye on the great Public Service vote, are being indulged in, the Government are being deprived of the opportunity of determining the amount of wages to be paid to the public servants. Honorable members seem to approach this matter under the assumption that the Government have not come to any decision upon it. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> announced on the floor Of this House that Commonwealth public servants would be paid a basic wage as from 1st November of this year, and all the talk we  in  ay indulge in for days will not alter that fact. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to do so, but I point out that this debate on the basic wage is delaying the determination of the Government, and that, therefore, we ought to agree to this motion. It ought to be made clear to the public servants that we cannot help them, and are not helping them one whit, by sitting on here discussing the matter. The Government policy has been definitely announced, and it will be carried out whether the debate proceeds in this Chamber for a week or three weeks. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope the Treasurer will not press his motion, or, if he does, that it will Be defeated. It is extraordinary that the right honorable gentleman should have moved it at the outset of a very important discussion. His motion means, in other words, that Parliament, on the rising of the House, shall be practically prorogued. Would it not be better for the Government to wait until the debate upon the basic wage has proceeded, at any rate, until some stage this afternoon, by which time they might be in a position to know whether finality can be reached and a specific announcement made? I do not wish to repeat the cogent and forcible arguments advanced by honorable members on this side, and I need scarcely remind honorable members that this very important public matter is one that is agitating the minds of many thousands throughout Australia. It behoves Parliament, then, to give that attention to the subject which the public expect of us. My reasons for speaking as I do are fortified by the fact that I have received a telegram, in common with other honorable members, despatched from Sydney  la6t  evening. It contains a message to the effect that the Prime Minister stated to a deputation in Sydney- </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members are here as constant watch-dogs over&#39; public affairs ; they can bring matters forward and move motions in this House. A majority of honorable members can always compel the Government to their will. If the House is not sitting, however, how can that be done? The Government do not require much time in which to decide and announce what they mean by their pledge. As for their decision to pay the increase as, from the first day of this month, I hold that they should go much further back. The party to which I have the honour to belong has taken every opportunity to point that  out.  Before a motion of this character is agreed to, we should have some definite assurance that the pledge of the Government will be honoured. I am not satisfied that we have the assurance as yet ; and, that being so, I shall vote against&#39; the motion . </para>

                        <para>.-When the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> moved the adjournment of the debate on the basic wage last evening, protests were raised by honorable members opposite, and it was alleged that honorable members on this side did not wish to discuss the subject. I was one of those, however, who indicated that I was willing to remain and assist in its discussion. When there is important business before the House, and it appears obvious that honorable members are &#34; stone-walling,&#34; I am always prepared to vote for the application of the closure. Now that we have reached the end of the session, however, if honorable members wish to carry on the debate upon the basic wage, i shall be willing to remain as long&#39; as other honorable members reasonably desire. It was intimated at the beginning of this week that the Government were prepared to fix a basic wage for public servants, but the Prime Minister did not reveal what, the amount would be. I consider that a definite proposal of the Government should be before the House, and that, otherwise, it is of no use to debate the question at all. As there is no proposal before honorable members, the only way to intimate to the Government what we think, is to debate the matter in this Chamber. It has been said on many occasions by honorable members opposite that supporters of the Government discuss subjects such as this in our party room upstairs, and that we arrive at our decisions beforehand. The Treasurer knows, and will confirm me. I am sure, when I say that nothing qf the kind has occurred with respect  to the basic wage. We have not had an opportunity to discuss it at a party meeting. If the House is given an opportunity to decide what is to be the basic wage, I shall press the view that this Chamber is not the proper tribunal for determining such a matter. But if the Government are about to arrive at and announce a decision, this House should have an opportunity to discuss that decision and indicate whether <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> thinks fit to approve it. </para>

                        <para>. - It is an extraordinary procedure to endeavour to weight the basic wage question with an effort to put out the Government. If we were to take the business of the Government out of their hands there would be only one course for any self-respecting Ministry to adopt. It is the duty of the Government to present and control the business of this Chamber; it is their duty also to say a.t this stage what they are going to do regarding the basic wage. </para>

                            <para>- It is very unwise to try to smother this business up. It cannot be smothered, and if an effort is made in that direction there will be serious results. I listened carefully to the utterance of the Prime Minister early this week, and I am quite as anxious as any one else to sea public servants paid a living wage. I hope, however, that the matter will not be made a party one, for that procedure would inflict injury on the Public Service. I understood the Prime Minister to promise in this House that the Government would pay an interim basic wage, but that they wanted time to consider it. Why cannot the Treasurer tell honorable members now that the Government are prepared to pay a wage equivalent to the State basic wage? </para>

                            <para>- In the in interests of public servants, with whom I have some sympathy, I plead with honorable members not to adopt that procedure. It would be better for the Government to hold a Cabinet meeting, even to-day, for, after all, the question must be settled, and the sooner the better. Delay will cause the dissatisfaction of the service to swell, and the agitation of its members to grow like a rolling snowball. Most honorable members on this side have made up their minds that the Government will be acting rightly in determining that some additional wage shall be paid to public servants, and I hope that Ministers will not hesitate to make a statement on the question. An honorable member asks me why I intend to vote for the motion . </para>

                        <para>- I am unable, at the moment, to find the answer to this question, but if the honorable member has any propositions for enterprises similar to those which have been undertaken down here, and which promise the same result, I shall be disposed to look kindly on them. It is quite impossible, however, to give a definite answer to a hypothetical question. My sympathy is with irrigation. I think irrigation is a paying proposition for the Federal Government, as well as for any of the State Governments. </para>

                            <para>. - I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, believing that it would be quite improper to discuss this all-important subject during an all-night sitting. This is the most important report that has yet been before this Parliament, since the findings of the Commission must undoubtedly affect the whole of the industrial life of Australia. It would be a grave mistake to assume that the Government could grant the basic wage to public servants without providing for its extension to every branch of industrialism in the Commonwealth. Some time ago a slightly embarrassing political situation arose, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> adopting his usual . policy of following the line of least resistance, appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of the basic wage. After an investigation, more or less complete, that &#39;Commission presented its report. Then followed a most extraordinary procedure, which, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> is quite unprecedented, and I hope that it will never be repeated. The Commission, having sat for upwards of twelve months - having taken evidence in all the States - presented its report to the Governor-General, and it was received &#39;by the Prime Minister on Saturday or Sunday last. The right honorable gentleman promptly referred it back to the  Chairman  of the Commission for a further re port by him without consultation with the other members of the Commission. The &#39;procedure usually associated with the appointment of a Royal Commission is almost farcical. Whenever a difficulty arises - whenever any strain is cast upon Ministerial responsibility - a Royal Commission is appointed, and its report, on presentation to the Government, is generally referred to those whom it criticises, with a request that a statement reply thereto shall be submitted. That is the invariable practice, with the result that we have submitted to us sheaves of reports, which make the whole inquiry ridiculous. But in the whole of my experience in State and Federal politics I have never heard of the  Chairman  of a Commission being -asked, -as in this case, to pronounce a verdict on the report of his own Commission, and doing so without consultation with his colleagues. </para>

                                <para>- If he had changed his mind after signing the report, he should have called his colleagues together and have told them what he was asked by the Prime Minister to do. The truth is that what has occurred is the result of one of the weak, silly, half-way measures which have marred the public life of the Prime Minister. Instead of facing with proper Ministerial responsibility the demand made by the Commonwealth Civil Service for increased pay, he referred the subject to a Commission providing for the consideration of a universal basic wage. This report together with the semi-private memorandum of the  chairman  of the Commission, have thrown the commercial and industrial life of Australia into confusion, and will cause the gravest difficulties. Without consulting any one, so far as I know, the right honorable gentleman has announced that he will fix the basic wage for the Public Service at a minimum of about &#163;4 4s. per week, commencing from the 1st November last. This is his statement as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> (page 6820)- </para>

                            <para>Now, if I am asked what the Government are prepared to do, &#39;I will state it in a few words. With the figures submitted for their consideration by the Basic Wage Commission, supported by the figures of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> showing that the purchasing power of the sovereign has depreciated from 1907 until the present time to the extent that 84s. 8d. will now only buy what 43s.1d. would buy in 1907, we have to satisfy ourselves that the public servant can buy as much with his present wage as he could buy in 1907. In many cases he cannot do so, because his money wage has not risen correspondingly to the increase in the cost of living. The Government recognises, therefore, that the wages of the public servants must be increased, and, although it is not prepared to say offhand what is a fair basic wage, it will give immediate consideration to the question. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">My interpretation of those remarks is that the figures given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> are those which the Prime Minister had in his mind, and were, roughly, the foundation on which he intended to fix the basic wage. The Government of New South Wales have established a basic wage of, I think, &#163;4 5s. per week. The Commonwealth Government have no right to do anything in this matter without consulting this Parliament. It is not within the province of a Minister, or of a Cabinet, to make a wholesale increase or a wholesale reduction in the payments to the public servants of the country without the consent of Parliament. We have surrendered more than enough of our control of the purse. This House should decide whether an increase in the salaries of the public servants should be made, and, if so, what it should be, and from what date it shall be paid. The speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Bendigo, following the ordinary procedure, was accepted by every candidate and the public generally as a statement of the policy of the Government. There is no reference in it to the limitation of the basic wage to any section of the community. As I read his remarks, he approved of a. basic wage being fixed for the whole of Australia. If a basic wage is applied to the public servants of Australia, no man, no Government, and no party will be able to withstand the flood of requests which will sweep over the country demanding its application to all branches of work and to all classes of the community. Australians would not permit one particular class to enjoy a basic wage, a minimum living wage having no relation to the work they did, while the workers at large, in town and country, earned less. These would insist on having the basic wage conditions applied generally. Since the Basic Wage Commission&#39;s report was laid before honorable members, I have given of my best in the attempt to grapple with the question with which it deals, but I am not prepared yet to say what would be the result of adopting the recommendations that it contains. Let me give some figures, which I succeeded in getting in the brief time at our disposal. According to the statistics, the average weekly earnings of miners, labourers, and other employees on the mines are - In New South Wales, 89s. 4d. ; in Victoria, 86s.8d. ; in Queensland, 80s. 3d.; in Western Australia, 90s. 6d. ; and in Tasmania, 77s. 2d.; the average for the Commonwealth being89s.10d. I have excluded the figures relating to coal miners, because most of what they produce is sold locally. </para>

                                <para>- They are to be differentiated, not so much because of their organization, but for the reason that the bulk of the coal raised in Australia is used within the Commonwealth, so that it is possible for us to fix its selling price, also the wages and working conditions of the industry. There are in the Commonwealth 15,115 gold miners,8,553 copper miners,8,706 silver miners, and 5,256 tin miners, the total of these figures being 41,630 miners, exclusive of coal miners. In no case does the miner obtain the sum recommended by the Commission as the basic wage for a married man, the highest wage obtained being &#163;4 14s., in Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The strike settlement for Broken Hill fixed a rate of 15s. per day for miners, working on wages. My conclusion is that the application of the basic wage, to mining would compel the great majority of the mines in Australia to close. Practically all the gold mines would close, or the miners would have to be put on to piece-work, like the coal miners, and some of the silver miners. Most of the mines at Bendigo, Ballarat, Mount Lyell, and Cloncurry are just about paying expenses, with a not very&#39; large dividend occasionally. A number of them are not quite paying expenses, and a small call is paid by the shareholders from time to time in the hope, which makes mining possible, that they may &#34; strike &#34; something and get an adequate return from their investment. </para>

                                <para>- But for that hope there would not bo nearly so much mining as there is to-day. What will be the position in big mining centres like Bendigo or Ballarat if we insist on the application of a basic wage which the mines cannot pay? The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> yesterday, when dealing with secondary industries, was quite right in what he said. In relation to these; we may make the Tariff whatever we choose, and by means of those friendly arrangements amongst manufacturers which practically banish competition, fix any wages or any price. But the moment we export outside Australia, Tariffs and price-fixing go to the four winds of heaven; we are then in competition with the world, and have to accept exactly what the production brings in the world&#39;s market. There is no &#34; royal road ; &#34; if we fix a wage at which production cannot be made profitable., then production will cease. This morning I was for a few minutes at a conference, and heard from authentic sources that the best price obtainable by the producers for oats in Victoria to-day is from 1s. 6d. to 2s. per bushel. , </para>

                                <para>- I should not be doing my duty in the position I occupy in this House if I did not place before honorable members the true facts and conditions as I know them. This is a most serious blow to the most important industry of Australia. If our wool, or a large portion of it, is not wanted in the markets of the world, God knows what is going to happen to the growers! The honorable member for Grampians and others are trying to fix up some kind of Pool and so save the situation. Some growers have not had too good a time, and, in an involved position, with their wool unsaleable, are faced with hard ruin. What is the use of imposing a basic wage on such men ? If the basic wage is made applicable to every wage-earner in Australia, as it must if we give it to the public servants, what about the small producers in the back-blocks, who have the largest families and are the most hardworking people in the community? They have gone into the back-blocks of every State to make homes for themselves, and in their struggle for a living have to work, not eight hours, but from daylight to dark, for less than half the suggested basic wage. Are these people to have no consideration? Is consideration to be given only to those who are non-producers, directly ? </para>

                                <para>- I deliberately say &#34; non-producers, directly,&#34; because however desirable it may be to encourage secondary industries, it is the primary industries which keep the rate of exchange down - the export of the surplus wheat, wool, meat, coal, fruit, and hides - and it is that alone which keeps the wheels of the Commonwealth going. We must not make the cross now being carried by primary producers too heavy to bear. I warn the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),,</inline> and members generally that if we do anything to injure our primary industries, the secondary industries and the whole fabric of our industrial life will tumble about&#39; our ears like the walls of Jericho in ruin and consequential chaos. We may go on tinkering with Wages Boards and awards, we may do whatever we choose, but unless the primary producers of Australia - the only men who, with their export trade, produce the money to pay the interest on the indebtedness of the country - receive a share of our consideration, all the &#34; quack &#34; medicines we may administer will not cure the consequent evils. Holding the views I do, I say that not one penny piece in the way of a basic wage should be expended without the approval of this House. We have no right to go into recess and leave an open cheque with a Government to fix industrial remuneration in any direction. </para>

                                <para>- I mention no particular Government. This House has resigned the power of the purse ever since the war broke out, and permitted expenditure and interference, with our industrial life by Cabinet rule and Regulation to a degree I never thought possible in a Britishcommunity. It is time we cried &#34;Halt!&#34; and I, for one, mean to cry &#34;Halt!&#34; Honorable members seem to think that, because I moved the adjournment of the debate last night, I am not in favour of discussing the question to a conclusion. But, knowing the feeling of Australia, and knowing the force behind the agitation by means of which members have been &#34; bombarded&#34; for some weeks, I say that nothing could be more dangerous than for this House to attempt to shirk this question, and go into recess without dealing with it. I say deliberately and seriously that I am not prepared to leave to any Cabinet a matter such as this, which is the first responsibility, the primal duty, of the House itself.&#39; </para>

                                <para>- I agree with the honorable member. Before the last election, when sitting behind the Government, I urged that the drift in the finances should be stopped. Last night the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> confined himself to the manufacturing or secondary industries, and the figures for 1918, the latest available, show that these represent &#163;58,000,000 worth of production, with which we have power to deal. But the great pastoral industries represent &#163;98,300,000 worth of production, 94 per cent. of which has to be exported out of Australia. We have no more command over the price of wool than we have over the tides of . Bass Strait. </para>

                                <para>- I am trying to show what the position of Australia is, and its ability to face a universal basic wage. It is worse than- useless to attempt to fool either the public servants or the workers by giving them an undertaking which we know we cannot carry out. Since I received the report of the Basic Wage Commission, I have dome my very best to measure its effects. Any private individual, before he increases his expenditure, ascertains whether his revenue is sufficient to meet it. In 1918 the production value of the leading industries of Australia was as follows : - </para>

It is true that during the last four years of the war values were abnormally enhanced, but they are already coming back rapidly to something like the original figures. The value of our mineral production, excluding coal, for the decade reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>Moreover, in every other direction, excluding agriculture, .there has been an enormous reduction in the quantity of the production of every commodity which helps to make Australia prosperous, except in regard to secondary industries. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> who takes a great deal of interest in these matters, gave us some figures last night showing that in the past few years the secondary industries of Australia have made great progress, but he also pointed out that boot factories in Melbourne were shutting down because of over-production. This brings me to a consideration of the question of profiteering. We know that calfskins, which rose to the absurdly high price of 5s. per lb., are to-day not worth much more than 5d. per lb., yet, despite this enormous drop in the value of the hide, there has been no drop in the price of leather or boots. Heavier hides have also fallen in value. We all remember the plea that was put forward on behalf of the &#34; poor &#34; manufacturers, who, according to the Leader of the Opposition, are doing exceedingly well despite the hard times. The honorable gentleman has alluded to the enormous profits they have been making, but last year, when some of us spoke in the same way, the cry was raised by honorable members opposite, and some honorable members on the Ministerial side, that the price of hides had sent up the price of leather. And the argument put up a few months ago before the Victorian. Prices Commission by the tanners and boot manufacturers was that they had been compelled to increase the price of their leather and boots because of the enormous increase which had taken place in the price of hides. Hides have since come -down with a slump, but the price of leather and boots still remains where it was. In my opinion, the Prices Commission referred to is nothing but a farce. I was told the other day by a man in the clothing trade - he is one of the most intelligent workers I have had the pleasure of meeting - that, as a result of the inquiry by that Commission into clothing, his firm was able to increase the price of its suits of clothes by &#163;2 or &#163;2 2s. </para>
                        <para>I think I have shown that Ave are in an extremely parlous condition in regard to Australia&#39;s production. It is only the enhanced value of our products that has brought about the increase shown in our production values, whereas, as a matter of fact, our production of wool, wheat, gold, and base metals have been on the down grade for some time past. I have mentioned the price of oats. Hay is almost unsaleable, but, although the farmers have  enjoyed  good prices for their wheat during the past few years, no one will say for one moment that the price of wheat for the present season will remain at the present high figure. In fact my information goes to show that there is no reason whatever to expect&#34; that the present price will be maintained on the world&#39;s markets. With all these facts in front of us we are expected to rush into a proposal which will revolutionize the whole of the industrial and producing life of Australia, and at the fag-end of an extremely strenuous session, without giving proper consideration to the most important report that has ever been sent into this House, arrive at what should be a basic wage to apply throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- In the first -place I think this matter originated in an electioneering squib. The Prime Minister rushed into the matter with his head down in promising to pay the civil servants a basic wage, and the Leader of the Opposition is plunging into it, not only with his head down, but also with his eyes shut, in proposing that the wage recommended by the Basic Wage Commission should be applied indiscriminately all over Australia. This matter will need the fullest and most complete consideration. </para>

                                <para>- It is astonishing what a lack of intelligence some honorable members display when they will not listen to what one is trying to put forward. I have said nothing of the kind. I said that the Ministry had no right to fix and pay a basic wage; but that they should fix what they think is a proper wage, and bring it down to Parliament in the form of Supplementary Estimates, whereupon this House should give a decision upon the matter. If honorable members cannot distinguish between these two courses it is not my fault; my language is sufficiently plain and straightforward. This House must have the final say in the matter. </para>

No honorable member attends to his duties more closely than I do, and I have not seen my home more than once since Easter. To me the session has been specially strenuous, but I contend that we have no right to go into a long recess. We have no right either to allow the Government to fix up this matter without the consent of Parliament or to allow the question to be dragged out until May or June next. I suggest to the Government that they should consider it &#39;fairly, and then call Parliament together, and put their proposal deliberately before us. In the meantime they should give no increase established on a basic wage. </para>

No member of this House has had time, and, therefore, I am moving my amendment to give some relief to the public servants of the country, who, I believe, are not too well paid at the present moment. </para>

                                <para>- So far as I know anything of the report, it seems to me a peculiarly incomplete one. I should have thought that an inquiry of the kind would have made some reference to the number of basic wages already established up and down Australia by various bodies of various kinds and have tried to reconcile them for us. There is to-day in New South Wales a basic wage which has been declared by a Board of Trade, after an elaborate inquiry. There is a basic wage which has been declared quite recently, I understand, in Western Australia, after a similar inquiry. There has been a basic wage declared in Victoria in connexion, at any rate, with some classes of employees. </para>

                                <para>- Then I shall say that a rate of wage has been declared by the Government, at least, so far as the railway service is concerned. It does not matter very much whether we call it a basic wage or any other kind of a wage ; it is the recognised standard wage. And these various declarations are the standards for the various States. One would have thought that a Commission such as we set up would take these bases of wage payments in the different States, and that it would have made some pronouncement concerning them. Honorable members know that we cannot take the basic wages applying in various States, and reconcile them without further inquiry. &#34;We are driven back, therefore, to see how our own public servants are faring as they stand related to the various determinations of the States. That is our immediate obligation, and the Government are preparing to meet that obligation at the earliest possible moment. One thing stands out from all these inquiries, that is, that the rate of payment for our public servants is not an adequate rate, having regard to the decreased spending power of the sovereign and to conditions as they exist today in the Public Service. It is that concrete practical difficulty that the Government are immediately responsible for. It is that concrete practical difficulty which we propose to solve; and I know of no better way in which to solve it than, after having given the most careful consideration to the whole matter, to fix, at the earliest possible moment, irrespective of all the differing State rates, a rate for our own servants such as will do them substantial justice. </para>

                                <para>- -The honorable member is quite wrong ; &#163;4 4s. 8¾d., was it not? I do not pretend to be one of those clever gentlemen who can deal off-hand with the most intricate problems. I simply say that the Government is under an obligation to lose no time in arriving at this determination. It ought not to take us very long. It should be possible for us to deal with it, say, during the next Fortnight. The matter, however, cannot be dealt with in this House. It can be dealt with only after the most quiet and careful consideration elsewhere. I therefore invite the House to agree to this further amendment which I submit on behalf of the Government. It means substantial justice at the earliest possible moment to public servants; it proposes as soon as possible to do the fair thing by them . </para>

                        <para>Honorable members &#39;may speak of this difficulty and that with regard to the cost of living. But every one admits that the times are out of joint, and that it is difficult in these days for the working people of the continent to live. No one knows that better than do the people who, although outside the ranks of those who labour with their hands, are yet not blessed with too much of this world&#39;s goods. Every one admits  that conditions will not right themselves, either, for some time to come. The condition of things is abnormal. It seems to me that whatever we may do can be of only a temporary and tentative character. These matters must ultimately adjust themselves as the business conditions, the exchanges, and the production and trade and commerce of the world adjust themselves. In that way only shall we have the final adjustment. It will be brought about, not by your Courts, not by your Royal Commissions, but by the ordinary processes of production and trade throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>We are treating, therefore, a temporary, . and, let us hope, passing . phase of economics in this country - a phase which none the less presses with particular severity on the working people. It is in pursuance of our obligation under these temporary, shifting, and, let us hope, evanescent conditions, that we now make this proposal. It aims, first of all, at having regard to the wants and needs of the public servants of Australia. It aims, at the same time, at paying some due regard to the financial capabilities of the country to meet this kind of obligation. It is all very well to say that a man can live comfortably and decently and under reasonable conditions only by the payment of a wage which has been demonstrated to be an uneconomic one. </para>

In dealing with it the Government must be guided by what the resources of the country are in relation to the question, and by the necessities of its public servants. This further amendment meets both those factors, and I submit it to the House in the belief that it will bring a much needed and welcome addition to the incomes of the public servants of this country while at the same time leaving the country free to discharge its proper obligations. </para>

I desire now to deal with the further amendment which has just been submitted by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> From the very inception of the Commonwealth Parliament we have had no such experience as this. I cannot recall any case where the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in this House has moved an amendment on a motion submitted by the Prime Minister. Such a thing has never happened before. The veriest tyro in politics must know what has led to the submission of this further amendment. We all know what has happened upstairs. The1 Ministerial party has met, and has said, &#34; The amendment moved by the Leader of the Labour party is loaded. We shall need to make a further proposal in order to counteract its effects.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- I have not the slightest objection. I repeat that the Government and their supporters discovered that they dare not vote without explanation or qualification against the amendment that I had submitted on behalf of the Labour party, in which I . called upon the Government to stand up to the definite pledge made on their behalf by the Prime Minister to the people of Australia. This further amendment is, therefore, submitted as a way out for them. I would remind the House, however, that in the letters patent appointing the Commission there is no reference to public servants, nor is there any reference what- ever in this report to a basic wage for public servants as such. The whole report refers to the community as a whole, but I congratulate the public servants of the Commonwealth on the success of their agitation. Three weeks ago nothing was heard of them in this connexion, and nothing would have been heard of them- </para>

                        <para>The Treasurer told us in one breath that he had not read the Commission&#39;3 report, and, in the next, that it did not set. forth the basic wage provisions of the States. He said that in New South Wales the Board of Trade, after an exhaustive inquiry, had fixed the basic wage at &#163;&#39;&#177; 5s. per week; but was that inquiry as exhaustive as the Commission&#39;s inquiry? Will any one say that the amount recommended is outrageously high, or more than any one should receive? The right honorable gentleman wished to make out that the report of the Commission is absolutely valueless. </para>

I was careful last night to say that I did not reflect on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> in any way; but I said then, as I say now, that it was not fair for the Prime Minister to ask him at 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon to reply as soon as possible to certain questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> told the Prime Minister that he would let him have a reply to his questions at 9 o&#39;clock. He was careful to point out that under the Commission those questions could not be dealt with, and the Government, had they wished to have them dealt with, should have altered the Commission to enlarge the scope of the inquiry. The Treasurer has told us that he relies on the figures of the Government Statistician. Last night I referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> having omitted to take count of about 580,000 children. </para>

Now, SO per cent, of the children in the community are children of the working class, that is, four out of every five are wage-earners&#39; children. </para>

                        <para>I congratulate the public servants ou the success of their agitation. I am desirous, too, that the unions which have been appealing to the Arbitration Court, and were promised by the Prime Minister redress of their grievances, should be given a living wage. The Treasurer told us that the Commission docs not refer to the basic-wage rates of the States, but on pages 15 and 16 of this report there are eleven distinct  references  to the decisions of Judges and others. They do not give the figures. </para>
                        <para>The Government is anxious to get out of a hole. Ministers thought that the  debate on the amendment would continue, but we were right in taking a vote on it. The record of that division is what will stand. The Government ought to have kept the pledge which it made when it went before the people last year. </para>

I intend to express my views. We have been told by the Treasurer that figures have been supplied by the Government Statistician which show that it would mean bankruptcy to the country to apply the recommended basic wage to the public servants. Many of our public servants, no doubt, are underpaid and overworked, but the public servants, as a whole, must realize that the Service is too big for the country. </para>

                                <para>- A great deal has to be taken into consideration before deciding this matter. Our Public Service is too big and too expensive. As most persons are aware, there are hundreds in the Service who could be dispensed with ; and if the public servants were wise, they would attempt to drive out the drones, because the community has too big a burden to carry. Of what use would it be to apply a basic wage which would make the country bankrupt? Would it not be fairer and more honest to support the Prime Minister in his promise - and see that he kept to it - to deal properly with the Public Service? The Treasurer has said that Ministers will make up their minds within a fortnight. Ministers must take responsibility for whatever is done, and will be answerable to Parliament, which can send them about their business if it disapproves of their actions. I presume that a wage similar to the basic wage of the States will be adopted. I and others would support the payment to the public servants of a basic wage like that in force in New South Wales, which, I  think, they would be ready to accept. The Prime Minister has promised that the Government will look into the matter, and that an increased wage will be paid to the public servants as from the 1st November. I think that the public servants, if they could express their opinion, would be satisfied with that. Of what use would it be for them to demand a wage which the country cannot pay? Are we to ignore our pension obligations, and the other claims upon the Treasury, in order to pay the rate which the Commission recommends ? We must take a common-sense view of this matter. I know that many of the public servants are getting less than a living wage, and I say that the Government must give them a living wage, and must subsequently get its action ratified by Parliament. At the same time, I advise the public servants to get rid of a lot of the loafers in the Service, because there is a limit to what the country can pay. </para>

                        <para>I do not blame those who have conducted this agitation. After all, we had an agitation among ourselves when we found that we were underpaid. Those who were not receiving a living wage are right in agitating for more ; but the . demand can be overdone. The attempt is being; made to create political capital out of this matter, and I refuse to allow gentlemen opposite to put, unanswered, into <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> statements branding me and others with having less sympathy for the public servants than they have. Certainly, I am not prepared, as an electioneering dodge, to talk clap-trap and to advocate the payment of rates which it  has been shown by official figures would bankrupt the country. The Government have undertaken to fix before Christmas a fair basic wage for thepublic servants. The Prime Minister has pointed out that the cost of living has, within a certain, period, almost doubled, and that, therefore, the living wage must be doubled in that time. He proposes to take the proper course. If an attempt is made to create political capital out of this question, nothing will be gained, because it would require a strong cause to put out the &#39;Government. </para>
                        <para>I wish to make my position quite clear. I realize that quite a number of our public servants are not getting a fair living wage, and I hold the Government to their promise that within fourteen days from now they will make up their minds what is a fair basic wage. When Parliament again meets, the determination of the Government will be submitted to us, and if we think that the wage is not sufficient we can, of course, by a majority, decide to increase it. But if I think the wage fixed by the Government is sufficient, I shall not be led away to vote for one of &#163;5 16s when we are informed by the Statist and by the Treasurer that we cannot afford to pay it. What is the good of promising what we cannot perform? </para>

                                <para>- I do not say that Australia cannot afford to pay it; but I am prepared to follow the Statist and theTreasurer, the latter of whom, in strong and clear language, told us that to act on the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition would mean bankruptcy to the country. I advise the public servants to keep on their agitation, and see that they get a fair deal, but they will be ill-advised to allow politicians to make political capital out of them. After all, it is a pretty daring position to take up - that all the men who are prepared to give fair play are on the Opposition side of the House. The fact that a man holds what have been termed conservative views does not prove that he is not a fair minded man ; indeed, some of the most conservative of men are always prepared to pay a reasonable wage. Personally, I consider that the basic wage paid in New South Wales, which I believe is about &#163;4 5s. per week, would be a fair one to adopt for the Commonwealth Public Service. But whatever sum may be suggested, I am not prepared to put my judgment against that of the Statist and tie Treasurer. Of course, in places where living is expensive an extra allowance might fee given on that account, a policy already adopted in the Public Service. I am not in favour of differentiation, but it is only fair that an allowance of that kind should be made. There should also be some special consideration for those who live in localities where it is difficult to obtain the necessaries of life, and also for those with large families. Unless we use common sense we shall find ourselves on the edge of the precipice; and we ought to go slow. I can quite understand that those who cannot get bread and butter feel very much aggrieved, but it must not be forgotten that the Public Service is overloaded with thousands who are not required. </para>

In the country, on the other hand, we find the public servants overworked . and underpaid, sometimes one man doing two men&#39;s work. In the cities, as I say, we find hives of men . and women who could be dispensed with. </para>

                                <para>- But the Government cannot meet the expenditure that would be necessary under such an amendment as that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. I voted against that amendment, because I think it would put us in the position of not being able to meet the demand made on the finances. We have also to remember that provision has to be made for pensions for the invalided and aged, and for the soldiers; and I do not see how we could meet any further expenditure, considering that we are up to the limit of taxation. </para>

                                <para>- There are numbers of workers who are not wage-earners, and who have to pay taxes, such as selectors, farmers, and primary producers generally. Are they to have no consideration? We know very well that if we fix a &#34; wild-cat &#34; wage for the Public Service it will be taken as the standard of wages outside the Public Service. I refuse to be silent under the castigation of honorable members opposite, who seem to think that we are unfair because we are prepared to accept the common-sense proposal of the Government. After all, it is the Government, and the Treasurer in particular, <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> is responsible for the finances of the country. It is difficult to get accurate figures, but I have been told that the basic wage in New South Wales is &#163;4 5s. I do not know what the basic wage is in Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member must have been employing somebody recently. In &#34;Western Australia the basic wage is &#163;4 ls., and in South Australia just under &#163;4. Living is getting dearer, and my suggestion to meet the situation is that we accept the New South Wales wage as a fair standard. It will be the duty of the Government to ascertain and decide during the next fortnight what, in their opinion, is a reasonable average. We ought to go steadily, and not overdo things, or we may find the scheme tumbling down of its own weight. It would be easy, of course, for the Trea-surer to lavishly distribute the public money, but he has not an inexhaustible bank, and he must consider the taxpayers. When proposals are put forward for the betterment of country districts, we are often asked by honorable members, &#34;What about the consumers, as well as the producers?&#34; Let us on this occasion have some regard for the producers, and realize that to our resources there is a limit, which we have nearly reached. My suggestion, however, is the basic wage of New South Wales. </para>

I shall vote for &#163;4 5s. With such a wage, it is my opinion that the Public .Service would be satisfied, and I am not prepared, under all the circumstances, to seek popularity and a few extra votes by supporting a higher figure. </para>

                            <para>.- The scope of the inquiry referred to the Basic Wage Commission was, in my opinion, altogether inadequate. It was a Commission conceived in election times, and that the scope of the inquiry was inadequate is evidenced by the nature of the report and the necessity for additional information. This additional information is the most salient and important of all - even an ore important than the report itself. The Commission set out to ascertain what is a reasonable living wage for a man, his wife, and three children. The Commissioners estimated variously that amount at the present time to be something in the region of &#163;5 16s. per week; but after the Commission had submitted its report, .and had been asked for additional information, it is found that, in awarding that amount as a basic wage, it is awarding something which is to be provided for 2,100,000 non-existing children. We find that, instead of 3,000,000 children, the number estimated to be possessed, as it were, by 1,000,000 workers, is .90 per cent, for each worker. The report of the Commission, therefore, does not reveal the real position. Again, the Commission was not asked anything in regard to the possibility of the Commonwealth being able to pay the wage it considered adequate. It is highly important that this should be determined. We entered into a war along with the whole of. the Empire and certain Allies, and was it expected by any honorable member in this House that we could fight a bloody war of the kind against the greatest military power in the world, continuing it for nearly five years, and still enjoy all the privileges we had before it started ? I am sure that many of us felt that if we could succeed in holding our liberty, and living through the terra of our natural lives after a struggle of that kind, we would not be doing badly. But the proposition that here in Australia we have a right to expect to maintain a higher standard of living than obtained before the war is utterly unreasonable. I value the supplementary report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Basic Wage Commission, because it is highly significant. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> says, in fact, and in effect, that the wage of &#163;5 16s. cannot be paid without rendering the Commonwealth bankrupt. In other words, he means that we would be called upon to pay for our production more than would be the value of that which is produced, lt is a fanatical and utterly unreasonable request to ask for the payment of this basic wage as recommended by the Commission, and I feel quite sure that those who put it forward are paying too much consideration to their political position, and too little regard to the welfare. of Australia. We are also told in the supplementary report of the Commission that if a wage of &#163;5 16s. be granted, trouble will commence in the first three months, because with such  an addition to the cost of living, the purchasing value of the sovereign will so decrease that the Commission will need to be called upon again to institute a new inquiry, and fix upon a new standard. And so the vicious circle would continue to the end of things, which would arrive very speedily. It is impossible for a man to continue for long spending more than he earns. The only place for him is the Bankruptcy Court. If 1 am called upon to pay this increased wage, particularly at a time when I am selling my wheat to Australia at less than the world&#39;s parity, that is to say, if I am asked to continue producing wheat .at a very much higher cost, my position will be that I shall expect my children to work night&#39; and day for me without the basic wage, simply in order to provide other people with a high wage and cheap bread. If the basic wage is applied, it must increase the cost of production and also reduce production. And it has only to continue long enough in force to extinguish production altogether. Therefore, we must call a halt at some reasonable point. </para>

                        <para>In this House I have said before that the principle adopted in our Public Service is quite wrong. We have nearly 250,000 public servants in the service of 5,,000,000 people - one to &#39;every ten adults in the Coon mon wealth. The number is too high altogether, and the services rendered are not sufficiently co-ordinated on business lines. I am thoroughly in favour of the adoption of business methods in connexion with our Public Service, and I was hopeful that the Government would bring forward their Bill, which proposed to institute an inquiry into the management of the Service, and the possibility of adopting business methods. In fact, 1 would rather we had first proceeded with that Bill instead of dealing with the question of adopting the principle of a basic wage. I would like to see all public servants for whom a reasonable amount of work cannot be obtained in the Departments provided with other work in Australia outside the Service. Their removal would allow the payment of reasonable wages fo those who would be left in the Service. The Commonwealth and the States pay &#163;40,000,000 each year to the persons who render public service - I think a different state of affairs would be found if the work were let on contract subject to specification - and now it is proposed that this cost should be practically doubled, and we are asked to pay close on &#163;90,000,000 for the public services rendered to 5,000,000 people. It would be better to follow the advice of the Economies Commission, and rid the Commonwealth Service of men for whom a reasonable amount of work cannot be provided. In this way we could pay those remaining in the Service a decent salary. Those persons who are so inconsistent as to advocate the payment of a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. per week regardless of where the money is to be obtained with which to pay it, and at the same time urge a reduction of hours of labour, are, in my opinion, rushing headlong to destruction, and trying to drag down everything else with them. </para>

But no honorable member opposite has suggested that that principle should be laid down. I do not know whether any of them would support such an amendment, but it is absolutely within the power of this Parliament to establish that principle in this Bill. It is of no use merely to listen to speeches from them proclaiming that the Arbitration Court cannot do certain things because this Parliament has not the power to lay down principles. We have the power to do so in this Bill. We have the power to lay down a further principle which it is very necessary should be recognised, and </para>

                                <para>- What do the Government propose to do? They have the power, and we want to know. We are asked to give the Government <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche,</inline> with this provision super-added, namely, that we release them from carrying out their pledge. Why this sudden desire to do justice to the Public Service? When, during the debate upon the Arbitration (Public Service) Bill, the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> moved an amendment which sought to make it imperative upon the Arbitrator to fix a wage for the Public Service which would be not less than the basic wage as decided by the Basic Wage Royal Commission, we were told that the Government were waiting until the report of that Commission was available, when they would carry out its recommendations. The Government did not then tell us that they should give to the Commonwealth Public Service the same basic wage as has been prescribed by the different States. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> did not then suggest that &#163;4 5s. per week should be given to the publi&#39;c servants. When we asked the Government to give a wage about equal to the basic wages of the States, they said, &#39;&#39;Wait until we get our own Basic (Wage Commission&#39;s report. Why should we give what the States prescribe?&#34; Now we  have our own report, and the Government&#34; say, &#34; Let us give something like the State basic wage.&#34; Why do they say that? Because it is less. They .will not face the real position. The fact is that the Government and the Party behind them have allowed profiteering to become rampant in this country during the past few years that the cost of living has soared. The profiteer has been, allowed his full fling. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> showed clearly, in the course of his speech last evening, that while, during the war, there were some rise3 in wages, the manufacturers made proportionately far greater increases in profits. The cost of living during the war years became so great that some increases in wages were found to be absolutely necessary; but the rise in prices has been far in advance of the increases in wages. Now the Government wish to continue the same policy. They will not acknowledge their mistake, and they say, &#34; The recommendations of this Commission cannot be adopted.&#34; The Prime Minister has two replies. First, he says, &#34;As far as the outside workers are concerned, we have not the constitutional .power.&#34; And then, secondly, he says, &#34; If we had the power to grant this basic wage, the country would be ruined by granting it.&#34; As for the first argument, there is ample power in the Constitution to give effect to the findings of the Basic Wage Commission, not only with regard to Commonwealth public servants, but in respect of industrial workers outside. The Prime Minister does not deny that he has the power with regard to Commonwealth public servants; and I remind him that there can be no dispute concerning whether there is power to grant the basic wage in connexion with all matters such as InterState trade and the handling of commodities which are intended for transmission from one State to another. &#39;The Government have the power to fix a payment, as the basic  wage, according to the recommendations of the Commission. It is of no use, then, for the Government to allege some constitutional difficulty. I say there is no constitutional difficulty, and I assert that with some authority and with some knowledge of the subject. The time has come when this House must make some sort of declaration that will condemn the breaking of solemn pledges. The Prime Minister has broken every solemn pledge that he has made, and their violation has been condoned by the people. Was it not a solemn and definite pledge that the Prime Minister made in this case? Will any honorable member say that that pledge did not mean that effect was to be given to the findings of the Commission? Will any one say that the Prime Minister did not intend to convey to the public of Australia that he regarded the wage of a man with a wife and three children as the unit from which we should build up ? If the right honorable  gentleman  found that he had made a mistake, why did he not at once admit it? Why did he not come to the House, and say, &#34; I find I. have made a mistake. I want to be excused from the carrying out of my pledge.&#34; The fact is that this is but another illustration of the barefaced making of a pledge in order to get political support, and a subsequent barefaced breaking of that pledge. Honorable members are now asked to be parties to the breaking of that pledge. </para>

                                <para>- I deny that. The Labour party all through has contended for what my colleagues &#39;and I are contending this afternoon. We are not now raising this contention for the first time. Does the honorable member suggest that it is for mere party purposes that we ask the Government to honour their solemn pledge, and that we demand that the large body of public servants with wives and families in starving conditions shall have justice done them? </para>

We on this side can only protest and appeal, but honorable members opposite have the power to say to the Government, &#34; You shall do this thing.&#34; They do not, however, avail themselves of that power. They talk, but do nothing. Why have they allowed public servants during all these months to be paid a wage of only &#163;3 5s. or &#163;3 12s. a week, although they have wives and families to support. How often must some of these public servants and their families have gone hungry? We know that it is a characteristic of the Australian people to grin and bear their troubles. But during all that time honorable members opposite have had power to compel the Government to take action, and have seen fit only to talk about the matter. Why do they not act ? They are prepared now to vote for this further amendment, which excuses the Government&#39;s failure to honour its pledge, and says, in effect, to them,, &#34; Fix upon whatever you think is a fair and reasonable thing.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. It is useless for us to sit here unless we do something. The House has power to compel the Government to take action, and it is up to us to use that power. All the leading newspapers of this country, which usually support the Government, are ashamed of their tactics with regard to the basic wage. The Government are barefaced enough to make any pledge to a trusting public, and to break their pledges over and over again, merely that they may retain place and power. And to remain in power to do good for whom? For the class that made the Prime Minister a present  of &#39;  &#163;25,000. </para>

                        <para>This is only another of a long series of broken pledges on the part of the Government. But in regard both to this and the pledge made with respect to the wheat guarantee, honorable members are asked to condone the breaking of them. They are asked to excuse the Government - to actually vote to excuse their failure to give effect to  a  solemn pledge, and to give them <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to do what they like. </para>
                        <para>I am going to oppose this further amendment. If honorable members opposite wished, they could even now see to it that before the House adjourns we shall know exactly what the  Government  intend to do. If the amendment submitted on behalf of the Government is carried, all that we shall know is that they are going to scrap the Commission&#39;s report - that they will go back upon it and upon their pledge. If honorable members opposite would take action even now, we could have some definite pronouncement as to the specific amount which will be paid to the public servants of the Commonwealth, and I, personally, shall not be satisfied with anything else. </para>

                            <para>.- I have just awakened to the fact that the public servants of the Commonwealth during the past fortnight have secured from some honorable members of this House assistance which has never before been forthcoming at their hands. I regret that an honorable member opposite was prepared last night to descend to dirty tactics in regard to my position in this matter. According to press reports, he stated that, although there were more public servants in my electorate than in any other part of New South Wales, I had not been in the House during the week. </para>

                                <para>-I was here on Monday and Tuesday last, and the statement made by the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle),</inline> as reported in the press, is a deliberate and dirty falsehood. It could only have been made by a man who was prepared to abuse our soldiers during the war, and who did all he could to prevent reinforcements being sent to the aid of the men who were fighting for him and his like. It was, after all, only another illustration of the lack of principle displayed by men of the type of the honorable member. It is typical of the attitude which he adopted and maintained throughout the war. </para>

I shall never say anything in this House concerning an honorable member that I am not prepared to say to him outside. I am quite prepared to give an account of my stewardship to the public servants in my electorate, and to accept responsibility for whatever action I have taken, or whatever statement I have made in regard to them and the basic wage. I had an opportunity yesterday of. ascertaining the attitude of public servants in New South Wales in regard to this matter. As a matter of fact, I went to Sydney early this week largely with the object of ascertaining what their attitude was. </para>

                                <para>- I repeat that this question is being used by honorable members opposite for party purposes. Some time ago every honorable member in this House received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> the  president  of the Agitation Committee in Sydney, a telegram inquiring as to their attitude in regard to the basic wage. As a matter of fact, before that telegram had been sent, I wired &#39;to most of the secretaries of the Public Service Unions in New South Wales, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> expressing my views on the subject. But never once has a telegram from an honorable member on this side of the House to the Public Service organizations been published in Sydney. I challenged the person concerned in Sydney yesterday. I pointed out that my telegram had not been published, whereas no less than five telegrams from Labour members had been published in the one day. Effect has not been given to any suggestion made by me. There is a deliberate attempt, not only by honorable members opposite, but by certain people outside, to use this question for party purposes. I object to the Public Service being so utilized. </para>

                        <para class="block">Prime Minister of Australia, no matter who he might be, should be treated betterthan <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was treated on the Sydney Railway Station last night. </para>
                        <para>I consulted Public Service officials in Sydney yesterday as to their attitude in this matter, and the general expression of opinion was that they would be satisfied for the present with the promise made by the Government that probably within the next fortnight they would make an interim payment which would date from the 1st November last. Ever since I have been in this House I have urged that the Commonwealth Service is&#39; the worst paid Public Service in the whole of Australia. I repeat that statement today. After the reclassification scheme carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan,</inline> our public servants for a time were on a higher plane, but to-day they are the worst paid public servants in Australia. Their salaries have not advanced with the increase in the cost of living. </para>
                        <para>In order to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living, the Government should have done what was done at the inception of the Commonwealth with regard to Federal public servants in Western Australia. It was found, on investigation, that the cost of living in Western Australia at that time was 5 per cent, higher than in other States, and under a Public Service Regulation Commonwealth public servants there were granted an allowance of 5 per cent, on top of their salaries to compensate them. To-day the cost of living in Western Australia is lower than in several of the States, and I do not see why, for the time being, a regulation could not have been passed fixing allowances to bring up the wages of public servants to the level of the basic wage of &#163;4 5s. per week fixed in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> who spoke to me on the railway station yesterday, told me that he was satisfied with the statement of the Prime Minister. There was no justification for sending the telegrams which honorable members received. Members of the deputation came to the train, and endeavoured to drag the Prime Minister out of his carriage. I was asked whether I would remain here to keep a House, and I said that I was a supporter of the Government, and would do anything I could to assist the public servants in getting a fair wage. I am prepared to stay on now. What occurred at the Sydney station last night was a deplorable exhibition of larrikinism; I can call it nothing else. The main body of public servants remained outside, but fifty or sixty went on to the platform and gave one of the worst exhibitions of larrikinism I have seen. I told some of these men that they were not doing the Service any good, and advised them to go away and hold their meeting without harassing the Prime Minister; that there was nothing to be gained by that. This matter has been used for political party purposes, and the agitation is being engineered largely by the disloyal element in the Service. The best men in the Service are fighting their &#39; case fairly, without descending to the tactics that I have complained of. Those who were on the platform last night care only about stirring up disorder and discontent. They have no time for the Prime Minister or any honorable member on this side. There were probably sixty men and six girls on the platform, and only three of the men were wearing the returned soldier&#39;s badge, the remaining fifty-seven not having obeyed the call to serve. If I had my way, the Public Service would be cleaned up, and those who did not volunteer for active service, if they were eligible, would lose their jobs. I do not intend to sink the principles on which I was elected. I stood as a returned soldier, to see that the returned soldiers got justice, and I would not stay here to do the underground work of persons who did not obey the call. I intend to hold by the principles for which I fought. Last week, When speaking to the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> I said that no doubt honorable members opposite had the interests of the Public Service as much at heart as honorable members on this side. But I believe that the country cannot afford to pay a basic wage of &#163;5 17s. I am prepared, however, to <inline font-style="italic">hear</inline> the matter discussed, and to go to the fullest amount that we can afford. Had the Commission reported six months earlier, its recommendations could have been fully discussed. I hold that the public servant should be paid a fair wage. But I know, from my connexion with the Service, that there are men in it, though only a very small percentage, who Have no right to be there. It is, however, very hard to get rid of an  incompetent man. In some of the Departments I would give the head absolute control of his staff in respect to dealing with inefficient men. As it is, so long as a man keeps within the four corners of the Act, he can carry on, although he may be inefficient. When the Public Service Bill is again under discussion, I shall be able to show how several thousands of pounds could be saved annually by the adoption of a little business method in two branches of the Postal Department. No doubt, honorable members generally wish the public servants to be fairly recompensed, and I think that the Service is satisfied that the Government intend to do a fair thing by them. I regret that the report was not presented earlier; but I am prepared to stand behind the Government in the promise that within fourteen days a determination will be arrived at respecting an interim payment, which will date from the 1st November. I hope that the House will support that. </para>

                        <para>- I give the honorable member the same reply that the Government usually gives to us - wait and see. This discussion will have a great effect on the working classes of the country. The rejection by the Government of the Basic Wage Commission&#39;s report is good. It will open the eyes of the working men and women to the farces that are perpetrated in the name of constitutional government, and under the plea of Democracy. It will show them how much the ballot is worth. </para>

                <para>Mr.CONSIDINE.- And the honorable member is not doing a &#34; star turn &#34; at present. The Government tell us, and their supporters by inference give us to understand, that it is proposed to reject the recommendations of the Commission, and to adopt the New South Wales rate of &#163;4 5s. a week as fixed by the Board of Trade. The Government reject, not a majority report, but, according to the employers&#39; representatives, a unanimous report, so far as the main essentials are concerned, and treat it as so much waste paper. </para>

                        <para>- According to his own statement, the Prime Minister was so astounded on receiving the report that he referred it to the  Chairman  of the Commission in order to see how it could be carried into effect. The Prime Minister read the memorandum of the  Chairman,  intimating the course of procedure which could be adopted by the Prime Minister, if he saw fit, and, of course, by Parliament. &#34;The Government now propose to adjourn the House, having taken care to obtain Supply which will carry them approximately to the first fortnight in July. Honorable members will be dispersed all over the country, and the Government will be given a free hand to do as they please with regard to this report. For six months, or thereabouts, we shall have absolutely no chance of even criticising the Government, and if we criticise them outside we shall probably run foul of the War Precautions Act as &#34; repealed.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If the working men and women have to depend upon that kind of help I do not think they will be very much advanced. However, my view is that the Government cannot put this report into operation because the employing interests of the country will not permit them to do so, and, therefore, the Prime Minister who has landed his party in this predicament has to find some other way out. As usual, no matter what the opinion of experts or the evidence may be, the Prime Minister intends to brush them aside and do what he thinks proper. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure we all appreciate the unconscious humour of the honorable member. The Prime Minister cannot allow the matter to rest where it is now. If he wishes to remain Prime Minister, he and his supporters must do as their masters, the employing interests of the country, tell them. The only advantage of this discussion is that it will show the people outside what they have to expect from the deliberations of the House, and from Commissions appointed by the Government which is nominally in control of Australia at the present time. The workers, and also the primary producers, have to learn by experience that their interests are in common. </para>

That is what I have been pointing out ever since I came here ; only last evening I. said that the conditions of the world generally - the commercial and international conditions - determine conditions in this country. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and his associates of the Country party seem to take the view that when prices drop in Europe the person who has to bear the brunt is the unfortunate employee. </para>

                        <para>- No, I belong to the international section, which I fancy is rather too broad a conception for the honorable member. I remind him, if he does not already know, that the combination for which I am agitating has been adopted by his fellow primary producers in Canada. In Manitoba and several of the wheat-producing districts of Canada, industrialists have joined hands with the primary producers to form a joint Farmers&#39; Labour party, and with very good results. In Europe there is a similar combination against their common exploiters. The Government appointed, the Basic Wage Commission at great public expense, and when this unexpected bombshell of a report was dropped into the camp, they simply ignored it, the workers being left to console themselves with reading it, together with the prophecies of ruin, which, according to honorable members opposite, would follow its adoption. It is a curious fact that in every instance where it is proposed to increase wages or reduce hours to any noticeable extent, or to do anything to materially benefit the working classes, the employers&#39; representatives immediately declare that the country is about to be ruined. That was the prophecy when a. ten-hour day was sought instead of a fourteen -hour day in Great Britain, and the same argument is U6ed in America at the present time in reference to the exploitation of child labour. Every step attempted to be taken to improve the lot of the bottom dog always produces a crop of Jeremiahs among the capitalistic class, who tell the people that the country will be ruined, and that the improved conditions desired cannot possibly be granted. The. only value to be derived from- this discussion, and from the report of the Commission itself, is the educational effect it will have on the working classes outside Parliament. It lies with the great working classes of this country,, including the great mass of public servants, if they wish to get these improved  conditions, to use their intelligence, their power of organization, and their solidarity, with the. object of bringing pressure to bear on the Government to force them to carry out not only the recommendations of the Royal Commission, but also such alterations in the existing social order as will make it impossible again for any Government to suggest the repudiation of its own Commission&#39;s recommendations. </para>

                        <para>-  I repeat that it is fine material for criticism when we find that a Government which has appointed a Com- mission to make a certain inquiry chooses to ignore the report of that Commission when it learns the nature of its findings. But, although the Government does consider it absolutely impossible to put this report into effect, there are honorable members who would make an attempt to achieve the impossible, namely, to pay a basic  wage of &#163;5 16s. per week to the least efficient workman in the community - that is what the payment of a basic wage means  - while  paying a proportionately higher wage for skill and more arduous work. I am prepared to question the contention of the honorable member for WestSydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> that this Parliament has the power to put into effect this basic wage in all the industries of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government can certainly fix upon a basic wage for its own employees, even at the amount which the Commission has recommended as necessary to enable a workman to pay for what are considered reasonable comforts; but it certainly would not be right for the Government to fix for its own employees a wage that could not be earned by those doing similar work outside the Service. We must pay our public servants a wage that will enable them to live in reasonable comfort, and a wage equivalent to what they could earn outside the Service. Otherwise we shall lose the best of them, and the Service will become very much less efficient than it is to-day. Many honorable members contend that it is necessary to give it a complete overhaul. But if we are to pay our public servants a wage of &#163;516s. per week for the lightest and easiest class of work, what are we to pay the men working in the mines, forests, and fields, who do hard and rough work? Surely they are entitled to a higher wage than is paid to those who have light employment in our Public Service, and who enjoy all the nice comforts demanded by city dwellers? Of course, if persons prefer to live in the city they can have all these comforts; &#39;but if we choose to ill-pay our servants, some of them will have the courage to face the hardships of life, and, being anxious to enjoy what every man desires, a comfortable home, will leave the Service, leaving behind them the worst to do our work, when we ought to have the best. However, if we pay &#163;5 16s. per week to those employed in the Public Service and those engaged in city industries, whose cause the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> particularly supports, the men who work in our forests, mines, and fields will be compelled to work for less remuneration, because this wage has to be earned before it can be paid. If a man in the city is paid a wage over and above what he actually earns, it has to be made up from somewhere, and certainly the loser will be the man who works in the fields to provide food at the cheap rate demanded by the city dweller. The honorable member for Yarra and others have said that an industry that will not pay what they consider to be a fair wage should not continue to exist. There never was a greater absurdity uttered in this House. Are we going to close down one-third of our mines in Australia because they will not return &#163;5 16s. per week to all the men employed in connexion with them ? Would it not be equivalent to a man cutting his throat because he could not have all the comforts he desired? Would it not be an absurdity for any one to contend that, because rural industries cannot provide all employed in them with a wage of &#163;5  16s. per week, we should therefore cease altogether the production of potatoes, cabbages, fruit, wheat, and other commodities absolutely necessary for the life of the people? There are men employed in the occupations I have referred to who do not earn &#163;5 16s. per week, and who cannot expect to do so in view of the prices ruling for their productions. If all the men employed to-day in producing butter were to receive a wage of &#163;5 16s. for a week of forty-four or forty-eight hours, instead of butter being 2s. lOd. per lb., as it is to-day, it would have to be 6s. per lb.&#187; &#34;Will the honorable member for Yarra and other honorable members opposite say that because the dairying industry does not return to all employed in it &#163;5 16s. for a week of forty-four hours they should cease to milk cows and produce butter ? </para>

                <para>Honorable members must realize that a wage has to be earned before it can be paid. It is perfectly certain that many industries carried on in Australia to-day cannot pay the basic wage which the Commission has said is necessary to secure for the people engaged in them reasonable comfort in life. Royal Commissions have their own way of arriving at conclusions. This Basic Wage Commission took evidence from partisan witnesses on both sides. The witnesses for one side said that they required much higher wages than they were getting, and they gave evidence as to the prices they paid for food, clothing, .and rent. I do not suppose that any one will deny that some of the evidence given before the Commission with regard to the cost of commodities and the cost of living was very greatly exaggerated. Witnesses for the other side put the cost of commodities at a much lower rate, and differed from the other witnesses as to the food and clothing required to give a reasonable standard of comfort. </para>

                        <para>- They did. The Royal&#39; Commission struck a balance between the two testimonies in trying to arrive at a wage necessary to provide for reasonable comfort. I believe that three members of this House, by a little reckoning, could, in the course of a day, decide the real cost of living to-day and the wage necessary to enable men to live in reasonable comfort, and be very much nearer the mark than the amount fixed by a Royal Commission that has cost thousands of pounds, and occupied -many months in its inquiry. I say, without any hesitation, that the proposal put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> in his memorandum for differentiating between married and single could not be given effect, and will not bear examination. It is quite unworkable. I do not think there is a political party in this Parliament that would attempt to put it into effect. </para>

                        <para>- That would not be a bad idea, but I remind the honorable member that honorable members opposite were loud in their protests that they were not being given an opportunity to discuss this matter. I am not taking up much of the time of the House, but I have no intention -to permit the question to go to a vote without giving some reasons why I could not vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra. I am of opinion that this House should not be turned into a wage-fixing tribunal. We have already too many such tribunals in Australia. Every State has its own. We have a Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and only the other day we passed a Bill to establish a new system1 by which to arrive at the Tight wage &#39;to pay members of the Public Service. In spite of all these tribunals and Acts of Parliament, it is now proposed that we should fix the basic wage ourselves. If that is not a good example of extravagance, I should like to hear- of a better. </para>

                        <para>- They represent only a section of the community. I contend that this Parliament has not the power to fix the basic wage to be paid in all industries, and if it has, then, &#34; in my opinion, it should not&#39; have such power. In the interests of the efficiency of the Public Service, as well as in the interests of justice to those employed in it, they should be paid a fair wage, and one equivalent to what they could earn outside the Service. Further than that I am not prepared to go. As the Government have decided to fix the basic wage for the Public Service I hope that it will be a fair wage after considering what might be earned by the same people in industries outside the&#39; Service. Taking the public servants as a whole, they are not, in my opinion, so badly treated as some would indicate in the wires they have sent to me and to other honorable members. If they had to leave the Service and go to work in the back blocks, where there are none of those comforts and attractions such as were described in the course of evidence before the Commission, they would soon learn that they have not been quite so: badly treated as some allege. Nevertheless, if the Government decide that the Public Service is underpaid, the wrong must be put right without delay. There is just this, further, that if the Government come to the conclusion that for some time the Public Service  ha6  been underpaid, they should certainly have remedied that wrong without waiting for the report of the Basic Wage Commission, the recommendations of which the Prime Minister now tells us cannot possibly be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is gratifying, although the result was disappointing, to remember that a definite vote was taken to-day upon the actual subject-matter of this discussion before the Treasurer&#39;s side-stepping and camouflaging amendment was moved. The supporters of the Government, having been caught napping, advantage has been taken of the opportunity to show to the public servants, and to the people generally, exactly where honorable members stand. To vote in support of the amendment moved by the Treasurer will now be tantamount to indorsing the action of the Government in deliberately breaking the pledge made on the occasion of the last election campaign to public servants. </para>

                    <para>The Government is, therefore, appointing ft Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war, and also how the basic wage may bead justed to the present purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. TheGovernment will, at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. </para>

The Commissioners say that such-and-such a rate shall be the basic wage for one State, and that such-and-such shall be the basic wage for another State. Those are the . principles of their findings; and the Prime Minister said in his election pledge that at the earliest possible moment the Government would set about giving effect to those principles. The principles were contained in the report of the Commission. The amendment of the Treasurer, if carried, will mean a violation of a definite promise. </para>

                        <para>- It is regrettable, all the same. I am sorry that the Government should violate their principles, because of the effect upon the Public Service, and the working people of Australia generally. I am glad that they should violate their principles if the violation will have the effect of helping to get  rid of the Government. Who is responsible for the findings of the Commission? Why was the basic wage established at such high rates ? Can the Government relieve themselves of responsibility ? The recommendations of the Commission were placed at such a high standard because profiteering has been allowed so to flourish that the purchasing power of the sovereign has been tremendously decreased. If the Prime Minister had not made known to the country that it was not the intention of the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Commission, he would not have journeyed to Sydney in quite such good heart to receive that gift of &#163;25,000. Indeed, he might not have got the money at all unless he had first given the assurance that he did not intend to give effect to the finding of the Commission; or, if he did receive it, it would not have been handed over with such good will as seems to have been at the back of the presentation. </para>

                <para>It was pitiful to listen to the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> whose name has been connected with telegrams received on every side. The honorable member said yesterday that he. would make one to sit here and secure a definite vote upon the subject of the basic wage. To-day, he says, &#34; I do not think we can pay what is recommended by the Commission, but I am quite prepared to sit here and find out what is a fair thing.&#34; Very well ! That is in keeping with the terms of his message to the public servants in Sydney. But what happened here to-day? What was the attitude of the honorable member? He did not rise, and say, &#34; We should be prepared to sit here this week, and even next week until we decide what is a fair basic wage.&#34; He did not think it worth while. He waited until a vote was taken, and without uttering a word of protest supported the Government who have violated the pledge they made before the elections. He did not even speak, but when the mischief was done, and the . vote recorded, he rose with an intention of expressing certain views that could have no effect. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to allow the matter to be smothered up, because the question is of great importance, and affects thousands of men and women in the Commonwealth, and if the Treasurer&#39;s amendment is defeated, it will be an instruction to the Government to keep its pledge. It is a matter that should be, and must be, exposed. Of course, it is not unusual for this Government to break their pledges. They had no hesitation in doing so in connexion with their guarantee of 5s. per bushel for wheat at railway sidings. But because they have broken their pledges on previous occasions, that is no reason why they should continue violating the pledges given to the electors. It is the duty of honorable members to publicly expose the Government, and to show clearly that they are not keeping faith with the electors. I have in my possession quite a number of letters which clearly illustrate the unfortunate position in which many of our public servants are placed, but it will be sufficient to briefly quote one or two. I shall  take a case, which is typical of many, of a postal employee who was sent to an irrigation area just beyond my electorate at a wage of &#163;90 per annum, or 35s. per week. This unfortunate employee, although receiving such a small remuneration, was compelled to pay &#163;2 10s. per week for board. Of course, he was not able to do it, and after endeavouring to do so for a while, and finding that he was running into debt, he obtained work with the Irrigation Trust, which paid him &#163;4 lis. 6d. per. week. Is this not a striking contrast? In 1914 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon fixed the basic wage for New South Wales at &#163;2 Ss. per week. I have  before  me particulars of a married clerical officer in grade 2, class 4 of the Commonwealth Public Service who was at that time receiving &#163;245 per annum,  Or  &#163;120 per annum above the basic wage which represented an additional payment for skill and responsibility. To-day that officer in the same class is being paid &#163;245 per annum, plus a war bonus of &#163;32, which makes his salary &#163;277 per annum, which means that the amount that he can claim for skill and responsibility apart from his bonus is &#163;21 as against &#163;120 previously. On the basis  Of  the Royal Commission&#39;s finding, which provides &#163;5 17s. per week, he would not receive even &#163;30 as an additional remuneration for skill and responsibility but there would be a deficit of &#163;26, as that margin has been entirely dispensed with. There are a number of other cases which I could mention. In New South Wales, for instance, the railway servants are paid in accordance with a basic wage of &#163;4 5s. per week, and to institute a striking comparison I may mention the wages of the railway telegraphic staff in New South Wales and the postal telegraphic staff. One officer with twenty-five years&#39; experience in a country post-office receives &#163;280 per annum,. whilst an officer on the railway telegraphic staff in a town a few miles away with ten years&#39; service receives <inline font-style="italic">&#163;31 S</inline> per year. .There is also the case of an officer with thirty-six years&#39; experience, who is at present in the Commonwealth telegraphic service and who receives &#163;212 per annum, and one in the railway telegraphic service with six years&#39; service who is in receipt of &#163;255 per annum. There are also two officers, one on the railway telegraphic &#39;staff and another on the Commonwealth telegraphic staff. The Commonwealth employee with six years&#39; service receives &#163;126 per annum, and the State employee on the railway telegraphic staff, also with six years&#39; experience, receives &#163;255 per annum. I do not suggest that the amount paid to the employee on the Railway telegraphic staff is too much. According to the findings of this Commission, he is not getting enough; but <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will be seen that whereas a Commonwealth officer in the Post and Telegraph Service receives only &#163;126 a year, an officer doing similar work in the State railway service is receiving &#163;255 per annum, or &#163;4 18s. as against &#163;2 Ss. per week. While officers in the telegraph branch of the railway service have been receiving a basic wage for a number of years, not a supporter of the Government, before the presentation of this report, was prepared to utter a word in favour of the levelling up of Commonwealth servants. Not a word was uttered by them in favour of bringing such officers into line with those working on the basic wage operating in the State. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a very pertinent inquiry, which might well be addressed to the Prime Minister if we could find him. Ever si nee this discussion started this &#34; afternoon, he has not seen fit to come into the House to explain why he stands for the breaking of a solemn pledge, for which he, above all other members of the Government, is most responsible. He certainly did come in for a few moments to refer to a telegram, the truth of the statements in which he denied. That telegram was sent to honorable members by the  chairman  of the movement <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. O&#39;Connor)</inline> to secure the basic wage for Commonwealth employees. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, one of the Prime Minister&#39;s most docile  supporters subsequently eulogized the  chairman  of the movement. We know what object the Prime Minister had in view in referring to the name of the render of that telegram. He knows that if lie can only succeed in dividing our public servants amongst themselves, -the whole issue will be side-tracked. And so he resorts to his old tactics. I do not believe, however, that his attitude is indorsed, or that it will be countenanced, by the great bulk of those who sit behind him. It is inconceivable that they could indorse it. When the right honorable gentleman wants to extricate himself from an awkward position, he invariably raises as a side issue something that will appeal to the passions and prejudices of the people. That is what he did this afternoon. It was a most discreditable action. He referred by name to a gentleman who, I presume, was voted to the position of  president  of the Agitation Committee by the great body of public servants in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that. In order to camouflage the attitude of the Government, he refers specially to this man&#39;s name, and says that the demand for the basic wage is being made, not by the Public Service generally, but only by a section of it, and that this agitation is -being engineered by some hidden force. In this way the Prime Minister endeavours to cover up the shame of his having violated a solemn pledge. He is not likely, however, to bamboozle the Public Service or the great mass of the people. The Public Service of the Commonwealth are alive to their own interests, and will not allow themselves to be influenced by any such consideration as that suggested by the right honorable gentleman in such attempts. I think he largely stands alone. </para>

                <para>There is only one other aspect of this question to which I desire to refer. From time to time discussions have taken place in this House, as well as on public platforms, as to the efficacy of Labour Governments in certain States. I have beard the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> say, on many occasions, as was said during the recent Queensland and other State elections, that the cost of living in Queensland, where ;a Labour Government has been in power for some years, is not less than that in any other State. We. now have the definite finding of an independent Commission that a basic wage of &#163;5 6s. per week is sufficient in. Queensland, as compared with a basic wage running up to &#163;5 17s. per week in States whore anti-Labour Governments have been in office for years. No one can deny these figures. They show that, as the result of a Labour Government having been in power for years in Queensland, the cost of living there is from 16 per cent, to 20 per cent, less than in any other State of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member cannot get away from the fact that the report of this independent Commission shows that the cost of living in Queensland is less than in other parts of the Commonwealth. &#39;If every State had been controlled by a Labour Government, as Queensland has been for some years past, the Commonwealth today would not be in the hopeless position . of being financially unable, according to the Government, to give effect to the findings of the Commission. These figures of an independent authority prove that as a result of Labour legislation in Queensland, the people there have a cheaper loaf, and a cheaper breakfast table, and are able to enjoy a greater modicum of comfort than the people of any other State. That is a very pleasing feature of this report. It is sad to learn from it that the public servants of the Commonwealth have been ground down for a number of years, and have been living under conditions infinitely worse than those of their fellow servants in the employ of the States. The Commission has made the fullest inquiries, and has  occu-pied  over twelve months in collecting the data upon which it bases its findings a3 to what is a fair basic wage. There is, therefore, no reason for further delay. </para>

                    <para>.- I am convinced that every honorable member of this House desires to do the right thing by the employees of the Commonwealth. The only question that concerns us is how are the Government going to give effect to the recommendation of the Commission ? I am afraid we have got into a tangle because of the different basic wage rates declared by different tribunals. I doubt very much whether these inquiries0 have produced any very satisfactory results, but it is one thing to criticise a report and another to suggest a remedy. I regret that the scope of the Commission did not include an instruction to inquire how the basic rate of wage to be declared could be given effect to, and I agree with the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> that the first requisite of any democratic country is that its employees shall be paid a sufficient living wage to insure all the reasonable comforts that people may expect to enjoy. We are now confronted with the deliberate statement that it is impossible to pay  every employee &#163;5 16s. or &#163;5 17s. per week, according to the State- in which such employee lives, which the Commission has declared to be the basic rate of wage &#39;for a man, his wife- and three children. The  Chairman  of the Commission <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Piddington),</inline> whose opinion must be respected, has made a suggestion as to how the recommendation may be carried out, namely, by paying one rate of wage to the unmarried man and another rate to the married man with children. </para>

                        <para>- That statement has been made several times, but so far as I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington&#39;s</inline> suggestion, the employers would be called upon to pay the &#39;same wage to all employees, whether married or single, but that in addition to such payment the employers shall pay into a special fund .a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount for all their employees, married or single, from which a payment of 12s. per week shall be made for each child. This is rather a revolutionary scheme, but it is not altogether new. It is similar, I think, to the proposal made by the Holman Government not very long ago in New South Wales, but which, I believe, was found to be impracticable. </para>

                        <para>- It may have been, but I know the suggestion was made, and I regret that it was not given effect to. It might not have been successful, but I think we shall have to experiment along those lines. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> the payment of the basic wage to every employee in &#39;the Commonwealth would represent an additional expense of &#163;93,000,000 per year, and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> an additional expense of &#163;101,000,000. It needs very little thought to realize that this would be an impossible burden for the industries of the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> has shown that it would be impossible for some of the most important industries to pay this rate of wage, and that, if it were adopted, they would have to close down altogether. In the interests of the workers themselves, it is only fair that the Government should have opportunity for further consideration of this report. It is generally acknowledged that the wages at present being paid in the Public Service are not sufficient, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has promised to increase the amount up to the old basic rate of wage, plus the present purchasing power of the sovereign, that is, the wages shall have the same purchasing power as in 1907. This, it is admitted, is only a temporary expedient for the purpose of giving the Government time to look more carefully into the recommendations of the Commission, and the drastic suggestions made by the  Chairman  in his memorandum. The suggestion that the report will be pigeon-holed and forgotten is altogether unfair. The whole position is to be reviewed, and the Government will make a suggestion as to how best to give effect to the report of the Commission, so that every man and woman in the Commonwealth Public Service, at any rate, and, incidentally, all those employed in Australian industries, may get a fair living wage. I do not see anything unreasonable in this proposal. It appears to me to be the only way by which the difficulty may be overcome. For that reason I welcome the amendment proposed, and intend to give it my support. </para>

                    <para>.- As the representative of the city of Sydney, where a large proportion of the population of Australia is concentrated, I feel compelled to say a few words about the report of the Commission that was appointed by the Government to inquire into the basic wage question. It is to be regretted that certain honorable members are in a flippant mood, because, in my judgment, no more important document has ever been presented to the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                <para>The Basic Wage Commission was appointed to give effect to an election promise of the Prime Minister, and no one knows better than he that it was intended that its recommendations should apply to the whole of the industrial life of Australia, and not to the Federal Public Service alone. My Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> pointed out that the fixing of a basic wage was first discussed in 1906, and in 1908, in what is known as the Harvester case, a basic wage was embodied in an award of the Arbitration Court. From that time unto the present that award has not been reviewed. No exception was taken to the composition of the Commission, because the men appointed as representatives of the employers and employees were closely identified with those sections of the&#39; community  respectively; nor has it been said that the Commission&#39;s recommendations are not based on the evidence which was put before it. Before any matter affecting conciliation, arbitration, industrial peace, and the like, can be dealt with, there must be an agreement as to .the basic wage of the industry concerned. </para>
                <para class="block">This National Parliament is the only body that can settle the matter for the whole of Australia. Yet honorable members opposite have employed all their ingenuity to prevent a direct vote being taken, and to avoid facing the issue. It will not be disputed that the party in power is under the influence of the employing section of the community, and, when the Commission &#39;6 report reached the Prime Minister, his first thought was for the interests of that section, not for those of the public servants or of the general community. Therefore, he took steps to obtain a document - which was produced at a speed hitherto unknown - to cloud the recommendations of the Commissioners. I do not think that he should have done that.  His  course was to take the House into his confidence, so that one of Australia&#39;s chief problems might be solved, and the cause of industrial peace advanced thereby. Undoubtedly the Crown, as an employer,- should, in its treatment of the public servants, set an example to other employers. But this Government has paid no proper regard to the Federal Public Service. Honorable members generally have complained that the public servants are not paid what they should receive for the work that they do for the community. Will any one say that the people of Australia wish their, servants to be underpaid? The State Governments have applied basic rates in the payment of their public services, and the Federal Commonwealth Service should have been similarly treated. As for the cry that the country cannot afford to pay the recommended basic wage, I say that there never was a reform which meant the shortening of hours, the. increasing of pay. or the improvement Qf any condition without the objection being raised that it could not be done, be? cause it would ruin the country. We never hear it said, however, when railway and tramway fares are raised, &#39; when farmers are getting 9s., 10s., and 15s. a bushel for their wheat, when the prices of meat, butter, and other foodstuffs are increasing by 100, and in some cases 200, per cent., and when there is a general  rise in prices, that the country will be ruined, &#39;and that the people cannot afford to pay what is asked of them. The members opposite display a spirit of callous indifference. They show an utter disregard of the interests of the workers. I well remember the occasion upon which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> W. Osullivan, Minister for Works in the Government of New South Wales, decided to increase the pay of railway navvies to 7s. per day. The proposal was denounced by the press as an impossible one, and the cry was immediately raised that the country could not afford to pay it. But, as a matter of fact, the country did pay it, and no serious results followed. This afternoon, the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> stressed the point that the fruit-growers of the Commonwealth would not be able to&#39; grow fruit if the industry were compelled to pay this basic &#34;wage. But of what use is it for anybody to produce  commodities if the people do not possess sufficient  money to purchase them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It seems to me that honorable members have not realized the true significance of the report of the Basic Wage Commission, and how intimately the adoption &#171;of the recommendations of that body will affect the  daily  lives of our people. I intend to send a few copies of that report to the Old Country, and &#39; also to America, accompanied by some comments, and I am confident that before very long the Labourparty in those countries will be following in our footsteps. What a splendid advertisement it would be for Australia, especially when it is seeking; to attract a large stream of immigrants to its shores, if we could point with pride to the fact that we were paying the basic wage which has been recommended by the Commission ! As honorable members are aware, a supplementary report upon this matter &#34;has been issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> - a report- containing a mass of figures. The impression conveyed by this supplementary report is that the industries of Aus&#171;tralia cannot afford to pay the basic wage recommended by the Commission. I have no hesitation in saying- that this country is well able .to pay a basic wage sufficient to enable all workers to maintain themselves and their families in a reasonable degree of comfort. </para>

                <para>As a representative of Sydney, I know that I am expected to voice the opinions of my constituents. As I said before, I am sorry that the House has not displayed that spirit and frame of mind which are necessary to the proper consideration of this question. Whether the report of the Commission be a proper one or not, we should have set ourselves determinedly to solve the problem involved. However indifferent honorable members may be, or however much they may try to side-track the issue, it is an  issue  which must be settled sooner or later. What is the good of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act, or our Industrial Peace Act, unless there is some standard on which decisions may be based ? There is no doubt that once a standard is available, much of the work of the Court will be rendered unnecessary, and the congestion of business to that extent relieved. The question of wages crops u,p in almost every case which comes before our arbitration tribunals, and it is a great pity that one of the most important reports ever tabled should lack proper consideration because of mere political prejudice. </para>

                    <para>.- I have to admit at the outset that I have not given a great deal of study to the report which is the subject of discussion today; but to the extent to which I have dipped into it I&#39; feel that it provides no reliable store of information to enable me to solve the difficult problem that is before Parliament at the present time. This Commission has taken twelve months for its investigations, and has covered a great deal of ground. It has produced a report abounding in much pseudo-scientific terminology ; but it seems to me to have missed altogether some of the simplest and most fundamental propositions that ought to be embodied in a report of the kind. The idea of determining a basic wage is altogether a pernicious one. There is no such &#39;thing as a basic wage, in spite of the amount of talk devoted to the subject. When the suggestion was added that the Commission should consider and inquire into some methods by which wages may be identified with the rise and fall of the- value of the sovereign, I say without hesitation that it was given an absolutely impossible task. I am surprised, indeed, at any practical man attempting to carry into effect the suggestions embodied in the instructions by the Prime Minister. The Commission deals very learnedly, to all appearances, in scientific terms of quite formidable character. It speaks of &#34;tentative regimen,&#34; &#34;calories,&#34; and &#34; coefficients,&#34; until one would imagine that the members of the Commission are highly technical and skilled experts in these matters. That, in my opinion, to a large extent is misleading the country. I do not think that any of those gentlemen are anything more than amateurs in regard to investigations along these lines, and I feel sure that in some regards they are fundamentally at fault. It is suggested that a basis can be found for the cost of living in the amount of calories - to use the so-called scientific term - required to enable a man to carry on an average day&#39;s work. Here is where the mistake is made by the Commission, and it is a mistake habitually made by all theorists in dealing with matters that refer to human beings. The elusive human element is left out of sight or forgotten altogether. When any one talks to me about so many &#34;calories&#34; being required to produce a certain amount of health and vigour, I say, as one who has had considerable association- with working conditions of various kinds, that it is a notable fact that men who sometimes live on the most meagre diet show more energy, and carry out more work, than others alongside them who eat three times the quantity. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very sensible observation, which I commend to the honorable member for a little more study than he has given to the subject up to the present. I remind honorable members that a certain quantity of goods can be bought from the grocer, baker, or butcher, which, handed over to one housewife,&#39; will produce sufficient satisfying and healthy food for a big family for a whole week, while the same materials, handed to another woman, will starve a family in a couple of days. These are facts which have to be taken &#39; into consideration. When I am told that it requires &#163;5 16s. to keep a family of five - two adults and three children, I say that, while a man is entitled to that amount, if he earns it. there are numerous larger families maintained ,  and well maintained, in Australia to-day on considerably less. I do not for a moment say that there should be anything less than a living wage for everybody in this country I am merely indicating one of the reasons for discounting, to a large extent, the findings of the gentlemen who constituted this Commission. Then, again, , if they had taken into consideration the simplest facts of political economy, they must have realized that, in establishing this basic one to-day, they were creating conditions that would require a recasting of the wage a. few days later; in other words, the addition to the extent suggested to the cost of production would undoubtedly increase the prices of production, so that the community would, to use a homely allegory, be exactly in the same position as a puppy dog chasing its own tail. Therefore, I say that the money and time devoted to this inquiry are very much misapplied, and I cannot acquit the Prime Minister himself of a considerable proportion of the responsibility. The suggestion he made was one which is somewhat &#39;characteristic of him as a way of getting out of a difficulty, but it was an ill-judged suggestion. He had sufficient evidence before him, if he wished to treat the public servants fairly, to. have taken action without waiting for twelve months for this ponderous and unpractical report. </para>

                <para>The Opposition have made considerable play on this issue. I suppose it is one of the misfortunes in regard to politics and parliamentary action, that when a subject does offer an opportunity for any party to make good upon, the opportunity will be seized. I am certain that if members of the Opposition had been sitting on the Government benches when this report was presented, they would have had to take up exactly the position that has been taken up by the present Government. It would have been forced upon them by circumstances. There is indeed no alternative offering to any Government in regard to the propositions included in the report. </para>
                <para>I admit that the time is more than ripe for some attention to be given to the conditions affecting particularly the lower classes of the Public Service. These men and women have been grossly underpaid for many years past, and the manner in which the vast majority of them have continued to carry out their work under  the unsatisfactory and discouraging circumstances concerning the payment they receive for their duties is highly creditable to them. When one remembers that in the last Estimates large sums were provided for additional payments to already well-paid public servants, one undoubtedly wants to know why the Government did not at the same time take an opportunity to redress the grievances of the lower-paid officers. </para>

That may be a fairly good excuse; but, in view of the fact that we all recognise that public servants have been underpaid for many years past, if the Basic Wage Commission could not send in its report in less time than twelve months from the date of the opening of the inquiry, then the Government should have taken action and let the Commission proceed as it liked. </para>

                <para>The reform of the Public Service as a whole is urgent. There is very much dissatisfaction in the lower ranks on account of the low pay and poor prospects of promotion. What do we find in the higher ranks? It is no secret that there, are men in responsible positions in the Service drawing very substantial salaries <inline font-style="italic">who,</inline> if they were in private employment, would be receiving only &#163;3 or &#163;4 a week, and, perhaps, addressing envelopes. I know also that men have been introduced into the Public Service of the Commonwealth - this was some time ago, and I do not think many of them are in it at the present moment - who bought and paid for their jobs. In view of these circumstances, it is high time some action was taken to clear out the useless men, who will very often be found in the higher positions. In that way a saving would be created which could be applied more usefully to the better payment of the men in the lower ranks. I do not say that all the men in the higher positions are of that class. There are many able officers who should undoubtedly be paid much higher salaries than they are getting. I have only to refer, to the services rendered to the Commonwealth by such men as the permanent head of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, and  the head of the architectural branch, of the Department of Works and Railways, to prove that men who are doing the work they are doing ought to be receiving double the salaries that we have paid them up to the present time. But one cannot conceal from himself, in going round the Departments, that there are large numbers of men in responsible positions who ought not to be there at all. It is high time the system of promotion by seniority was put aside, and some method under which the smarter men in the Service would get promotion substituted, thus doing them justice, and also getting the best results for our money. </para>
                <para>There is undoubtedly some difficulty in assessing the wages of public servants, but I do not think it exists to any extent in the case of the lower ranks. If we only took the trouble to inquire as to the wages that are paid for similar classes of work outside the Service, we should have a fairly good guide. When the outside rates are compared with the wages paid to the lower classes of the Public Service of the Commonwealth today, we find at once that there is considerable leeway to make up. I trust, therefore, that the Government will immediately go into this, matter and decide, by&#39; means of some such basis as I have indicated, what are fair wages for the servants of the Commonwealth. If they have any doubt in that regard, I hope they will err rather on the side of generosity than in meanness, just by way of a change. The rank and file of the civil servants have been very loyal and very reliable in the work they have done, and ought at least to receive a remuneration equivalent to the wages that are being paid outside the Service under conditions of employment similar to their own. </para>

                    <para>. - The vote recorded this afternoon has fairly indicated the attitude of the members of this House towards the findings of the Basic Wage Commission, which was appointed by the Government. The Commission was appointed to inquire into the cost of living, and to ascertain the basic wage required to support a man, his wife, and three children in a reasonable amount of comfort and decency in a civilized country such as Australia, which is acknowledged to be one  of the wealthiest in the world. That Commission was not appointed hurriedly. We must assume that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the members of his Cabinet gave due consideration to its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> before appointing it; and one would imagine that, having done so, they sized up the probable consequences of appointing a Commission of that character and the possible results&#39; of its findings. Condemnation of the Government is, I suppose, looked for by Ministers from members on this side of the House. They are not slow to tell us that we eternally condemn them, and, we think, rightly so,  while  those who place us here are not slow to show us that they appreciate what we do in that regard, and that we voice their opinions. When, however, we find the press organs of the Government also attacking them over this question, and pointing out their hypocrisy, it is well for members who sit behind the Government to ask themselves in what position the Government, as represented by the Prime Minister, are placing them. I do not think the most biased person in Parliament would call the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> a Labour journal. Yet that newspaper, in its issue of Wednesday, 24th November, discussing the report of the Commonwealth Basic Wage Commission, prints an article with the significant heading, &#34; Typical Bit of  Hughesism.&#34;  This journal refers to the appointment of the Commission, and in an examination of the reasons which actuated the Government gives the history of the Commission as follows : - </para>

                    <para>The question naturally is asked : If the Commonwealth authorities have no power to fi.* a basic wage applicable to the Commonwealth, why was this Royal Commission issued ? What was to be gained by this lengthy and expensive inquiry if its findings are to&#39; be made applicable only to the Federal Public Service, and perhaps a few industries? The answer .is found in the history of the Commission. It represents a typical bit of Hughesism. The first announcement about the Commission was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> when, prior to the last election, he delivered his policy speech at Bendigo, on 30th October, 1919. On that occasion he said : - Means must be found which will insure that the minimum wage shall be adjusted automatically, or almost automatically, with the cost of living, so that, within the limits- of the minimum wage, at least the sovereign shall always purchase the same amount of the necessaries of life. </para>

                <para class="block">That briefly discloses the purpose for which the Commission was appointed, apart altogether from the vote-catching aspect of the matter. It was intended that the Commission should lay down a decent standard of comfort for those people in Australia who are obliged to work for wages.  </para>

In a  lengthy rambling,  theatrical speech in this chamber he claimed that it was impossible for Australia to pay the living wage as laid down by the Commissioners. He said, &#34; The wealth is not in the country.&#34; If the wealth is not in the country, it is because the Prime Minister and his party sold the primary products of this country during the war at far less than they were worth, causing the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds to Australia. We have to pay war prices for what we use in our homes to-day, but we have not received for our products the war prices ruling on the other side of the world, to which we were entitled, and which, we should have received but for the  way  in which the Prime Minister bungled things. </para>

                        <para>- The National party, which the honorable member supports, or, at any rate, which he votes to keep in power, is responsible for that. It is the honorable member&#39;s own fault. At any rate, the fault does not lie at the door of honorable members on this side. We are not keeping the Government in power. We have it on the word of General Lassetter, of Sydney, a man of  high  standing in the business world, that Australia has lost &#163;140,000,000 on its wool sales alone. That is the reason why w.e have not the money in Australia with which to pay a reasonable wage to the people. Now that the Government has repudiated the report of the Basic Wage Commission, the workers will begin to realize how much they have suffered as a result of the bungling of the National Administration. No one can say that the Government did not bungle these sales. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> the only member of the Ministry who has been to Great Britain and inquired into these matters, was not slow to say that some of the things done by the Prime Minister were like the peace of God, which &#34;passeth all understanding.&#34; Is it not true that the Prime Minister dominates his Cabinet and his party ? Of course, because he is the only one who can keep his meek and humble followers together. But when rogues fall out, honest people come into their own. Through the row in the Cabinet between the honorable member for Balaclava and the Prime Minister, and when these two gentlemen were at one another&#39;s throats, we got an inkling of what has been done during the last four years, during which period there has been so much smothering up, secrecy, and undue laxity in respect&#39; of those transactions which have been carried out by the Prime Minister. </para>

                <para>When the workers of this country and the nien in the Public Service endeavour to secure redress, they are met with talk such as we have had from the Prime Minister when he declares that the spokesman cf the public servants is allied to a world-wide conspiracy to overthrow the Empire. No greater insult could be tendered to the Public Service than to refer to this gentleman in this way, particularly as I understand that he is a prominent Nationalist. He went to no end of trouble to inform honorable members when they were interviewed by representatives of the Public Service in Sydney a few days ago that it was the  hardest  job possible for him to prevent the Public Service getting into a state of chaos owing to the seething discontent which had manifested itself. He particularly stressed the fact that the position was not being dominated by members of unions, but that it was an aggregation of the rank and file of the Service who were moving in the matter, and had appointed him as their spokesman. The Prime Minister, in order to suit his dirty sectarian ends - I can ascribe his words to nothing else - says tha* this gentleman whose name is O&#39;Connor is in a world-wide conspiracy to overthrow the British Empire.&#39; This vilification of the honest endeavours of men to right the wrongs which are existing in this country only serves to bring about seething discontent. We had an example of the discontent prevailing at the meeting held in the Melbourne Exhibition Building last night, attended by 5,,000 members of the Commonwealth Public Service. We have no desire to see chaos in the Service. We want things to move along harmoniously and smoothly. Therefore, we view with regret the fact that one who should set an example to the people of the Commonwealth has seen fit to descend to such petty, childish tactics in order to serve his own political ends, and discredit the great body of men and women who, as the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> has declared, have been labouring under an undue hardship for a considerable time past. The nonpayment of a decent wage to members of the Public Service has been responsible for many of the best men in Australia leaving the Service and going into the open market in order to secure employment under better conditions. There could be no greater condemnation of the Government&#39;s administration. We cannot expect to attract to the Public Service the best youths in the community when they learn that there is no future ahead of them if they join it. A friend of my own who occupied an important position in &#34; the Postal Department was, after ten years&#39; service, in receipt of &#163;4 2s. 4d. per week. He reached the breaking point, and, as he was unable to support his family on the sweated wage paid him by the Government he had to resign, and the Service is the poorer for his loss.  His  case is only typical of hundreds of others that might be. and have been, referred to. </para>
                <para>When it is suggested that honorable members or. this side have taken up a  certain attitude with respect to the report of the Basic Wage Commission for party purposes, we might very well retort that the Commission was appointed for party purposes. If, when I voice the protests and opinions of the electors who sent me here, I am to be accused of doing so merely for party purposes, all I can say is that honorable members opposite must have a strange idea of the functions of Parliament. While the Government could find money to increase bv 60 or 70 per cent, the wages of the more highly-paid officers of the Service, they cannot find sufficient funds to pay the lower grades of the Service properly until they are forced to do so by such an agitation as has been carried on during the past month. </para>
                <para>It has been stated that, by raising wages, we are only going in a vicious circle, since every rise in wages is followed by an increase in the cost of living. While the profiteer is allowed to  unduly increase the price of commodities, it is no solution of the problem to increase wages. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has pointed out that the undue profits made by big businesses were made from prices that were proportionately greater in excess of the increase in wages. No effective machinery has been provided during the last four years by this Government to prevent profiteering, and the legislation passed by the present Government has been intended rather to protect the interests of the profiteer than those of the worker. Some members of this House carry on private businesses from which they derive considerable incomes apart from their parliamentary salary, and the struggle for existence does not greatly concern them. Some of them are so patriotic as to say that if the Federal Capital is transferred to Canberra they will resign from the National Parliament. We cannot expect such men to have much sympathy with the hardships of the under-dog and the sweated worker. Many of the men to whom I refer belong to the class of profiteers who made huge profits out of the participation of Australia in the war. </para>
                <para>It would be well if the scales were drawn from the eyes of the people in order that they might understand what Nationalism or &#34; Hughesism &#34; has done for the workers of this country. It has been responsible for increasing enormously the cost of living, and as I have already said, the bungling of the Prime Minister has been responsible for the fact that men who are not wage-earners, but producers of primary products, have not received a fair return for their labour because of the low prices obtained for their products overseas. We have been robbed, and the workers have been robbed, whilst the profiteers are the only persons who have gained any advantage through the present Government being in power. They have looked after the interests of the profiteers, and, either wilfully; or because they lacked ability, have failed to prevent the plundering of the wage-earners of the community. </para>
                <para>As one who has worked in Queensland, I am in a position to say that wages have been higher and the cost of living cheaper in that State than in any other State of the Commonwealth. We know that there has been the grossest misrepresentation of the conditions in Queensland under a Labour Government. It is left to the report of the Basic Wage Commission to vindicate all that we have said about the better economic conditions in Queensland under Labour administration. During the war the worker in Queensland was 10s. a week better off than the worker in any other part of Australia so far as the purchasing power of the sovereign was concerned, and at the same time the wages he received were higher than those paid to workers in the other States. This proves that Labour administration in Queensland was better for the worker than the administration of the Commonwealth Government has been. </para>

I desire only to warn the people against the renewal of this campaign. The Government are aided in their misrepresentations by a press which has indulged in profiteering just as vile as, if not viler than, any other branch of the vile business. The daily press of the cities has even gone so far as to considerably increase the price of war loan advertisements, as well as to exploit the relatives of deceased soldiers by doubling the cost of death notices and the like. The party to which I belong does not rely upon the support of corporations which adopt such profiteering tactics as these. The Labour party has no need to state its case through such sources. From the utterances and indications given by the Prime Minister to-day, there can be no doubt that he is about to launch a new campaign of misrepresentation to serve, apparently, for some future contingency. I warn the people against accepting any so-called political news that appears in the daily press. Let them look for misrepresentations rather than the truth, and they will not be disappointed. There is only one journal in the land from which accurate records of the proceedings of Parliament can be obtained. I refer to the official publication of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which may be obtained from the Government Printer for 2s. 6d. per session. All Labour supporters in the community should arm themselves by means of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with the facts concerning what goes on in the Australian Parliament, in order to be able to disseminate the real truth among the workers of Australia. One can hardly wonder that some of the latter are apt to be carried away by the persistent untruths published in the organs of our political opponents.- I have no doubt that some new lie will be sprung upon the people for the next Federal elections - something fresh, but after the manner of such lies as &#34;Ryan means ruin,&#34; and those other canards concerning Queensland. From the exhibition of tactics afforded by the Prime Minister to-day it would appear that the new lie will have something to do with an alleged worldwide conspiracy for the defeat and overthrow of the Empire. I am reminded by the Prime Minister&#39;s methods of the trick sometimes played by little boys. A young mischief-maker turns on a tap, and, after a good deal of water has run to waste, he turns it off again. Then he runs inside to his mother and tells her he has saved water by turning off the tap. The idea of the Prime Minister is to manufacture a scare - to stagemanage some bogy, just as we have been informed by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that the Prime Minister stage-managed .his welcome home by returned soldiers. Then, having launched his scare, and played on th&#38; feelings of the people, he steps forth as the hero who has arisen to protect and save the community from the dire disaster which he himself had manufactured. I have no doubt that tactics such as these will again be resorted to. The Prime Minister is endeavouring to mislead the people now regarding the millions of money lost to the community by his bungling. I do not believe that any amount of spoken truth will have the slightest effect upon the supporters of the Prime Minister in influencing their attitude towards the amendment. The secret junta has met in its party room upstairs. The whole matter of the basic wage has been discussed and decided upon, and the most cogent arguments which honorable members on this side could advance would now be unavailing. The Prime Minister and his supporters appointed the Commission to catch votes. Now they have repudiated its report; and they give, as a reason for so doing, the excuse that the Commonwealth cannot pay its servants a decent living wage. However, the people will be the judges of that. If the Commonwealth cannot pay a fair thing it will be because the primary products of Australia during the past four years have been practically given away to people on the other side of the world, with the result that the workers of this country, have to sweat and pay more than ever for domestic necessities. All this is because of the bungling and mismanagement of the Government, ruinously led, as it is, by the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- Many members of the Public Service are not getting anything&#34; like the remuneration which they should receive ; but when the Government are asked to pay a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. 6d. the question inevitably arises whether the resources of the country can stand the strain. I have been engaged upon urgent public business away from this House, and, unfortunately, I have not yet had time to peruse the report of the Commission as carefully as I intend. The payment of  a basic wage is so huge iri its importance and effect that the Government cannot be expected to deal with it offhand. I believe that our public servants should be paid more than they are getting, in the main. They should receive the best wage we can give them commensurate with reason. But if we pay them more than the country can afford our action will be, not only unreasonable, but ruinous. It would not be fair to the Service. I believe that when a majority of its members know that an honest attempt is being made to mete out justice to them, and after they have had an opportunity of carefully considering the report and realizing what is involved, they will be quite prepared to abide bv the decision of the Government. I am anxious to see the public servants adequately paid; but I do not wish to express a definite opinion at this juncture, particularly when we do not know exactly what additional expenditure the country can carry. There is reason in all things, and I know the members of the Public Service will be among the first to admit that there must be some limitation on our capacity. The Commonwealth public servants, in common with other public servants, are in a very strong position in one sense, because when they are permanently appointed on the staff of any particular Department they are there until they reach the retiring age - that is, of course, if their behaviour has been satisfactory. The same cannot be said of &#62;men  who  are in private employment, because if their services ar&#171;* not needed they can be dispensed with. For that reason, if for no other, Commonwealth public servants are in a comparatively safe position, and if work cannot be found for them in one Department there is no difficulty in transferring them to another. The public servants, of course, feel keenly, as do other members of the community, the appalling increase in the cost of living, and if we are going to pay &#163;5 16s. a week, it will naturally mean that employers outside will be forced to follow, with the result that prices will be increased to such an extent that their position will not be improved in the slightest degree. It will simply be pursuing a vicious circle. If the basic rates mentioned in the report were to be adopted, the primary producers would, of course, be penalized, and the cost of everyday commodities would rise to an alarming extent. Do honorable members opposite think that if these rates were enforced that our primary and secondary products would remain at present prices? In such circumstances increased wages would be of little value, and the Government are taking a very wise step in adopting the course suggested. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has made a fair offer in saying that the&#39; , Government will go into the matter, and within a fortnight will announce what they consider a fair wage, which will operate from the 1st November. That is a reasonable proposal, and if we debated the matter for days I do not think a more satisfactory one could be suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to give a silent vote on this question, more particularly as I am in somewhat of a quandary. I certainly would not have voted for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and I find myself confronted with a considerable difficulty in voting for the amendment moved by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook).</inline> I do not suppose any report has come before this Parliament that is of greater importance than that which has been submitted by the Basic Wage Commission. It has far-reaching tendencies, and I question whether there is one member in this Chamber who has had an opportunity of thoroughly grasping its Import. Although I have perused extracts from the document in the newspapers, it was not until this afternoon that I received a copy of the report. I doubt very much whether any honorable member has read the whole of it,, and I do not think any member would give a vote which may be the means of doing serious injury to the future prosperity of the Commonwealth. If the Government agree to pay a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. per week, it would not rest with the Public Service alone, but it would have to become the basic wage for the whole Commonwealth. It would be absurd. I always consider that the members of the. Public Service are holding permanent positions, and obtain benefits that are not enjoyed by those in private employment. I am not attacking members of the Opposition, but they are demanding that the rates mentioned in the report should  be adopted. </para>

                <para>I have nothing to say as to the merits or demerits of the report, but it would be absurd for the House to pass any resolution which would force the hands of the Government, until an opportunity had been afforded for the most mature consideration. Honorable members who claim specially to represent the wage-earners should carefully consider what effect the adoption of the findings of the Commission would have on the future of this country. If, as a result, large numbers were thrown out of employment, we should have a state of chaos. I am sure that honorable members opposite do not want that sort of thing; that they are just as anxious as we are to build up prosperous conditions in Australia. </para>
                <para>I throw upon the Government the whole responsibility in regard to this matter. They appointed this Commission; they believe in commissions of inquiry to investigate various subjects, and they approve of government interference with our industries. I, on the other hand, am opposed to anything of the kind. The Government have submitted an amendment under which we are invited to approve of the Prime Minister&#39;s past promises. 1 do not approve of them. I agree with him, however, that labour is entitled to a fair share of the wealth it produces. </para>

                        <para>- Even if the honorable member were to read it a dozen times he would still be unable to take any but a biased view of it. The Prime Minister says that labour is entitled to a fair share of the profits it produces. I agree with him, but the question is as to how we can help labour to obtain that fair share. The adoption of the Commissions recommendations would not help, in the slightest degree, to that end. If we do anything that leads to the destruction of industry we must have a corresponding reduction in employment. Incalculable injury would be done to the country if we fixed upon a basic wage which must create unemployment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member thinks that the State should step in. We know that efforts were made in New South Wales by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> to frame a scheme under which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> suggested in his memorandum, married men with children would receive special assistance and succour. But when you interfere in these matters you must inevitably create trouble for yourselves. Is not the common sense of this Parliament sufficient to enable us to originate a system under which the worker would get a fair share of the profits from his labour ? Whenever we talk about  co-operation, we are met with opposition from the Labour party, but I believe it is possible, under some such system, to insure for the worker a fair share of the profits. There are difficulties, I know, in regard to many industries: but we should try to evolve some scheme to increase production. This adoption of the recommendation of the Basic Wage Commission will limit production. </para>

They have not vet had time to digest the findings of the Commission. This could not be done in- a week or a fortnight, and so they should have time. They have made a promise which, T think, should satisfy honorable members opposite. They have said that they will pay certain increases to the public servants, pending a closer investigation of the problem, and that the whole matter will be dealt with when Parliament re-assembles. </para>

                        <para>- There will be no dodging this issue. I feel very dubious about the result of any action that is going to be taken by the Government in connexion with this matter. Time after time I have said that I believed that if, when the war started, we had been able to look ahead, we could have appointed some special Board to deal with the cost of living problem and, as costs rose, wages could have been increased correspondingly. I also said that the Government should have brought in legislation to limit war profits. No big organization; should have been allowed during the war to make one sixpence extra profit than they made prior to the war - I would have supported legislation to compel these big organizations to hand over the whole of the surplus profits to the Treasury, after allowing, of course, a reasonable amount for interest. Many of our big trading organizations made enormous profits. They took every advantage of any shortage in supplies to force prices up. I can quite understand the worker getting restless about the increased cost of living. The House should accept the proposal of the Government, and throw the whole of the responsibility upon them. Give them time to mature their plans, so that they may come before Parliament when next we meet, and tell honorable members what will be the effect of this basic wage upon our industries . We have no right to. force the Government to give effect to this recommendation until we are satisfied what its effect will be upon the community generally. If we do as I suggest, then when Parliament meets again, we will have all the information which the Government have been able to compile in the meantime, and be in a position to indorse their proposals, or place some others in power who will devise some other means of giving fair play to the worker without doing injury to the community. </para>

                        <para>- My cabbage soldier friend interjects that it does not matter. I feel sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that when he says that he is speaking the truth. It does not matter to him how many promises his party breaks. It does not matter to him how many election pledges the Prime Minister makes and breaks. So long as his party can remain upon the Treasury bench, it matters not to him or any one else on the other side of the House, how they retain their position. If I did not know honorable members opposite so well as I do, I would have been surprised if I had been told that we could have such a succession of broken pledges as has been our experience during the last ten or twelve months. When the Prime Minister was before the electors last year, he realized that, as he was in a dangerous .position, he would have to make a bold bid for support. Consequently, he made several promises, including one to the wheat-growers of Australia, to whom he guaranteed  the payment of 5s. per bushel at railway stations. That promise was interpreted by the farmers as it was meant to be interpreted. They thought that they were going to&#39; receive 5s. cash on delivery. Yet what do we find? Many months elapsed after Parliament re-assembled without anything being done, so honorable members on this side of the House decided to force the hands of the Government, if possible, in order to have the promise honoured. We know, of course, that it has been dishonoured, and that every honorable member on the other side of the House voted to assist the Government in dishonouring this promise. We also know what has happened in connexion with the war gratuity bonds. Almost &#39;every returned soldier is in financial difficulties owing to the high cost of living.  Honorable members opposite may laugh at the idea that, the soldiers, the &#39;majority of whom belong to the working classes, should be in financial difficulties. if they had their way, the working classes would always be in financial difficulties. If they adopt the amendment now before the House, the working classes will continue to be in financial trouble. It appears to be a matter of mirth with them that any honorable member on this side of the House should mention that returned soldiers, in spite of all they &#39;have done for this country, and in spite of the promises made by the Government, are in financial difficulties to-day, and that they should have expected the Government&#39;s pledge to be honoured by getting their gratuity in cash. </para>

                        <para>- I went on to say that had the Government supporters had their way yesterday, the Standing Orders would have been suspended to enable the Government to keep the House sitting continuously until the business was disposed of, in which case this question would have been talked out, or would have been brought forward when honorable members were too weary, after an all-night sitting, to intelligently follow the debate. I complained that the honorable member had said a couple of weeks ago that the Labour party was making a party question of this matter, and that he had said that he had spoken more than any other honorable member on behalf of the public servant&#39;s. My comment was that he may have spoken on their behalf, but that he was one of the most servile supporters of the Government, a statement that was cheered to the echo. I added that in this House it was votes which counted; that what mattered was not how a man spoke, but how he voted. I was in error in stating that the honorable member had not been. in the House this week. I have since ascertained that he was here; but he took such an insignificant part in the proceedings that I did not notice him. I went on to say that the party to which I belong is not seeking to make political capital out of this question. I do not think there are 200 public servants in my electorate. </para>

                <para>Just before the last election the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in his endeavour to secure a further lease of office, made certain promises to the electors. Speaking at Bendigo, he said - </para>

                    <para>The Government is, therefore, appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage.The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war; also how the basic wage may be adjusted to the present purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means, when once so adjusted, of automatically adjusting itself to the rise and fall of the sovereign. The Government will at the earliest date possible create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Commission was appointed, and clothed with the necessary powers. After a thorough investigation it was reported that it cost in Melbourne &#163;5 16s. 6d., in Sydney &#163;5 17s., in Brisbane &#163;5 6s. 2d., in Newcastle &#163;5 18s. 6d., in Adelaide &#163;5 16s.1d., in Perth &#163;5 13s.11d., and in Hobart &#163;5 16s.11d. for a man to keep himself, his wife, and three children, living in that standard of comfort which a human being in a civilized community should enjoy. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet were absolutely staggered at the findings of the Commission, which were unanimously arrived at by the members of that body. Therefore, the right honorable gentleman asked the  chairman  of the Commission alone to supply him with another report. As has been pointed out by every&#39; honorable member who lias spoken from this side of the Chamber.&#34; it is a remarkable thing that the Prime Minister did not ask any other member of the Commission for a further report, However,  the fact remains that he asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> and that, between 5 o&#39;clock one afternoon, when the request was made, and 9 o&#39;clock the same evening, that gentleman presented a supplementary report to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then came clown here, laid the report of the Commission upon the table of the House, and, following his customary tactics, quoted extensively from the supplementary report which had been furnished him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington.</inline> Had not attention been called to this matter, the impression would have gone forth that the right honorable gentleman was reading from the report of the Commission itself. He concluded his remarks by moving &#34; That the paper be printed.&#34; Had that motion been carried, the papers -would have been printed, and nothing further would have been done. But, as honorable members upon this side of the Chamber were anxious to insure justice being meted out to our Commonwealth public servants, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> submitted an amendment to add to the motion the following words: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>And, in accordance with the definite pledge given by the Prime Minister in his policy speech at Bendigo on 30th October, 1919, the Government should give immediate effect to the findings of the Commission. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">One would have thought that that amendment would have been acceptable to honorable members upon both sides of the Chamber, and particularly to Ministerial supporters. It simply asked for the honouring of a pledge. The Commission had reported upon the wage which it considered necessary to enable a man to support his wife and three children in a reasonable degree of comfort. There is not an honorable member in this Chamber who dares to go before the electors and say that a man ought not to receive a wage sufficient to enable him to maintain his wife and family in comfort. Had honorable members opposite been sincere, they would have voted for that amendment, the adoption of which would  have  given effect to the finding of the Commission. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the proposal which the honorable member for Parkes rushed across from Sydney to assist the Government to carry. If it is carried - as, apparently, it will be - it will mean that this question will be left in the hands of the Government, who will do nothing of any practical benefit to our public servants. Certainly, they will not give effect to the  findings of the Commission. Only the other day, the Prime Minister definitely stated that he would not agree to pay the basic wage recommended by the Commission. If the amendment which we are now considering be adopted, the question will be left entirely in the hands of the Government. Seeing the way in which they have failed to honour their promises in the past, we know how they will honour them in the future. A little while ago, when we were constantly pointing out to them that our public servants in New South Wales were being paid less than the basic wage of that State, they said that they would not recognise that basic wage. But now, because the New South Wales basic wage is less than the wage decided on by the Commonwealth Commission, the Prime Minister endeavours to convey the impression that the former is the amount which the Commonwealth will pay. If that was not recognised as a fair amount to pay two or three weeks ago, why does he now recognise it as a fair amount? He . recognises it as a fair amount now, simply because it is less than the finding of his own Commission. What justification was there for appointing a Commission? What justification was there for putting this country to such an expense, if, simply because its findings are not acceptable to the Government, they are to be contemptuously tossed aside, and the Government left to fix a wage on their own account? What good purpose has been served by the Commission if its findings are not to be given effect to ? If the Government and their supporters do not intend to give effect to the findings, it means that the expenditure on the Commission has been wasted, so far as the basic wage is concerned. In my opinion, however, the Commission serves one useful purpose. It shows to the workers, who to-day are not receiving the amount decided on by the Commission, that they are not paid sufficient to enable them to live at a reasonable standard of comfort. </para>

                        <para>- From my painful experience of those workers who remain outside the industrial organizations, they needed something like this report, and this discussion, to impress on them that they are not receiving a living wage. They had no real conception what living means, in the true sense of the word. But now those who, so far, have remained outside the organizations may be expected to join . and agitate for an equivalent amount. If it were not for the agitation created by the public servants of Australia - if they had not inundated members of this House with telegrams - I have not the slightest doubt that the Government would have done nothing at all in the matter. </para>

To those honorable members who charge us, on this side, with making this a party question, I can only say that the same invitation that was sent to myself and the other members of the Labour party was sent to every other member of the House, to attend the meeting at the Exhibition Building last night. At that meeting, I scanned the faces of those assembled in the body of the hall, and those on the platform, but I failed to see a representative of any other party except the Labour party. </para>

Hall at a picture show, deliberately keeping the House from meeting, in order to block discussion on this question, until the Prime Minister could come from Sydney, and with his usual cunning get them out of the difficulty in which they found themselves. Honorable members opposite know that if it were not for the Prime Minister they would always be floundering as they were yesterday. He has cunning, and, with his power to appeal to sectarian feelings, and the basest instincts of mankind, he is able to stir up class passions and hatreds, as he did to-day, when he seized upon the name of O&#39;Connor in order to make out that the agitation over the basic wage is fomented by those who are desirous of disrupting the Empire, although O&#39;Connor is a thick and thin supporter of the Nationalist party.  His  supporters, however, know that they can depend on his cunning, audacity and unscrupulousness to get them out of any awkward corner. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and, after all, he has only shown the workers the class of Government that Australia has to-day. I have said that I earnestly looked for some Nationalist supporter of the Government, or for some member of the Country party, at the meeting last night, thinking that, perhaps, as in Sodom and Gomorrah, there might be one good man ready to assist the public servants in their fight for justice. And I did see one, and only one, and he was slinking away in the distance, on the edge of the crowd, as if he were ashamed to be seen at such a gathering. The fact that not a single member opposite except that one accepted the invitation proves conclusively that &#34;the Government supporters, and they only, are making- this a party question. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not. care to give a silent vote on the amendment, the form of which I do not like. It expresses approval of the statement made by the Prime Minister in regard to the basic wage, and, personally, I do not at all approve of it. I regard his statement only as second in importance to the report of the Commission itself, and with almost as much consternation. The whole history of this Basic Wage Commission proves it to have been a most mischievous idea. It started as an election pledge, regardless of the fact that it could not be carried out without certain alterations in the Constitution. Now that the report has been produced, it is being used entirely by the Opposition for purely party and political purposes. The Labour party desire to have this proposal carried willy nilly, without regard to consequences, &#39; simply because an election pledge was given, and despite the fact that the  Chairman  of the Royal Commission himself admits that to carry it out in its entirety would absolutely dislocate and. destroy Australian industries. The position that has arisen is most serious. The question of providing a living wage for everybody in the community is one that should be absolutely beyond party, going down, as it does, to the very root of our national progress, and being one of the girders of the fabric of Australian society. It should be determined in a most impartial and detached manner. I regret that, in an off-hand and haphazard fashion, the Prime Minister and the Government are going to dispose of the question of the application of the principle to the public servants, simply as the result of this report, which bear? internal evidence throughout of being ill-digested and out of harmony with the possibilities of Australian developments. </para>

                <para>I have no hesitation in speaking in this way because no one can deny that, on every occasion on . which I have spoken in this chamber on the question of the payment of the public servants, I have insisted that they should be decently paid. In fact, I think I am one of the few members who have received a definite vote of thanks from Public Service organizations for the manner in which I have advocated payment for the members of the Service in accordance with what other people in the community are receiving. Whether I were in Parliament or out of it. I should always insist, and have always insisted, as far as was in my power, that men and women receive a fair return for their labour. But I believe in a proper adjustment of the whole problem. If the Government said, &#34; This is the basic wage, and we must carry it out,&#34; and if at the same time they submitted a proposition whereby the whole of the Public Service was to be properly overlooked and supervised, and the incompetents, of whom there are many, weeded out, one could approve of their policy on this question. We must pay good wages to- the Commonwealth Public Service, as is necessary in the case of every Public Service, or most of the good men will leave, because they can make more money outside. The result of paying low wages in any Service is that only the incompetent hands or those who are tied lip by financial and domestic burdens remain. What we need to do in the Public Service of the Commonwealth is to weed out incompetents, and pay decent wages to the good men who are left, giving them a sense of responsibility, and getting a proper idea of the true value of their work. I take it that the Government, in the business undertakings they are handling, are not to be regarded as a benevolent institution. They may pay old-age pensions and maternity bonuses, and in that respect act in a benevolent capacity; but when it is a question of getting value in the shape of work for money paid out to public servants, they should be as strict as any other business concern. Quite apart from this, I do not think a simple increase of wages to public servants, according to a report founded on evidence, such as we have had submitted to us and which inevitably raises all other wages, is a proper way to improve the general condition of the public servants, or, indeed, of the public at large. It is admitted in the report that it must make the condition of salaried men worse. I object to the whole process by which- the various basic wages have been built up during the last twelve or fifteen years. It is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers in 1917 laid it down that these awards should be built upon scientific and humane principles, and arrived at only after securing all the authentic materials available. The construction of the report before us is not scientific, nor has it been built up on all the authentic materials which could have been, and ought to have been, obtained in the proper consideration of a subject of this kind, which reaches right down to the basis of Australian society. </para>

As the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> truly said this afternoon, &#34; It would be like a dog chasing its own tail.&#34; Increases in wages are not the only means by which the general well-being of the community is to be built up All that increases of wages are doing in Australia at the present time is to increase the prices of certain commodities - and those the manufactured commodities. The figures in regard to raw materials are instructive, as the following table will show: - </para>

                <para>Light calf hides are lower than10d. per lb. I knew men who have been trying, during the last few days, to sell hides of that description down to 2d. a lb. Fine crossbred wool is quoted at 16d. per lb. now, but it is practically unsaleable at present. The same state of affairs is true of many of the products of Australia, of which our wealth consists. While these products have been lessening in value as compared with pre-war times, the wages that are being, paid in the cities, and which must ultimately be paid in the country, if any workers are to be kept there at all, have advanced by leaps and bounds. They have gone up practically by 100 per cent. during the last six years. I am confident that at least 50 per cent.&#39; of the increased prices of goods is due, not- to any increase in the price of raw materials, but to the increase in wages. Thus, a vicious circle is being established. Wages axe increased, the price of the manufactured article is increased, and the amount of commission paid for handling and selling it is increased, and so we go on, until we shall reach a condition in which, no matter how much money we pay, we shall be getting a much lower return in actual goods and comforts than in the old days when wages more nearly approximated to the price of the raw material. And under this condition of affairs we have a Commission appointed, because of an election promise by the Prime Minister, to go into the whole matter and ascertain what is a living wage. But we find no fundamental principle underlying the appointment of this Commission. The Prime Minister in this House gave us his definition of a basic wage. He said - </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to the payment of a wage of &#163;5 16s. per week if it is found to be a proper wage on a more democratic, scientific basis than apparently has been adopted by the Basic Wage Commission. My objection is not to the amount but to the unscientific method of determining that amount, which as soon as it is made makes it inadequate. Any inquiry into this matter without also going into the question of the number of hours during which an industry ought to be worked and the production in that industry is ridiculously futile. The essential requirement in fixing upon a basic wage is to ascertain what wage is necessary to keep the person who works and his dependants in perfect health, according to the standard of the community in which he lives. I do not say that &#163;5 16s. is not a proper basic wage, or that &#163;10 per week should not be paid. All I say is that the inquiry instituted by the Commission was not on a scientific basis, and did not go to the root of things. After months of inquiry the Commissioners have fixed upon what they regard as a fair basic wage, and their recommendation is brought before this Parliament, where we are informed that if the wage is paid to all employees with or without children, the increased burden on the community will be, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> &#163;93,000,000 per annum, and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> &#163;101,000,000.

                        says that he has not had time to go into detail&#39;s of individual export industries; but it seemed to him that as far as manufacturing industries for export were concerned, they would be ruined, and that in the case of other industries the application of a basic wage of &#163;5 16s. 6d. would retard their development, and possibly prevent their continuance. Another result of addition to the cost of production of goods for domestic consumption, which represented 62 per cent. of the total production, would be to so raise prices for such goods that all secondary industries would be liable to be ruined by importations unless the Tariff were substantially increased. . . .

                        <para>- The same applies in proportionate degree to the haphazard arrangement proposed by the Prime Minister. He has said that that would impose a burden of &#163;28,000,000 on all industries. I should not object to industry being asked to carry that burden if it were found to be necessary, after proper examination. If it could be shown that our industries would stand it, that it would increase development and production and improve the physical condition of the people, I should be prepared to support it. There can be no doubt whatever that an improvement of the physical condition of the people will inevitably increase production. A healthy man who feels fit cannot remain idle long, and will not &#34; go slow &#34; on his job. </para>

                <para>It must be clear from the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> that if there were a general application of the basic wage recommended by the Commission, industries which have been built up in Australia with .very great difficulty would be ruined, and our export trade would be wiped out. <inline font-style="italic">Yet-</inline> honorable members opposite wonder why we will not vote for their amendment to apply the Commission&#39;s basic wage immediately to the Public Service. If we did so,, the effect would be at once reflected in the demands made for increased remuneration by persons in outside employment. I have found, in my own district, that when the wages of Government employees have been raised, outside labour will &#39;not work for less. That sets the standard for the locality. The report of the Basic Wage Commission shows beyond question to every thinking man in Australia, whether worker or  employer, whether a public servant or a civilian, the absolute futility of the methods we have adopted during the last twenty years for the settlement of industrial disputes. Has any honorable member ever heard of an Arbitration Court, by its awards, doing anything else but increase wages ? &#34; </para>

Butter may be ls. a lb. to-day, and at another time ls. d. per lb. Wheat may be 2s. 6d. per bushel to-day, and at another time 5s., and at still another time fall again to 2s. 6d. Hides may be 2s. per lb. to-day, and at another time 2d. per lb. And yet for the last twelve years every Arbitration Court award has raised wages, quite irrespective of these fluctuations in the market for primary productions. We keep on going up in a spiral, but our actual conditions are not improved. We shall reach a point at which our whole industrial fabric will topple over, and then we shall have, not high wages, but unemployment on every hand. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the Government have singularly failed to deal with profiteering. Increased production is the only way in which we can expect to secure a fall in the price of boots or of anything else. As the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> has pointed out. Lord Leverhulme has said that there is only one way in which to bring about an improvement in the conditions of life all round,  and it is by working dead machinery to the maximum and the human machine to the best physical advantage. What is necessary is that we should discover the best number of hours of work for a worker in any particular industry. That was Lord Leverhulme&#39;s  plan for increased production, which must mean more comfort for every one. In my opinion, the whole basis of our industrial system in determining, wages is wrong in this respect, that no constant point has been adopted as the basis for examination. The basis adopted for the  report  we now have under consideration seems to be the employers&#39; view of the matter in t&#39;he Harvester Case. That is al 1:asis with which the employer was satisfied thirteen or fourteen years ago, and because he was- satisfied it has been assumed that it must, therefore, be a fair basis to work from. As a matter of fact, it is a wrong basis  entirely,  and we must have some constant and stable basis upon which to work to get a result of any value to the worker. That can only he arrived at bv a medical commission such as that which inquired into the health of munition workers in England. This problem -which we have to solve is essentially a physiological problem. </para>

                        <para>- But economics are essentially bound up with physiology. The fundamental basis of society must be the physical health of its members, and, therefore, the first thing to find in arriving at a solution of this problem is the best number of hours  of work in any given industry. Some industries can only work short hours, some longer hours.  Rockchopping,  for instance, must be always very limited in the number of hours worked. The work of feeding machines involving the continual repetition of the same work dulls the sensibilities of the operator, and men can work effectively at it only for a limited number of hours before their output diminishes, and it is not economical to continue. There are a variety of operations performed in the open air at which men would really be -better for working a longer number of hours than it is customary for. them to do at the present time. Some effort should be made to discover the best number of hours of work in any industry that will produce the maximum output, and at the same time maintain the worker in the  best  physical condition. I mean the number of hours that will keep him in perfect health. By perfect health I mean the retention of that elasticity of mind andi body that enables him to enjoy his recreation and permits his mental development after his work. It was found in England&#34;, Germany, and the United States during the war that if a worker worked a longer number of hours each day,, and day after day, than his physical strength permitted - that is to say, if he exceeded his physiological standard - then, although he&#39; might follow that period of strain with a prolonged holiday, weeks and months might elapse before he could again equal the output of men who had riot been subject to over-strain. The only way to find these things out is to go to work on a scientific basis. I will read the names of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission on Health of Munition Workers, which dealt with this subject in England. Their reference of inquiry was not confined to the output of munitions, and to ascertaining whether that output could be increased, but it included an. investigation as to the effect the national task would be likely to have on the health of those engaged. The Commission comprised <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Newman, M.D., <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Barlow, F.R.S., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Bellhouse,  Professor Boycott, M.D., F.R.S., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. j.</inline> R.

Those ladies were upon the Commission because that body was investigating women&#39;s work, among other phases. Every Arbitration Court should have a Commission appointed to act with the arbitrator to ascertain facts such as these, and to place their practical knowledge and experience at the disposal of the Court in a way that could admit of no refutation. The actual living wage may change with a rise and fall in prices, but the number of hours of work to insure -perfect physical health is independent of these vagaries. It differs with occupation, climate, sex, &#38;c, but for each occupation, sex, &#38;c, a physiological standard can be determined which is the fundamental basis of the whole problem. One should be able to discover what is the average output to be expected from a worker in a given number of hours every day, and if one could learn the best number of hours that ought to be worked in an industry, and could secure some definite knowledge concerning the total of production to be expected from that industry. If we determine these two constant factors for the few basic industries, we have a constant basis from which to argue and work and automatically regulate the rise and .fall of wages in secondary industries. We go to all sorts of trouble to perfect dead machinery, but- we go to no trouble to insure that the human machine shall do its best work. Because in Australia we place no premium on skilled labour or science we hand over inquiries into all such matters to amateurs, and we ask them to give an opinion concerning what should be expected of the human machine. The man is greater than the machine; the only guarantee of effective labour is his individual health and his mental development. The final) report of the Health of Munition Workers&#39; Commission stated - </para>
                <para>It is certain that, unless our industrial life is to be guided in the future by the application of physiological science to the details of its management, it cannot hope to maintain its position hereafter among some of its foreign rivals, who already in that respect have gained a present advantage. However, this is an ideal of the future. </para>
                <para class="block">At present, because in each State the people are living under haphazard systems, and a basic wage has been fixed by a local Tribunal on unscientific lines it is imperative  that the Common-wealth Government should do something to bring its own servants at least up to the standard of the basic wage in each particular State, and I will support that. If, in the Public Service, we are going to start a  system  of wage payment according to the 6ize of a man&#39;s family - which may possibly be a correct and a . just system - it must be remembered that the method cannot be applied to employers generally without bringing about a serious result. It is introducing a new principle into industrial arrangements that deserves very full consideration. Men having no children, or only one or two, will receive preference of employment. &#34; Then, to prevent that, and to encourage the rearing of families, the Government will have to step in and subsidize employers, to insure the payment of commensurate wages to  familied  employees. I would like to see. this principle, which in itself is almost as far reaching as the subject of the basic wage, discussed at a stage of the session when it is likely to be debated on its merits. I condemn the Government, first for having, in a mischievous way, handed the problem of the basic wage over to a Commission which, in my opinion, was .not competent to investigate it, and for having presented to Parliament and the people the findings of the Commission, knowing they cannot be put into operation except in a very small particular, and can only unsettle industry. And I further condemn the Government for having brought forward the subject-matter at a time when it cannot be considered as a question of such magnitude should be. </para>

                    <para>. - The only trouble with the report of the Basic Wage Commission - is that, when it was presented at the head of the Government, it was found to be loaded. When the Prime Minister promised to create such a Commission, and to adopt its findings, he thought, no doubt, that it would be a body similar to other Commissions which, after much investigation, have presented some very ordinary suggestions and harmless ideas. But, to the dismay of the Government and its supporters, this Commission was in earnest, and it actually produced a correct record of the conditions and requirements of wage-earners in Australia to-day. What are the Government afraid of? The Commission has fixed varying rates averaging approximately &#163;5 16s. per week, and the Government and their supporters now say that such rates cannot be paid. It is. an absurd stand to take, and the suggestion is- in keeping with the general policy of the Conservative section of this chamber. As has already been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> a similar statement was made when the basic wage was fixed, at 42s. per week. It was said that Australia would be ruined, and now when a Royal Commission clothed with full powers to make a &#39;thorough investigation has come to the decision that &#163;5 16s. 6d. per week  is a living wage for a man, his wife, and three children, we are told that if it were paid, industries would be ruined, and that financial chaos would prevail. It is merely a matter of rearrangement, and I believe that if the rates mentioned were adopted, it would be found within a month that they would be inadequate. The suggestion to reconsider the rates every three &#39; months is ridiculous, as it would only give the profiteering class a further opportunity of exploiting the workers, and making more money. The rates should be re-arranged every fortnight, and, although such a suggestion may seem ridiculous, I believe it is one that .should be adopted. Honorable members opposite have said that, under &#39; our present system, it would be impossible to pay. these rates, and if such is the case, it is an admission of Parliament&#39;s incapacity. Do honorable members infer that the Commission was bribed to come to such a decision ? Are the members of that Commission brainless numskulls, who, after obtaining all the  neces-sary  evidence, and making the fullest possible investigation, have made a recommendation which cannot be given effect to ? If the Government admit their inability to govern the Commonwealth, it is time they made room for those who can. If honorable members opposite believe that it is beyond the power of any party to pay the rates set out in the Commission&#39;s report, our present social and economic system is at fault, and radical changes will have to be made. Honorable members know that it is useless to increase wages unless a check is placed on prices. The Royal Commission has set down an irreducible minimum of &#163;5 16s. 6d.&#34; per week for Victoria. The Government have been in office for twelve months, and although their supporters told the people, prior to the last election, that they would govern this country in the interests of the people, they have failed lamentably. . The wage-earners were told to vote for the great National Party, because its policy was one that would be the means of improving the conditions of every member of the community, and some silly idiots believed them. I could mention six constituencies in Victoria in which the electors were hopelessly deluded. Although the basic wage rate for Victoria has been fixed at &#163;5 16s. 6d., I believe the Government do not intend paying more than &#163;4 4s.. which means that they are going to ask a man who has a wife and three children to support to accept &#163;1 12s. 6d. less than the Commission, which was &#34;specially appointed to make an investigation considers necessary. The workers of Australia have been waiting patiently for many months for a decision to be reached, and men have charged the workers&#39; representatives on the Commission with delaying the publication of the report. The working men and women in Victoria are in a more serious position than those in New South Wales, where the Government have to a degree settled the question. When the New South Wales basic wage was fixed at &#163;3 17s., the Victorian rate was about &#163;2 8s., and when the New South Wales rate was increased to &#163;4 5s., the Victorian basic wage was&#39; &#163;3 2s. The workers in Victoria have been waiting for the decision of this Commission, and now it has been received, the Government say they cannot give effect to it. We are told by honorable members opposite that we are only in favor of the public servants receiving an increased basic rate, but that is incorrect. This Parliament can effectively control the wages of the public servants. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they will, because they have been the worst paid section in the community. It is impracticable for a private employer to pay less than is paid in the Public Service. We deny the statement that this Parliament cannot assist the workers outside as well as those in the Public Service. If we increase the price of commodities, wages must also be increased, and, as I have said on a previous occasion, a daily wage of &#163;1 is not too high, because it really requires that amount to enable a man with an average family to live in comfort. One hears on every hand of increasing rents, which are rising to the extent of 4s., 5s., and even 10s. a week. The Government guaranteed 5s. per bushel for the farmers&#39; wheat at the railway sidings ; but wheat is now 9s. per bushel. All other commodities have risen in price, and wages must be increased to meet the altered conditions. I doubt very much whether a discussion on the subject will have any effect; but it is the duty of honorable members to place their views before the people. I believe it would be in the interests of the public servants if they held stop-work meetings every day until their demands were conceded. I know there are many honorable members opposite who would welcome such an event, because they believe they would then have an opportunity of dealing with them. </para>

                        <para>- Because it. is a weapon which has been used by industrial unions with great success during the last few years, and it would benefit the public servants if they adopted a similar course. I happened to be in Western Australia when the public servants of that State went on strike a few months ago. That strike, brief though it was, disorganized the whole State, and had it continued much longer would have brought about a condition of chaos. The position would be the same in the event of a strike of Commonwealth public servants. If the seamen or those engaged in the building or carrying trades go on strike, the effect is injurious to many of their fellow workers, but such occurrences open the eyes of the community to the real sore in our social system. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that we have had a long session, aud that attendance in Parliament entails heavy work on Ministers, but we might very well have continued the sitting for another week in order to deal with a report for which the workers have been waiting* for so many months. This report relates to the very life&#39;s blood of the wage-earning section of the community, and they expect us to deal with it at once. The Prime Minister this afternoon did not display the good temper that I should have shown had there been thrown at me the little present that he received a night or two ago. He dealt with this question in a way which, no doubt, was amusing to some of his supporters, but he might well have asked the House to sit next week m order that this quest &#39;on might be fully considered, and a definite decision arrived at. The public have not been taken by surprise. The have been expecting the fixing of a basic wage. Will any one say that it was thought that the Commission would recommend a basic wage involving an increase of only four or five shillings per week on the existing rate? I am sure that the Prime Minister had no such  anticipations.  He is teo keen a student of economics to have expected anything of the kind. </para>

If there is any industrial matter that comes within his jurisdiction, and concerning which my constituents complain, I shall not hesitate to bring it before him. Another point is that he has taken. good care to clothe himself with more power than  has any  other man in Australia. He is, indeed, the only mean in the Commonwealth with any power. The people have not yet recognised that fact. They gave him a new lease of power last December, and I shall continue to put before him every industrial grievance with which he has power to deal. It is my duty to do so, and it is his duty to listen to my representations. </para>

                <para>I do not want to see any trouble over this matter - I am afraid that I am too often speaking of threatened trouble - but I am satisfied that the public servants of Australia are determined on this occasion to secure their rights. It is nonsense to say that the country cannot afford to pay the basic wage. The Commonwealth can pay it, but it is useless to pay it unless at the same time the Government take steps to keep down the cost of &#39; living. Unless that is done, a re-adjustment will be necessary from time to time. </para>
                <para>A word now as to the position of the womenfolk of the community. In dealing with the basic wage, I hope that the Government will not discriminate between married and single men, nor as between the sexes. A woman nowadays needs as much to live on as a man. We are told that the women want to dress too well. That may be a weakness on their part; but every man prefers to see a woman well dressed, rather than dressed in a dowdy fashion. In respect of clothing alone, apart from the cost of board and lodging, a single woman wants the same wage as a man. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in differentiating in this regard between married and  single  men, for the reason that if the wage fixed for a single man is less than that for a married man, private employers will employ only single men. There are many ways by which a man with a family may be assisted without differentiating between his pay and that of a single man. The State in many ways can assist his children from their birth. The State should provide them with medical attention and medicine, and, where necessary, with nurses. It should also provide for the education of the children, from the primary .school to the University. Not only should it provide them with free instruction, but with all school requisites, and if the child of a poor man has brains, and goes to the University, the State, where necessary, should provide that child with food and clothing. In the olden days, when a man paid &#163;1 a week for his board and lodging, a woman had to pay only 10s. or 12s. per week. To-day it is not possible for a woman to get decent board and lodging for less than 30s. a week, and, in addition, she must keep herself in clothing and all the other necessaries. I do not want to labour the matter, but I trust sincerely that this question of .sex in relation to the basic wage will not be dealt with now as it has been in the past, and  that further disabilities will not be laid upon women. </para>

                        <para>- This principle has been laid down, as the honorable member for Yarra points out; but in the Education Department we find women teachers in one town doing work for a certain wage, and male teachers in another town doing the same class of work for a higher rate of wage. Of course, if a woman cannot perform the work done by a man, she should not expect the same rate of pay; but it is the duty of the Government to see that every person in the community gets a fair living wage. It has been stated that the industries of the Commonwealth will not be able to pay this basic wage. What nonsense! If an industry is in that position, it is clear that the public are underpaying for its products. We have been told that many mines throughout the Commonwealth will have to close down if miners&#39; wages are to be brought up to the standard fixed by this Basic Wage Commission. I should like to see many mines closed down, for I know it would be much better, from the point of view of health, if the men engaged in them were employed on the land, even if, after a few years&#39; work there they turned round and  voted not for the party that made it possible for them to go on the land, but for the Conservative section of the commuunity. The statement that an industry cannot afford to pay the basic wage is nonsense. There was a time when the fellmongering industry was the lowest paid in Victoria; but when it was demonstrated that if the industry could not pay better wages it would have to go out of existence, those connected with it very soon found it possible to pay better wages. Take the case of the farm worker. If the effect of paying the basic wage to him will mean increased prices for farm products, well, it will be nothing new. Wheat, butter, and other products have already gone up in price, so that this will only mean another re-arrangement. But if we agree to pay the basic wage throughout the Commonwealth, and do not take prompt steps to put down profiteering, the basic wage will not be sufficient for very long; there will have to be a rearrangement about every month. Glad as I would be to see the Government placed in an awkward position by their refusal to give effect to this recommendation, because &#39;I am one of those to whom political victory is very sweet, I do not want to see them in any such difficulty at all. I would rather they adopted the basic wage, in order that the people might be in an improved position financially. I hope, therefore, that before this session closes something practical will be done. </para>

                    <para>. - This movement for the basic wage is another declaration of the war that is going on all over the world ; but it is not, based on scientific principles. I should like to see a wage fixed for the man and woman as husband and wife, and provision not for three children, but four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or twelve children. If the basic wage is paid to the husband and wife, there could then be no question of differentiation between single and married, men, because the single man, if he had any sense, would hope soon to find a good Australian girl to be his mate. It is. the duty of the State to look after the child. For thirty years I have been endeavouring to persuade the powers that be to endow every woman with the right to go to the Government and claim a pension for her child. The elder Napoleon was the greatest friend of woman and child the world has ever seen. Under the <inline font-style="italic">Code Napoleon</inline> it is impossible for the husband to disinherit his wife or children. No child asks to come into the world, no child can come into the world, unless the parents meet; every child is the future unit of the State, and every unit of the State has rights that neither parents nor the State can deprive it of. It has the right to claim proper food, shelter, clothing, in order to become a healthy adult. I want to see woman idealized, and to be able to claim. &#39;as her right, all these things for her child, as the future unit of the State. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> has named 12s. as the sum which should be set aside for the upbringing of each child. What lesson is this for the Military Department in regard to their treatment of the children of deceased soldiers ! What a lesson it is to that mean-spirited Treasurer of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McPherson),</inline> who says that children  can be brought up on 8s. per week. I wonder how he would like his own children brought up on that sum. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington&#39;s</inline> figures, parents with twelve children, and for some years they could all be under sixteen years of age, would get the basic wage of &#163;4 per week, and the allowance of 12s. per week for each child would bring the total income to &#163;11 4s. per week. It hae been said that the country cannot afford to pay the amount involved by the adoption of the Basic Wage Commission&#39;s. recommendation. Is it not a fact that in Germany, Italy, and Russia wages are nominally very much higher than in Australia ? After all, although money in those countries may have depreciated, the real test is to be found in the amount of commodities that it can buy. A quarter of a century ago the public servants of this State regarded Labour and Democracy as something not to be touched with a 40-ft. pole, and I remember on one occasion, when speaking at an open-air meeting, telling them I expected to live to see the day when they would ask Labour unions to help them. That day has come. But will we be satisfied if public servants get this basic wage, and outside employees do not? By no means. In the old days the public servants of Victoria drew &#163;2 in pensions for every &#163;1 drawn by public servants in New South Wales, with &#163;50,000 to the bad. Victoria at that time paid her public servants in pensions more than was paid in all the other States of Australia put together. I have always stood for one pension, and that pension only - a pension that should be available to every man and woman on reaching a certain age. What I ask for the public servants I shall not cease from asking for every man and every woman employed outside the Public Service. I was glad to hear the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> say that no difference should be made on account of sex. As far back as 1901, this Parliament, in dealing with the Public Service Bill, affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work. &#39; There is not a member of this House who would permit us to go back to the barbarous times of a comparatively few years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison&#39;</inline> Ord, who was Secretary to the Labour Department of Victoria, once said, that certain manufacturers and others used to pay their girls 2s. 6d. a week, giving the money on the Saturday morning, and collecting it from them again on the Monday morning. They were actually allowed to use it in that interval. When they asked for more they were &#34; sacked,&#34; and others taken on in their places. In 1898, 4,554 women were employed in Victoria at an average wage of&#39; 10s. 9d. a week, and of them 3,813 averaged only 8s. 7d. a week. The average of 10s. 9d. a week was due to the inclusion of the comparatively high salaries paid to heads of Departments. That brand of infamy known as sweating was supported by the laws of Victoria; but to-day the people are rising in their power. I recognise that the position has its difficulties for Ministers. I do not care who else may be making this a party question, I am not doing so. lt may be difficult on the figures given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> to pay this basic wage. Employers will dismiss their hands, and close their works. But how easy would the position of Ministers be if they could say, &#34; This Commission recommends a certain basic wage. We are bound to accept its recommendation, and unless within sixty days a certain number of citizens lodge a petition objecting to its payment, it will become the law of the land.&#34; There would then be behind it the 900,000 or so householders who pay the whole of the taxation of Australia. With the referendum and initiative in pur Constitution the people would have, the last voice in saying what should be done. Under such an arrangement Ministers would be in a much happier position. As it is, the alliance of the public servants of Australia with the Labour  party may cause them to lose a number of seats. The conditions of our society are a reflex of those of Central Europe; but, thank goodness, we are 12,000 miles away from the centre of the disturbance. A German friend of mine, in sending five sovereigns to Germany, can get 900 marks for them, whereas formerly he got only 100 marks, so greatly has the purchasing power of money declined there. This Parliament must prevent the unjust increasing of prices. We should send to- gaol those who charge unfairly. In 1812, Napoleon, in his Criminal Code, enacted - I quote from memory a free translation - that if any man, or body of men, came together for the unjust raising of prices, the penalty should be 20,000 francs and- not &#39;&#39;or&#34; - six months&#39; imprisonment; but if the increase of prices affected food, such as bread or wine, the penalty should be doubled. </para>

                <para>Evidently, he saw the malign influence of Trusts and Combines. The sooner we face this difficult question the better it will be for all of us. It was in 1898 one of the most aristocratic surgeons that England has ever had - I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jonathan</inline> Hutchison - suggested that England should nationalize its bread. Why should not the Commonwealth Government take the &#34; staff of life,&#34; pay a fair price to the farmers who grow the corn, give a fair price for the gristing at the mill, and let the national bakeries hand it over the counter free, with a charge made for delivery? It would not cost them one-tenth of the amount which they have expended in connexion with the war. I am now speaking on behalf of the most helpless section of the community - the children. They have a right to proper food, clothing, and shelter. What is the greatest asset which a country can possess? Is it its gold, its houses, or its land ? Certainly not. It is a healthy population, consisting of well-educated men and women, who are well able to discharge their citizen duties. Does it not appeal to every honorable member that we must control prices ? I can recall the case of only two or three companies in Australia which have not increased their reserve funds and their dividends since the outbreak of war. Anybody can verify what I am saying by consulting the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> Honorable members might do worse than study the question of finance as it is set out in that publication. I am glad that the public servants recognise that the workers of Australia are their peers. If they are in need of assistance, I am satisfied that the unions of this country will help them so long as they will act reciprocally. I do not doubt that, at the recent elections, some of the swell public servants of this country were swayed by the placard which was used by the National party, and which was headed &#34; Ryan and Ruin.&#34; How can a man help the name that he bears? It is a mere accident of birth. Yet, I am convinced that at the present moment it is a handicap for one to bear a name&#39; which comes from the land where the shamrock grows. Loving my country as as Australian, I do not deny the right of persons born in other lands to become permanent residents of the Commonwealth. To me, there is only one country, and that is Australia. It comes before everything else. I want every person who is an Australian, either by birth or adoption, to stand up for it. Let us set an example to the whole world by showing that we can handle our country and that we can do at least as much as is accomplished by intelligent creatures of a lower . order than ourselves. When I look upon the ant and the bee, I ask myself how it is that, never in the nest of the ant or the hive of the bee, do the young suffer if the necessities of life exist there. Can we say the same of our fellow human beings? Has it not been stated that 20,000,000 persons have perished of starvation in India? That is equivalent to four persons for every man, woman and child in Australia. Have we not been told that there is no child , under four years of age in Servia, and in parts of Bulgaria, and that although the Russians are endeavouring to help the children of their own country, the latter are still in want. Let us set an example to the world, by showing that every human being here - fashioned as he is in God&#39;s likeness - shall have a chance to live a decent life as the Deity intended. </para>

                    <para>.- My enemies will be pleased, and my friends will be resigned to learn that I have limited my address upon this proposal to ten minutes. After that, I shall bid the House and you, sir, an affectionate farewell, with an expression of hope that you will enjoy a happy Christmas and a merry New Year, and that we at least - whatever may happen to unfortunate public servants to whom the Government have refused their just rights - may go home to enjoy that basic wage which we have secured for ourselves for the period of the Christmas vacation, and for so long thereafter as a tolerant public will suffer us to enjoy it. J rise to join very shortly in protesting against the Government breach of faith in respect to the non-payment of the basic wage, in the first place to the members of our Public Service, arid afterwards, as we had hoped, to the general community. As an Opposition all we can do is to register our protest against the repeated breaches of faith on behalf of the Government iu matters of the kind. The promise was made under solemn circumstances; it was not a casual observation, but a direct statement by the Prime Minister himself, the head of the Government, as part of the Ministerial policy. The promise was that effective machinery would be created for the purpose of ascertaining a basic wage payable fo members of the Public Service, and that the findings of the Commission would be given effect to. </para>

                <para>We are&#34; not now beginning in this matter; we should by now have reaped the fruits of our labours in this regard. The Commission has deliberated for twelve months, and the Public Service and the public generally have waited expectantly &#34;for the result of the Commission&#39;s deliberations. It is not surprising to-day, when this determination has been arrived at, that the greatest impatience and indignation should be manifested on finding that Parliament is, about to go into recess without any hope of the promise being given effect to. The amendment moved by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> does not advance the matter. It is a series of platitudes which binds the Government to nothing, and promises nothing, though, indeed, if it did, we should not be much further advanced. It is curious, by the way, that the Treasurer should move an amendment as a subordinate Minister, on the motion submitted by his own Prime Minister. It is said that we cannot pay this minimum wage. I remind honorable members that the basic Wage does not necessarily mean fair compensation for work done; all it means is the minimum on which a person or family can decently live. I suggest to the Government that it is their duty, in the case of married men with three children, to definitely promise the immediate payment of what has been declared to be the least that is necessary to enable them to live under decent conditions. That is not too much to ask as a first instalment; and on that sure foundation, they might then, if they chose to regard the obvious intention of the Commission, extend &#39;some measure of justice to the others/&#34;&#39; We have deprived the Public Service of the Arbitration Court, and are proposing to 6et up a new Tribunal, though when that new Tribunal will come into operation I do not know. We have- granted large increases in salaries to members of the Professional Division x and  to &#39; men enjoying high salaries in the Public Service, and we have not, it is perfectly true, forgotten ourselves. In these circumstances, for a responsible Minister to declare that the Commonwealth is not equal&#39; to paying to its public servants what a Royal &#39; Commission, after sitting for twelve months, declares to be the bedrock salary, is an in; suit to the Commonwealth as a whole, as well as to our common sense. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony),</inline> who is absent, and whose interests I wish to protect in his absence, has raised the objection that the presentation of this report of the Public Works Committee to the Governor-General may deprive the House of the opportunity of discussing it. Am I to understand that, although the report of the Committee is presented to the Governor-General, it will be laid on the table of the House in the ordinary way when it meets again, and honorable members will have the opportunity of discussing it? </para>

                        referred to two matters relating to compulsory military training. The first complaint is in regard to the unsuitable time for prosecution of lads employed in the coal mining industry. This Department has no control over the State Law authorities, the days for prosecutions are arranged to suit the local magistrate, but instructions will immediately be issued to the Commandant, 2nd Military District, that Area Officers in future must consult mine managers and the magistrate, and endeavour to arrange that cases for failure to render personal services are taken on days which are not working days for the collieries. At the same time, full inquiries will be made in regard to this matter by an officer specially detailed to&#39; visit Sydney next week. The second complaint is in regard to the non-supply of uniforms and boots.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline>
                        will remember that the reason for this was given some time ago. Special instructions were issued some time ago that discretion was to be exercised by Area Officers in dealing with lads who were drilling in their plain clothes. If

                        will be advised of the result of inquiries immediately a report of the officer mentioned in the previous paragraph is received.

Certain members of the Public Service desire that I should call attention in this place to a circular which they have received, which is regarded as objectionable. Personally, I think that it is objectionable. It has been issued by the Acting  Deputy  Postmaster-General, apparently in the ordinary departmental routine way, and its contents are as follow: -  tn connexion with the awards recently made by the Deputy &#39;President of the Arbitration Court for the granting of new allowances to operate as from the 1st July, 1920, to meet increased cost of living, I have to state it is necessary that all widowers and married officers submit evidence of marriage, and it is accordingly requested that immediate steps be taken by you to obtain from all widowers and married, officers in your branch their marriage certificates for notation by&#39; the Department. The certificates should be forwarded under confidential cover to the Staff Section, accompanied by a list of names and designations of the officers concerned, and special care must . he taken to see that the documents are duly delivered. The certificates will be returned immediately after notation. </para>

It has been a trying session, and when I look on those patient and enduring men who record what we say, or what we endeavour to say, I think that if there is to be a special reservation high above the Seventh Heaven, they will surely inherit it. Their duties are most trying.

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Friend</inline> has organized and leads a most competent staff, and, with the experience I have had in other parliaments, I say deliberately that his is the most efficient <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff in Australia. Indeed . I think it will compare more than favorably with any in the world. To the messengers and other officers I tender my thanks. They, too, play their part, and strive to do their duty. We wish them well. I wish the officers and staff of the House every good thing for the coming Christmas season, and in the New Year I hope I may, without completely blighting, or withering my friends on the other side, wish them well also. We have our little differences. Where would we be without them? The interjections of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> which I do not always catch, are a source of unending delight to me,  and when I offered him an hour or so ago &#163;10 to assassinate two members of this Chamber who persisted in prolonging this sitting he absolutely refused to undertake the business. And yet there are carping spirits who say lawyers are ah avaricious and unscrupulous tribe ! We have all had a trying time. We have endeavoured, each one in our own way,- to do our duty, and it will be in the fullness of time for the people to judge each one of us. I wish every member of the House the compliments of the season. I wish every officer the same. May I express the earnest hope that  we  all meet again, our health and spirits benefited through the temporary respite from our labours. I trust that we shall return to duty prepared to make the Tariff, amongst other things, a Tariff at which every nation will pluck out their eyes with envy, and that we shall be able to say that  We  have solved one of the most difficult problems on earth. </para>
