The exemption of such investments from Federal income tax is unfair to the rest of the community. </para>

                        <para>- They are, and State loans are free of Federal income tax. I confess that I was not aware of that fact until a few days ago. The question of whether or not incomes so derived are taxable has not yet been decided. It  is a constitutional point, and until it has been determined, I cannot say whether they are taxable. Meantime no taxation is being collected in respect of income from State loans. </para>

                    <para>-(By <inline font-style="italic">leave).I</inline> had thought of making to-day a short statement regarding the new Commonwealth loan, but since the Prime Minister is, I understand, to lay on the table this morning the cable messages - which have been edited - that passed between the ex-Treasurer  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and himself and proposes to deal with that very important matter, I fear that, from the point of view of publicity, it would be prejudicial to the loan itself if I were on the same day to make a statement with regard to it. I was wondering whether the House, in the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves, would think me wanting in my duty to it if, instead of making the statement to-day - and, after all, it will be only a short one - I were to publish it in the press on Monday next </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The only question is whether I should make this statement side by side with the other very important matter to which I have referred. I do not think it would be fair to the loan itself to do that. I should like the statement to go out when the public mind will not be occupied by other important matters. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot deal with this matter by way of answer to a question, but may I say that I have my rights just as have other men ? I think it is only fair to say that as soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> resigned it was assumed, as usual, by the press of this country, or of this State, at any rate, that I was in the wrong. I was not only blamed for being the cause of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline> resignation, but for not immediately accepting it, and for refraining from making a statement on the whole matter. . As honorable members know, I made a statement after consulting my colleagues, as any sensible man would have done in the circumstances, and that statement, to put it mildly, upset my critics more than a little. Of course, they withdrew nothing that they had said about me, but they suggested that they would wait until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> came back before they said anything more. There the matter would have rested but for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> himself, who suggested the unusual course of laying the correspondence between us on the table. If I had declined to do this, is it not obvious that my refusal would have been construed as an admission by me that the course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> would prove him to be in the right and me in the wrong? In the circumstances, therefore, I have followed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline> suggestion. This House, and the people of the country are to act as a jury to try the case, and judge who is in the wrong. I have my reputation to consider, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has his. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has been my colleague, and I have never said, and do not propose to say, one word against him. He has, however, resigned, and I must show that his resignation was due to no act or fault of mine. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> said that as the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party are satisfied, after editing the cables that passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> will be placed at no disadvantage by their publication, and that we should, therefore, not publish them at all. But the honorable member is under a misapprehension as to what the position is. All that those who edited the cables have done has been to excise those parts which have really no bearing on the point at issue, but are matters which, in the public interest, ought not to be published. They have not attempted to judge the merits of the case. Everything that relates to the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> will be laid on the table. I am now appealing as a private member of the House, and I say to my fellow members that they have a right to hear me, because I have been assailed. </para>

                    <para>. - (By <inline font-style="italic">leave).</inline> - As I have said, the course proposed to be followed in connexion with this matter is a most unusual one. So far as I know, it is without precedent for a Government to table the secret correspondence that has passed between its various members in relation to public matters. But then the circumstances are unprecedented, too. Let me remind honorable members for a moment of what the position is. It is grave in the extreme. My late colleague went Home to deal with matters - to quote his own words - "of life and death." The financial circumstances of the Commonwealth at present are most embarrassed. I need not dwell on them for they are well known. I refer honorable members to the statements made by the ex-Treasurer in Parliament and outside. He went Home because it was considered impossible to grapple with the situation from a distance.  A  man on the spot was called for, and he, by virtue of his position as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was by all sections of the House considered the proper man to go to London to deal with it. The most important and pressing object of the mission related to finance. </para>
                </talk.start></continue><para class="block">In addition, there were other matters to be dealt with, not less important, although, perhaps, less urgent. Amongst these were matters that arise out of the Treaty of Peace - Mandates, League of Nations, and War Indemnity. There was also the re-organization of the High Commissioner's Office in London, the question of a trade representation in England and elsewhere, and the question of immigration. </para><para>After the right honorable gentleman's departure the Allied Powers decided to hold two Conferences of the first importance, one at Brussels to deal with finance, and the other at Spa to consider, and, if necessary, to revise, the Versailles Treaty. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> was appointed the sole representative of Australia to both these Conferences. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Yes; to-day we have neither any representative on these vitally important Conferences, nor any representative in London to deal with finance. Honorable members can readily appreciate what this involves. For example, the day before yesterday the time expired when it became necessary to find a huge sum of money in London. We had no one there to carry on the difficult and delicate . negotiations on the London money market, or to put our case to the British Government. The Brussels Finance Conference is coming on. We shall be unrepresented. The Spa Conference, at which the question of the war indemnity will be raised and important revisions of the Treaty of Versailles may be made, is shortly to be held. Australia will be without a representative to uphold her vital interests. </para>

But by no effort is it possible for us to place a man 12,000 miles away in sufficient time to take up the threads of the mission with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> was intrusted. These considerations then, together with the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> himself that the cables that passed between us should be published, are the reasons, or excuse, if honorable members  prefer it, why I take this unprecedented course. </para><para>The cables that passed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and myself were very numerous, and, in some cases, very lengthy. The whole of the file which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> asked yesterday should be published was laid before a Committee consisting of that honorable gentleman, the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> and myself, and the cables were edited. There was no difference of opinion between us as to what should be excised. By general consent certain things were left out. I give the House and the country the assurance on behalf of myself, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Country party, that nothing has been left out the omission of which could in any way affect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to his disadvantage or prejudice, and that all things left out have been omitted only in the public interests of the Commonwealth. I think it only proper to say further that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline> the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, who has charge of all these files, and through whose hands all these telegrams go and come, and who ciphers and deciphers them, was asked by me in the presence of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> and the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> whether this was the complete file, and he said that, with the exception of two telegrams sent by the Department of the Treasury, at Mr. Watt's request, to supply him with particulars about financial affairs in that Department, this was a complete file. The cablegrams referred to, I understand, were purely departmental, and have nothing whatever to do with the matter with which I am dealing. I have not got them here, and have not seen them, but I am prepared to show them to the honorable members to whom I have referred. </para><interjection>

Wool is key to solution. Very much depends upon way in which matter is put to British authorities. Am convinced that way we agreed upon is one to follow. Position is that Commonwealth Government owes British Government for war expenditure, say, £40,000,000. Britain is strongly pressing for payment of 8$ million pounds at once, and for assurances re balance. That is one side. Now for the other: British Government owes Commonwealth Government- not owes wool-growers, mark, but owes Commonwealth Government - half profits all civilian wool. What this amounts to we cannot ascertain, although we have pressed for information repeatedly, but in my opinion our share is not less than £40,000,000. </para><para>The position being thus stated suggests courses to be followed, and I know no one so. well fitted to do so with complete success as you.

And as a step precedent to all discussion upon finance, settlement of our half profits on wool must be made. </para><para>Honorable members will understand that the above is what I am suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> should say.

It was a small, but most representative, gathering. I put two schemes before them- one dealing with finance, the other relating to sale of new clip. I told them in strictest confidence of the purport of your mission, upon the success of which I said financial position of Commonwealth depended. I told them that the Commonwealth must have money. I explained effect the huge excess of exports over imports must inevitably have upon Australian business. </para>
                    <para>Of course, British Government is not in any way concerned with all this. Under the agreement, Britain must divide profits with Commonwealth Government.

                    <para>I desire to suggest for your consideration a scheme which calls merely for a little co-operation between growers and others interested, and for some negotiations with the British Government. These negotiations I am prepared to undertake if required, as I feel sure that the action contemplated will be in the best interest, not only of Australian wool-growers, but of Australia generally. This scheme calls for no further legislative nor administrative action by the Government. The present Proclamations with regard to the export of wool would simply remain in force until November 1st next. The rest of the scheme depends merely upon agreement between growers and Australian brokers to defer opening sales in Australia for some six weeks or so, and negotiation with the British Government to induce it to suspend sales in London while 1920-1921 clip is being sold in Australia. </para>
                    <para>As I have told you, Government of Australia must raise at least £40,000,000. This money must be raised. </para>

I fully appreciate that many graziers are having bad time with drought, an.d they have my deepest sympathy. I sincerely hope this trouble will soon pass away, but I say that, apart from the drought, wool-growers are in unique position. No other section of community will have anything like sum of £30,000,000 payable to it in London. No other section has before it possibility of realizing during next year even fraction of amount that wool-growers are likely to get for new wool clip if it is handled properly. </para>

                    <para>These, I think, are the principal complaints. I will take them in order. </para>
                    <para>Let me remind you, first of all, how your mission to England originated. As Treasurer, you made a most important statement to Cabinet dealing with finance, and stated that your mature opinion was that the position was such, that a Minister ought to go oversea forthwith to deal with the matter, which could not be settled from this end. Your colleagues entirely concurred. You suggested Millen should go. I thought, as the matter related to finance, and so fell peculiarly within your province, and you were in every respect best fitted to deal with it, that you should go. This you consented to do, at the request of myself and your colleagues, who all agreed you were the best man to go. </para>
                    <para>In your statement on finance made to Cabinet, the question of wool was not mentioned by you; it was brought up by me later at the same or at a subsequent Cabinet. Being much impressed with the gravity of the financial position of the Commonwealth as set out by you, I ventured the opinion that our half-share of the profits was so considerable that, if we could obtain it, it would materially help us.' It was then agreed that you should, when in London, not only deal with finance generally, but that you should also endeavour to get a statement of accounts and payment of the half profits. Then it was decided you should endeavour to organize immigration. I was to persuade the States at this end to agree, but, if this were not possible, then, as I stated a* Bendigo, Commonwealth would act independently. That was the third point of your mission. Then you were asked to look into and re-organize Australia House. You were also to press upon the British Government the necessity for immediate confirmation of the Mandate, and to insure payment of the indemnity in May, 1921. These were the main heads of your mission. Primarily it was one relating to finance: if it had not been for that and your statements in regard to it, no Minister would have gone to London. </para>
                    <para>You say I have interfered with you and embarrassed you. Cabinet has looked most carefully through all the cables which have passed between you and me, and into those between </para>
                    <para>British authorities and Commonwealth since your departure, and has considered my actions here in all their bearings, and, as I have said, they do not think your complaints justified. </para>
                    <para>Before dealing with your complaints in detail, let me remind you that, long before you reached London, and before I had even thought of discussing anything with the pastoralists here, you sent a telegram from Colombo, dated 9th April, in which you said you were disappointed I had not sent latest confidential information with reference to Peace Treaty, League of Nations, and Mandates. You stated that, unless you received advice as to developments these questions, it would not be. possible for you to effect anything, and that you would not attempt the task. I regarded the peremptory tone of your cable as an indication  that you had not received some of the telegrams that had been sent, that you were still far from well and suffering from strain of overwork. As I told you subsequently in my  wire of 16th April, I had no further information in regard to Mandates, Treaty, and League of Nations since you left, but would prepare and send you before arrival in London full statement on these and other matters. And this I did, as you know. </para>
                </quote><para>  Now let me deal with your complaints in detail. First as to wool. You complain that I met the growers and discussed certain matters with them while you were on the water. I certainly did, and it was imperative that I should do so. Time was the essence of the contract. I saw them on two matters, neither of which permitted of delay. One related to a matter outside your mission entirely - I mean the sale of the new clip. That had to be settled at once, for, clearly, delay in a matter that had to be determined in a few weeks was, on the face of it, impossible. You can hardly say that this embarrassed your mission in any way. The second point I discussed dealt with the half profits due to growers, about which they had had no information, and about which they were much concerned. This had relation to your mission, but, so far from embarrassing you, the discussion and subsequent action could only have the very opposite effect, because, although technically the half share of profits belongs to the Commonwealth Government, we are only trustees for the growers, to whom the money belongs and to whom, in default of an agreement, it must be handed over. As your mission to London was primarily to raise money which would be available for the Commonwealth to pay Commonwealth debts, it would not help us in any way if the half share of the profits were paid to the growers and retained by them. And, of course, deliberately withholding the money from the growers by compulsion was out of the question. There was, and is, no way of obtaining it except by arrangement with the growers. All this needs no argument. If you got the whole of the 40 millions which we estimated is due to the growers in London to-morrow, how would it help the Commonwealth if we had to hand it over immediately to the growers? The consent of the grower to such an arrangement which would enable the Commonwealth to have the use of that money in London was essential to the success of your mission. You could not negotiate with the grower, who was here. </para><para>Negotiations had to be carried on here, which I did. I remind you I did it on the suggestion of a section of the industry itself. So much for that. </para><para>As I told you, the pastoralists have agreed to my proposals <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the sale of the clip, and I hope and Believe they will agree to the bonds, thus leaving you able to adjust Commonwealth finances with the Chancellor. You speak about obtaining the 81/2 millions, paying 41/2 millions to Chancellor, and making balance available to our Treasury. May I remind you that, without growers' consent, you cannot retain a farthing of this 81/2 millions? </para><para>Now I come to another point. You say I have been communicating with the British authorities by wire, in regard to payment of half profits and wool clip, while you were on your way to and in London. That is quite true. As to my telegrams re sale of next clip, you recognise that is outside your mission, although I asked you before, and do so again now, to support it with British Government. As to wires <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> payment of half profits, I sent those while you were en route, in order to prepare the way for you. I am sorry if you think I ought to have left you without any support from this end in a matter which concerns us so vitally, but I think you will find, quite apart from this, the real objection from Inver forth and Company is not the cables I have sent, but the press reports, which have obtained such wide publicity, of the debates in House of Representatives on motion of adjournment by Rodgers, and a grossly inaccurate statement in the press by Inverforth himself, to which I was compelled to reply. However, I quite see your point and shall not send any further wires in reference to payment of half profits except to you. </para><para>You say, further, that I ought not to have entered into any negotiations with growers while you were on the water. I do not agree with you. Let me remind you what you did while I was on the water. While I, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, accompanied by Minister for Navy, was on my way to England, you entered into negotiations with. British Government for an extension of wool contract and sold the wool for the war and one year thereafter. Not only did you not consult me, but you did not even notify me when you had completed the negotiations. I learned of it only through the press, and subsequently from Secretary of State. So much for that. </para><para class="block">I would remind honorable members that this is a matter which I originated, it was in my Department, and those who recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to sell knew that if I had been here I would never have agreed to extend the agreement for longer than the period of the war. Yet I was not even notified of the transaction when completed, let alone consulted, although this could easily have been done. </para><para>You complain that I communicated with British authorities. Let me remind you of your own practice while I acted as representative of Australia in London. I could mention many cases in which you did this on matters relating to my mission, but one will suffice. In November, 1918, you advised Secretary of State of Government's approval of principles of clearing scheme of settlement of pre-war debts, merely notifying me of the action taken. This was clearly a matter on which I might have been consulted at all events. </para><para>For months, you communicated on many matters with the Secretary of State direct, without notifying me at all. I only learned of them from the Secretary of State himself and was thus frequently placed in a most embarrassing position in my discussions with him. It was not until I asked the Prime Minister that copies of all cables from and to Australia should be shown to me after arrival and despatch that I was kept reasonably well informed of what was being done. I have only to add that, on 11th May, I sent you a cable setting out in the fullest detail, both in relation to sale and finance, the proposals I had put before the wool-growers. </para><para>I must say that your statement that I sent you a cable which differed in form and substance from that sent Secretary of State on same matter is absolutely amazing. The whole of members of Cabinet had opportunity of comparing them, and all agree that for all practical purposes they are identical in form and precisely the same in substance. So much for that. </para><para>

                    Representation at Spa Conference. - You complain that, while nominally given the powers of a plenipotentiary, you are so restricted by instructions from here that you are in effect only a telegraph messenger. Surely, if you will cast your mind back to the time when you were Acting Prime Minister and I was in London, you will see the position of which you complain is one in which I myself was placed. I was never given a free hand, but was compelled to act on definite instructions from Melbourne. Not once, but on many occasions, you told me in plain terms that I must not commit the Government; that I must not act in a certain way. For example, in November, 1918, you told me that I must not press for representation of Dominions, as such, either at Versailles Council or Peace Conference, that it was not reasonable and could not be supported by Cabinet. You said - " We feel we are not justified in letting you go straight ahead on the course you nave marked out without Baying even more plainly than in my previous cables what our opinions are. I personally earnestly trust that you will give due weight to them, and advise me result."
                </para><para>Then, again, in regard to sale of wheat, which was one of the matters specifically intrusted to me, I was placed in a most invidious and unfortunate position by being hampered continuously by contradictory instructions from Melbourne, which compelled me to perform a <inline font-style="italic">'volte face</inline> with British Government and Royal Wheat Commission. Again, in connexion with appointment of a Naval Member and Commodore, after having made arrangements with Halsey and guaranteeing a certain salary, Cook was compelled to cancel the appointment. There was also the question of Nauru. When I strongly urged that we should stand firm and resist attempt of British Government to compel us to share this with Britain, I was told Cabinet did not agree, and I had to withdraw from a position I could have maintained to the lasting advantage of Australia. Then, again, in connexion with sale of Austral ships, in March and May, 1919, you said proper procedure was to obtain definite authority from Cabinet, and that I should carefully observe this rule. Then, in May, 1918, <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> finance, you said I must do nothing involving finance on large scale without consulting you. </para><para>I could multiply these instances <inline font-style="italic">ad lib.,</inline> but these are sufficient. They amply demonstrate that the opinion of the Government was then, and is now, that it is impossible to give an absolutely free hand to representatives overseas, and that the Government is, and must remain, in Melbourne. You will not forget this rule applied even when I, as Prime Minister, along with Ministers for Navy and Defence, was in London, and Cook and I were, in widest sense of term, plenipotentiaries. </para><para>Having said so much, let me say this further to you: I am merely following the rule which you yourself so strongly insisted upon. You will admit, I think, that the rule is a sound one. It certainly applies to Lloyd George himself; it applied to him right through Peace Conference. On several occasions he found himself overruled by his colleagues. It happened to Orlando and Clemenceau. Wilson was in a different position, but what is the result?  His  Parliament refuses to indorse what he did. I want to say, however, that I know how embarrassing and irritating the application of this rule must be. I felt it so a hundred times, and had I said exactly what I felt I should no doubt have sent you many telegrams which would not have differed much from yours. So, speaking from the depth of my experience, I quite understand your attitude, but hope that you will look at the matter as I did, and do the best you can. Believe me, I shall not embarrass you, but will do everything to help you and keep you informed. I shall not communicate direct with Secretary of State <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> wool half profits or finance, excepting at your request. In regard to Spa Conference, the only restrictions upon your freedom of action are in relation to those matters upon which overwhelming bulk of Australians have fixed opinions. </para><para>Further, I put it to you, as one man to another, that as Prime Minister I may fairly claim to be consulted before any variation is made in Peace Treaty with which I had so much to do, and with the details of which you cannot be as familiar as I am myself. Reference to cable files shows that in every stage of the Peace discussions, I acted in fullest concert with the Cabinet, and took no important step without first obtaining their views. </para><para>

In pressing this on Lloyd George in letter dated 7th March, 1919, I pointed out that Commonwealth Government Line was then operating nineteen ex-enemy ships of total tonnage of about 134,000, and had previously been operating nine others of total tonnage of about 56,000, but of latter five had been submarined, one wrecked, two taken over by Indian Government, and one employed carrying mails northwest coast Australia; that many of these ships had been specially built for, and had at outbreak of war been engaged in, Australian trade, and that to bring total tonnage ex-enemy ships in Australian trade up to 300,000, although it would in some measure relieve great hardships suffered by Australian producers during war and at present as consequences of loss of tonnage and diversion of ships to other trade, would still leave us far short of our pre-war tonnage. I stressed industrial and economic disadvantages to Australia under war conditions resulting from her geographical position, also huge sacrifices made by her in voluntarily surrendering to Great Britain fifty-three coastal steamers, of gross tonnage of nearly 200,000 tons, and depriving herself of seventy-nine other steamers, of gross tonnage of nearly 400,000 tons, which she requisitioned and handed over to Britain. I reminded him that Australia was an island continent with 12,000 miles of coastline, relying on sea-carriage for bulk of her InterState trade, and whole of her trade with other countries. I compared serious decline in Australia's exports and imports during war period with great increases in case of other countries, particularly Canada and United States; and I drew attention to disastrous effects on prices of raw materials, on marketing of which Australia lives. Finally, I pointed out that war necessities which had been held to justify this treatment of Australian trade no longer operated, and that every consideration of justice required its immediate alleviation. </para><para>In subsequent letter to Lloyd George, dated 12th March, 1919, I again directed attention to urgency of Australia's needs. Owing to lack of shipping, millions of tons of wheat, food products, and other raw materials, were lying in Australia awaiting shipment. The world was hungry for this food. It had also been said that Europe must be fed and clad. If so, it is surely necessary to safeguard Australian interests and not to permit America and Japan obtain at once carrying trade and market for goods produced outside Empire. Ex-German shipping belongs by every right to Empire for this purpose. To pay America, or any other country, with Germany's very best asset, at expense of all her other creditors, leaving Australia without ships to send her goods to world's markets, would be to inflict great, perhaps irreparable, injury upon Australia and Empire. </para><para>Hughes.

On top of that comes your telegram making widely ( ?different) and, I think, impossible demands. You are the head of the Government and I a subordinate Minister. The wool authorities did the only thing open to them - politely, but clearly, they turned me down. Even now, while promising not to communicate direct with Secretary of State about wool finance again, you have apparently no intention to put me right with Government here, by stating to them that this matter is entirely in my hands. Until such an intimation is sent, I should only humiliate myself by knocking at door again. I repeat that your telegram to Secretary of State was different in form and manner of presentation to what I was advised; but I see no good arguing on difference, in view of what you say is Cabinet opinion. </para><para>

                    Spa. - If you think I am fool enough to agree to any amendment of matters on which Australians have strong convictions without consultation, I am neither fit to be plenipotentiary nor messenger. Nevertheless, I cannot masquerade as a plenipotentiary and know that I am bound hand and foot.

Will any man say for one moment that that was an improper limitation upon the powers of a representative of the Commonwealth? I ask them to contrast that with my position in London, when I was told that I must not even ask that Australia - this great Commonwealth that made such tremendous sacrifices for the Empire during the war - should be represented at the Peace Conference at Versailles, and that he could not allow me to go straight on.

I say deliberately that had I given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> every cause for irritation and resentment, as he was the representative of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> a mission which meant life or death to us, he ought not to have abandoned his post. Had I been in his place, and he in mine - although, perhaps, what I would have thought could not be expressed here owing to the rules of the House - I would have remained, and when I returned would have said exactly what I thought. I have no doubt that is the feeling in the minds of nine out of every ten people in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> has left us now without a representative in London at one of the most critical junctures in our history. I invite honorable members to note those acts of omission which he said irritated him. I invite them to note that I did what he asked at the earliest possible moment. I notified the British Government of the fact that he had been appointed as our representative on the Imperial Cabinet. He asked me to see that he received copies of cables to and from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and I* directed that that should be done. I said, further, that, whilst I did not admit for a moment that his complaints were justified, I understood his position, and I would in future be silent, or I would speak as he desired. I said that I would despatch no more cables apart from those he wished me to send to support him.

I felt it so a hundred times, and had I said exactly what I felt I should no doubt have sent you many telegrams which would not have differed much from yours. So, speaking from the depth of my experience, I quite understand your attitude, but hope that you will look at the matter as I did, and do the best you can.

I understand, I think, just how you feel, and I want to assure you that you have no reason whatever for the belief that anything is being done, pr will be done, at this end to impede your mission. On the other hand, everything will be done, whether by silence or action at your request, to further it. We want you to succeed. We both have the same object in view, viz., the welfare of Australia.

I have looked through the files, and I can find nothing to justify it. I ask honorable members to recollect that the only thing I did in reference to the half profits on sales of wool were things that, in the very nature of things, had to be done, and had to be done in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> could not negotiate with the growers, neither could he retain one penny of the money unless the growers ' assented. The growers were in Australia. I was the man to meet the growers, and I did so. For some reason or other <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> took umbrage at this, although I notified him at the earliest opportunity of what T had done. I communicated direct with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> But he acted in a very different manner towards me, for he sold the wool when I. was tin the water without even notifying me of the sale. He states that his ship had wireless, so had mine; and, although I was at Auckland for a week, at Suva for a day, at Honolulu for a similar period, and was four weeks in America, I did not hear one word concerning the sale of the wool. Yet, although I was surprised and strongly objected to what he had done, I went on with my mission. </para><para>I have endeavoured to put "the matter quite fairly. I am naturally much disturbed at what has happened. I am disturbed personally, because it has broken the intimate relations that have existed between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> and myself during three or four of the most trying years in the history of the Commonwealth. But I am more disturbed because of the consequences to Australia. She is unrepresented now, when she is in urgent need of representation by a competent man. Our finances are in a very delicate and embarrassing position, and "matters of life and . death " require attention by a man on the spot, yet we have no representative in London or elsewhere to endeavour to adjust them. </para><para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                    has resigned. I have explained the circumstances under which he has done so; I think I should add that this is the third time that he has sent in his resignation since my return from England.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                    then met me at Fremantle, and accompanied me across the continent.  His  health was at that time giving him, his family, and his friends grave concern. We discussed together the position as it then stood and the future as we saw it reflected in the mirror of the present. He told me - I give the substance of our conversations, because I cannot remember the actual words - that he could not continue in office, that he had merely held on during my absence, but would now have to resign. On my side, I said what honorable members know to be true, that I had had five or six years 'of incessant struggle. Those who' know me best know what a wrench the cataclysm that divided the Labour party in 1916 was to me. I had returned from a mission in regard to which I might fairly claim that the reputation of Australia had not suffered at my hands. I had done that which I was sent to do. There were many reasons why I should retire- I shall not speak of the opportunities laid before me in England on which I turned my back, but it can be understood that returning as I did, and being received as T was received, I could not have selected a more propitious moment for temporarily withdrawing, at any rate, from my position. -I had had enough. Therefore, I said to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>
                    Watt,  " If you retire, I shall retire also. I shall not carry on." To that he replied that he would think the matter over, and let me know his decision. Subsequently he said that he would carry on, and honorable members will recall that that decision was publicly announced. I told him that as his health was such as to preclude him from doing much electioneering work, in the event of an election he could remain in Melbourne, and I would do the greater part of the electioneering. That promise was kept. Subsequently, however,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                    twice resigned, definitely and in writing. In each case I persuaded him to withdraw his resignation.
                </para><para>Honorable members now have all the facts before them. These show clearly that I did everything in my power in this instance as I did on other occasions topersuade <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> to remain in the Government. The cablegrams prove conclusively that there would have been no sufficient reason for his resignation had he been in Melbourne, and had I spoken to him in the terms in which I wrote to him. No one would dream of resigning a portfolio on that account. I have been in a Ministry with the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> and he, like other members who have held office, know that at Cabinet meetings there are frequently differences of opinion expressed, and that after discussion the will of the majority must prevail, and the Minister holding a contrary view must either fall in with his colleagues or resign. I do not say that there are not circumstances which justify resignation if the Minister is on the spot; but during a long Ministerial career I can now recall only one instance in which I felt so strongly on a matter that I would have resigned had it been decided adversely to my view. The matter to which I refer had nothing whatever to do with conscription. The honorable member for Yarra was one of my colleagues at the time, and he and I decided to resign unless effect were given to a certain policy. Effect was given to it, and we did not resign. Had we resigned, however, our resignation would not have embarrassed the Commonwealth. But when men are sent 12,000 miles overseas on a mission of vital importance to the country, there is imposed on them a sacred obligation which they cannot evade, and I cannot conceive of anything that would justify their resignation. Certainly there is nothing in the cablegrams that I have read to justify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline> resignation. I have sat at Cabinet meetings at which hard things have been said, I will not say worse than anything I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> because I wish that every one would speak to me as I wrote to him, and no doubt others would like me to speak to them always as I wrote to him. I cannot conceive of anything that would justify the abandonment of a mission so vitally important to the Commonwealth as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> I regret the right honorable gentleman's resignation; I regret the loss of the man himself, and, above all, I regret the consequences of the resignation to the Commonwealth. </para><para>There is one other cablegram which I have not mentioned.

                        relating to the surplus from the London sales had been considered separately, and that it had been decided to accept the Prime Minister's proposals as a basis for the sale of the forthcoming clip, and to authorize him to put his proposals before the British Government as follow: - " 1. No export of the new 1920-1921 clip from Australia prior to 1st October, 1920. " 2. No auction sales of Australian wool in London after September 30th, 1920, until May 1st, 1921. " 3. The earliest notification of this to be given so that buyers will know that Australian wool will be procurable only in Australia between the dates mentioned. " 4. No auction sales to be held in Australia until October 1st next. From this date on Australian wool brokers would auction the 1920-1921 clip on owners' account and proceed with the auctions without interruption until May 1st, 1921, from which date onwards normal conditions would prevail, viz., the British Government would resume selling its left-over wool and auctions could be held concurrently in Australia of any small quantity that might then be left of  the 1920-1921 clip.
                    </para>
                    <para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> explained that in formulating his proposals and laying the item before growers, he had been offering advice which he felt assured was in their best interests. It would not only be against the interest of growers, but a disaster also to Australia to allow the coming clip to be sold anywhere hut in Australia. He would not be a party to compulsion. "Representatives of the growers indicated that Government control in any form, regarding the management of the realization of the new clip, would not be acceptable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> again emphasized his determination to have nothing to do with control. " Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to the drought difficulties in many parts of Australia, and he expressed the hope that the British authorities would, without further delay, make a statement of accounts as to the amount of money that already stood to the credit of the Pool. The presence of the Treasurer in London would, he felt sure, be helpful in obtaining a proper statement, and also in securing an immediate payment of the amount due to Australian growers. "As the amount to be made available from accrued profits was uncertain, it was agreed to leave the consideration of the Prime Minister's financial proposals to a later date, pending receipt of replies to his cable communications to the Secretary of State and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt.</inline> " In order to allow carcass butchers, sheepskin buyers and fellmongers to be unhampered, in their operations, and also to safeguard the interests of the fat stock and sheep-skin markets, it was indicated that special arrangements would have to be made whereby skin wools could be realized, thereby preventing an undue amount of money being locked up. Permission to sell privately through selling brokers during the period from July 1st to October 1st, would, it was held, no doubt meet the difficulty. "It was announced that an executive had been appointed to be known as the Australian Wool Council. This body will be available to receive all communications from, and discuss all matters with, the Prime Minister in connexion with his negotiations." </para>

                            - Yesterday I asked whether the cablegrams that had passed between the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                            and
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline>
                            or between the Prime Minister and any other Minister and the British Government would be laid on the table, and the Prime Minister replied that they would be laid on the table, with the exception of such parts of them as had nothing to do with
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt's</inline>
                            resignation or contained statements which, in the interests of the public, should not be disclosed. He suggested that I and the honorable member for Franklin
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline>
                            should go through the file with him, and determine what might properly be kept back from publication. The file of correspondence was submitted to us, and we were assured by the Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department that it contained the whole of the cablegrams that had passed. The Prime Minister's suggestion was that we should edit this file; but we acted rather as censors, our work being to cut out what was not material to the case, or what, in the public interest, should not be disclosed. We were not asked to take sides, and I do not intend to do so. By way of illustrating the omissions that we sanctioned, I might say that one of the cablegrams sent by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                            contained certain confidential figures. He said, " I have obtained these figures in confidence." That information was, therefore, kept back from publication. Then on another matter the Secretary of State for the Colonies sent a cablegram to the Prime Minister marked " most secret." Honorable members, no doubt, are aware that there are " confidential " cablegrams, "secret" cablegrams, and "most secret ' ' cablegrams. A cablegram marked " most secret " could not be published without the permission of the sender, and therefore that cablegram, together with the Prime Minister's reply to it, has been withheld. We were not asked to indorse or confirm any of the statements in the cablegrams; that was not our business. All we were asked to do was to make sure that the material facts were given to the House. In the file there are statements that are not material to the resignation of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                            - criticisms of persons and Governments, which have nothing to do with the case - and the publication of some of which might injure the Commonwealth. We agreed that such statements should not be made public. Possibly any member who desired to see the whole file could do so; but that is a matter for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. I assure the House, however, that, in my opinion, everything on the file that is material to the case, and that could properly be published, has been made public by the Prime Minister.

                            and the ex-Treasurer

                            has been made public. What we struck out was either matter that did not meet the case, or matter that we thought should not, in the public interest, be disclosed. May I add that I deeply regret what has occurred. Personally, I shall refrain from expressing any opinion on the case, either publicly or privately, until
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline>
                            is present, and has put his position before the House. That seems to me to be the fair course to take.

                    <para>That in the opinion of this House it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work: - Provision of an automatic telephone exchange at Collingwood, Victoria. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This and two other similar works were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1915, and were approved of. This work was unanimously approved of by the Committee in that year. One of the other works has been carried out, and the other is in course of completion at the present time. This particular work has not been touched because of the difficulty of securing material and the inability of the Treasurer in the state of the finances to provide the necessary funds. I am glad to say that this year the Treasurer is able to provide sufficient funds for the work to be carried out during the present year. In anticipation of the consent of the House being given to this work I have obtained tenders for the switchboard, but I received an intimation that unless the tender is . accepted by the 30th June the prices quoted in it will be re-adjusted. Knowing that the House would not re-assemble until yesterday, and that consent to proceeding with the work could not be secured until to-day, I was able to induce the tenderers to agree to an extension of the time for the acceptance of their tender to the 7th July. If we do not proceed with the matter now we are informed that the prices quoted will be likely to be increased. The work is absolutely necessary. I may say that there are three other automatic exchanges which it is proposed to submit to inquiry by the Public Works Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member at the present moment in which State they are to be established. The work referred to in my motion is estimated to cost £123,000, and it is anticipated that about £100,000 of that amount will be spent during the present year if the construction of the proposed exchange is approved of. It is very badly wanted. Our telephone services have become terribly congested throughout the whole of Australia through the inability of the Department to carry out necessary works during the years of the war. We have now to pull up the consequent arrears, and the sooner we do so the better. I confidently ask the House to carry this motion. </para>

Our revenues have increased remarkably; from Customs and Excise we received this year £4,000,000 in excess of the Budget Estimate. I have always believed that the Budget Estimates were on the conservative side, the anticipated receipts being nearly always exceeded; I have rarely known them in my twenty years' esperience in this House to be overestimated. </para>

                            <para>- They have never reached anything like the colossal proportions of last year's figures. We received last year, in Customs and Excise revenue, £21,640,000, or £3,890,000 in excess of the Budget Estimate. No doubt the new Tariff accounts, in some measure, for that increase, but high prices are, I think, largely expressed in the figures. I am glad to be able to announce that the income tax receipts for the year totalled £12,850,000. We anticipated receiving from that source only £10,500,000, so that the increase over the Budget figures was £2,350,000. Many arrears from past years have been paid into revenue. That speaks volumes for the spirit of our people, who, notwithstanding the ravaging drought which has raged over a large part of the continent, have stood up to their responsibilities in this way, and paid amounts that were due from former years. No doubt high prices have again helped, and I apprehend that we may look forward to continued high prices for primary products for some time to come. </para>

                            <para>- I know of some honorable members in the Comer here who hope that I am right. When we hear of butter being sold in London at 240s. per cwt., we can still anticipate a distinct rise in the prices of some things. The reason is that, to-day, the world is still hungry, and many countries are in want of those things which we, in this happy land, have in abundance. I think we should congratulate ourselves, not only upon our attainments during the last financial year, but upon the prospects for the future. Of course, the expenditure also was greatly in excess of the Budget anticipations. That was due largely to big increases in the war pensions and old-age pensions, but notwithstanding these heavy advances in expenditure, we anticipate that the year's transactions will disclose a credit balance of about £2,000,000. We commenced the financial year with an accumulated surplus of £3,476,478. There is unavoidable delay in completing the accounts for the year, owing to the fact that there are in London huge accounts to be balanced, the final figures of which do not reach us for several days after the financial year has terminated. For that reason the figures I am quoting are only approximate. But we anticipate that when all accounts have been balanced we shall have an accumulated surplus of between £5,000;000 and £6,000,000. I am looking forward to the appropriation of that sum in connexion with next year's account towards meeting the heavy expenditure to which we are still liable in consequence of the war. At this moment our attitude should be one of gratification for the manner in which the people have responded to their liabilities, and particularly for the fact that we live in a country that is so happily circumstanced. </para>

                        <para>.-We were all delighted to hear the Acting Treasurer's statement, particularly as it followed upon the somewhat dismal picture that was painted during the reading of correspondence earlier in the sitting.  I  am glad that the financial outlook is improving. As I stated when speaking on the Tariff last night, I am concerned with the Tariff, less as a revenue producer, except in regard to Excise duties, and import duties on beer, spirits, and narcotics, than as a means of giving advantages to Australia's industries. Perhaps one of the causes of the 'big increase in Customs revenue are the high prices which are operating at the present time, and which, unfortunately, the people have to pay.  I  am hoping for the time when prices  will  decrease, but I candidly admit that those persons who are  in  the best position to judge do not anticipate any material decrease in the near future. I should like the Acting Treasurer to inform the House of the order of business for next week. Honorable members should know whether we are to proceed with the Tariff or with the Navigation Bill and the Passports Bill, so that they may come prepared accordingly. </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish to impress upon the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> the necessity for making some adequate provision in the forthcoming Estimates for the construction of the Federal Capital. At Canberra the Commonwealth possesses one of the richest properties in Australia, and it is calling aloud for development. The development already carried out there has been immensely profitable, and by the expenditure of the money necessary to honour the bond entered into with the State of New South Wales at the time of Federation, the Commonwealth would be able to develop there a rich revenue-producing asset; The honouring of that contract is long overdue, and I hope that the Estimates for the current year will disclose that the Government are determined to keep faith with New South Wales. There is abundant evidence on every hand that this is not a National Parliament in the fullest sense, and that it cannot be so while it continues to sit in the capital city of one of the States. </para>

                        <para>.- When I interviewed the Prime Minister in Sydney concerning the prospects of proceeding with the Federal Capital, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> informed me that the question of finance was the difficulty in the way. We are now informed, however, of a surplus of some £6,000,000. In view of that happy state of affairs, I hope the Government will make a full statement to Parliament next week regarding the Capital. New South Wales has endeavoured to carry out her share of the obligations entered into with the various States under the Constitution, and she should no longer be denied her own rights. I look to the Government to honour the agreement, and I believe this House will heartily support the proposal to complete the Capital at Canberra. </para>
