                            <para>The figures referred to by the honorable member were apparently extracted from the No. 3Report of the VictorianRoyal Commission on High Prices. That report states that the figures were discussed in detail by the Commission with the  President  of the Victorian Farmers' Union (now the honorable member for Echuca), who, the Commission stated, accepted as accurate the c.i.f. prices United Kingdom quoted, and who concurred in all the other figures. Owing to the impossibility of obtaining free freight from Australia to London in 1919, in any quantity, even at exorbitant rates, it cannot be said with any certainty, or even degree of accuracy, what true London parity of Australian wheat was at any time during the year. The statement does not appear to be an unfair one. </para>

                    <para>. -When the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was explaining the Supply Bill to the Committee, he stated that the amount provided for in this Bill would carry the Government on till the end of May. That means that we are asked to practically pass Supply for nearly the whole of the remainder of the financial year without having an opportunity of discussing the expenditure. I remember the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> when he was sitting on this side of the House, writing for the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail</inline> a series of articles called " The Financial Carnival." If the country was engaged in a financial carnival then, the present rate of expenditure might be described by a much stronger phrase. At that time Supply was usually obtained for a month at a time; only on exceedingly rare occasions was the House asked to vote Supply for three or four months. We have departed from that practice. The Treasurer stated also that but for the election having intervened, the Estimates would have been disposed of in December of last year. He went on to say that the reason they were not dealt with was that after the Prime Minister returned from England, Parliament was busy in dealing with the various Pool's and other matters. He was evidently referring to the Commercial Activities Bill. I find that the Prime Minister returned to Australia in August, whilst the Commercial Activities Bill passed through this House on the 3 1st July. I believe that it was assented to before the Prime Minister's  arrival, so that the explanation given by the Treasurer was absolutely incorrect. </para>

                        <para>- I shall get on with the job. In order to obviate an all-night sitting, which I am always ready to avoid if possible, I promised the Prime Minister last night that the Supply Bill would be passed through the House by 4 o'clock this afternoon. That undertaking will be honoured by every honorable member on this side of the House. </para>

                <para>One matter has apparently been lost sight of. The Treasurer forecasts an amendment of the Public Service Act to place the Service under a Board of Management. That will mean probably the appointment of three Commissioners instead of one. We were told subsequently that the Post Office would be placed under a Board of business men. As a representative of a metropolitan constituency, I do not think that that arrangement will be bad for the vested city interests, but if I were a country representative, I should not like to see the control of the Post Office handed over to men who will see that the city interests are looked after. We shall have exactly the same trouble as is experienced in the State Parliament in connexion with the railways. There the Minister shelters himself behind the excuse that the Railway Department is being managed by the Commissioners, and he has no power at all. </para>
                <para>I did not speak to the amendment put forward by the Country party, because I felt that honorable members who had not spoken on the censure motion moved by me had a prior claim. There are many items in the Bill which should be discussed. Some honorable members will desire to know why one State receives different treatment from the others in regard to the export of base metals. So that other honorable members may have an opportunity of bringing before the Committee the items in which they are interested, I shall content myself with having placed on record the inaccuracy of the Treasurer's statement regarding the reason for not proceeding with the Estimates last year. </para>

                    <para>.- There has been a good deal of discussion regarding economy and the reduction of expenditure. Although I took no part in the debate on the amendment moved by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> I have listened with considerable interest to it. The striking feature of the debate was that when honorable members had an opportunity, a few days previously, of casting a vote in support of the principle for which they alleged they were standing, they refused to vote against the Government, presumably, because the motion was moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Honorable members in the Ministerial corner were found voting with the representatives of the middlemen. I think the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> was justified in his suggestion that honorable members in the Ministerial corner had really passed &amp; vote of confidence in the Government, but that they then turned round and moved what amounted to a vote of want of confidence. </para>

                        <para>- I am just leading up to a point. The Country party acted inconsistently. Honorable members on this  side who represent country constituencies voted consistently on both occasions; they supported the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition and that which emanated from the Country party, because they realized that the interests of the primary producer and the consumer are identical. That was illustrated by the votes cast by the honorable members for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham).</inline> Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> and Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle),</inline> and those gentlemen were supported by representatives of industrial centres, whether they were sent here by waterside workers, miners or shearers. A practical demonstration was given to the people of Australia that this party stands on a platform which comprises the interests of the producers and consumers alike, and eliminates the middleman. This matter must eventually be fought out in the constituencies. I have not much faith in our friends in the corner, I have never had, and I have not much faith in any alteration that would take place if they were given the opportunity of assuming the reins of government. I am influenced by no personal feeling towards any one in casting my vote. I vote, not against the Prime Minister, but against the Nationalist party he is leading, which stands for and is supported and put in by the profiteers. I draw attention to this in order to make my position clear to the constituencies, where eventually the fight must be fought out. The only good that I can see that would obviously be derived by removing the present Government from office, is that we may have an opportunity of looking . through the pigeon-holes, because there will be no proper investigation or disclosure until we have another set of Ministers in charge of the Treasury bench. That is one of the main reasons why ' I supported the amendment of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> and why I think a change of Government ought to be brought about or a new election held. No one' on this side is frightened of an election. Until there is a different set of Ministers in office, the people of Australia will not have a proper disclosure of the situation; we shall have no explanation in regard to the shipbuilding contracts- or the amount of money  lost on each, and there will be no proper explanation with regard to the wool transaction. Is there any honorable member in this House - </para>

We are told they are to get half the profits to be made by the Imperial Government, but I doubt whether it is the Imperial Government and not some huge private profiteers in Great Britain that has made profits. I have great confidence in the manner in which the British Government, as a Government, will deal with the overseas Dominions of the Empire, but I have a shrewd idea th 6.t the profits on the wool sales have gone to private individuals in Great Britain. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I have a shrewd" idea that some persons in Australia were permitted to sell to their own representatives on the other side of the world, and thus, perhaps, shared in the profits. The people are looking for a full explanation of the whole transaction. They want to get down to definite facts. It is claimed that the information has already been given to them. If that is .so, why is the Treasurer to be sent Home on a begging expedition to get a bonus, as it is called, for the wool-growers? There should be some definite way of explaining to the people what they may expect to get in return for their wool clip, but no such definite statement has been made. I want it now, because the wool-growers of Australia do not know what they are to expect. In my. opinion, they may expect very little, if anything at all. </para>

In Australia we are reaching a stage where the power of money exceeds the power it has displayed in any previous period of our history. A statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> "Wade, a well-known Liberal of New South Wales, on his return from Great Britain, is largely applicable to Australia.

                </quote><para class="block">An identical state of affairs is fast making its appearance in Australia, and a good deal of the direct action that is complained of, and of the industrial unrest prevailing arises from the fact that the workers of Australia are having it driven home to them that, although we are supposed to enjoy free democratic institutions, the reins of government can be secured by the use of large sums of money and by the practice of doubtful methods. Unless our friends opposite and those who support them realize that they must discontinue 'this practice, then exactly to that extent will our parliamentary institutions become discredited, and the number of people outside who stand for direct" action, and claim that Parliament is of no use, increase. One of the most objectionable methods employed during the electoral campaign was the use of a secret service known as the Commonwealth Police Force. I have no hesitation in saying that some members of that Force were used for political purposes as canvassers. The Prime Minister smiles when I say this. He evidently thinks it a great achievement; but I would like to know why this Force, born of the Warwick egg, was transferred to the control of the Attorney-General on the eve of the elections, how many persons constitute it, when and to what extent their numbers were increased, exactly what their duties are, where they are located, and whether there is any other secret service ? I want to know exactly the amount of money spent on the Commonwealth Police Force, and, generally, what necessity there is for its existence. These are matters in which the people of Australia are very much interested, and I am satisfied that honorable members of this House know that the circumstances do not justify any expenditure in this direction. </para><interjection>

At all events, it is not justified by public exigencies, no matter what the private exigencies of Ministers may be. I do not hesitate to say that some public money is being spent on a secret service which is mainly used for political purposes. I would like to know whether Ministers contend that the Bill does not cover some expenditure for the Commonwealth Police Force. Seeing that no Minister replies by interjection, I feel it is necessary for mc to add certain words to the clause. This Supply Bill, I take it, covers all the Supply asked for by the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- Before this clause is carried, I desire to repeat my question as to the Commonwealth Police Force. It was definitely stated by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> that no authority was sought under this Bill for moneys for the payment of that force. The statement was not very relevant to the discussion, because the amendment that I moved, if carried, would have had the effect of preventing the payment of the Commonwealth Police from any source, whether under this Bill or otherwise. I should like to know under what authority the Commonwealth Police are paid and what are their numbers. </para>

                    <para>. - When the honorable member first raised this question I told him that I would obtain the information sought by him, and while I was doing so he moved his amendment and divided the Committee on it. I shall tell the Committee all I know in  regard  to the Commonwealth Police Force. So far as I have been able to gather, there are eight or ten - I would not say that there are more than nine - persons employed in investigation work, who, for want of another term, may be described as members of the Commonwealth Police Force. It is against this formidable and numerous body that the honorable member has been fulminating for some time. Apparently the Commonwealth is tottering on its firm base because of the machinations of this body, and the Treasury is depleted because of their emoluments. I have been out of the country for some time, and do not know very much about the force, but I was endeavouring to obtain the information sought by the honorable member when he rudely interrupted my laudable effort by proceeding to divide the Committee. But I may tell the honorable member that these men are engaged in connexion with investigation- work, and they do for* .my Department and the Attorney-General's Department exactly the same kind of work that the Customs officials do for the Customs Department - neither more nor less. To call them police is to misuse language, for they are not police- </para>

                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> tries to introduce many extraneous matters into the debate; and by way of rejoinder, I should like to say one word. The honorable member, asked me what these eight or nine men are engaged in doing, and I have told him that, amongst other duties, they investigate cases of fraud or embezzlement in the' Departments, and, in national matters, they investigate all cases of disloyalty, conspiracy against the State, movements by the Sinn Fein body, and so on. Will the honorable member, or any honorable member, say that Sinn Fein is an institution which is to be permitted to run its course in this country without any attempt on the part of the State to see that it does not aim a blow at the foundations of Empire, on which our security depends? I have said, or, if I have not, my colleagues, or some of them, have said, that for all practical purposes this so-called. Commonwealth Police Force ceased to exist long ago. It was brought into existence to enforce Federal law, which was in danger of being wholly disregarded. In certain parts of Queensland iri which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> resided for a long while, the Federal law was disregarded to such an extent that the warrant of the Commonwealth did not run, and the State police force would not attempt to enforce it. If I require any proof of that, I can turn to the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford),</inline> who lived in the district where, for all practical purposes, law did not exist. </para>

                    <para>.- One has to be very cautious in dealing with finance matters, in view of the danger there is of creating panic.' The other day the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us that he is going to England on Commonwealth business, and that one of his objects is to float a loan, or make some arrangement, for the repayment of some £8,000,000 odd to the British Government. It is our duty to preserve the financial stability and credit of Australia, and to show our ability to meet any ordinary call made upon us. We were told by the Treasurer that the Commonwealth is requested to pay this sum of £8,750,000 as soon as possible; and I think that the position can very easily be met. In my opinion there is no necessity for the Treasurer to go on the London money market in its present condition. Any one who is studious enough to watch the financial journals and the telegrams which appear daily in our own press must realize the anxiety and trouble which the financial genius of Great Britain is experiencing in the efforts to meet the war debts, without the Dominions making any heavy calls on the resources of the Old Country. I cannot understand why the Government did not immediately ask the advice of this House, or get authority while the late Parliament was sitting, to repay this money. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems remarkable that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who originated the Commonwealth police as a sort of secret organization, is not in a position to give the Committee any information regarding it. I find that, instead of the few men referred to by the honorable gentleman, there are at least thirty-two officers of different grades in this body, who are paid a total sum of about £7,000 per annum. This Department has grown in the usual way - a few men were appointed for certain duties, and they soon gathered Others around them. Thus new Departments multiply, and the expenses of the Government increase. In the central administration there is a- director in ' connexion with this Investigation Branch at a salary of £750, and he has several clerks, an inspector, and two sub-inspectors. In New South Wales there is a. sub-inspector at £372, a clerk at £198, an inspector at £180, and two detective sergeants at £584. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria there is an inspector in charge at £408 per annum, a clerk at £198, a detective-sergeant of the first class at £292, and one detective sergeant of the third class at £256. /'n Queensland, in which State, it was &lt;aid, the Commonwealth police originated, there is an inspector at £426, two clerks at £204, and £186 respectively, two detective sergeants of the first class at £584, and two detective-sergeants of the third .lass at £511. In South' Australia - a very peaceable State indeed - there is an inspector in charge at £408, with a clerk  at £186, and two detective-sergeants of the third class at £512. In Western Australia there is an inspector in charge at £40S, a' clerk at £186, and two detective sergeants of the third class at £512. In Tasmania there is an inspector in charge at £300, and, under his control, one detective of the first class at £257. The total expenditure under this head, as I have said, is set down at £7,102 per annum. If we can exercise economy anywhere it is in connexion with this absolutely useless and extraneous body created by the Prime Minister simply to satisfy a whim. To expend between £6,000 and £7,000 per annum on the upkeep of an absolutely useless body of men is to scatter broadcast the taxpayers' money, which can be ill-spared at the present time. If these men are paid, not by the Commonwealth Government, but by private persons, that should be stated. They are under the control of the Commonwealth, and' act according to the instructions of Commonwealth authorities. This country is infested with detectives and others who are engaged in seeking information solely for the purpose of damaging the parties opposed to the Nationalist party. This is a lasting disgrace to those who are responsible for it, and I do not know how Ministers and their supporters can ruthlessly, recklessly, and extravagantly vote this money and justify their action to their constituents. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, they are. What is, the good of trying to hoodwink the members of the Committee?  Every public servant and every man in public office is paid out of the amount covered by this Supply Bill. We have to go to the Estimates for special information regarding the allotment of the grant. I have shown the class of men employed. They are paid handsome salaries for doing nothing but work of a political nature. Those responsible for this state of things should be ignominiously " booted out " of their position, and a set of men placed there who will, in the expenditure of public money, perform their duties honestly. This is not the only item to which exception can be taken ; there are many others which show that Ministers and their supporters, while mouthing economy, are spending money recklessly. </para>

                        <para>- Some members may be silenced by a jocular remark of the Prime Minister, intended to hide deficiencies in administration, but the country will not be satisfied with a smile and a joke instead of explanations. There is a kind of economy which, no doubt, will be practised by the Government, which will not meet with my approval, because it will be levelled at the producers and at those who are doing the work of the Commonwealth. I believe that Ministers will seek to economize by discharging workmen, who are the best customers of the producers, and will keep in office men of high salaries who are doing political work. I protest stoutly against the .cavalier fashion in which the Prime Minister has treated the Committee. Finance was the great issue of the election, and the chief matter that we have to deal with. Yet the Estimates are full of items which should be wiped out. I ask honorable members not to be influenced in their votes by the fact that an objection comes from this or that part of the chamber. If a proposal is right and just it should receive the support of honorable members- generally. This party did not, because the Country party refused to support it3 censure amendment, refuse to support the amendment of the Country party. I know what it is for people to have to live on small incomes, and I am determined that we should, so far as we can, cut down our expenditure. I commend the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> for having brought this matter before the Committee. The establishment of the Commonwealth Police has been a sore point with many of us. The Commonwealth has at its command the services of the State police, including the detectives, and hitherto they have sufficed to prevent fraud. The services of the State police  are still available to the Commonwealth, and there is no need for a special Commonwealth Force. On behalf of the many thousands of men and women who find it hard to make ends meet, and who are paying the bulk of the taxation for the rich people in the community, I protest against this. I appeal to members to act justly towards the taxpayers, even should it mean the displacing of the present Ministers. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that the honorable member has asked the question. Recently a very strong deputation, representative of those interested in the silver and lead ores of Tasmania, waited on me, stating that they were under great disabilities because the Sulphide Corporation, the local treatment company, could not pay them the world's price for their ores, but could only make an advance against the sum that the ores might hereafter realize. They, therefore, asked for permission to export the ores. The Government considered the request carefully, as it raised a question of great importance to the country. The war showed the absolute necessity of control in respect of such .products as lead, zinc, copper, and! tin, because those metals are essential to national safety in times of crisis. Silver, of course, is specially valuable at the 'present time. It was necessary, therefore, to take steps to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate state of things which existed prior to the war, when Germany had control of our metals. But unless we can assure the metal producers of this country a fair price for their products, they cannot continue their operations, no matter how they may wish to do so. If  a  handicap must be placed on the industry, it should be shared by the community at large. I, therefore, told the members of the deputation that, without prejudice to the future permanent policy of the Commonwealth, which in due season honorable members will have an ample opportunity to discuss, they could', for a period of six months at least, export their ores to all but enemy countries. The honorable member for Maranoa asks for the same consideration for other States as has been given to Tasmania. I assume he does not speak merely for Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I have no hesitation in saying that it was not my intention to restrict the concession to Tasmania. In considering the matter, the Cabinet determined that any concession given to one State must be given to all. Whatever privileges are accorded to the producers of silver and lead ores in Tasmania will be given to all producers of such ores throughout Australia. It is not advisable to stress publicly the limitations imposed upon exportation to certain quarters, but, except for those limitations, which apply, of course, to exportation from Tasmania as well as from the other States, there is no embargo on exportation. I shall be glad if the honorable member for Maranoa will convey to the manager of the Silver Spur mine the effect of my statement, to which the press, I have no doubt, will give the widest publicity. If any honorable member desires information that I have not given, and that I am able to supply, I shall be glad to supplement my statement. </para>

Since Friday last it has been the policy of the Government to treat silver and lead ores throughout Australia in the same way as such ores are treated in Tasmania, and I shall ask my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, because of the doubt just expressed by the honorable member, to instruct his officials at the various ports to allow the exportation of these ores. </para>

Difficulties have been experienced, and heavy expenses incurred, in connexion with the shipment of tin and copper, and there is equally as good a claim for consideration in respect of them as in respect of silver and lead. Will the freedom that is to be permitted to the silver-lead producers apply to the producers of base metals generally? </para>

                    <para>. -  I have not given that point any consideration, but I hardly see how it can affect Western Australia, because, as the honorable member for Dampier knows, permission has been given the producers of base metals in that State to- export their products. That was done on account of the remoteness of Western Australia from convenient treatment plants in Australia. No representations have been made to me in regard to copper, tin, and other base metals. So far as I know, there is no hardship throughout the rest of the continent on account of the existing restrictions. But if there is a hardship it is open to honorable members to make out a case, as the Tasmanian representatives did. I dealt with a specific case on its merits, and I am prepared to deal with any other case on its merits. The honorable member for Dampier must realize that we have spent much time and money in attempting to establish great industries in this country, and we shall have failed if we permit the metal trade to drift back into the channels in which it flowed before the war. We must have some regard for the interests of the Commonwealth. If any honorable member can point to any hardship imposed upon any group of producers of any base metal, other than galena or silver-lead ores of any kind, I shall be glad to hear their representations, and, if a case is made out, to grant the necessary relief. </para>

The producers are at liberty to get the best bargain they can in the markets of the world, but the policy of the Government and the Parliament in regard to trading with the late enemy has been declared quite publicly. If this Parliament' wishes to alter that policy it must do so formally after a discussion of the whole matter. Until then the policy of the Government remains unchanged, and registration of contracts must continue. The producers may get the best price they can and export their products to any country except to enemy countries and one other place. </para>

So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, there is no objection to the tabling of that paper. But it is not a contract made with us; it is made between the Imperial Government and certain companies. I know of no reason why it should be kept secret, and the Government will endeavour to get a copy and lay it on the table. If the contract were between the Commonwealth and some one else, the position would be different. But it is not, and I must obtain a copy of it from either the British authorities or the Zinc Producers Association. I shall endeavour to do that. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall endeavour to arrange, at a later date, a conference of many of the leading producers of base metals with the Prime Minister, so that their case may be put clearly before him. I do not care what the policy of the Government may be in regard to these matters - for I am sure I can secure sufficient parliamentary pressure to alter that - but  if  the Government wish to look at the question from the right stand-point, the persons whose interests must be first conserved are the producers, and not the owners of the treatment plants. I know that the Prime Minister was absent from Australia when this question arose, and it was difficult to bring to his knowledge the evils that had arisen. But I feel convinced that, if the honorable gentleman had realized the disaster and ruin that has fallen upon many owing to the drastic regulations made by the Government, he r would have made much fuller inquiries in regard to the claims of the small producers than were made during his absence. These matters were dealt with in an autocratic method, that did not tend to assist either the Government or the country. The producers have never yet asked to be allowed to send their metals to enemy countries. They are prepared to fall in with any views held by the Government in that regard, but I believe I shall have the support of the whole Committee when I say that the first interest to be considered is that of the men who go into the back country and win wealth from the soil rather than that of those who own the treatment plants. Every honorable member of the House has received, I believe, a copy of the lengthy report made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garland, Chairman</inline> of the Sydney Metal Exchange. That gentleman holds a big position in the mining world, and has had a great deal of experience. Therefore, his views are entitled to respect. I know that the tin treatment plants in Sydney did not ask for the restrictions which the Government have imposed. I have with me the particulars  of  one small parcel of tin. At the time it was dealt with, tin- was worth £280 per ton, and had the producer been able to send the tin oxide to America for treatment he would have received, including exchange, and after paying treatment charges, £87 per ton more than he received through being obliged to send the ore to Sydney. The Sydney smelting companies will not treat the metal and then allow the producer to sell it abroad. They buy the oxide on the basis of its Australian value, and then export it to 'America,, and get the benefit of the exchange which should go to the producer. I know that the Prime Minister has been sympathetic towards the producers lately, and I feel sure that when their case has been put fully before him it will be dealt with sympathetically. I am prepared to leave the matter at this stage, in the hope of arranging a deputation to the Prime Minister in the near future. </para>

Two of them are surrounding Brisbane, which is menaced, and the other is in Sydney.

                    <para>. -  When information in regard to the Commonwealth Police Force was first sought by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that the schedule to the Supply Bill now before honorable members contained no provision  for .that' force, and subsequently*  when an amendment was threatened by the honorable member for West Sydney, in order to obviate it, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir- Joseph Cook)</inline> indorsed what the Prime Minister had said. After the division on the amendment had been taken, the Prime Minister returned to the chamber, and said that if the schedule did contain any provision for this force he would supply the necessary information. And now we find that there are three members of the Commonwealth Police Force. But the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has discovered that the ordinary Estimates make provision for thirty-two members of the secret service, and as the schedule to this Supply Bill is based upon the ordinary Estimates, it must contain some reference to the Commonwealth Police Force, if only under the heading of Contingencies. I suppose the Prime Minister is treating this matter in this cavalier fashion because he is buoyed up by the result of the division taken last night. He knows he has the numbers with him and that he can spend what he likes and go on hiding all these things, because no notice will be taken of them. It was very interesting to hear his camouflaged statement as to the necessity for a Commonwealth secret service, on the ground that there have been disloyalists in the community, and that attempts have been made to undermine the Empire. During the last four years, any one who spoke against the Prime Minister or against the manner in which the affairs of the country were being administered by the Government, was accused of disloyalty. </para>

And now .the Prime Minister naturally feels he ha3 a further lease of life, realizing that when it comes to a crisis, such as was threatened last night, at least one member of the Country party will conveniently cross over and vote with the Ministry, and that even if the situation should become desperate, another honorable member will follow this example. That is my interpretation of what took place last night. </para>

I am dealing with a matter affecting wool, and I see no difference between the discussion of lead and ' the discussion of wool. With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I wish to point out that, notwithstanding the statements made by some members of the Country party and others, that our primary producers are perfectly satisfied with the arrangements made regarding the sale of wool to the Imperial Government, I claim there is much dissatisfaction among the wool-growers. It is true that the pastoralists were to get an appraised price,, guaranteed to be ls. 3$d. per lb., a better price than they had ever got in their lives previously, and it is said that they ought to be perfectly satisfied because their wool brought much more than that, and they are to get half of the profit secured from re-sales; but I represent quite as many wool-growers as any other honorable member does, and on their behalf I challenge the declaration of satisfaction that has been made as purporting to come from them. As a matter of fact, the Imperial authorities kept back 10 per cent, out of the appraised price of ls. 3Ad. in anticipation that the wool might not realize that amount, and that 10 .per cent, was not paid over to the pastoralists until the full amount of the appraised price was realized. </para>

                        <para>- In view of your ruling, sir. I shall not at this stage make further reference to the matter. Before we proceeded to divide on the amendment moved by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> that no further provision be made for the payment of the Commonwealth Police Force, the Prime Minister informed the Committee that the schedule to the Bill contained no reference to the force. On his return to the chamber, after the divi son hari taken place, he said that there was at one time a great number of men in the force, but that they had suffered severe casualties, and that their numbers were now reduced to three. I suppose it was after the last general election that their ranks were depleted. This goes to show that the members of this secret service were used for political purposes at the last elections.  </para>

                        <para>- No doubt they are still in the service of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied they are provided for in the schedule to this Bill under the heading of " Contingencies." Several members of the Country party who stand for economy say that they voted against the amendment moved by the honorable member for West Sydney because they accepted the Prime Minister's word that the schedule contained no reference to Commonwealth Police. Now that the right honorable gentleman has intimated that three members of that force have still to be provided for, there can be no misunderstanding, and as every man who stands for this country wants to get rid of this secret service, I shall test the feeling' of the Committee by moving a further amendment.- </para>

The provision in the standing order is clear; the question has to be submitted " forthwith," and there can be no debate at this stage. I submit that it does not lie in the discretion of the  Chairman  to permit any debate now. There is nothing in the standing order to provide that anybody may do anything at this stage to prevent the  Chairman  putting the motion forthwith as to agreement or disagreement with his ruling. </para>

                        <para>- The standing order is absolutely clear. It does not say that the vote shall be taken forthwith; what it says is that the objection " shall be stated at once in writing, and may forthwith be decided by the Committee." What is the alternative? It is that the question shall be debated whether the  Chairman  is right or wrong in his ruling. Personally, I am in favour of the vote being taken forthwith, but it is within the province of any honorable member to discuss the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- We were informed by the speech of the Governor-General that it is intended to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the incidence of taxation. I understand that the Commission is to be appointed almost immediately. Apparently, its expenses will be met out of the Treasurer's Advance, which is provided for in this clause, and I wish, therefore, to take the opportunity to mention a- few facts which indicate the existence of some kind of conspiracy to alter the basis of our taxation by placing on the masses of the people taxes which now are borne by the wealthy. </para>

                    <para>.- It is not my intention to speak at great length, because of the arrangement to finish with the Bill by 4 o'clock; but I desire to refer again to the wages and salaries paid to some of those employed in and about this institution. Honorable members have accepted the assurance of the  Speaker  that there is no sweating of the employees engaged in serving the Senate or the House of Representatives, and I accept his assurance that no one directly under his control receives less than £3 per week. There are, however, employees in the building getting under £2 10s. per week; and I have been informed, though I do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement, that recently a married man employed in connexion with this institution was getting only £2 4s. per week, and that when he died, leaving a wife and children, a " tarpaulin muster" had to be made by his mates to bury him. It has only been when thu  Speaker  or the Joint House Committee has been forced by the awards of the Courts that increases have been given in the parliamentary service, and I maintain again that this is a sweating institution, and that there are men employed in it who are receiving under £2 15s. per week, although the living wage is £3 17s. per week.

                    <para>. - I was  not present when the honorable member for Darling began his speech, and, therefore, did not hear all he said in regard to the wages paid to the employees of the House and the conditions under which they carried on their work. But I would draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that it has only been when I- have been in occupancy of the chair that increases have been made in the salaries of the attendants, messengers, door-keepers, and cleaners of this House. During the long period that my predecessors occupied the Speaker's chair, there was no raising of the salaries of these men, and no complaint of their underpayment was then heard from any of the honorable members who are now interesting themselves regarding the wages and conditions of employment of those in the service of the House. </para>

Those wages and conditions are better now than they were under any of my predecessors. Honorable members appear to be under a misapprehension regarding the facts. So far as the departments under the Speaker's control are concerned, the statements made are not correct. They may have in mind the cases of attendants in some portion of the building over which the  Speaker  has no jurisdiction. </para>

No messenger in that part of the building over which the  Speaker  has control receives less than £168 per annum, which, when the bonus is added, makes it £183. The statement that there are messengers in attendance on this Chamber who are getting less than £3 per week is not correct. There are male cleaners getting £158, without the £15 bonus. ' </para>

                        <para>- There were men here who lived on less before I was elected to the Speaker's chair. I have here a list of the salaries and of the names of the men under my control. In 1913, when I was first elected to the Speaker's chair, an increase of salaries of attendants- was made, and the rates now paid range from £158 per annum, which is the lowest, to £265, which _ is paid to the housekeeper. Together with the  President  I- have been instrumental in getting the Treasurer to pay a bonus in lieu of an increase of salary to the attendants of the House to meet the conditions which have been brought about by the increase in the cost of living. Last year the bonus given was £10, and this year it was £15. </para>

                        <para>- It is twice that, and is more than was ever done for the men before. Yet during the terms of my predecessors in office the question of salaries was never raised in this House. Honorable members who are now seemingly anxious for the welfare of the employees, when conditions are greatly better than they were under my predecessors, did not display any interest in the matter before I was elected to the chair. I draw attention to this aspect of the matter more particularly because during the recent election campaign untrue statements on the subject were circulated by - certain persons in my electorate with a view to damaging my chance of election. That is the reason why, when I heard it stated in the House that messengers employed about the building were paid less than was received by employees of the same class in the Commonwealth Departments and in State Parliaments, I went to the trouble of obtaining information from both the Departments and the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Victoria. I have here a comparative statement which I have not time to read, but which shows clearly that the attendants in this House, so far from being paid lower wages, are being paid a higher wage than is received by those rendering similar service in Government Departments and the Victorian Parliament. In the latter, no cleaners are employed; all the cleaning work is done by the messengers or door-keepers, in addition to their other work, for a less rate than the employees of this House are receiving. I do not say that the remuneration paid to the employees in this building is sufficient if the cost of living is going to remain at an abnormal level. I do not believe it is, but I do say that attempts to make political capital out of the matter will not help me to improve the conditions. On the contrary, it makes my task more difficult than it otherwise would be. </para>

As a matter of fact, I have done my best to supplement the earnings of the employees of the House by means of a bonus, which is another way of adding to the salaries they receive. For some time the whole question has been under review, and my own sympathies are with the men in their desire for a more liberal rate of remuneration, which the increasingly high cost of living fully justifies. The  President  and I have tried, as I have said, to meet the case to some extent by the payment of the bonus, and also by insisting that in connexion with any functions that take place in the House the messengers and other servants in the building should be given the first offer of employment and receive extra payment for their services. This has been done. </para>

                        <para>-I readily plead guilty, but I also urge that there were extenuating circumstances.' I have many times regretted since that I did not then realize the hardship it entailed on others. There is something in the contention that when the messengers are required to remain in attendance on honorable members all night they should receive extra payment. I am in sympathy with the idea that the remuneration should be increased, in view of the abnormal conditions existing, and I am doing my best to bring about that result. I hope that when the next Estimates are prepared they will disclose a more satisfactory scale of remuneration for the lower paid employees of the House. I repudiate the suggestion that I am in any degree responsible for sweating. On the contrary, my instructions to the officers have been that the staff should be compensated for extra duties by additional time off. In fact, I have directed that they be allowed as much time off as possible, consistently with carrying on the ordinary duties of the House, so that members will not be inconvenienced. In this way a considerable addition has been made to the ordinary holidays of the staff. Honorable members can assist me materially in removing any cause for a charge of sweating by combining in a firm resolve to conserve their own health, as well as that of the attendants, by concluding the business of the House within reasonable hours. If honorable members will leave this matter in the hands of the  President  and myself, they may rely upon it being sympathetically considered. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the remarks of the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. "W. Elliot Johnson),</inline> some of which were certainly in very questionable taste, I feel obliged to say a few words on this matter. The honorable member suggested that the under-payment of employees of the House was used against him in his electorate. I challenge him to name one member of the House who referred to this matter in the Lang electorate. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that assurance, because I know that no member of the House did deal with this matter in the honorable member's electorate. Possibly some person who had read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> made reference to it; but there is no foundation for the suggestion that political capital was made out of it by honorable members on this side. </para>

                <para>The honorable gentleman said also that the action of honorable members in bringing this question before the House would prejudice the chances of the employees getting fair treatment. That is a most unfair remark. It is_ beyond question that men are being employed about the House at less than the standard living wage ; and it is a reproach to every honorable member that we should have men in personal attendance on us under those conditions. That fact constitutes a grave reflection on every one of us; it is not the particular responsibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He, in his administrative capacity, is merely an officer of the House, and his duty is to carry out the wishes of the House. I cannot believe that the Treasurer or anybody associated with the Administration would hesitate to make provisions for the adequate payment of men who are in personal attendance on honorable members. The honorable gentleman exceeded the limits of both duty and good taste in assuming the right to tell us whether we should sit early or late. The question of when we shall transact the public business is a matter for the House to decide ; whether we sit early or late, or the round of the clock, proper attendance must be provided; and whatever financial responsibility results therefrom must be arranged by the Government. </para>
                <para>I take the strongest exception to the imputation that, because honorable members object to men who are engaged in rendering personal service to them being paid a sweating rate - and anything less than the recognised standard wage of <inline font-style="italic">£3 17s. 6d.</inline> per week for a married man is a sweating rate - their chances of receiving justice will be prejudiced. </para>

                    <para>.- If this matter were before the Committee for the first time we might, perhaps, have cheerfully accepted the undertaking by the  Speaker  that the evil would be redressed. But I have a very vivid recollection that the same matter came up for discussion in the House, over which the present  Speaker  presided, during the last session of last Parliament, and that he, on that occasion, as he did to-day, promised that he would take the question in hand, and remove the scandalous condition of affairs about which complaints were being made. I do not think that we should now accept a mere promise on the part of the  Speaker  that he will look into this matter, or the assurance that he is engaged in conference about it. If to-day he had told us that the conditions now prevailing would terminate to-day or to-morrow, I would be prepared to accept his assurance. But when he comes here, and tells us that he is negotiating about the matter and considering it, and says that it might well be left in his hands, it is very little less than an insult to the intelligence of honorable members. I venture to say that we should set an example rather than slavishly seek to find out what is a minimum wage that we may decently pay our attendants. I. hope that the amendment will be persisted in, and that those honorable members who are committed to a policy of economy will not find it inconsistent with their principles to see that men, adults and responsible for families, engaged as workers in this House receive at least a fair remuneration. Everywhere outside wages are advancing in some sort of relation to the increased cost of living. Here only do they appear to be standing at a minimum which does us no credit. It is said that the matter is under consideration, and that we ought to leave it with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He complains that political capital was made out of it at the last election. That is very likely. If I had had it brought specifically under my notice in the electorate of Lang, and it was proved to my satisfaction that men employed in the service of Parliament were being underpaid, I would have thought it a very legitimate kind of political warfare in which, to indulge, and a very right and proper matter to bring before the attention of the constituents of the honorable the  Speaker.  It would be a much more legitimate kind of warfare than that which was indulged in by some members of the Nationalist party during the recent election. However, I intend to support the amendment, sincerely hoping that it will receive such a measure of sympathy from all honorable members that here and now this disgraceful condition of affairs will be brought to an end. </para>

                    <para>. -  I sympathize with the proposal to make a little more liberal the salaries paid to officers of this House. My own impression is that they are not too well paid. A few years ago when I was Prime Minister I interested myself in the matter, and brought under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> at .that time the condition of the officers engaged in the service of this House, but I did not raise the question in the Chamber or attempt what honorable members are now proposing, to bring about a reduction of the Estimates for the purpose of securing an increase in them. Honorable members arc not proceeding in the right way. Last night they voted <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> with the gentlemen in the Chamber who were concerned with effecting economy, and their very first action after getting clear of that vote is to raise the question as to whether more money should not be spent by the House. After all, these matters are the joint concern of both Houses- </para>

I think we ought to treat our own officers fairly liberally, and I very earnestly suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that the matter should be reviewed. I heard today that the head messenger, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> who has upon his shoulders the sole responsibility for this building, and the control of its upkeep, is paid a bare daily wage. It does not seem quite the thing. However much we may discuss economy,  it is up to us to see that at least in this Parliament we do not sweat our own servants. I know there are difficulties surrounding the question- </para>

                    <para>.- I would like to give the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(.Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> some instruction upon the duties he will carry out as Acting Treasurer, and point out how he will be able to overcome the present difficulty. He has advised us to wait until, the next Estimates are before us, and if he will give the assurance that those Estimates . will provide sufficient for the payment of extra salaries to the officers of the House for the present moment, I am quite willing to let this matter go without a division. He can provide the necessary money out of his Treasurer's Advance. Among the Parliamentary attendants is a returned soldier, who is paid £2 17s. 6d. a week, out of which he has to maintain his wife and five children, and rent a house close to the scene of his work. He has also to pay 2s. insurance to the Government. This man cannot make one collar serve for a couple of days. He must be presentably attired, and must wear a clean collar nearly every day. He must always wear a white shirt. In 1913, the time referred to by the right honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> my wife, or the wife of any ordinary workman, could wash the whole of the household washing for Sd. a week, but to-day the material necessary  for the same amount of household washing costs: 3s. 6d. I could give further illustrations to show that this man is being penalized. To-day it costs him 6d. a. week to keep his boots clean, whereas in 1913 it cost him 3d. to do so. To-day his tram fares, going to and from his work, cost ls. 9d. per week as against ls. per week in 1913. It costs him 7s. today to have his boots half-soled and heeled, whereas in 1913 the cost did not exceed 3s. 6d. . Yet the  Speaker  makes a comparison between the wages paid today and those paid in 1913, when no complaint was raised. There is no comparison between the salaries paid in 1913 and those paid to-day. Perhaps the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> does not remember when he was working at Lithgow, and I endeavoured to have his wages raised by 2d. a ton on coal. In those days he was about as thick as a slate for the want of proper nourishment. If his memory would go back to those days be would accept my advice in regard to what to do at the present time. If I were Acting Treasurer, I would take the money from the Treasurer's Advance Account for the payment of the increases to the officers of this House, and I am sure that when the Estimates came forward no honorable member would object when the circumstances of how it came to be done were related to them. It is of no use to try to mislead honorable members like myself, because I have a knowledge at least equal to that of any other person in the House of the wants and necessities of the class from which I sprang. I would urge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to let us have no more of these vague statements, but to come boldly to the front and say either " I am in favour of an increase " or " I am not in favour of it." I am satisfied that these people are not being paid a living wage. Let honorable members think of the case of the individual who has to suffer. The next Estimates are not likely to be laid on the table of the House until August or September next at the earliest. What are these employees to do in the meantime? All of them are married men, and the cost of the necessities of themselves and their children is increasing as the cost of living rises, but they will have to stay at their present wage until the next Estimates are passed. Only the other day one of my married daughters told me that she had to pay 17s.11d. for a pair of boots for a son eleven years of age, and they were the cheapest she could get. Another daughter found that the only decent pair of boots that she could buy for a child not more than three years old cost her 8s.11d. Even then they were not of first-class workmanship. I presume that these servants of ours, like other married members of the community, have increases in their families. Each one of these makes a difference to the boot bill, and the longer justice is delayed to them in the way of salary the more possibilities there are of their little ones coming on and wanting boots. I speak strongly on this matter, because there is a principle underlying it. We, as legislators, have been told by commissions the minimum on which married men and their wives and children can live, as Australians. If we feel that wrongs of this kind are being done, let every individual member of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">House have the courage to bring the facts before the authorities, if he cannot have them redressed by any other means. I have spoken to members of the Ministry privately about this matter for eighteen months, and nothing seems to be done. I do. not want to secure limelight out of a question of this kind; but when the necessity arises I shall not hesitate to draw public attention to what is going on. I believe that when honorable members ventilate these matters in Parliament those in authority pay more attention to them, because they do not like the facts to be brought before the general public. I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would be consulting his own interests if he could expunge from the records all that he said to-day, because he certainly did not reach that high ideal of humanity that a representative man ought to aim at in any statement he makes about his fellow creatures. The illustrations which he gave from the past have nothing to do with the present needs of the Australian people. What was good when I was a boy is of no use now. I used to preach things when I was a young man of twenty standing on a tub in Hyde Park, London, that I would not say to-day. In those days myself and my fellow workmen used to sing- </para>

                <para class="block">The man who sings that to-day ought to be pushed into the river and never seen again. As members of Parliament we pass a law to compel private individuals to pay a minimum rate of wages, and yet we do not do it ourselves. When we bring that fact forward, those in authority say, " Oh, don't say that, because it does not sound very nice." That sort of appeal has no effect on me. I am glad this matter has come up, because the discussion should help to put a stop to what has been going on, so that those employed in this building may get what the people of Australia intended that the servants of Parliament should get. 'Does any honorable member believe that the public would tolerate for a moment a returned soldier with a wife and four children being paid only £2 17s. a week, and having to pay 2s. insurance out of it? If honorable members opposite think the people would not tolerate that state of things, let them impress upon the Treasurer that if  he does not do something to improve things they will vote against him at the next opportunity and push him out of his job. Unfortunately, honorable members on the other side cannot do that because the Prime Minister rules them and decides who shall be Ministers. If he sat on this side of the House, the first Caucus that met would want to know what the devil he was up to if there was anything wrong. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. The statement has been made that some are getting less, and I say that that statement is not true, so far as this House is concerned. Some honorable members may have other things in their minds, and, therefore, do not make the position clear; but they certainly have conveyed to the minds of honorable members the impression that some of the attendants of this Chamber are in the position to which they have referred. I again say that that is not so. To avoid mistakes, I shall give a list, without mentioning names, of the salaries paid. The smallest salary is paid to temporary cleaners, and, amounts to £158; when the bonus of £15 is added it brings the total salary to £173. That is the lowest. It is not £2 17s. a week, as honorable members have stated. It is considerably more than that - about £3 6s. 6d. Whether it is sufficient or otherwise is another question.  One hundred and fifty-eight pounds is the lowest male wage on this side of the building. </para>

                        <para>- It is the minimum at which the temporary cleaners are started. The next rate is £168, plus the bonus, which brings it up to £183, roughly £3 10s. per week. The next is £200, the next £216, and the next and highest <inline font-style="italic">£265,</inline> which is the salary paid to the housekeeper, in addition to which he gets free quarters, fuel, light, and water. Apart altogether, from the question of whether the payment is sufficient, I thought it well to put these figures before the Committee in order to refute the statement that attendants in this Chamber are receiving only £2 17s. 6d. per week. The whole question is now being, reviewed by the  President  and myself. We had it under consideration prior to the dissolution, but did not arrive at finality because it was felt that the matter was one that should be left for the determination of the Presiding Officers of the new Parliament. As soon as it is convenient for the  President  and myself to renew the conference which was broken by the elections, we shall meet again and further discuss this matter. </para>

                </continue><para>I should like to point out one very serious omission from the present discussion. I am surprised that during the consideration of the question of underpayment some reference has not been made to the position of honorable members themselves. While giving attention to the grievances of every one else, they appear to be the last to consider their own disabilities. I have no hesitation in saying that the allowance received by honorable members, having regard to existing conditions, is wholly inadequate to meet the extra burdens of existing conditions. Something should be done, and that very soon, to remedy the situation, so that honorable members, in common with the people generally, may obtain further remuneration to meet the increasing calls upon them. By comparison many of the officers of the , House are better paid. Some honorable members, at the end of the month, find themselves hard-pressed to make ends meet; yet they are the last to <inline font-style="italic">look</inline> after their own interests in this respect. I hope that if they are so diffident as to their own position, the Government themselves will consider the question, and realize that honorable members themselves have a real grievance. Even the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth with his enormous responsibilities gets paid a salary less than that of an efficient departmental manager of many a private concern. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - There  does  not seem to be now, nor has there been on any occasion, any wide difference of opinion amongst honorable members as to the inadequacy of the payments made to the parliamentary attendants. A point that has not yet been explained relates to the nature of the control of the staff of this House. It is practically the unanimous desire of the House that better treatment should be meted out to those in attendance upon honorable members'; yet no one has indicated who is the authority to give effect to that desire. We were asked a few days ago to appoint to the Joint House Committee members of this House, presumably, to represent us upon it. An honorable member who had served on that Committee stated, however, that the Committee had no control over the conduct of the House - that it was controlled by some one who was not a member of the House of Representatives, and over whom the Committee had no authority. We are entitled to know who really does control this House, and why it is that the wishes of honorable members in respect of these and other matters do not receive the attention to which they are entitled. If the government of the House is such that effect cannot be given to the will of honorable members in respect of these matters, an alteration ought to be made. There should be some one to whom we can attach the blame for any failure to give effect  .bo  the expressed wishes of the House on these and kindred subjects. I should like to know whether it is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has control of the staff of the House of Representatives, or whether the whole business relating to that control is under the direction of the Joint House Committee? If it is under the control of the Committee, we should see that those elected to it by this House do justice to the men  Whom  we employ. To me, it is a disgrace that we should be setting an example different from that which we expect private employers  to  follow. It is not the wish of the House, and we should see that the officers responsible for the control of the House are made to understand that we expect them to control it, and not to allow the authority to do so to drift into the hands of any person beyond our control. </para>

                    <para>.- I had intended earlier in the day to draw attention to the financial position of Australia, and to the indifference shown by the Government and their supporters to any attempt to solve the problems associated with it. As that would involve my speaking at length, I shall not do so to-day, but shall avail myself of another opportunity to deal with the whole question. I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a couple of grievances relating to the Old-age Pensions Act. The first has to do with the treatment of a German under the Old-age Pensions Act.  His  case has been considered by a union in Sydney, of which he is a member, and has also been brought under the notice of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Association. Both bodies have urged me to bring it before Parliament, since, under the Act as it stands, it would seem that the Department itself is powerless to grant the desired relief. The following letter, which was addressed to the Department, puts the position as briefly as possible: -  18 Raglan-street, Darlington, Sydney, 19th July, 1918. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> I apologize for thus taking up your valuable time in a matter that is of great importance to me. I have been' in receipt of the old-age pension from January, 1915, until June, 1918, when it was discontinued. The reason given to me at the Pensions Office in Sydney for the discontinuance was that, as I was naturalized after the outbreak of war, I could not receive it under regulation's. I therefore desire to place the following facts before you, and crave your reasonable consideration of the matter. I, Moritz  Carl George  Hirsch  arrived in Brisbane on the 5th day of November, 1809, by the sailing ship <inline font-style="italic">Humbold</inline> under Captain Meyer, my passage being paid by the Queensland Government. I was granted 40 acres of land. I remained in' Queensland for three years, and then came to New South Wales, in which State I have continuously resided for forty-six years. I was honestly under the belief that, as I was brought, out by the Queensland Government, I automatically became naturalized, and was not aware of the contrary until I made application for the pension in 1915. I swear that I have always been, and still am, a loyal subject of the British Empire. I have always taken a keen interest in the affairs of my adopted country. I am well known to Superintendent Kelly, of the Metropolitan police, from whom any further information required as to my character could be got. As I am now in my eightieth year, and have on several occasions been unsuccessfully treated for hernia, I am quite unable to earn my own living. I have no relations whatsoever in the Commonwealth, and sincerely trust you will take a favorable view of my case, as the pension is my only means of livelihood. </para>
                <para>P.S. -I received my naturalization certificate in January of 1915. </para>
                <para class="block">The union of which this man is a member allows him a certain sum per week, and I believe he also gets same assistance from the State. We cannot turn a man on to the streets to starve simply because he was born in a foreign country. This man has been forty-six years a resident of Australia, and, so far as I know, there is nothing against his character. </para>

                        <para>- I have another case of an old-age pensioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J.' Anderson, late of Avondale, Cooranbong, New South Wales.  His  case also requires consideration. He bought an annuity of £30, to become effective when he reached the age of seventy, but when he applied for the old-age pension, the Pensions authorities deducted the amount of his annuity from his pension rights. There might have been no objection to this course, but the authorities capitalized the annuity and deducted <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 18s. 2d., the amount by which his income exceeded £26. A further deduction was made in respect of the value of his accumulated property, so that his pension was payable at the rate of £2011s. l0d. per annum. I do not think that the Parliament intended that individuals should be penalized in this way. The departmental officers, I understand, acted on the advice of the Crown Law Department, and, no doubt, faulty draftsmanship of the measure is responsible for this anomaly. I trust there will be some redress-perhaps, by an amendment of the Act - so as to remove this disability from old-age pensioners, who, in their earlier years, may have purchased an annuity. Unless this is done, all those who purchased annuities will be penalized., Here is a chance for members of the Country party to effect economy. ' If they can persuade 100 people to buy annuities, expenditure on account of old-age pensions will be correspondingly reduced. I know there is a general desire to finalize the Supply Bill, but I felt it my duty to bring these cases before the Committee and I hope that something will be done. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has asked honorable members to conclude their remarks on the Address-in-Reply next Wednesday evening. I can remember, in the last Parliament, how the Prime Minister received the shock of his life when I did not debate the Address-in-Reply, and the motion was carried on the voices. Indeed, there, was no man in the Commonwealth more annoyed at what I did than was the Prime Minister. I am not sure, however, whether I shall follow that example on this occasion, because, on other questions, no opportunity has been presented to me of saying a few words that I desire to say. I agree with the Prime Minister that the War Gratuity Bill is of first-class importance, and I know that many people throughout the Commonwealth are anxious to see it. There are many who are to receive advantages under it, while there are others who think that they ought to receive advantages. Some persons were prevented by the military authorities from going away from the Commonwealth, and they think they ought to be put in precisely the same position as returned soldiers. I agree with what was said by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> the other day, to the effect that this is a Bill which, to use his own phrase, ought to be discussed in a "leisurely" way; there should be no attempt to rush it through until persons affected have an opportunity to thoroughly grasp its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and it is certainly no reason why it should be rushed through before those persons have an opportunity to state their cases to honorable members. I have in my mind representations which have been made to me by persons who were prevented from leaving Australia. I am not going to discuss the question now, but I think other honorable members may know of similar instances. When the second reading of the Bill has been moved, it is only right there should be an adjournment of the debate to afford honorable members an opportunity to study the details of the measure. </para>
