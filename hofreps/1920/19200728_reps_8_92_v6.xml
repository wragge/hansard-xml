You will remember that, during the discussion of a certain motion last week, there were some heated interchanges between the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> and myself, and I, coming into conflict with the Chair, was named, and my suspension&#39; was moved by &#39;the Minister.

                        <para>It is not considered that debits for (a) State and. Federal income taxes, and (b) war-time profits tax, are legitimate charges against cost of production in a private trading concern, and it is not proposed to inflate Government factory costs by the inclusion of any such charges. Under ordinary circumstances, charges on  account  of rates would be incorporated in the factories&#39; accounts, but, as the Commonwealth is exempt from such charges, no amount can he included under this heading  in  the accounts of any factory. The amount,  if  included, would not materially affect the cost  of  production. Payment for water and sanitary services are, however, paid  in  Government factories. As a matter  of  policy, the Commonwealth carries its own risk of loss through contingencies which,  in  private enterprises, are ordinarily covered by insurance. Should any such loss occur in the case of factories, the amount of the loss is borne by the factory concerned. As regards depreciation, interest  on  capital, and advances, all charges  on  these accounts are duly brought into factories&#39; accounts. All charges which arc definitely incurred on behalf of any factory, including cost of audit, are debited  to  the factory, but  it  is impracticable to assess, with any degree  of  accuracy, a charge on account  of  departmental  costs.  In any case, the amount would be so small that the effect  on  factories&#39; costs would be negligible. It may be added that the form of balance-sheet in use in the Defence Department was designed by the Advisory Accountant to the Royal Commission  on  Naval and Defence Administration in consultation with the Treasury, and is considered  to  fully reveal the actual position&#39; of the respective factories. </para>

The same prices for the tweed have been charged to members and non-members. An audit of the books of the tweed department shows that in no case has there been an overcharge. The league receives ls. 6d. per yard on its contract - of this, ls. is retained by the head office to finance the tweed department, and the balance by the sub-branch, less freight on the cloth. </para>

The minute-book of the league was examined from the 1st April to the 16th July last, and no record could be found of a resolution, such as alleged, having been passed. </para>

                <para class="block">But before the honorable member proceeds, I would like  to  make a few remarks so that  my  attitude may not be misunderstood. I need not repeat the ruling which I gave, and to which the honorable member takes objection. It  is  still my opinion that the  framers  of the standing order providing for the closure motion contemplated that the motion should be submitted  to  the House for decision immediately on being moved. Otherwise, at least two hours and ten minutes might  be  occupied  by  the mover and seconder  of  a motion before the closure motion could be submitted. However,  it is  only right  to  say that I  find  from the past records that the present <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker (Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> for whom I am acting in consequence of the very serious illness of his wife, has ruled that a closure motion cannot be put until the original question has first been stated from the Chair.

                <para>I have no wish to differ from a ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but with all due respect, I contend that the Chair never makes a proposition. It is the honorable member who makes the proposition. On the occasion; on which the closure was moved, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> moved a motion, and then proceeded to speak to it. The usual statement from the Chair is, &#34; That the question&#34; - whatever it may be - &#34;be considered by the House.&#34; Those who are of opinion that it should be passed are asked to vote &#34;Yes,&#34; and those who are of the contrary opinion are asked to vote &#34;No.&#34; I regret that I cannot withdraw the interpretation which I have given. With great respect, I have to differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and submit the matter to the decision of the House. </para>

                <para class="block">I regret the circumstances which have led to the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker (Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> from his place this afternoon. It is somewhat of an anomaly that if my motion is agreed to it will uphold the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and if it is defeated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling will be overruled by the House, and that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Hon. J. M. Chanter)</inline> upheld. I hope that honorable members will approach the matter entirely free from any preconceived ideas upon it, because it is of great importance that the rights of honorable members to discuss questions within the Standing Orders should be preserved. The ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is undoubtedly right, and I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> to compare the various standing orders bearing on the matter. Before the discussion is ended - it need not be long - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> will  alter  his opinion as to the time when a closure motion may be put. The standing order under which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> moved &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; is on page 71 of the Standing Orders, and reads as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">I invite attention to the first few words, &#34;After any question has been proposed.&#34; Those words define the time when an honorable member may move &#34; That the question be now put&#34;; that is to say, when any question has been proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy</inline> Speaker&#39;s ruling leads us to this peculiar position, that a motion, &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; may be taken when there is actually no question before the House to be put. The language of the standing order is quite clear. It says, &#34;After any question has been proposed.&#34; The matter to be decided by us now is, &#34;When, is a question proposed?&#34; and &#34;Who proposes a question?&#34; The Chair is the only person who. can propose a question. No honorable member can do so. I invite the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> to the difference between a &#34;motion &#34; and a &#34; question,&#34; and refer him to standing order 120, which provides - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The word &#34;proposed&#34; applies to the statement of the question to the House by the Chair, and not to the intention formed in the mind of an honorable member to move a particular motion. Comparison of the two standing orders shows that the question is proposed by the Chair, and in that regard the word &#34; stated &#34; is synonymous with &#34; proposed.&#34; But the actual proposal comes when the motion has been moved and seconded according to standing order No. 120. A glance at these two standing orders furnishes ample evidence and, I am sure, also proof to any unbiased person that the ruling given on this matter on a former occasion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is right.  I hope, therefore, that honorable members will hesitate, particularly in his .absence, to overrule a ruling which is obviously right. There are many ways of meeting the suggestion which you make that, if the motion may not be moved &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; then there is no means - if the House be so minded - of preventing an honorable member from proceeding with his remarks. There is ample machinery provided in the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister may move, &#34; That the honorable member be no longer heard,&#34; and, if a majority is of opinion that it has listened sufficiently long to the honorable member who . is speaking it can vote him down. But your ruling leads to the extraordinary position that an honorable member speaking, and intimating that he intends to move something, may have that matter put to the House, although there is not another honorable member who is prepared to second it. A motion can not be put to the House unless some honorable member has seconded it. I hold that there is a difference between a proposed motion and a proposed question. You, sir, would elevate the position of a proposed motion to the same position as if it were a question to be decided by .the House. If you confine yourself to the interpretation of the Standing Orders to which I have referred - and they are as plain as the English language can be - I submit that you will come to the conclusion that you committed an error in your ruling. But I refer you also to <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> (10th edition, pp. 265, 266) in order to point out what is meant by the word &#34; proposed.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> lays down that questions are proposed <inline font-style="italic">&#34;by</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> - </para>

                <para class="block">And until the House is in possession of the question it is absurd to suggest that any honorable member may move &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; Let me carry my argument a little further. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> (page 276) also lays down when an amendment may be moved.

                <para class="block">So there is a difference between proposing a question and the putting of the question. But, before any honorable member can invoke the closure, there  must be the question proposed by the Chair ; and the motion is then to bring it to a decision - which is the putting of the question. I would again refer you, sir, to <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> (page 213), where there is reference to the time of the closure - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A closure motion may therefore be sanctioned by .the Chair, either immediately upon, or within a few minutes after, the proposal to the House of the question to be closed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I ask honorable members to closely examine those words. Of course, I know, and no doubt you, sir, also know, as do honorable members generally, that the closure is moved very often in the middle of an honorable member&#39;s speech, and, perhaps, after he has indicated that he intends to move something. The closure in such cases is moved in order to prevent tha&#39;t honorable member from developing his intention into a question by having it put through the Chair. Some honorable member - generally a Minister - rises and moves &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; Of. course, the honorable member who was originally speaking is then prevented from having his intended motion developed into a question. But before that procedure can be adopted there must be some question before the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- No ; he indicated that he was going to move it. But, whether he did actually move it or not does not affect my argument, because it only becomes a question when it has been seconded and is proposed from the Chair. The matter is one of- great importance, and I hope honorable members will see the necessity for settling it irrespective of which side of the House they may be found, because we may sit on one side of this Chamber to-day and on the other side to-morrow. It is necessary that we should be able to uphold the rights of honorable members.. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> when he moved his motion, was out of order. Evidently he had become very anxious, for some reason or other, to prevent the honorable member for Dalley from proceeding with his very eloquent and forcefully impressive speech with respect to the War Precautions Act and industrial unrest. The Prime Minister used the first instrument at his hand when he rose and moved &#34;That the question be now put.&#34;&#39; I submit that the House should not hesitate to disagree with your ruling; but I hope, rather, sir, that you will reconsider your decision and render one which will be in conformity with the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker (Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> on this matter, which is obviously right. </para>

                    <para>.- In seconding the motion, I desire to draw the attention of honorable members to the seriousness of the matter with which we are now dealing. The ruling given, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> restricts the rights of honorable members to address the House. The merits or demerits of the motion that was closured need not concern us; but it is necessary that honorable members should support this dissent lest the ruling to which exception is taken be made the means of preventing honorable members from bringing business before the House. I hold strongly the opinion that no question can be before the House until it has been stated from the Chair. Often members have risen with the intention of making a motion, but, during the course of their preliminary remarks, ,some development takes place which obviates the need for proceeding further, and the motion is not made. It is only when a question has&#39; been stated from the Chair, and has thus become the property of the House, that it may be closured. Honorable members who voted for the closure on Friday did so in ignorance of the motion that they were closuring. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> makes it very clear that a question must be stated from the Chair before it is before the House; and if the House of Commons, or the House of Lords, insists upon that procedure, we cannot go far wrong in following their example. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is  not infallible ; like all human beings he is liable to error. The Prime Minister is often in such a state of mind that he is not in a position to appreciate the seriousness of the things he does. That was the case on Friday, when he moved the closure, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> no doubt elated because of the responsible position he was filling, lost for the time being his customary levelheadedness. Any encroachment on the rights and privileges of honorable members should be resisted. I do not . say that some curtailment of debate is not wise, but when the closure is applied, its application should be in accordance with the Standing Orders. I hope honorable members will rise above party prejudices, and by their vote upon this interpretation of the Standing Orders preserve the rights and privileges of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> delivered a hasty judgment which was fraught with great danger to this House. Therefore I hope honorable members will indorse the views enunciated by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline></para>

I was under the impression that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had definitely ruled upon any point, such as that now under consideration, his ruling became the settled procedure of the House until it was altered by a vote of the House, or until the Standing Orders had been amended. Do I gather that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has given a definite ruling, it remains for any Deputy-Speaker to give any fantastic ruling he may please in absolute contradiction of the procedure laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker?</inline> I am reminded by interjection that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent once gave a ruling to which he was careful to add, &#34; That is my ruling for to-night, anyhow.&#34; I thought, perhaps, you, sir, meant that those words should be added to your ruling on Friday. </para>

                        <para>- The ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Johnson was given on another question, and in accordance with his interpretation of the Standing Orders at that time. The House is now dealing with a motion to dissent from a ruling given by me, and I hold that it is . within the power of the House to review at any time any interpretation of its rules. That being the case, this discussion is in order. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has based his argument on the first paragraph of the standing order dealing with the closure, and he has urged particularly that the word &#34; proposed &#34; in relation to any question means proposed from the Chair. He has quoted other Standing Orders in support of his contention, and has said very properly that we must discuss this question without reference to the side of the House upon which we sit. I agree with that entirely. I have sat on other sides of the House, and I am trying to deal with this question on its merits. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has referred us to the Standing Orders themselves. I brush aside the question of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling is in accordance with the ruling of yourself, sir - I put that on one side, and for the very reason that the honorable member for West Sydney advanced, namely, that all men are liable to error. You, sir, on the face of things, are no more likely to be free from a liability to error than any other man; and, therefore, we come back to the question itself. We have to ask ourselves, as every Court does in construing an Act: What is the object of these Standing Orders - what did the Legislature intend in adopting them ? Clearly, the object of this and the following Standing Orders is to prevent honorable members speaking -at undue length, and to give the House control over its own business. It is provided that when any motion is moved any member may get up, although another honorable member is speaking, and move &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; &#34; That the honorable member be no further heard,&#34; and so on. There are two possible meanings to the word &#34; proposed,&#34; and the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has said that it means a proposal from the Chair only. Very well, let us see whether that meaning is compatible with the object of the Standing Orders, which, as I say, is to give the House control over individual members and prevent them arresting the progress of business. If the honorable member&#39;s contention were correct, it would follow that an honorable member might speak for an hour and five minutes, and not until he had finished, and his seconder, with a like right, had spoken for another hour and five minutes, and the motion had been put from the Chair, would it be possible for any honorable member to move &#34;That the question be now put.&#34; Further, when the question was put from the Chair, any honorable member might immediately move an amendment, on which he might speak for a like time, and when that amendment had been defeated, another member might move a similar one; and so the proceedings might go on <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum.</inline> It is quite clear that the whole object of these Standing Orders is to prevent waste of the time of the House. In- the present case it is said that there was no motion before the Chair, but the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)7</inline> it will be remembered, moved that the Orders of the Day should- be postponed until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 1, in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> On this, the then Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph&#39; Cook)</inline> said that he understood that the business of the day had been called on, and, therefore, the honorable member&#39;s motion was too late. But you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> then said that the particular Order of the Day appearing first on the paper had not been called on, and, therefore, the motion of the honorable member for Dalley was in order. Will the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> in the face of these clear facts, say there was no motion before the Chair ? It will be seen that the order that appeared first on the business-paper  had not  been called on, and that, therefore, the motion of the honorable member for Dalley was in order; and that honorable member proceeded to discuss it at length. It was not until it was very obvious that the intention of the honorable member was to waste time that I got up and moved &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I know I was; and I only desire to show what has been done here many times. .There was a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Sir William</inline> Irvine, that the Bill be read&#39; a third time. The question was not put from the Chair at all, but the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald)</inline> rose to speak. He had not got further than &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> &#34; when he was arrested by the then member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly),</inline> who proposed &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; Here we have three things one after the other - a motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine for the third reading of the Bill, an attempt by the honorable member for Kennedy to say something to the Chair, and a motion by the then honorable member for Wentworth &#34; That the question be now put &#34;&#39;; and the latter motion was forthwith put&#34; and carried. There were dozens and dozens of such cases at that time, as, apparently the usual way of carrying on the business. I take it as one of the most glowing tributes to my tolerance that I said very little at that particular time; indeed, I do not know what was the matter with me. I venture to say that there is nothing in the Standing Orders at all to Support the contention of the honorable member for West Sydney. There is, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> in the very nature and object of the Standing Orders the support to which you must look for your ruling. The object of these Standing Orders is to prevent waste of time. If the ruling the honorable member for West Sydney would have you give is upheld, all I can say is that these Standing Orders are absolutely useless, for two hours and ten minutes could be taken up on any motion before it could be moved &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; But as we have now each occupied about twenty minutes in discussing the matter, I move - </para>

                    <para>. - This is a Bill which is likely to lead to considerable expenditure at a time when every Treasurer in Australia is crying out about the shortage of money necessary for carrying on the ordinary works of development; and if we agree to this clause, which contains the various parts into which the measure is divided, we practically assent to the whole of the principles of the Bill. Under Part III., which sets out the powers and functions of the Director, quite a number of sub-Departments may be established which will naturally lead to increased expenditure from which, in my opinion, very little benefit will accrue to the people of Australia, and which will simply mean the duplication of expenditure already undertaken by the States. Nothing can be done by the Commonwealth that is not already being carried out by the various States. If it be necessary to engage the services of an eminent scientific expert to carry on research work on lines not at present attempted by the States, surely the States and the Commonwealth can combine to secure his services without the creation of a new and totally unnecessary Department for the purpose. It may be claimed that the will of the Minister will find expression in any action taken by the Director of the Institute. While there may be an odd Minister here and there who is prepared to withstand his officers, and determine how the Department of which he is the nominal head shall be conducted, for the most part the heads of the Departments practically control their Ministers. In any case there are so many other tasks which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will have to undertake besides the administration of this measure that he will be able to pay very little attention to what the Director of the Institute will be doing, and, therefore, will simply initial the recommendations brought to him by the Director. In this way expenditure will heap up. No doubt, at first, on the Director&#39;s appointment, the Minister will lay down very emphatically the necessity for having the Institute run on economical lines. He will say, &#34;We want efficiency and economy combined,&#34; and naturall&#39; the Director will assent to that proposition, but there will be a very different tale when he commences his operations, and very soon he will be saying to the Minister, &#34; My recommendations must be carried into effect if I am to be held responsible for the proper administration of the Institute.&#34; If honorable members peruse the powers and functions of the Director as set out in detail in Part III., they will readily come to the conclusion that this </para>

                <para class="block">Institute will not only be a big Department in itself, but may comprise quite a number of sub-Departments which can only be carried on by considerable expenditure. We are asked to incur this expenditure at a time when we have many heavy financial responsibilities facing us. &#39;Honorable members ought to hesitate before they give the Government the power to establish new Departments. There is a sort of an apology in the Bill to the effect that in order to avoid overlapping with the States, everything to be done by this Institute must be carried out in cooperation with the State Institutes ; but I have yet to learn of any man appointed to a new position who has not immediately set out to magnify it, and make it more and more expensive. I shall not have it said of me that I sought to prevent any man from coming to the Commonwealth who might, through being possessed of ability not possessed by any person here, be able to enlighten us on various matters and carry out work that would eventually prove beneficial to the people of Australia; but I hold that the Commonwealth&#39;s part in bringing out such an expert ought to be confined to providing his salary. He could easily carry on his work in connexion with universities, technical schools, and schools of mines in the various States. All the machinery and appliances necessary are available to enable him to commence his work. There is no need for the Commonwealth to establish a new Department for the purpose. I am not preaching economy for economy&#39;s sake. The cry of economy is a horse one can ride to death. To economy on some lines I am totally opposed. Here, however, we have the opportunity of preventing the establishment of an expensive Department ; but, unfortunately, a majority of honorable members seem prepared to indorse this expenditure without regard to the limit to which it may go. I am not opposing the Bill for opposition&#39;s sake. In various forms this measure has been before us on several occasions, and I have always opposed it on the ground that it would lead to the duplication, and even triplication, of expenditure already undertaken by the States. Can we justify establishing a seventh Department to supplement six State. Departments already doing the work it would undertake? To attempt to do so in the face of the liabilities confronting us is next door to criminal. It will be useless when the Estimates come down from year to year for any honorable member then to say, &#34; I did not think this Institute was going to cost this sum of money,&#34; and move for the reduction of the item as a protest against such expenditure. At the initial stage we ought to be able to nip it in the bud. Those honorable members who vote for the Bill must accept the responsibility of setting up a new Department, which, according to Part III., may possibly embrace at least seven sub-departments. I hope we shall be able to take a broad national view of the matter ; and, in dealing with each clause, I trust honorable members will see just how far the States have gone in doing the work which the Commonwealth is now seeking to embark upon. We should allow the States to proceed on the lines they have already followed, while promising them every assistance; and, if that is done, I am sure it will lead to the gratification of the people as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.-  I regret the remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> though of course, in the initiation of a large and important institution there may be many matters worthy of criticism. It is true that the various States are conducting experiments on lines similar to those which will be undertaken by a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry,&#39; but we ought to remember the many schools of surgery and medicine which are operating in England. It is the rival investigations of the universities of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales which serve to stimulate those bodies to higher and greater efforts. Science must rule in this present day. The old time of bows, arrows, and spears has gone by the board, if I may use a war-time allusion. The machine gun would mow them down in thousands. In the old days grappling irons were used in the course of naval encounters. Only in comparatively recent years have boarding pikes been abolished in the British Navy. To-day it is not so much the rank and file of the men on our ships as the one controlling brain which counts. And so it is in the matter of scientific application to agriculture. Only the other day the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> informed me that he would cable to England to ascertain particulars following on an intimation in the press that a new variety of wheat had been discovered which would give more than ninety bushels to the acre. We know how lucky a. farmer feels to-day if he can average twenty-five bushels for three years. Would we not be a wealthy community if our farmers could secure a return of ninety bushels to the acre ? The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay),</inline> and the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> delivered speeches on this subject which are well worthy of perusal if honorable members failed to hear them. Those honorable members spoke of the benefits accruing from experiments in the growth of wheat. Scientists to-day are hopeful of producing a variety which will contain elements such as to eliminate the need for eating meat. The time may come when we shall all be grain eaters, and will have forsaken the eating of flesh foods. How much would thickly populated Europe give to-day if it could only obtain additional territory equal to that in Australia which has been rendered useless by the prickly pear ? Do what we will, that pest is extending, and only science can arrest its progress. </para>

                <para>In inaugurating this important new organization we must closely watch expenditure. It is my intention to move, in respect of the salary to be paid the Director of the Institute, that it shall be not more than &#163;1,000 per annum. I want to see established in Australia the principle that the salary paid to a member&#39; of Parliament shall be the highest paid to any head of a Department. </para>
                <para>I intend to vote for this Bill. I hope and expect great results from it. The central body should be the Commonwealth Institute, linking up with State activities and utilizing them for particular experimental and investigation purposes within their own States. A central body established in Melbourne cannot as satisfactorily carry out investigations, for example, in the north of Queensland as could a body established in that State. But the Commonwealth Bureau should be the dominant authority, linking up each and all of the States. Moreover, the Government should have the power to put before the central body specific questions of policy. A sum of &#163;5,000 has been spent upon rain stimulating experiments, which most people laugh at. Before such an outlay was agreed upon the actual question itself should have been placed before some such scientific and expert authority as the Institute will become. This should have been done before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Balsillie  was permitted to fool away &#163;5,000. Our manufacturers are suffering to-day from certain striking disabilities. They may not own the machines with which they are working, but are only permitted to rent them. The central authority should be asked some such questions as these : - &#34;Are these patented machines necessary &#39; to carry on Australian industrial life? If so, what do you suggest to protect the manufacturer and the public from these trusts and combines which hold the patent rights and are thus prolific of trouble and expense to Australian industry ?&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - If any honorable member doubted which way he should vote upon this measure he should have been persuaded to vote in its favour as the outcome of the speech of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> The honorable member furnished some of the most cogent reasons why the Bill, as introduced, should be passed.  His  great point was that the measure would bring  about still further overlapping; he enumerated several instances where that occurs throughout the States to-day. He pointed to the fact that experts in several of the States are engaged in branches of research and are actually performing a similar class of work. That indicates a waste of energy and a serious amount of overlapping. The very object of the Bill is to prevent that. The Director is told by the Bill that he must co-operate with existing organizations throughout Australia, with a view to preventing unnecessary overlapping. There must be complete control in. the matter of co-operation and co-ordination. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been so, but the point is not really cogent to my argument. The very essence of this measure is co-operation with respect to scientific research. The best results can be achieved only by co-operation. The Federal Institute, so far as possible, should undertake general supervision and be in a .position to direct and assist the several States along the lines in which their  energies  should be bent. If there is a supervising and co-ordinating authority, such as this measure proposes, there will be effective results. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> referred to one point on which we disagree. It would be ringing the death knell of a scientific institution, such as is here proposed, if salaries were to be limited in the manner suggested by the honorable member. Such limitation would at once preclude all hope of our securing the best men. </para>

                    <para>. - I realize my responsibility in regard to this Bill, and&#39; I take this opportunity of saying that I shall oppose this and- every other clause in it, not because I do not appreciate the value of scientific research, or that I do not know that if we have not an Institute of this kind we shall be out of step with other countries, but for two definite reasons. The first is that the House has been given mo estimate of the cost of the proposed Department. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is supposed to have promised an amount of &#163;500,000 for the fitting out of the Institute. The Minister in charge of the measure <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> stated last week that certain requests for money had been, made, but had been refused by the Government because the creation of the Institute had not been sanctioned by Parliament. I am glad that the Minister took that stand, but it is clear that once Parliament has given its sanction to this scheme, many and large requests for money will be made. My second ground for objection is the danger of overlapping. If any assurance had been given to us that there would be no overlapping, the fears of many of us would he removed. But we find to-day that there is overlapping of State and Federal activities in regard to the collection of taxation, and I am certain that if a Federal Institute of Science and Industry is established, not one of the States will surrender its Scientific Department- willingly -and with the consent of those who are employed in it. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> said that the statement made by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> that the different States were already doing this work, was a good argument for the establishment of a Federal Institute. I would agree with the honorable member  for Kooyong if there were any guarantee that tha whole of the work would be concentrated in the Commonwealth establishment. But the very wording of clause 10, which provides that the Director shall co-operate with the existing State organizations &#34; as far as possible,&#34; is an admission of doubt that co-ordination will take place. I am well aware that the Commonwealth cannot make a mandatory provision that the States shall co-operate, tut my little experience of Federal Department convinces me that the establishment of this Institute will lead to a tremendous increase in expenditure, and I desire to save myself from the risk of future reproach by opposing the measure on the grounds that we have no estimate of the cost and no assurance, other than a pious resolution, that there will be no overlapping. </para>

                    <para>.- I stated on the motion for the second reading that the success of this Institute would depend largely, if nob entirely, upon the type of man appointed as Director - whether he was a practical or theoretical man - and I advocated the extension of the existing laboratory rather than the setting up of an entirely new Institute. In the Government Service are two sorts of Departments - the collecting Departments, such as taxation and Customs, which are always very careful as to how money is spent, and other Departments, like Defence, Home and Territories, and the Navy,  which  justify their existence by the amount of money they expend.&#39; This Institute will come within the latter category. I quoted last week the letter of resignation of the  chairman  of the existing Bureau, Professor Orme Masson; I have not yet heard whether his resignation has been accepted or withdrawn. There is a very great obstacle to separating the Institute from .political control, as Professor Masson advocates. There must be parliamentary control of this or any other Institute, so that there may be a check on its expenditure. Furthermore, there must be co-ordination with the activities of the States. It is within the recollection of honorable members that a conference of </para>

                <para class="block">State Ministers of Health and their officers with the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> was held in Melbourne in order to evolve a definite plan of action in connexion with the influenza epidemic; but as soon as the State Ministers returned to their own States they repudiated the agreement with the Commonwealth. We may pass pious resolutions and express in the Bill fervent hopes for co-ordination, but we shall never achieve it unless we are in the controlling position. Even then there must be a doubt as to whether the States would hand over to the Commonwealth the work they are now doing. The honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> in, the course of an excellent speech on the second reading, pointed out the desirability of the proposed Institute dealing with the problem of venereal disease. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> mentioned the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Wilkinson, a man who has done excellent work for the Commonwealth during the last ten or twelve years, and who, if given the opportunity, could make a success of the Institute. At . the back of the Customs House in Melbourne the Commonwealth has the most up-to-date laboratory in Australia, and it is available at the present time for doing Commonwealth work. Honorable members who have not visited the establishment should do so. If any manufacturers&#39; desire that technical work should be carried out for them at the laboratory, they should pay for it. If the technical knowledge of our skilled officers, trained in our own. Service, is placed at the disposal of manufacturers and others for their private profit, it should be paid for ; and the fact that such knowledge is available should be made known throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, a gentleman came into my office one day with what appeared to be a 2-lb. jam tin, and asked that its contents might be analyzed. I pointed out to him that there were numbers of private analysts, but he said that there was only one man able to analyze this particular product, and that that man was in the service of the Commonwealth. He informed me that the tin contained ambergris, which had been collected on one of the Tasmanian islands, and that if it were as valuable as he thought it to be, it was worth about &#163;11,000. I push the claims of no one person, but I do desire the claims of all to be considered, particularly those of our own servants. There are Commonwealth laboratories in every State, and these could be enlarged and their usefulness extended. I am very much afraid that if we create a completely new organization we shall have a Department that can only justify its existence by the amount of money it expends ; and this would be a most undesirable result. </para>

                    <para>.- I offer no opposition to this measure; but, perhaps, I take a view of it different from that of the majority of honorable members. This Bill is introduced under peculiar circumstances, as an effort to honour a sort of promissory note which was given by the Prime Minister, amongst a lot of other similar documents, at the general election. I take it that the Bill will result in the establishment of a National Institute of Science and Industry, which may lead to a co-operation of the States and the abolition of the State institutions as we know them at present. There is no doubt that a central laboratory is required to investigate and value our copper, iron, and other natural products with which Australia is bountifully supplied, but which are as yet little developed. I feel sure that the States, in view of their financial position, will have to curtail some of their activities, thus making way for central Commonwealth action. I regard an Institute of this kind as a national affair, and the creation of it ought to have the support of every honorable member. , There have been objections raised on both sides on the score of the cost; but I submit that money spent in this way is very wisely spent, whether in the interests of the man on the land, on the mine-field, or in the manufactory; any efforts that result in ascertaining the true value of our natural wealth must prove of benefit to the country. The States hitherto have not assisted the Commonwealth in centralizing many activities; but the blame for&#39; this lies less with the State Governments than with the Commonwealth Government. For some years we have not had a Commonwealth Government with the&#39; courage to stand up against the States for the benefit of the people; indeed, the Commonwealth Governments have been like puppets in the hands of the States. From 1910 to 1913 the Labour Government of the Commonwealth had to face the opposition of the States to the &#39;founding of the Commonwealth Bank, the creation of the note issue, and other proposals. There has been no Commonwealth Government for some years capable of bringing pressure to bear on the States so as to lead to the creation of a National Institute of Science and Industry, and it is very much to be regretted that we should have proved so weak in this connexion. Day after day we have Bills of a similar character to this, all showing the lack of co-ordination and co-operation as between the States and the Commonwealth, and that lack must continue until the Government asserts itself; when it does do this I feel sure the people will approve. I offer no opposition to this Bill, which, in my opinion, will render it impossible for the States to decline to part with any of their existing powers on the ground, that the Commonwealth has made .no provision for exercising them in a national way. I  am not. troubling myself about the merits or demerits of this .particular measure, because I am only too pleased to see one of  such a character before us, with an object so necessary and desirable. </para>

                <para class="block">The object of the amendment is to insure that the Institute, when founded, shall obtain the hearty sympathy and cooperation of the best scientific minds and of the leaders of industry in its various forms throughout Australia, and to insure also that the State Governments shall co-operate with the Commonwealth Government to insure its success. Without this co-operation and enchaining of sympathy, the Institute, if it does not become an absolute failure, will, 1 fear, fall very short of the desires of Parliament and of the requirements of the people. The issue raised by the amendment is fundamental. Should the clause be carried as it stands, and the amendment circulated by the Minister for the insertion of clause 4a be inserted, the Director, subject, of course, to the Minister, would be the sole repository of power and authority, and he would-be chosen, not by representatives of the best scientific and industrial minds of Australia, but by the Commonwealth Government. I cast no reflection on the judgment of this Government or of the Minister, or on their capacity for choosing a Director, nor have I anything to say in disparagement of the qualifications of any. gentleman who may be in the minds of Ministers or of honorable members as suitable for the position. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister will permit me to unfold my views on the subject, he will, I think, recognise that that is not so. I have used the words &#34; local councils &#34; instead of &#34; State councils &#34; to indicate that the councils will not be representative merely of the State Governments. What the Committee has to consider is whether it will adopt a course which will enlist the sympathy and support of the best scientific and industrial minds of each State, and so of the whole of Australia, or one which will, to some extent, discourage that sympathy and support. If a dictator be appointed under the name of director, who at his own sweet will and caprice may make appointments to the Advisory Council, or refrain from doing so, that is likely to discourage sympathy and support. During the war I had considerable experience of the workings of bodies constituted in various fashions, and I say unhesitatingly that a government ap- &#34; pointed dictator who could ignore or recognise the scientific opinion of Australia just as he thought fit would, to some extent, diminish the usefulness of the Institute. My proposal is to establish local councils representative of the best scientific opinion. The election or nomination of the Director should be made by delegates from the six local councils. </para>

                        <para>- No ; quite the opposite. My scheme makes full provision for the various State Departments to be represented on the local councils, and each local council will choose its best men to be its delegates to the Central Council. If the Minister wishes to obtain the warm-hearted and cordial support of the best minds in Australia from the very beginning, he will not do it by depriving them of all sense of responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member thinks it important, I shall answer his question. In all probability, the members of the local councils will be connected with some university, or a Government Department, or with some Chamber of Mines, Chamber of Pastoralists, or Chamber of Manufactures, and will probably be already in receipt of a considerable income. It will not be necessary, therefore, to pay them high salaries in connexion with their duties on these local councils. Possibly they could be remunerated as the members of the Advisory Council have been, with a fee for each sitting, and something to recoup them for out-of-pocket expenses. However, if men of such distinguished ability are given some measure of power and responsibility, I am sure they will be quite agreeable to do the work without pay. In any case, they will be quite satisfied with a guinea or two guineas for each sitting. </para>

My amendment to this clause&#39; merely deals with the suggestion. I have other consequential amendments. We have not to interest these gentlemen in science; they will do all they possibly can to increase the cause of science and industry in Australia, but if we are desirous of getting the best out of them, we must handle them diplomatically. A man will not get the best out of his agent or representative by ignoring him every day. </para>

                        <para>- It may be novel. I am not prepared to follow slavishly word for word any proposal previously made: There are people in Australia who are quite as capable of constructing schemes that will work as there are in any other part of the world. I claim that my proposal is a better conception than that which was set forth in previous Bills; at any rate, it would be more workable, and more likely to achieve the result desired by the Minister and honorable members generally. The experience of the working of the Institute during the last few years has proved conclusively that the best scientific and industrial men of Australia have not been satisfied to remain mere dummies under a political Department. In fact, they have made their protests in the most effective way, almost all of them, by resigning. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. If the Director is to be given power to do and authorize certain things, as set forth in the Bill, may he not sign contracts? And if, under the Bill, he is to have such power, then, with my amendment embodied, he would still retain that power. If you desire that the Institute shall be a success, there must be some form of representation of the State Departments which to-day are carrying on somewhat similar investigations and experiments as the Institute will undertake; and, as far  as  possible, there should be on the Institute effective representation of each State. There is no effective representation proposed in the Bill. If a Director is to be appointed without the Government asking the advice or counsel of any one else, either individually or as a body, then .po&#39;wer will be given to that Director to create his own advisory council. The members of these various State councils, when appointed, will be asked to render enthusiastic service and assistance; but they are to be given no share in the responsibility for the Institute, or in the initial important task of appointing its Director. They will find themselves at the sweet will of a dictator appointed by the Government. That is not the way to insure the interest and co-operation of Australian scientists. Local councils should be appointed, fmd these should have some say in the selection of. a Director, seeing that that person will be their guide and chief. There is in every State of Australia to-day a university, each, I understand, well equipped and possessing men of scientific knowledge and attainments. </para>

                    <para>. - I interjected, when the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> was speaking, that his amendment was utterly impracticable. I propose to indicate why it is so. The honorable member has stated that the intention behind his amendment !is that the Institute should consist, not only of a Director, but of certain local advisory councils from each State. The number of members to be appointed to each of these councils was not mentioned. They are, apparently, to be an indefinite number totalling, perhaps, from five to twenty persons in each locality. The Director, together with this indefinite number of members of State councils, is to form the Institute. This body, having been constituted, will find itself in such a position that the simplest contract cannot be entered into, nor the smallest job undertaken, unless and until the whole of the members of the Institute have been called together. It would prove too unwieldy for proper executive work. The fact is that the Institute will be unable to act until its members have been called together to consider the points, great or small, which are at issue. Let us suppose that there are ten members of each council. The&#39; Institute, then, will comprise between sixty and seventy persons. All of these will have to be notified and their expenses paid to Melbourne, or to wherever they are to meet. In addition to the item of travelling expenses, the members of the Institute, I presume, will be entitled to fees amounting to &#163;2 2s. or &#163;3 3s. a day. </para>

I call his attention to the phrase in the Bill, &#34; which shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal, and capable of suing and being sued.&#34; </para>

My objections are not frivolous, but arc of absolute substance, and particularly so from a legal standpoint. All that the honorable member seeks to obtain could be secured by the proposal of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene).</inline> It is very desirable that there should be local councils, so that the Institute shall work in conjunction with them. The original Bill contained a proposal for the establishment of councils to consist of three members each; but these members were not to form the membership of the Bureau or Institute. </para>

                        <para>- So have I,. in their own sphere. At the same time, if we are to get solid, practical work from the Institute, it must be constituted of practical industrial scientists, men with u knowledge of industry. The University professors have taken offence at the terms of this Bill, because it is not the class of measure that they contemplated. But I congratulate the Government on their determination that the Institute shall be constituted of practical men. </para>

                        <para>- The local councils proposed by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> would give control to the University professors. They dominate the existing Advisory Council, and the work performed by that body has not been completely satisfactory so far as practical results are concerned. No industries seem to have benefited largely by any advice offered by the council; work has been of a theoretical rather than of a practical character. I have not a word to say against the professors in their own line of .pure scientific research, but I say that their University qualifications do not necessarily make them capable of undertaking the work we hope to achieve under this Bill. Nothing I say must be regarded as any reflection upon them and their distinguished services at their several Universities. But an Institute such as is proposed must have help from every source, and its best energies must be applied in an industrial direction. Therefore the amendment, which aims at making the Institute more representative, is not only impracticable, but would be very expensive. The same results can be more effectively achieved by the constitution of local councils of an advisory character as have been suggested by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- What I and the honorable member desire is to secure the  cooperation  of scientific men, both theoretical and practical, in carrying out the work which the Institute will have to perform. The whole question is how best to secure that co-operation without overloading the Institute with expenditure, and how to direct its energies into the channels in which they are most required&#39;. The experience of the Advisory Council to date has been this : Perhaps an engineering question was before the Council; it was a small body, and there was no engineering scientist on it. Or, the question may have been one of agricultural science, and there wa3 no member of the Council particularly qualified to deal  with  it. The Council found that in1 dealing with specific problems it was necessary to call in: those special scientists whose particular province it was to study that matter. The men who have been doing the real investigatory work of the Institute in many instances have not been the members of the Council. I do not care how representative the Council is made, -science is so highly specialized that it is impossible to place on the Council all the men who may be required to deal  with  the scientific problems that will arise. I have given notice of an addition to clause 4 which will be moved as a new clause, and which will incorporate  in  the measure what was the definite intention of the Government as to the way in which the Institute should operate. The Institute will comprise a Bureau of Agriculture, a Bureau of Industry, and such other bureaux as the Governor-General determines from time to time. One of those other bureaux might be one to deal with forestry. Of course, it will be necessary to appoint a definite head to the Bureau of Agriculture and, similarly, to the Bureau of Industry. Then we shall  provide  that tha Governor-General may appoint Advisory Boards to advise the Director in regard to the general business of the Institute. That, I take it, will mean a gathering of scientists drawn from many branches of science, and convened&#39; from time to time to consult with the Director as to the general scope of the work to be undertaken. Also, power is to be taken for the appointment of a Council in) regard to any Bureau thereof. </para>

                <para class="block">In connexion with- the Bureau of Agriculture, for instance, the Director carrying out the functions of the Institute, in cooperation with the States, would naturally call together om the Board, first and foremost, the scientists associated with the State Agricultural Departments. It does not necessarily mean that the Advisory Board will be confined to such heads of State Departments. There might be other eligible men occupying chairs of agriculture at the universities, or experts in veterinary science, who might be called im to form the nucleus of an Advisory Council. In that way we shall secure all the men required to constitute a scientific body capable of dealing with particular questions. What is the use of having an advisory council composed of engineers to deal with the question of agriculture? The scheme of the Government is to secure, by the appointment of advisory councils, the assistance and co operation of the scientific men of Australia for dealing with the specific problems that the Institute will have to consider from time to time. I believe that that will not only secure the effective working of the Institute itself, but will prevent the tendency, which has been noticed up to the present, of distributing the energies of the Institute over a great number of subjects, some of which are, perhaps, more urgent than others. </para>

                        <para>- What we are proposing will do exactly what the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> desires. It will be the means of securing the co-operation of our scientific men, and it will do so in a way which will enable them to concentrate on the particular scientific problems with which they are intimate. It will not call together a body of scientists who may not be conversant with the branches with which their fellow-members are familiar; but it will bring together, in cooperation with the Government on each specific problem as it arises, the best men it is possible to obtain. I have discussed the Government&#39;s proposals with those interested, and I do not think we will have the slightest difficulty in securing, with the exception possibly of two or three men, the whole-hearted co-operation of the scientists of the Commonwealth. I hope the honorable member for Grampians will not press his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The amendment is doing the very thing that I object to, as it provides that the Institute shall comprise, for instance, a Bureau of Agriculture. Where is that to&#39; come from ? Is it to be in Victoria, where there is already a Bureau of Agriculture? If we say we shall establish forthwith a Bureau of Agriculture, it means that we shall have in Victoria a second bureau, and that is a serious objection. We have to realize that, not only in this State, but in other States of the Commonwealth, bureaux of agriculture are already established, and are doing splendid work. Instead of having others we should use these institutions in conjunction with the activities of the Federal Government, which would be able to deal with more important questions that are not of State interest, but rather of Federal concern. </para>

It is for us to find some means of co-operation to prevent additional and unnecessary expense. When I was a Minister in South Australia it was the practice to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government under an arrangement whereby the State bureau was utilized. A member of the advisory council visited Melbourne from time to time to consult with the representatives of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but the Commonwealth should link up to the States without giving them statutory powers or creating new Departments. We should no-operate in such a manner that they will feel that they are part and parcel of the proposal. We all recognise the necessity for such an Institute: but we must also realize that it is undesirable,, in view of our financial obligations, to establish costly Departments that will be antagonistic to those already in existence. This Government may be quite prepared to co-operate with the States ; but we have to remember that we are not legislating for this year or next year, and that it is quite possible that a few years hence a Government may be in power that will be in favour of establishing their own Departments in all the States. At the present time, I believe, there are some honorable members who think that the Commonwealth should ignore the States altogether, and in dealing with legislation of this character we have to remember that its administration may be in the hands of men whose opinions may be totally opposed to ours.  The new clause of which the Minister has given notice sets out the functions of the new Department, and the moment a Director realizes that he has the power to appoint he will do so. </para>

I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians, although I think it goes too far. I ask the Minister to postpone the consideration of this clause, as he will then have an opportunity of carefully considering the amendment. This is not a party question, but one on which every honorable member is anxious to do the right thing. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposal before the  Committee  seems to be the antithesis of the proposal actually in the Bill. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> suggests that it is not very difficult to amend the clause, and that possibly the Minister for Trade and Customs may be prepared to do so. To me it seems absolutely impossible when one considers the nature of the amendment and the principle underlying it. The Bill provides for the appointment of a central body, which happens to be one individual, to control, direct, and organize scientific effort. The proposal of the honorable member for Grampians is that we shall not have a central body, but that the members of the controlling body shall be scattered over the whole Commonwealth. That is absolutely out of the question- </para>

                        <para>- I think it is absolutely clear ; but,  apparently  my reading of the position is not the reading of the proposer of the amendment. I understand there are to be six advisory committers or councils, which, together with the Director, are to constitute a body corporate. These States are scattered far apart, and, no doubt, the individual members of the proposed body will live at long distances from one another. How such a body will be able to act with any celerity, or any definite purpose, is quite beyond me to understand. It seems to me an entirely wrong principle that is embodied in the amendment; and for that reason I shall most certainly vote against it. I suggest that the matter cannot be dealt with in the manner suggested by the amendment, which involves a re-casting of the principle of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I think that out of his own mouth the honorable member has shown that his mind has not the subtle agility of the mind of another honorable member who has just interjected. The points that have been raised in the discussion certainly require a great deal of consideration; but, personally, I cannot see that we can possibly come into line under this amendment. It is essential and imperative, as pointed out, that we should have the co-operation of the best scientific minds in Australia, and also the co-operation of the States&#39; various Departments. It is also a question for the consideration of the House whether one man should, form this body corporate, or whether there should be more. In the original Bill the number was three; and the number is a matter for direct amendment. It seems to me, however, that whatever is done, we must have a central body of a limited number, and provide that the man or men selected shall command the respect of the community, particularly of the scientific section and the leaders of industry. If this body acts with reasonable tact we shall get far better results from an advisory council than: we could get by creating a great unwieldy body which certainly, in my opinion, would not give that scientific investigation which is hoped for under this amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I consider the amendment a most important one, but I was not able to give fully the reasons in support of its adoption. There has been, in the course of the discussion, such gross misrepresentation of my intention that it is only right. I should make some reply. In deference to my honorable friend, the honorable member forFremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell),</inline> I shall withdraw the word &#39; &#39; misrepresentation &#34; and substitute the word &#34;misunderstanding.&#34; There is one point I wish to clear up. I was subject to most violent interjections, and told that my proposal is utterly impracticable. </para>

When I resented the implication that <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> scheme is impracticable, I was told that it is not my scheme which is impracticable, but that the amendment as I proposed it would prove so. I then pointed out that I was not a drafter of Bills, and I bowed to the wisdom and experience of the honorable member for Kooyong . <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and others, with whom in such a matter I would not dream of comparing myself. The honorable member for Kooyong, both by way of interjection and afterwards in his address, poured oceans of contempt on this idea of mine - this &#34; novel &#34; idea, as he described it - that an Institute could be formed and worked in such a fashion as I propose. That honorable member described the idea as absolutely impossible, and that opinion has been repeated over and over again by both himself and the Minister. I was not then aware whether or not my idea was &#34;novel,&#34; but I accepted the statement, and admitted that, under the circumstances, it might be exposed to such criticism. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. But it must not be forgotten that when the measure was before the Senate it contained provision for the establishment of an advisory council in each State. Though the creation of the Institute of Science and Industry has never been definitely authorized, there has been established in each State at least one advisory council and the honorable member for Grampians, I understand, wishes to restore that provision in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>-  The position roughly, is that the work upon which these scientific men will be required to co-operate, boils down to specific subjects, and we believe that it is better to make provision in the Bill which will enable us to call upon them to co-operate in respect of particular problems than to establish a general council. But provision is made for the establishment of a general council in regard to the central area. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the view taken by the Government is the correct one, because only specialists and highly-trained men will undertake independent investigations, and these men may be hampered rather than helped by the creation of State advisory councils. In my judgment, the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> is not calculated to assist the Institute, and I regret, therefore, that  I  shall be obliged to vote against it. </para>

I understand, however, that because he was two or three minutes late we are to be prevented from hearing what I anticipate would have been a very effective reply to some of the criticisms which have been levelled against his amendment. I think that the Committee is willing to hear the honorable member, and I suggest that he be given permission to continue his remarks. </para>

            <para class="block">There is no reference to the powers and duties of the Committee of the House, but I submit that the Committee is for the time being the guardian of the privileges of the House, and that a matter of privilege suddenly arising, as it has in this case, must be decided as the standing order provides in precedence of every other matter. A little while ago I rose to put this point, but before I was able to put it the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> with characteristic discourtesy, plunged in and interrupted me. I ask the Temporary <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman (Mr. Watkins)</inline> to take counsel with those who may be presumed to know something about the matter, and without any disrespect I suggest that the point I raise is unanswerably in favour of my being able to bring forward any question of privilege, and submit it for the immediate decision of the Committee; because the matter to which I refer is very urgent, and because I think the Committee would be careful to be the guardian of its own rights and privileges. With the military and the secret service of the police surrounding us, I should say that the matter is an urgent one, if ever there was such a thing, requiring immediate decision. </para>

                    <para>:- The amendment is a wise provision to retain parliamentary control. Instead of a true Democracy we have been subjected, during recent years, to a system of bureaucratic control in regard to expenditure of public, money, and the provision now sought to be inserted in the clause will give the people an opportunity, through their representatives in this Parliament, of expressing an opinion concerning the directorship and staffing of this particular  institution. I agree that scientific methods are essential for the proper development of this great country, but it is very desirable, in my opinion, to include the safeguard suggested by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).</inline> The amendment will relieve the Government of a responsibility which should properly be shouldered by the representatives of the people. </para>

                        <para>- The ordinary procedure of allowing the Executive to make the appointment and fix a salary should apply in this case. This is the invariable practice, with the exception of a few cases in which the salary is definitely laid down in a Bill, such as for the appointment of Judges. The Committee will be well advised not to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision, because he knows that if the Director&#39;s salary is fixed it will be a difficult matter for Parliament to deal with it in the Estimates. I can call to mind one instance bearing upon&#39; this particular matter. When the salary of the Governor-General was under discussion in an Enabling Bill in the Victorian Parliament, the provision that the salary &#34; shall not be less than &#163;10,000 &#34; was altered by striking out the word &#34;less&#34; and inserting &#34;more&#34; with the result that when New South Wales endeavoured to increase the amount to &#163;20,000, it was unable to do so because the Victorian Act limited the sum to &#163;10,000. As Parliament will be blamed for anything that may be done in connexion with this Bill, it would be wise to retain the right to determine the salary. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister&#39;s contention appears to me to be very weak, because I take it that the Director will be appointed at a fixed salary of, say, , &#163;1,000, for a term of five years. If Parliament stepped in and reduced the salary to &#163;750 a year, the Director would have his remedy against the Government for breach of contract, because if he were a sensible man he would have his contract in black and white before he accepted the appointment. I am against the Bill absolutely, but I shall vote for the amendment in order to secure parliamentary control. </para>

Australia is at a great disadvantage at the present time as a result of cheeseparing in regard to the services of its experts in all Departments. Other countries are prepared to pay the best for the best, and the sooner Australia adopts that policy the better. </para>

The question of salary had better be left open so that the Government may arrange to pay for the value they are to receive. If the Government arrange to pay &#163;10,000 for the right type of expert he might be a very cheap man for a young country like Australia in its developmental stage. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment might possibly hamper the Government in their choice of a man. They will have to negotiate for somebody, and we hope they will engage the best man available. They might be able by negotiation to get a good man for &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000 per annum, but that man might not accept the position if he knew that the arrangement made bv the Government was only tentative, and must run the gauntlet of parliamentary approval. If such a man were in the employ of a big company he might prefer to keep his present position rather than run the risk of the contract with the Government being rejected by Parliament. The desire for control by Parliament will be met by the item being placed on the Estimates each year as is the salary of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. If Parl&#39;ament so. desires the salary can be struck out or reduced. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has explained that the amendment is unnecessary, because the salary must appear upon the Estimates, and be subject to parliamentary approval. On the other hand the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> say that the amendment would hamper .the Government in their choice of a suitable man, because a likely appointee might fear that Parliament would refuse to indorse any contract the Government made with him. I fail to see why it should be impossible for Ministers to successfully negotiate with a competent man provided that Parliament allowed sufficient latitude in regard to salary, as I have no doubt Parliament would. The salaries of the High Court Judges are fixed by Act of Parliament; they are not left to the judgment of the Executive. Whilst in ordinary circumstances I would be prepared to yield to the request of the Minister that the amendment be not pressed, yet in the light of recent experience and my general knowledge of the manner in which the Executive have absolutely ignored Parliament in regard to the expenditure of public moneys, I am not prepared to do that. I am not unmindful of the. fact that as late as the 7th July the Government, without reference to Parliament, issued a regulation under the War Precautions Act enabling them to pay out of the consolidated revenue losses incurred in the running of ships along the coast under requisition, some of those losses being probably due to the ships having been held up while the seamen&#39;s strike was in progress. In view of the fact that the Government are prepared to legislate by Executive minute, and to directly charge upon the people the expenses attendant upon such legislation, while large profits are being made by the shipping companies trading along the coast, and in view of our general knowledge of the manner in which the Executive have abused their powers in connexion with the expenditure of public funds, it is high time that we applied a stricter rule and carried out the pledges we made to our constituents to restore to Parliament the control of the public expenditure. </para>

                    <para>.- The only effect of the amendment would  be to disadvantage the Government in the selection of a suitable man. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> does not think for a moment that the House would turn out of office a Government who made a bad appointment; the House never has done that. I favour the Government having latitude in this matter because it is necessary that they should get the very best man available. When the Commonwealth Bank Act was passed it was provided that the Governor-General in Council should fix the salary to be paid to the Governor of the Bank. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. As soon as it became known that the Government wanted a manager for the Commonwealth Bank several of the banking companies called upon their chief officers to say whether or not they intended to apply for the position. Many of them thereupon said they would not be applicants. That action restricted the Government&#39;s choice, and might possibly have prevented them from getting a good man. They did, however, get one of the best banking experts in the Commonwealth, who has since done wonderful work. By negotiation the Government might be able to get for Director of the Institute a man of &#163;4,000 per annum calibre, but if that amount were fixed by Parliament the best man available might not be worth that salary; he might be worth only &#163;2,000. The Minister when conducting negotiations with an expert employed by some big company would have to come to Parliament and say, &#34; We can get a good man for &#163;4,000 per annum.&#34; Immediately honorable members would demand to know the name of the applicant. The disclosure of the name before the appointment was confirmed would prejudice the man in his private employment, and the fear of that happening might prevent him from applying. The Broken Hill Company, for instance, employs some men who are very prominent in the scientific and industrial world, and I understand that one officer of the company is paid a salary of &#163;10,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- The company realizes the value of his work, and is prepared to pay. If it was whispered abroad that the Government proposed to secure the services of the chief officer of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company his directors would probably ask him if he intended leaving the service of the company, and in the event of an affirmative reply he would probably be asked to terminate his engagement. If such a position should arise in connexion with the appointment of a Director the Government would be hampered, and would not be able to get the best man for the position. I trust the honorable member will not press his amendment. </para>

Every one who has studied scientific research will admit that it is not the highly-paid men at the top of the tree who make discoveries, but the younger men-, directed by the elder brain, who achieve success. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Thomson, afterwards Lord Kelvin, after thirty years&#39; work, said he knew no more about electricity than when he first commenced its study.

The clause provides that the Director, if suspended, may be tried by a board of inquiry appointed by the Governor-General; but I ask honorable members if any business firm or company with a board of directors would suspend its chief officer and allow him to be tried by a board, before whom there might be laid a pile of evidence as high as the table in this chamber, as has happened in the case of public servants.

                        <para>- .That may be so, because we are now living in a time of peace* Political parties are more evenly divided than they were during the war ; and, with great respect &#39; to Ministers, it is a good thing for the country when there is a strong Opposition.  However  well meaning the  Minister  may be, the Director of the Institute will be authorized by this Bill to make grants </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is very young. When  he  is three years older in political life he will probably have arrived at the same conclusion as I have. During my occupancy of a seat in this Chamber there have been several Ministries in power, and not one of them has kept its pledges to maintain a firm control over our expenditure. This Bill provides, not one door, but several, for very big outgoings of very little benefit to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister has proposed the postponement of the remaining Orders of the Day until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 2, for leave to introduce a Bill for an Act relating to industrial matters. I am most anxious to reach the consideration of that measure, but I direct attention to the fact that, according to the press, the Prime Minister on Saturday last threatened that he would pass the proposed amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in spite of the opposition of honorable members on this side. I have never known of any opposition to that Bill on the part of honorable members on this side. As a matter of fact, we have been asking for the introduction of the Bill. The adjournment of this House has been moved on more than one occasion to urge an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to permit organizations to get to the Arbitration Court more speedily than they can do under the present law. They are prevented from getting to the Court at the present time. Now, in spite of what the Prime Minister said at Bendigo, he proposes to pass over the notice of motion for the introduction of the Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I understand that he proposes to take only the first reading of the Bill dealing with industrial matters, in order that it may be circulated, and we may consider it tomorrow. Every member of this House is aware that private business is taken first to-morrow, and, if the history of this Parliament repeats itself, we shall be occupied up to 6.30 p.m. with the consideration of that business. As the Bill proposes the adoption of a new principle, I presume that the Prime Minister will not desire that we should go straight on with its consideration, but that we should have an opportunity of considering its provisions. What this Parliament should be most anxious to do is to minimize, as far as possible, the industrial unrest existing at the present time. I agree that the disturbed feeling in the minds of the general community is not confined to Australia, but is evident in every part of the world. It is nearly impossible to secure a measure that will secure complete industrial peace, but we should not shirk our duty to do what we can to prevent industrial unrest. I suggest that the Prime Minister should let us deal with notice of motion No. 1 to-night. </para>

                        <para>.- There is one word I wish to say on the motion for the adjournment of the House. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> this afternoon moved the closure at the end of a long controversial speech. I desire to enter my protest against his action in moving the closure at the end of such a speech, because the adoption of that practice does not give other members of the House any opportunity to reply. Certainly, a very effective reply was given by the vote of the House. I should like to direct attention to the dictum of a  Speaker  of the House of Commons, on the 12th May, 1893, on a point raised by Lord George Hamilton. The matter is recorded as follows, at page 790, vol. 12, of the 4th series of Parliamentary Debates, 4th May, 1893, to 1st June, 1893: - </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the question of the noble lord is whether the closure can be moved after a speech has been made on a general subject or after reasons given for moving it. As far as I recollect, a similar question was raised in August, 1887, when a right honorable gentleman made a long and necessarily controversial speech, and at the end of it moved the closure. The honorable and learned member for Louth raised the point, and I then told the honorable and learned member that  the  question had been settled by former precedents, and that it was competent for an honorable member at the close of a speech to move the closure. But after an experience of many years, 1 am bound to say that for an honorable member to make a controversial speech and then to move the closure is scarcely in conformity with the spirit of the rule, because such a course shuts out an answer to his speech being given. </para>
