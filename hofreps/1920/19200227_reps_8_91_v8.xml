                        <para>- May I ask honorable members generally not to put to Ministers without notice questions of which notice can be given ? When the subject of a question is of such urgency that obviously it would be detrimental to the welfare of any considerable body of citizens to delay the asking of it, it is proper to ask it without notice; but, as honorable members know well, it is not usually under such circumstances that questions are asked without  notice. I shall be glad if honorable members will be good enough to confine their questions without notice to matters of real urgency. I shall answer such questions if I am able to do so. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FENTON.- I have a question to ask which I consider important, because there are quite a number of troubled hearts in the community among the soldiers and their relatives. I wish to know whether the moratorium provisions for the protection of soldiers and their dependants who are renting houses are still in operation against rapacious landlords? </para>

In view of the fact that persons interned during the war were not informed of the charge against them, nor confronted . with their accusers, I wish to know what steps it is proposed to take to satisfy this House and the people of Australia that injustice has not been done to many accused persons. I desire, also, to obtain information as to the number of persons who were interned and the number still interned, but I shall put on the notice-paper my questions on those subjects. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the statement of the Prime Minister that it is not the intention of Ministers to answer questions without notice, unless they are of an urgent character, it would be wasting the time of the House to permit the asking, without notice, of questions which might reasonably be set down on the notice-paper. Therefore, I ask honorable members to give notice of all such questions. </para>

It is proposed, at an early date, to introduce a Bill constituting a Trust for the administration of these moneys, and it is intended such moneys - over and above all the obligations under the Repatriation Act and Regulations - shall be devoted to the widows, orphans, widowed mothers, and other immediate dependants of our fallen soldiers, and also to the more seriously disabled returned soldiers. </para>

                            <para>No. A somewhat complicated system of assessment prevails in Great Britain. Some assessments are based upon averages such as the honorable member refers to. The farmer grazier may elect whether he pays income tax based upon the annual value of his property or upon his average income of the preceding three years. Of course, conditions in Australia arc not the same as in Britain. </para>

                            <para>- The points raised by this question were very fully considered by the Parliament when the amendment of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act 1918 was under consideration, and it was considered that very full provision was made for relief to pastoralists, especially those operating in districts liable to severe drought, in which the capital of the business was liable to be lost or reduced owing to drought. It is probable that pastoralists have not made themselves acquainted with these provisions of the law. This matter will doubtless be considered by the proposed Royal Commission on the incidence of Commonwealth direct taxation. </para>

                    <para>.- It is with sincere pleasure that I second the motion. As the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> has said, the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> is well known to the House, and during his occupancy of the chair on previous occasions gave satisfaction&#39; to almost every one. He had occasionally to play the part yesterday described by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> as that of a flagellator, but it appeared to me that on some occasions at least the punishment meted out by him, if not merited, was, at all events, welcomed and rather sought after. The honorable member never used the whip until he had resorted to a good deal of suasion, and had asked for some consideration for the delinquent. The honorable member for Riverina is not exactly the father of the House - that is a position to which I aspire - but he has been in politics much longer than I have, having had considerable experience in the State Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the National Parliament.  His  decisions as  Chairman  of Committees have met with the approval of the great majority of honorable members, and I am sure they will never be challenged. They will be followed, I am confident, by any honorable member who is privileged in the future to occupy the position, for they displayed such a soundness of judgment that no one could cavil at them. </para>

                    <para>.- It is with reluctance that I rise to take the action that I am now about to do, but there are certain matters which I desire to bring before the House. Those who were in the last Parliament will remember that the Electoral Bill was before the House in November, 1918. The sitting, which opened on the 7th November, extended throughout the night, and after a brief adjournment was resumed at 11 o&#39;clock on the morning of the8th November. Shortly afterwards I rose to exercise my undoubted right to speak to a certain clause in reply to the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who was then Acting Prime Minister, but the honorable member for Riverina, who was then  Chairman  of Committees, ruled that I had already spoken twice to the clause,  and was, therefore, not entitled to speak again. I was positive, and I think most of those present shared my view, that I had spoken only once, and I told the  Chairman  so. Hisreply was that I must sit down, and I had to do so because I knew that if I failed to obey his direction I would be suspended. </para>

I make this statement because my experience on the occasion referred to may be that of any honorable member at some future date.

                    <para>On Friday week, when I rose to speak on clause 125 of the Electoral Bill, the  Chairman  of Committees told me that I had exhausted my right to speak on the clause, having already twice done so. I &#39;denied at the time the accuracy of his statement, and was threatened with expulsion; but the proof of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report furnished to me next day showed that I had spoken on the clause only once. As there was a possibility of a galley slip not having been delivered to me, I waited until the publication of the complete record, and from that it is evident that I spoke only once, beginning my speech at 11.24 a.m. At 11.52 the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> spoke. That was the time at which, according to the  Chairman  of Committees, I had spoken.  His  speech lasted for two or three minutes. At that time, I was absent from the Chamber interviewing the Acting Prime Minister. Our rights here are little enough, and they should not be reduced 50 per cent. </para>

I have admitted that every man can make mistakes - the man who says he does not make mistakes makes the biggest mistake of all. It is true that this was after an all-night sitting, but I should be failing in my duty as a member of this House if I&#39; allowed my rights to be curtailed without protest. </para>

However, it was not my province to interfere with the  Chairman  of Committees, although I was in charge of the Committee at the time; I trusted that the records of the  Chairman,  or of the  Clerk,  were more reliable than the faulty recollections of Parliamentarians like the honorable gentleman and myself. We had had an all-night sitting, dealing with that troublesome Electoral Bill, and honorable members were very strained. We were trying to hasten the close of the Friday sitting in order that honorable members might catch their Inter-State trains. Surely the honorable member does not mean to suggest that because the late  Chairman  of Committees made a mistake- </para>

                    <para>. - Than a lawyer, I know nobody more able to ,put up a case for or against than is the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> . Possibly the profession of the law allows a man to become a sophist. I am sorry to say that the Treasurer is a sophist; to would argue either way. This election is just another phase of the division of the spoils of office. The Ministerial candidate is one of the six survivors of the noble fourteen who left a certain room upstairs when the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> after holding the position of  chairman  of the party for two days and one night, was afraid to put to the meeting a motion concerning his leadership. The chairmanship is one of the paid positions of the House. With new recruits, the National Labour party number nine, and they &#39;have already more than their fair proportion of offices. I accuse the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> of having been absolutely unjust while he occupied the position of  Chairman.  Following the occasion on which I was ordered out of the House - the first time in a parliamentary career of thirty years - the  Chairman  left the chair, walked on to the floor of the House, and, by his remarks, rubbed the salt into the open wound. I placed the incident on record! in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the form of a sworn declaration. On a subsequent date the Labour Whip told me that my declaration was being discussed in the House. I came into the House, and the Minister for the Navy appealed to me to agree to expunge the declaration from the records of the House. He stated that the declaration had been read when the House was in Committee, and&#39; was, therefore, out of order. The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter),</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, should have known whether the reading of the document was in accordance with the Standing Orders. However, I was in a good humour when the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> appealed to me, and, after first requesting that a member from each side of the House should be chosen to investigate the matter, and decide whether the  Chairman  or I was in the wrong, I agreed to leave the matter in his hands. Ultimately the honorable member for Riverina would not indorse his statement. All that. I desired him to do was to admit that he had made a mistake. I did not want an apology from a man older in years than I am. He would not acknowledge that he was wrong. The sworn declaration was expunged from the records. The Minister for the Navy kept his contract. I remember him saying to the  Chairman,  &#34; If I were you, sir, I would withdraw and apologize, and so have done with the matter.&#34; I told the honorable member for Riverina that if he swore a declaration that my statement was wrong, I would prosecute him for perjury. I could do nothing more. He accused me of going into his district on one occasion to speak against his re-election. The only time I went into his electorate during elections was when I went, at my own expense, to urge the Labour branches of the district to adopt him as their candidate.  His  own common sense ought to have told him that my constituents required my presence in Melbourne during an election at which I was opposed. Even now, if the honorable gentleman will say that he regretted that he made a mistake, I will accept his word willingly. I come now to a humorous incident. Did not he, when  Chairman,  call me to order, and ask me to sit down, when I was singing <inline font-style="italic">God Save the King*!</inline> And did I not tell him and the Ministry that I would see them damned first? Whenever I am singing <inline font-style="italic">God Save the King,</inline> or whatever is the national song of the British race, I shall sing it standing. If the discussion to-day does nothing else, it will at least prove to the honorable member for Riverina that he, like others, is fallible. It would have been better if he, acting on the advice of the Minister for the Navy, had acknowledged that he had made a mistake, instead of compelling me to take the advantage of an opportunity, which occurs only once in three years, to register my protest. Let any honorable member read the declaration, and ask himself if any man could do more to prove that he had all the evidence on his side. </para>

                    <para>.- Having been present in the chamber throughout all the proceedings referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, it is only fair to those who were not present on that occasion that I should state a little more than has been said with regard to the incident. Concerning the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> I am able to state &#39; that everything he said regarding what happened upon the occasion in question is absolutely accurate. I can, from my own recollection, confirm his account. But, with regard to the implication that the  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament (the  Hon.  J. M. Chanter) was deliberately and intentionally unfair, I think it only right that one who was present and had personal knowledge of the whole incident should protest. There is not the slightest doubt regarding what occurred. There had been an all-night sitting. I understand that there are some twenty new members in this chamber. Most, if not all of them, are unfamiliar with all-night sittings. Possibly they will have become painfully familiar with such occurrences before long. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. These situations are, after all, more the outcome of habit than anything else. Some people readily admit their mistakes, others do not; I have been accused by my friends of being one who is always too ready to apologize, and who withdraws what may be deemed to be an objectionable statement far too soon. It may be that there are honorable members opposite who are tardy in making reparation for &#39;hasty and unjust statements with respect to honorable members upon this side. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that, &#39; and I believe it is true also. But I object to this whole subject being raised now, and to the stressing of the implication that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> was, upon the occasion in question, deliberately unfair. I am satisfied that he was not, but that he made a purely accidental mistake, and that he honestly believed that the honorable member for Yarra had spoken twice. </para>

                        <para>- I deprecate the fact that recriminations to which, unfortunately, we have become accustomed in the past should so soon be launched in this new Parliament. It was once said of a great house, whose scions came to their doom in- consequence of such principles, that of the past they forget nothing and from it they learn nothing. I trust that those remarks will never be said of the Opposition in this- chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I am a member of the Australian Country party, which&#39; is a very good party. I have not risen in support either of the Government or of the Opposition, or, indeed, of any party. This is not a party question, but one having to do with the impartiality of an honorable member who held an office of authority in this House. It is a subject which should be above all party. Had it been raised in a party spirit, such as the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> has implied, the procedure would be a degradation to this House and to those honorable members responsible. I plead that, in this new Parliament, which&#34; consists of at least one-third new members, and includes the cream of the intellect of the country, as typified by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls),</inline> who has just interjected, we should endeavour to forget all those bitter memories of the past, all those personal, and almost vindictive, recollections </para>

                    <para>.- I second the amendment. I see no reason why these positions should not be contested. From whatever side of the House a member is chosen to occupy the position of a presiding officer, we have a right to look to him to deal out evenhanded justice. I know that there have been times when we have had an all-night sitting, after a long day in Committee, and without any sleep, when we say and do things which we afterwards regret. We usually find that if a man has made a mistake he has been ready to make amends. In the first words which I spoke here I said that it was likely that I would say and do things on the spur of the moment which I might afterwards have cause to regret, but that if I did I hoped that; I would always be found sufficiently manly to admit my mistake and own up, whether that involved a public apology or not. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that our presiding officers, ki matters pertaining to the observance of the Standing Orders  and  decorum, should present a pattern and example which we should all be delighted to follow. The evidence which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has presented this morning shows conclusively that the gentleman who occupied the position of  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament made a mistake, and failed to admit it. I think that he ought now, even at the eleventh hour, to admit the mistake he made. A man who shows himself reluctant to admit that he made a mistake is likely, in the position of  Chairman  of Committees, to commit grievous errors in the future. I feel sure that if it had been the Prime Minister who suffered as the result of the mistake made by the honorable member for Riverina as  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament, he would have been only too ready to admit his mistake, but because it  was  the Leader of the Opposition who suffered as the result of his mistake, he is not prepared to admit it, even at the eleventh hour. </para>

                        <para>- Then why has the honorable member for Riverina not admitted his mistake before? We should not forget that his denial of the right of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> to speak a second time upon a clause of a Bill in Committee was accompanied by a threat which meant expulsion from the Chamber if the order of the Chair was not obeyed. It should be remembered, also, that the honorable member for  Yarra  deports himself in the* Chamber in a way which honorable members generally might well follow. He is amongst the least offensive members of the House, and is prompt in obeying the demands of the Chair. I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley),</inline> in order that honorable members may he given an opportunity to show that they  do  not approve of some of the actions  of  the  Chairman  of Committees in the last Parliament, and may be able  to  record their votes against his election on this occasion. </para>

It is significant that this appeal should have come from the  Deputy Chairman  of the Country party. It gives colour -to the rumour daily gaining currency that, after all, the so-called Country party is merely an unimportant wing of the National party. </para>

                    <para>. - I have nothing to say against the honorable member for Riverina as  Chairman  of Committees. I suppose that, like every other  Chairman,  he always looks after his pals. The only fair man I ever struck was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex.</inline> Poynton, the honorable member for Grey. He made me go down on my knees, and apologize to him, when he was acting as  Chairman  of Committees, although he was a member of our party at the time. There was not much favoritism about that. The debate has shown that, the Country party, notwithstanding all the protestations wo have heard that it is separate and alone, has an honorable understanding with the Government. That has been made plain by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett).</inline></para>

                        <para>- I do not know the name of the gentleman who interrupted me, or where he comes from, but after he has been here a little while he will understand that I shall not worry very much about himself or his party. The honorable member for Grampians has given the show away. I remember that, in connexion with a Wheat Commission which was inquiring in Adelaide, a statement was made to the effect that there was no combination and no Trust, but there was an honorable understanding, and it appears to me that the Prime Minister and his party have an honorable understanding if not with the Country party, them with the officials of that party, including the honorable member for Grampians. It is idle for us to nominate a candidate from this side. This is supposed to be an election by the House, but we know that it has been fixed up. Directly I came to Melbourne a member of the Farmers&#39; party told me that the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> was going to be  Speaker,  and the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> was going to be  Chairman  of Committees. That is a peculiar thing, but he was a good tipster, if he was nothing else. If the officials of the party had not been discussing this particular matter, the individual members had evidently been discussing it among themselves. To debate the election of  Chairman  of Committees is beating the air, because it is a foregone conclusion that the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chanter)</inline> is to be the man. I would point out to him that it is a hard thing for any man, when he does another a wrong, to own up to it publicly. </para>

                        <para>- Well, it is a hard thing. The honorable member for Riverina accused another honorable member of doing something that he did not do, and then had the power of expelling him, when that man was leader of our party. If I had been in the position of our leader I should simply have sat down and said, &#34; I am sticking for the truth, not for parliamentary procedure. Put me out.&#34; If he had been put out then for telling the truth, he would have had the sympathy, not only of the House, but of every man outside who believes that truth and justice should prevail above all things. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne Pouts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> has escaped being put out many a time when he should have been. If he was put out on one occasion when he should not have been, it was only one instance the other way. I feel that the honorable member for Riverina, when elected, will be as fair as he possibly can be.  He  may make errors, but every man makes errors. If our protest does no harm or no good, it will at least let him know the feelings of us who are in opposition. I would remind the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> that ever since he has been in Parliament he has had the pleasure of sitting behind the Government. When he has a taste of sitting in Opposition, with a brutal majority against him on that side, such as we have against us now, I wonder whether he will put up as good a fight as we have done. During his first session he was always looking for an all-night sitting. He would come up here wrapped up in an overcoat weighing about 56 lbs., and with a- swag on his back like a black gin&#39;s benjamin, which had been carried about .the bush for twelve months, and with a billy-can and a water-bag in his hand, looking for it. No wonder the honorable member talks about all-night sittings. </para>

He has had considerable experience in the chair, but he has reached such a stage that he can no longer be relied upon. He has fallen into a condition of senile decay, and perhaps on that account it might be wise to relieve him of such an important position. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to acknowledge the honour which has been paid me by electing me to the important position of  Chairman  of Committees arid  Deputy Speaker  of the House. I wish especially to thank the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> and the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> for having nominated me, and the other honorable gentlemen who have spoken to the motion. I desire also to assure honorable members that nothing that has taken place in this debate, no criticism passed upon me, &#34;will influence me in the slightest degree in the performance of my duty. When I take the chair I know no party in this House, and I forget everything that has been said. I want to remind honorable members, if they will permit me to do so, without adopting the form of a lecture, that for the good conduct of business here there are Standing Orders made and approved by honorable members themselves for the guidance and direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself when we occupy our judicial positions. If these Standing Orders are thought to be inadequate, it is within the power of honorable members to alter them. It is the duty - the imperative duty - of the presiding officers to interpret them to the best of their ability, and in an impartial manner. I may also be permitted to remind honorable members that the dignity and decorum of this House cannot be maintained by presiding officers without the assistance of honorable members themselves. They must have that support. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or I, when acting in our respective capacities, make mistakes, we are immediately open to challenge.I leave my past record in the hands of those honorable members with whom I have been associated, and my future with the members of the present Parliament. I shall be judged by my actions. All I can say is that I shall do my duty fearlessly and impartially, and as courteously as possible, in accordance with the Standing Orders. Again I thank honorable members for the honour they have conferred on me. </para>

Sometimes, I think we do not make enough allowance for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or the  Chairman  of Committees. We are prone to forget that they are human beings and, like ourselves, subject to all the disabilities of human nature.

                        <para>.- Earlier in to-day&#39;s proceedings the Prime Minister moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Supply Bill to be introduced before the debate on the Address-in-Reply had been concluded. Nothing was said when that motion was submitted, and it was formally agreed to. I thought at the time that it was necessary to grant Supply to enable the members of the Civil Service to be paid, and I expected the Prime Minister to give reasons for submitting the motion. I understand the procedure is that before agreeing to a motion of this nature honorable members have an opportunity of ventilating grievances. The Government are about to ask for the sinews of war to enable them to carry on. Is Supply to be granted for any particular time? </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how much. Unless there is some urgent reason, such as facilitating the payments of civil servants, I shall certainly object. Although the Government have been returned by a large majority, we do not know what support they are likely to receive from the House, because we have not had an opportunity of testing their strength. We do not know whether the party which calls itself the Country party is going to support or oppose the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I say it advisedly, and not offensively. But that is the view I hold regarding it. Before I agree to the motion to go into Committee of Supply I wish to hear from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, or from one of the Ministers, something in regard to what I consider has been extravagant and reckless expenditure on the part of the Government. Honorable members may smile, but I am sure that the majority of the people of Australia is anxious to have some particulars in regard to this matter. It is strange, indeed, that the Auditor-General&#39;s report, which was issued about eight months ago, was laid on the table of this House only yesterday. I have not had an opportunity of perusing it, and I do not believe it has been printed or made available, to honorable members. I notice, however, from the press that there are certain items of expenditure and certain losses on which some information should be given. I refer to a statement in the daily press of to-day, headed &#34; Shipping Losses,&#34; which reads - </para>

                        <para>Details are furnished of the loss entailed upon the Commonwealth in connexion with shipbuilding in America. An agreement was made with the Patterson, McDonald Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, to construct ten wooden cargo-carrying steamers at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> cost of 5,300,000 dollars. Subsequently the contract was so amended that the cost would have been 8,900,000 dollars. Advice had, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Israel</inline> added, been received that eight of the ships had been sold at a loss of &#163;326,000. In view of the enormous increase in cost compared with the original contract, a  very fortunate sale would appear to have been made. </para>

The paper from which this statement is taken supports the Government - I do not know upon what grounds - and the statement concludes, &#34; a very fortunate sale would appear to have been made.&#34; The people of this country, as well as the members of this House, should have some explanation, and I am sure the primary producers in particular will want to know more about it. </para>

                            <para>- If a satisfactory explanation can be given, I shall have nothing further to say; but on the face of the Auditor-General&#39;s report, it does not appear that any great business capacity was shown by the Government in making contracts which were subsequently cancelled, and at a loss to the taxpayers of such a large amount of money. If they can give an explanation, let them give it. I am also anxious to know before the House resolves itself into a Committee of Supply, who bore the expense in connexion with the hold-up of shipping, arising out of the dispute with the Institute of Marine Engineers. I want to know whether a large proportion of that expense of holding up ships which do not belong to the Commonwealth, was borne by the Commonwealth Government. It is a most important matter, in which a very large majority of the people of Australia are interested, and if that expense was borne by the Government, we should have a full statement of the reasons why. I cannot go categorically into all the matters I wish to refer to, upon which the Government could be criticised at this moment, but there are some things on which it is appropriate a pronouncement should be made at the earliest possible moment, because they are of vital importance, affecting as they do the interests of the whole of the people. We all know that, since the election&#39;s of the 13th December last, there has been a sharp rise in the cost of living. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It was pointed out by candidates who faced the electors that it would come about. I do not quarrel with the decision of the people of Australia, but I feel it is my duty in the interests of the electors of West Sydney to have something to say on this matter, because, although we have not succeeded in preventing a Government getting into power that is, in my opinion, backed by the profiteering interests of the country, we may still be able to do something in order to prevent that profiteering pressing too heavily on the people. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. There is no better evidence of what the Government believed to be their power under the War Precautions Act than the drastic regulation proclaimed the other day dealing with the Institute of Marine Engineers, the most undemocratic regulation ever issued by a British Government. &#39; That proclamation, which prevented a body of men from making use of their own funds for the maintenance of their wives and families without the consent of the Attorney-General, was ample evidence of the view which the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> holds of  the powers the Government possess under the War Precautions Act. Otherwise it was a gigantic piece of bluff on the &#39;part of the Government in order to achieve the result they desired. As I was saying, the Government, at the height of their power, when there could be no dispute as to their having complete authority under the War Precautions Act, repealed all regulations which had any bearing upon a reduction- in the cost of living in Australia. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. </para>
