                        <para>- The honorable member spoke to me about this matter yesterday, and therefore I am able to answer the question in some detail. For some time past an attempt has been in progress to get an arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States for the adoption of rolls covering both Commonwealth and State electorates, but the only State that has, so far, agreed to this arrangement, is Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> our Chief Electoral Officer, is now in Adelaide, and I think will be able to make an arrangement under which, not only the rolls containing the names of South Australian Assembly electors, but also those containing the names of electors for the South Australian Legislative Council, will be combined with the Commonwealth rolls for the State. I feel confident that such rolls will be used at the general election there next year. From Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> will proceed to Sydney and try to get into touch with the authorities there. I am satisfied that if we rely solely on correspondence we shall never arrive at finality in this matter. </para>

Is it proposed to go to great expense at Corio Bay in preparing a base on an unsuitable site? Would it not be better to establish the base at Hobart, and thus prevent the waste of money ? </para>

                        <para>- The establishment of the base near Geelong was determined before I took office, but having gone into the matter, I am satisfied that the site is one of the best in Australia. No doubt, in Tasmania there is an ample depth of water; but it is considered better to have the base on the mainland, and I am told by the best experts that Corio Bay provides the most suitable site. Submarines can lie in Corio Bay and go out into Port Phillip to be exercised. In Port Phillip there is a depth of 13 fathoms of water, over a splendid sandy bottom, so that there is no danger in exercising these vessels there. The submarine of to-day is a different vessel from the submarine that was in vogue when the Westernport Base was chosen. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, viz.: - Extension to buildings and equipment of the Commonwealth Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong, Victoria. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">On the Works and Buildings Estimates, which the House has already passed, provision is made for an expenditure of £8,000 towards these buildings and for an expenditure of £38,000 for plant, so that we have already appropriated for this purpose a sum of £46,000.  I  am now moving that the whole matter be referred to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. To meet military, naval, postal and other requirements, it has been decided that it is desirable to double the present output capacity of 600,000 yards per annum of the Commonwealth Government Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong. This involves the installation of additional plant and the extension of buildings for its accommodation. To provide this accommodation it is proposed to erect on a site to the west of and adjoining the present building, which is Commonwealth property, additions comprising a floor area of 31,616 square feet, of which 19,760 square feet will be devoted to the extension of the weaving room and the remaining 11,856 square feet to the finishing room. These extensions will be comprised in a number of bays, each 30 feet wide, in continuity of those which already exist. The length of each bay will be 104 feet. The structure is to be similar in all respects to that which already exists. It will have brick walls, a concrete floor, and steel story posts and roof principals. Efficient natural lighting will be provided by a sawtooth roof over the whole area of the extension, and there will be windows in the western wall. There will also be provided the necessary additional lavatory accommodation for male and female employees, together with drainage, &amp;c, electric light, power, and fire-preventive services. Tha estimated cost of the works and services is £23,993, and the Defence Department has advised that to provide the necessary machinery a further amount of £36,800 will be required, making a total estimated cost of £60,793. I submit the plans, specifications, and statement in compliance with the provisions of the Act. </para>

These proposals seem to suggest the atmosphere of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- Canberra is part of our own Territory. Queensland, one of the greatest States in the Commonwealth, produces wool of the best quality, and yet we have no proposal to establish a factory of this kind, or indeed any other Commonwealth factory in the State. I believe the Commonwealth Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong has been very successful, but if we intend to extend our operations in this regard, we should establish a woollen mill in each State. No one State of the Commonwealth should have a monopoly. In these circumstances I think the Public Works Committee should not be limited to art inquiry as to the suitability of Geelong for works of this character. The Committee should have power to make inquiries throughout the Commonwealth and to report as to the most suitable site in each State for the erection of a woollen mill. I do not object to the establishment of Government mills, but I am certainly opposed to the duplication of the Geelong mill. I am not putting in a special claim for New South Wales, although it is a well-known fact that the best tweeds manufactured in the Commonwealth come from the Marrickville district, where there is an abundant water supply. I should like the Committee to have power to inquire as to whether or not the water supply there ia not more suitable for the purposes of woollen mills than is that at Geelong. It should inquire whether a State which has&gt; ample coal supplies should not be considered rather than a State which has to import most of its coal. I shall object to this motion unless the Minister is prepared to omit the word "Geelong" and to give the Committee power to recommend the best site for such mills in Australia. The ambit of the Committee's inquiry should be enlarged. </para>

                            <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> that the Committee should be empowered to make inquiries in all the States. In my electorate, in the southern part of South Australia, we have abundant supplies of water running to waste, and we produce wool on a large scale. We have, in short, everything essential to the establishment of a woollen mill. The Government would be well advised, in establishing mills, to work up our rough wools, which are now almost a drug on the market, while our finer wools could continue to go to those countries wh'ich so badly need them. I believe there is no part of the British Empire so well adapted for the manufacture of woollens as is the south-eastern portion of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>.- I hope the Minister will take notice of what has been said, by the other honorable members who have spoken. The establishment of the woollen industry is vital to the welfare of Australia, and Commonwealth mills should not be restricted to one State. The activities of the Government in this respect should extend over all the States. To merely establish mills in Victoria will be a verY short-sighted policy. Queensland produces some of the finest Australian wools, and has abundance of water and other natural facilities for the manufacture of woollens, and has a right to be considered when the Government are proposing the establishment of further mills. It is unnecessary to dwell on the advantages which New South Wales offers for this industry. </para>

                                <para>- I am not advocating preferential treatment of any one State, but I do believe in preferential treatment of the people. That can be given only by establishing these mills wherever possible in Australia. The finest wool in the world is grown in New South Wales, which produces 39 per cent, of the total Australian wool clip. The finest breed of sheep is to be found there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkiner,</inline> who was formerly a member of the House, has done a great deal in that State to improve the breed of sheep. Amongst other natural advantages is an abundance of the particular class of water required for the treatment of the wool. The people of Tasmania, too, have a right to be considered in regard to the possibility of the woollen industry being set up in their midst. </para>

                                <para>- That State has natural advantages for creating cheap power, and I am pleased to know that efforts are being made to develop its power resources. There is a great future for Tasmania if its natural advantages in this respect are developed to the fullest extent. Having regard to the fact that . it is vital to the interests of Australia that the woollen industry should be established on a broad and permanent basis, the Minister should agree to the Public Works Committee having power to extend its investigations to all the States. Honorable members are well aware of the reputation which New South Wales has for the production of first class tweeds. At Marrickville, in that State, the best Australian tweeds are produced. Nobody has a more intimate knowledge of that fact than have you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> But, unfortunately, the works are not extensive enough to supply the whole of Australia's requirements. The Government should offer every encouragement to the extension of the industry in -the various States', and build up a great Australian asset. It appears to me a suicidal policy for Australia, which' is probably the greatest wool-producing country in the 'world, to be exporting practically the whole of the raw product and buying it back in its manufactured form. Why should we not do the manufacturing 'here, where the raw material is produced, and, at any rate, endeavour to supply our own requirements of woollen goods? For that reason, amongst others, I strongly advocate that everything possible should be done to develop the woollen industry throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>. - I support the request that has been made for the extension of this reference. The establishment of woollen mills is a matter that should receive the most careful consideration at the hands of the Public Works Committee, and, therefore, the reference should not be restricted to any one State. It is essential that consideration should be given to the fact that at the present time the woollen industry is entirely dependent on coal supplies for power. If a coal strike occurs, all manufacturing operations are suspended. Other honorable members have urged the establishment of Commonwealth woollen mills at Sydney and other . places, but I suggest that the manufacturing should be done where the raw product is produced, and where there are large supplies of water, and water power, as there are in the northern districts of New South Wales. Albury is another place which will have a permanent and plentiful supply of water and power before long, and' there ave other situations which have these natural advantages for the establishment of the woollen industry. The claims of all these places should be considered by the Committee. </para>

                                <para>- If we were about to establish Commonwealth woollen mills, I would have no objection to doing that. But the Government have already expended in land and machinery at Geelong, probably, £100,000, and if the site chosen be an unsuitable one, that machinery ought to be scrapped, and the mills removed to the most eligible site. The idea of establishing Commonwealth woollen mills in six different States is absurd. If Geelong is not the right place in which to establish them, let us remove them to the best possible site. Prior to Federation, probably not 25 per cent, of the boots of Australia were manufactured in my own electorate. But since then, most of our boot factories have been established there. Why? </para>

                                <para>- The boot operatives get more than the basic wage. The honorable member knows that the boot trade is a well-organized industry, and that the operatives who are employed in it have not been down to the basic wage for the past twenty years. In other words, they have always received more than the  minimum  wage. I will guarantee that the skilled operatives in the boot trade are receiving, in some cases, 10 per cent., and in others 25 per cent., more than the award of the Court. </para>

                                <para>- No; the Commonwealth Arbitration Court operates in New South Wales as well as in Victoria, and I am speaking of the award which was made in connexion with the boot industry. That award is higher than is the basic wage of New South Wales. The position is that the industry is becoming centralized in my electorate simply because the requisite labour is available there. Similarly a match factory was started in Richmond, and two other factories of a similar character have since been established there. Why? Because the necessary labour is forthcoming there. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> can tell us that the white work industry is centralized, so far as Victoria is concerned, in the district of Bourke. </para>

                            <para>.- I entirely agree with the argument which has been advanced in regard to the desirableness of establishing additional woollen mills in Australia. The woollen industry is one of our great key industries, and the question which we are now discussing is one of the most important questions affecting Australia. We should be narrow-minded indeed if we were to come to any conclusion upon it without a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the best site that is available for Commonwealth woollen mills. I do not know what my constituents would think of me if I failed upon an occasion like the present to emphasize the claims of my own electorate. I do so, not from any narrow or parochial consideration, but merely because New England is the natural centre of the woollen industry of this country. That district grows the finest wool that is produced in Australia, and it is the most central of all parts of the Commonwealth. When a connexion by rail is made between Dubbo and Werris Greek, the whole of the western portion of New, South Wales will be linked up with the New England District, which will then draw from Queensland and the north of the mother State practically all her wool supplies. All the conditions which are necessary for a large centre of population obtain there at the present time, and the climate is the finest in Australia. The fertility of the soil of New England is not surpassed by that of any other part of Australia. Everybody knows that where manufacturing industries are established a fertile soil is necessary in order that the people engaged in those industries may obtain the commodities that they require. </para>

I quite agree with the contention that a through inquiry should be made into the question of which is the best site available for the establishment of our woollen mills, and that that inquiry should not be limited to the eligible sites in any one State. The Committee should have a free hand to investigate and report to the House. </para>

                            <para>.-I hold a somewhat different view from that of honorable members who have preceded me. I do not think it is so much a matter of inquiry as to the erection of mills in the various States as a question of the necessity for this Commonwealth Parliament to decide once and for all whether or not Commonwealth factories shall be erected in our own Territory. The Commonwealth possesses to-day 900 square miles, to which we talk of eventually moving the Seat of Government. How are we to populate the Territory if we continue to build our factories in the various States? We ought not to confine the Public Works Committee to ascertaining whether there should be an extension of the Woollen Mills at Geelong. They ought to have greater discretion. If we refer a matter to the Committee, and stipulate definitely that it shall inquire only into that particular matter, we limit the scope of their inquiry. The Public Works Committee should have the power to inquire whether Canberra is suitable for this particular industry, and not merely whether we should expend £60,000 in making additions to this factory in Victoria. I am not speaking from the point of view of any particular State. To-day the Commonwealth has offices and factories in different parts of Australia, more particularly in Victoria, and if we admit the argument that where we have an existing building in Victoria development should be met by the extension of that factory, we can practically centralize all such industries in this State. We have erected many factories in this State, and I take it the day will come when their success will call for further extensions. Are we, then, in case of such development, to enlarge the factories in this or any other State in preference to erecting buildings in our own Territory? </para>

                                <para>- I cannot say; but I do not think so. My contention is that the Government are in duty bound to submit such projected works to the Committee, with discretion to say, after hearing evidence, whether, in their opinion, they should be established in our own Territory or elsewhere. Wool is produced all around the Federal area, so that there would be no difficulty in obtaining material for manufacture, together with water and every other requisite for the production of woollen goods. Why should we expend Commonwealth money in improving State values, when we ought to be improving the value of our own property? Some day we expect a large revenue from Canberra. We have already, I believe, spent £1,000,000 there, and will have to expend many more millions in building the city. Why, then, should we not expend the public money in improving our property? </para>

                            LAMOND (Illawarra)  £3.20]. -  I desire to move an amendment that will leave the selection of sites open to the Public Works Committee. I do not agree with the honorable member for Hunter
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline>
                            that the choice of the Committee should be confined to Geelong or Canberra. For instance, the Commonwealth has territory at Jervis Bay that might be found to be more suitable than Canberra for the establishment of a woollen mill. My view differs entirely from that of the Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor).</inline>
                            Australia is many times larger than Great Britain, and it is an utter absurdity for the Commonwealth to seriously contemplate handing over to Victorian pastoralists the SUpply of the whole of the wool to be manufactured for Australia's requirements, or, alternatively, bringing the wool from other places to Geelong and then carrying the manufactured article back to those distant portions of the Commonwealth where it is to be used. I maintain that it is impossible for the needs of Australia to be supplied from any one centre, and I am surprised that there should be any dissent from such an elementary proposition. We know to-day that, in regard to the supply of suits of clothes for soldiers, the mill is many months in arrears in regard to serge. Those who have been supplied with tweeds have almost worn out their suits, while others who have applied for serges have not been supplied at all. I am inclined to think that it will be found, as this industry develops, that the wisest policy will be to associate the manufacture of one line of goods with one factory by which means we' would most likely get more expert handling of the product. That may or may not be so, but I am certain that it will never be an economic proposition to carry wool from North Queensland to Geelong, manufacture it there, and carry it back again over all that extent of territory to North Queensland in the form of tweed or serge for use by the people there. .Surely the sane policy would be to distribute the manufacture, not to one or two, but to .several of the centres throughout the Commonwealth. I want to point out what will be demonstrated again on several other items of expenditure - the method by which centralization around Melbourne is -carried out. We are not asked to investigate a proposition for the establishment of woollen mills at Geelong. They are taken over under some extraordinary power of the Government, and Parliament is consulted after the deed is done. No inquiry is made as to whether Geelong is the best site. Parliament has no voice in that matter. The idea is t'o get a little industry commenced somewhere, and then, as soon as it is established, to throw everything into it, and keep on extending it, thus depriving other centres of fair treatment in connexion with Commonwealth industries. I am opposed to the proposal to limit this expenditure to the extension of existing works, because it may be a much more economic proposition to establish a new factory in some other district, from which the product can be distributed to a large local area more economically than it can be supplied from Geelong. Therefore, I give notice that I shall move a further amendment, substituting for the proposal of the honorable member for Hunter the addition of the words " or alternatively to establish new woollen mills elsewhere in Australia."

                                <para>- Most of it was made at Geelong. Quite rightly, the Government have determined that every returned soldier is to be supplied with tweed at a cheap price, but the Geelong mills are thousands of yards behind in the supply of the article. I see no reason why the supply of tweed should be confined to returned soldiers. If the Government are legally entitled to sell tweed to soldiers, surely they can also supply soldiers' widows and the fatherless children of soldiers with cloth at a cheap price. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know; but I suppose they were equally as competent as the members of the Public Works Committee. But because they chose Geelong they have earned the enmity of certain honorable members who represent New South Wales constituencies. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hay)</inline> has spoken about certain coal resources, and about the electrical energy that is likely to be developed in his electorate; but, with the exception of Ballarat, there is no better spot in Australia for the establishment of woollen mills than Geelong. It is the port for the Western District of Victoria, where some of the finest wool in the world is grown, and, with the development of the Morwell electric scheme, will be supplied with cheap power in the course of a few months. Everything necessary for the successful manufacture of woollen cloth is to be found at Geelong, and the mills have already demonstrated that they can carry on the industry with eminent success. But there is need for more cloth. It is a present need, and not one which is two years off. Already the Ministry have delayed long enough in bringing forward their proposals to extend the Geelong mills. Of course, if I looked at the matter from a parochial stand-point, I would be putting forward the claims of Ballarat, where two large mills are successfully demonstrating that they can carry on the industry there. But I realize that the cost of clothing is very high. </para>

I have been wearing the suit I have on me to-day for seven or eight months, and, including the profit of 4s. to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, the 3½ yards of tweed from which it is made cost me only£1 9s. 9d. I should like to see the Geelong mills extend their operations not only for the purpose of providing cloth for returned soldiers and soldiers' widows and little children, but also so that every individual in the community may be supplied with it. </para>

                                <para>- First, let us get the Geelong mills going properly. There is a crying need for them, and I ask honorable members not to persist in moving amendments which may only serve the purpose of delaying this proposition. The alterations are urgently required to enable the mill to catch up its arrears of work. We want to honour our obligations to our soldiers. Therefore, let us give the Government an opportunity of carrying out these extensions at Geelong at once. I do not think the machinery which will be required can be obtained in Victoria, or, in fact, anywhere in Australia. I know that a Ballarat mill, which is making extensive alterations, has been obliged to send its manager to Great Britain to buy machinery there. But if the amendment is carried, it will lead to months of delay. The Public Works Committee will feel called upon to examine the claims of every village which may be put forward, and therefore it may take months to complete its inquiry. </para>

                                <para>- I wish the machinery could be obtained in Australia, but we all know that during the war it was impossible to get it here. I have no doubt that those who arc interested in the establishment of woollen mills in Victoria would be very glad indeed if they could get the machinery erected at once. They would be prepared to pay some additional cost if they could get it in Australia, and at once; but, unfortunately, they cannot, and so the agents are going abroad for the purpose of obtaining it. If we agree to the amendment it will be good-bye to the returned soldiers' chance of getting cheap cloth for a long time to come. </para>

                            <para>.- The question of enlarging the Geelong Woollen Mills is one that has given me a good deal of thought for a considerable time. I brought it before the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> during the absence of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in England. Certain honorable members have asked vue not to be parochial in the expression of my views on the subject, and I hope I shall not be. I say that if it can be satisfactorily proved that mills of this kind can be established in any other part of Australia, I would not for one moment attempt to block the movement in the interests of the city and electorate which I represent. But I want honorable members to carry their minds back a few years, to 1911, when this question was first discussed, and when the Government sent to England and obtained the services of a competent expert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Smail)</inline> to advise as to the best location for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. </para>

                                <para>- I believe they managed to get a Scotchman in England, and I think the Government were extremely foolish to lose his services for the sake of a few hundred pounds additional salary. In his report, dated 19th July, 1912, a copy of which I hold in my hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> sets out that in the course of his inquiry he visited thirty-three centres, namely, Yass-Canberra, Warrnambool, Port Fairy, Geelong, Bendigo, Echuca, Moama, Kilmore, Launceston, Hobart, Devonport, Burnie, Ballarat, Liverpool, Lithgow, Parramatta, Botany Bay, Ipswich, Brisbane, Wangaratta, Adelaide, Perth, Guildford, Bridgetown, Collie, Mount Gambier, Port Macdonnell, Millicent, Beachport, Melbourne, Horsham, Ararat, Portland. Honorable members will see, therefore, that in his peregrinations he travelled extensively throughout the Commonwealth, and his report has, I think, been of very material advantage to this country. He indicated that in coming to a decision he had to consider the question of water supply, its quality and' quantity, drainage, climatic conditions, the manufacture of the woollen cloth, comfort of employees, proximity to wool markets, railway and shipping facilities, conditions of the labour market, geographical position as a distributing centre, and local conditions as affecting efficient and economical working. After a very careful inquiry into the claims of every place, he made his decision in favour of Geelong. This is what he had to say - </para>

                            <para>This town is admirably suited for the manufacture of woollen goods, having a constantly flowing river of comparatively soft water, natural drainage for mill: effluent into the river, a good industrial population, comparatively near the principal wool markets, well placed for railway and shipping, and a good centre for distribution. It is a most desirable place for our purpose, and has the further advantage of having a community who are conversant with wool manufacture, which is a valuable asset. The Harbor Trust offers land free of cost. Warrnambool, I consider, is quite out of the question against Geelong. </para>

                                <para>- Private enterprise recognised his worth. Evidently the Commonwealth Government did not. Having had the advice of an expert with no axe to grind, but whose only desire was to serve the Commonwealth by recommending the most suitable site for the Commonwealth "Woollen Mills, we would have done wrong if we had opposed a recommendation he had made. The Government supported the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smail,  and the mills were erected. As the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has 6aid, they have rendered excellent service to the community, and are still' continuing to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smail  emphasized the point that it was absolutely essential, if an undertaking of this character was to be a success, that there should be a population to work upon, who, in some measure, were conversant with the industry. It is generally recognised, that Geelong stands  alone  in that respect, because some of the most up-to date mills in the Commonwealth are established in that centre. That in itself is evidence in support of the wisdom of the Commonwealth establishing their mill there, and, personally, I cannot see any reason why there should be apposition to any extension of a plant which has rendered such good service. I offer no objection to the establishment of other mills, but I desire to remind honorable members of the fact that there is a constant complaint concerning the high cost of clothing. Two yeaTs ago I endeavoured to get the Government to secure the necessary machinery, and I submitted a proposition to the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to enable the mills to be extended so that we could in some small way meet the demand for Australian woollen goods. Those who have seen the mills and their products have admired the work of our Australian operatives. My reason for supporting the Government proposal is that the motion merely provides  for a small addition to an established undertaking which has already proved a great success. Returned soldiers in my electorate, and in a measure throughout Victoria, have recognised the claims of Geelong in this regard, and have collected approximately £67,000 from the "diggers" in order to establish another mill on the Barwon adjacent to mills at present in operation there. The soldiers have been well advised, and I fail to see any reason at all why there should, at this juncture, be any opposition to the proposal of the Government to extend the plant. </para>

                            <para>.- Although Geelong is not in my constituency, I intend to support the proposal for referring the extension of the Geelong Woollen Mills to the Public Works Committee. The extension of woollen manufacture in Australia, wherever it may be, either by the erection of entirely new mills or the extension of existing plants, is an urgent necessity at the present time. I do not think any one  will charge me with being an advocate of what is known as the nationalization of industries. </para>

                                <para>- It is not my intention to discuss the theory of the question, because I have always taken the view that cases of this kind should be judged on their merits. As men of affairs, be we merchants, statesmen, or men in any position of responsibility, if we find that any enterprise in which we are engaged is proving successful, we would probably endeavour to extend its scope. If. on the other hand, we find it proving a failure, our object should be to conserve our resources and cut our losses. Had I been consulted when the proposal for establishing the Commonwealth Woollen Mill at Geelong was first suggested, I probably would have said that I was not in favour of the nationalization of industries, and probably would not have supported it. But it was determined by the wisdom of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that this mill should be established for Defence purposes, and it has proved itself a great success. I listened with great interest to the detailed information concerning sites and conditions given by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> who showed that every precaution was taken by the Commonwealth Government in determining the most suitable locality for ' the . mill. The mill has been in operation for some time, and there is no one in Australia, however strongly opposed to the nationalization of industries, who will not admit thai this Geelong mill has been a distinct success. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> has directed attention to the urgent necessity of increasing the output from the present mill. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. The proposal to increase the production of this exceedingly good cloth, produced by an efficient staff and capable management, is not in any way antagonistic to the establishment of woollen mills anywhere else in Australia. The present plant is the property of the Commonwealth! Government, and has been successfully worked for some years.  Lt  has proved itself capable of supplying at a cheap rate some of the best and cheapest cloth in the world, and it is urged now, for the benefit of returned soldiers and others, that the operations of the mills should be extended. This is a case which should be decided absolutely on its merits, and quite independent of the claims of hundreds of other centres in different parts of Australia. On the merits of the question, it is desirable that this Commonwealth mill should be extended, in the interests of the whole community. </para>

                        <para>I desire to refer to another question closely connected with this, and that is the general extension of woollen manufacture throughout Australia. _ There is nothing in this proposal that is in any way antagonistic to the erection of other mills, and this is a most urgent matter to all of us. I could direct attention to the great advantages for woollen manufacture possessed by some most delightful and charming country towns in the electorate of the Grampians, and could mention such places as Clunes, Maryborough, Kyneton, Stawell, and Daylesford. I am sure, after an inspection of these towns, honorable members would be convinced that they are in every way suitable localities for the erection of woollen mills. </para>

                                <para>- I see no objection to that; but, as a matter of fact, they have not been approached by the Bureau. When the appeal is properly launched, all classes of persons will be asked to contribute. The establishment of a large number of woollen mills in Australia within, say, the next five years is an urgent public need. Where the mills shall be erected will depend on those who subscribe the money for them. If our friends at Jervis Bay, Marrickville, Tamworth, Ballarat, Canberra, or Kooyong desire woollen mills in their particular districts, it is for them to find the capital for them. At Stawell and Daylesford, in the Grampians electorate, they have already gone far in the raising of capital for the erection of local mills, and at Wangaratta, in the Indi electorate, they have raised enough capital for a woollen mill, and have gone a long way towards establishing the business of making woollens. Committees of representative men are now being formed in every State, and the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> will be glad to know that a very strong conwnittee is being formed to make an appeal in Queensland, the State at whose head he formerly was. I hope that within a few days an appeal will be made throughout Australia for capital for the establishment of woollen mills. The difference between the price of wool and the price at which tailors buy cloth for making up into suits of clothes is so appalling that adequate new woollen mills are an urgent need in Australia. They are wanted so that our people may procure cloth more cheaply; that employment may be found for the population; and that there may be a better and more stable demand for our wool. </para>

At Ipswich, a few miles from Brisbane, there is a factory where the best flannel in the world is made, all of it used within the State of Queensland. The Imperial Government asked for supplies of that flannel for the clothing of its troops. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. Why should not the Government help the company to enlarge that mill, so that it could turn out more stuff? Messrs. Cribb and Foote, who are part owners of the mill, also manufacture tweed which is equal to the best in Australia, and from which a suit of clothes can be made for £5 5s. 6d. They supply cloth direct to the consumer, and I do not see why the same thing could not be done in New South Wales and Victoria. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> said that Geelong was the centre of woollen manufacture because of its climate and its water, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> in his report, says that that place is the best for the manufacture of woollens because the drainage is so complete. Now, the Geelong mill is a mile from the Barwon River, and the drainage goes into Corio Bay, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> had not that in his mind when he wrote his report. There are other mills at Ballarat, Castlemaine, Warrnambool, and Collingwood, so that Geelong is not the only place in Victoria where it is possible to manufacture woollens. But although there are so many private mills, they cannot supply the demand. So far as climate is concerned, there is not a better district for woollen manufacturing than that near Brisbane; with the exception of Canberra, which I believe is better. At Ipswich, all the conditions are favorable. A supply of coal sufficient for 100 years exists within a few miles. There is plenty of water, and the mill is close to the main trunk line of the State, with a branch right into its yard. Why does not the Government assist private mill-owners to enlarge their factories, and thus increase their output? At Ipswich, wool is obtainable right on the spot, and truck-loads of it are passing the factory almost every day of the year. There is every convenience for manufacturing, and the proprietors of the mill are, I believe, making a good thing out of it. The Government helps Victoria because the industrial population is leaving Melbourne just as rats leave a sinking ship. </para>

                                <para>- But there must be something wrong with Victoria, having regard to the way in which she is losing population. Various industries established in Victoria are opening branches in New South Wales, where there is plenty of labour, and also an ample supply of coal, which can be obtained there at a cost much below that ruling in this State. In the circumstances, New South Wales must advance. I do not hesitate to say that Victoria's loss of population is due to her inability to obtain the supplies of coal necessary for her industries. </para>

                                <para>- I believe so. Considerations as to the cost of the carriage of fuel to Tasmania told against that State in the selection of a site. The Public Works Committee should be empowered tol report upon suitable sites in the different States. The position has materially changed since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> reported on this subject, and in the circumstances we should enlarge the scope of the Committee's inquiries. I have no wish to destroy Geelong's chance, but every State should have an equal opportunity. I am anxious that the Federal Parliament should meet at Canberra as soon as possible, because of the parochial instinct inherent in every Victorian. Victorians have got into the habit of thinking that their State is the Commonwealth. At one time New South Wales was inclined to regard herself as Australia, but since the Federal Parliament has been meeting here, Victorians have developed the idea that this is the only State in the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will accept the amendm'ent. </para>

                            <para>. -  I would remind the House that the motion submitted by the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> is not for the creation of a new mill, but relates merely to the extension of the existing mill premises at Geelong in order that pressing requirements may be met. If this were a proposal to establish a new mill, I should be solidly opposed to it. I am' glad that the Geelong enterprise has been successful, but I do not approve of the extension of Government-owned institutions of this kind. I would specially emphasize the point that it would be ridiculous to build another mill elsewhere instead of concentrating our efforts on the existing <inline font-style="italic">factory.</inline> Concentration of management will enable this mill at Geelong to more effectively continue and extend its operations. </para>

                        <para>I do not think this discussion ha* been altogether useless, since there has been displayed a praiseworthy enthusiasm for the extension of a local industry - an industry which, above all others, should be enormously developed in Australia. I hope that we shall have very soon some of the oldest established firms in the West of England setting up branches in Australia, and competing with the mills already here. I was surprised at the almost apologetic reference made by the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> to an extension of this industry on the part of Flinders-lane. I hope that Flinders-lane will build a dozen big mills in Victoria, and that, as the result of such competition with the existing factories, we shall be able to obtain woollens at something like reasonable prices. If Flinders-lane does not launch out in this direction. I hope that it will not hold the woollen industry in the future. I am  confident that there will be an abundance of private enterprise in connexion with this industry, and there could be no better field for private enterprise than that which the manufacture of woollens affords. For the present, however, we have to remember that the question before us relates, not to the building of new mills, but merely to the extension of existing premises at Geelong. As to the suggestion that the Public Works Committee should make inquiries all. over the Commonwealth, I would point out that in the future extension of this industry the most effective mills will be those which are erected, where the essentials to success obtain, lt is for experts to determine where those places are. I am opposed to the extension of mills owned by the Commonwealth, and in favour of more competition on the part of private enterprise. </para>

                            it is unnecessary for me to reiterate the arguments advanced by him, but I think it is essential that Commonwealth mills., and, indeed, all our governmental activities should be within Commonwealth territory. One of the constant cries of those who are opposed to the building of the Federal Capital at Canberra is that it is not a paying proposition. By establishing industries at the Capital we shall help to the realization of the national sentiments of Australia. The building up of industries there will attract population, and so enhance the value of property, and, in that way, the Commonwealth will obtain a good return from the Territory.

                            bias said that, by adopting this amendment, we shall, to some extent, curtail the facilities of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills for turning out cloth for returned soldiers and others. I do not think that anything of the kind would result from the carrying of the amendment. The Public Works Committee could make an interim report on the proposed additions to the Geelong mills, and at the same time prosecute its inquiries with the object of discovering the most suitable place in the Federal Territory for the erection of such mills.

                        <para>I do not very often disagree with my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> but I differ from him on the question of centralization. If this huge continent is to have, as we hope it will have in the not far distant future, a population sufficient to enable us to maintain our national ideals in regard to a White Australia and other matters, I undoubtedly say that we must adopt a policy of decentralization. That is the crying need of Australia. There is a general clamour against centralization, and we must so develop our industries as to spread our population over a wider area .than at present. Only by developing the secondary industries alongside the primary ones, so that both classes of industry may work in unison, can we hope to build up a great nation. Reference has been made to the capital that will be invested in woollen mills, and the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> spoke of a great scheme for developing the industry by private capital on a scale in comparison with which the Commonwealth Mills would be a very minor concern. The more the Commonwealth can develop woollen mills of its own, the better it will be for all concerned. God help Australia if it is to be at the mercy of Flinders-lane or York-street, Sydney! Today the people in Flinders-lane and York-street have the whole of the factories of Victoria and New South Wales in the palms of their hands. </para>

                            <para>- I did; but, at the present time, Flinders-lane and York-street are able to dictate terms to the factories, and that is one reason why the manufacture of softgoods is backward. The factories can produce only what the wholesale firms will take; and if they attempt to distribute any of their surplus through other channels than the wholesale houses pressure is brought to bear upon them. Therefore, I repeat that the more the Commonwealth can extend the manufacture of woollens and other goods, the better for the consumer. I support the amendment, and I hope that the Government will not be satisfied with merely spending a few thousand pounds in enlarging the mill at Geelong, but will extend its activities throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the Minister has done well in affording honorable members an opportunity, by means of this Bill, of discussing the vexed question of exchange, not merely as to the valuation of imports for duty purposes, but particularly as to whether the present system has been unfairly penalizing certain countries with which we are trading. As I understand the Bill, apart from the excellent speech delivered by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> - which, as one of the newspapers said, might have been a University lecture - it proposes that when the franc or lira falls 10 per cent. below the mint par rate of exchange, the Minister may refer to the Board of Trade the question of exchange in relation to the computation of duty values. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> announced by interjection that he intends to move an amendment to provide for a reference to the Board when the bank rate of exchange for the currency of any country rises above the mint par rate, in order to meet the circumstances of America and Japan. The only objection I have to the Minister's scheme is in regard to the composition of the Board. This body was constituted originally for the purpose of dealing with certain war matters; and it has now been given a status entirely different from what was first intended. </para>

I do not approve of that system. Members of the Taxation Commission are paid for their services, and if the Board of Trade is doing work in the interests of the Commonwealth its members should be adequately remunerated. The- point I am making, however, is that the workers should have representation on that Board. So long as I remain a member of this House, regardless of which side I may be sitting, on, I shall be opposed to the constitution of a Board in such a way that it is representative of only one interest. The decisions of the Board of Trade in relation to exchange and other matters will be far-reaching in their effect upon the commuliniity </para>

                            <para>- What the honorable member says of the manufacturer I say of the importer, although not in a personal sense. The other sections of the community which I have the honour to represent should be considered when Government Boards -are appointed. I think the proviso to proposed section 157a will safeguard the .manufacturing interests. I know that some honorable members have said that the importers were endeavouring to have this alteration made in the system of calculating exchange, and have argued that if a man bought a hundred pounds' worth of- goods .from France at the present bank rate of exchange, namely, 52. S5 francs to the fi, the value of those goods would be reconverted at the mint par value of 25 francs to the fi, with the result that duty would be paid upon £200 or more. Quite recently, I instanced a case of that sort. I pointed out that there were manufacturers in this country who were suffering on account of -these adverse rates of exchange. Manufacturers in Great Britain were importing silk or other raw materials for the manufacture of neckties, and were then sending out the manufactured articles to Australia. As more than 25 per cent, of the value of these articles had been made in' Great Britain, they were admitted into the Commonwealth at the British preference rate. In other words, these ties were imported into this country J not upon the extraordinary basis which has been adopted of their value for exchange purposes, but upon their value from the stand-point of the pound sterling. The result was that a great many tie factories in Australia were forced to close their doors. I regard the Bill as a step in the right direction. </para>

                            <para>- I approve of the proviso contained in clause 4, which declares that the Board shall not make a recommendation which, if adopted, would, in its opinion, be prejudicial to the manufacture of goods in Australia, or to the sale in Australia of those goods. We have a right to look after the industries of the Commonwealth, and to see that they are not injured. I think, however, that a measure should be submitted to this Parliament for the purpose of constituting the Board of Trade upon a definite basis. Already we have in existence an Inter-state Commission, the establishment of which was mandatory under our Constitution. The Board of Trade, however, has sprung into existence as the result of war conditions, and to-day we are asked under this Bill to vest in it some very large powers. I believe that the functions which we are empowering the Board to discharge will be satisfactorily discharged, but probably they would have been equally well performed by the InterState Commission. </para>

                        <para>.- For some time past I have held fairly strong views upon the subject of the basis upon which the computation of the value for duty of goods imported into this country should be made, and I think it is only just that effect should be given to the alteration which it is now proposed to make in the existing system. Upon previous occasions I have stressed the injustice under which France, Belgium, and  other countries were labouring in consequence of the action taken by our Customs Department. In introducing this Bill yesterday, the Minister for  Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> made one of the most interesting and useful speeches that I have ever heard delivered in this Chamber. After listening attentively to his remarks, I was at length comforted when I discovered that he now takes exactly the same view of this matter as I do. He stated that, in his opinion, the cost of goods in certain countries, even in their own currency, had risen to a grotesque extent. That is the point which I have always borne in mind, and it is that position which will be remedied under this Bill. The measure contains certain safeguards, and does not quite follow the lines which have been laid down by other countries in this connexion. But I am quite prepared to accept it as it stands. Certainly, I shall press for no alteration in it. I quite recognise the position taken up by the Minister when he embodied in the measure certain provisions for the prevention of dumping, and for the maintenance of the Tariff preference which we have granted to goods from Great Britain. The Minister said that he would be unfaithful to the principles in which he believed, and the Government would be unfaithful to the promises it had made, if he were to bring down a Bill which would enable foreign manufacturers to take advantage of the exchange position to dump goods into Australia. Certainly the honorable gentleman cannot be accused of betraying any of his principles in this Bill. The safeguards which are embodied in it are those which one would expect from a Minister who is such a pronounced Protectionist. It is because of these safeguards, and not because of the proposed restrictions upon the basis of calculating the rate of exchange, that the Minister gave to us yesterday a very interesting and informative speech. The position which he set out to establish - and anybody who will take the trouble to read his speech must admit that he made out a fair case - was that if the proposed measure of protection were granted, there would be a possibility that, at some future time, advantage might be taken of the exchange rates to enable goods to be dumped into Australia to the detriment alike of Australian and British manufacturers. In order to establish that fact he dealt very fully with the entire question, of foreign exchange. Anybody who chooses to read what he said in this connexion will be well repaid for his trouble, because one would require to wade through whole tomes of information before he could visualize the position as clearly as it was expressed by the Minister yesterday. With the honorable gentleman's statement I am almost in entire agreement. He emphasized the fact that in dealing with foreign exchanges in relation to their effect upon  the cost of goods in the country of origin, there were four factors which affected the position. These were the depreciation in the currency of that country, heavy importations, cessation of gold settlements, and loss of credit and confidence. The Minister stated that only the first two factors operate directly upon the prices of commodities in their country of origin. Obviously, the depreciation of the currency in any country will have the greatest effect in increasing the cost of production in that country, and there is no doubt that heavy importation will have a corresponding effect. At the same time, I do not altogether agree with the general proposition which he put forward, viz., that the rate of exchange between two countries does not materially affect the cost of production in those countries, if it has not been brought about by the first two factors already mentioned, particularly under present-day conditions. Whilst the honorable gentleman quoted an authority whose statement cannot be questioned - I refer- to Lord Goschen - I would remind him that what that authority wrote was written many years prior to the recent war, and at a time when- certain financial ideas were held - ideas which have since been modified to a very considerable extent. </para>

                            <para>- I think that, as the result of the recent war, all our ideas have been substantially varied. While I do not dispute the theory which underlies the general statement made by the Minister, I do not think that the danger of dumping, in the circumstances described by him, are quite as serious as he suggested. We have to remember that the present position of many countries is a very extraordinary one. Obviously, in all these countries, depreciation is the greatest factor in the whole equation. We must recollect that heavy importation by them obtains to-day, and that it is likely to continue. This question was discussed by the Minister from the standpoint of heavy imports by a debtor nation. I propose, however, to view it rather from the point of view of the type of goods imported. The two outstanding points are those of machinery and raw material, and these are going to operate adversely for a considerable time. While that continues, I cannot think that such a country is going to be placed in a very easy position to produce goods, either at such a price, or in such quantities that we need have any apprehension that the surplus will be disposed of by way of dumping in Australia. As to the cessation of the transfers of gold, which is the position to-day, I think we are all pretty certain that those nations with a depreciated exchange will continue to operate in that way. While that is not such a material factor, it is a very serious one. Wherever gold exports cease altogether, it ever tends to a higher rate of interest within the boundaries of the country concerned. The capital requirements for undertakings are so enormous that they will put a very heavy burden on the whole of their manufactures to carry the rate of interest which is certain to exist for many years to come. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The Minister dealt also with the basis of credit and confidence. This also is going to affect the position very much to-day, for the simple reason that the debtor countries are in such a hopeless position with regard to the credit which they need for many purposes, both internal and external, that they will have a very great difficulty in manufacturing to the full extent they would manufacture were their credit good, and the circumstances more equal. When the output is limited in that way, the whole of the overhead charges will remain high. </para>
                    <para>For all those reasons, I do not think that the Minister need be under any great apprehension with regard to heavy dumping to our own disadvantage, or to the disadvantage of the preference we give to Britain. In the event of such a position arising, however, he has provided safeguards. I am, I think, as good a Protectionist as any in the House, but I do not think we need have the slightest apprehension in accepting this measure with every confidence that any protection we have to-day is going to be maintained, notwithstanding the alteration in the basis of collecting Customs exchange. With regard to the safeguards we are providing - which, as I say, I am quite prepared to accept, though I do not take the same view of the necessity for them that the Minister does - other countries which have taken steps in the same direction, have not felt the same apprehension that Australia has, and have not taken the same precautions to protect themselves. It may be that the Minister sees farther than others; but I merely point out the fact as showing that, apparently, there is not such a great danger as we are led to believe by the honorable gentleman. In America, nothing of the sort has been done. There a committee of commercial lawyers went into the position fully and completely, and that country is simply taking the commercial basis of exchange, as against the mint par rate, and is not providing any such safeguards. New Zealand is in the same position. Consequently, there is some basis for the suggestion that, possibly, we really need not have these provisions; although for my own part, I shall not quarrel with them. I have obtained substantially what I think we ought to have got long ago, and with that I shall be content. </para>
                    <para>There was one point the Minister dealt with to which I think I should refer. I agree with him that a depreciation such as has taken place in Italy during the last few months is to be attributed to want of confidence more than anything else,, and that it is not going to be reflected in the price of goods at the moment; goods under manufacture now will not be affected; but I suggest that the whole general manufacturing position in the future is going to be affected if matters continue on the present basis. Whatever the causes may be that bring the commercial rates of exchange down, Italy is going .to be forced to buy on an adverse basis from every other nation, and. sell on a basis equally adverse. That is undoubtedly going to affect the position very seriously, in the actual cost of production, with which we are particularly concerned. </para>
                    <para>The Minister told us that certain people contend that an appreciated exchange renders trading easier than a depreciated exchange. The Minister said that is not so ; I think that everybody will agree with his view. If the view has been put forward that an appreciated exchange makes it easier to trade, it must have been by somebody with a small conception of the position. It is clear that if a country has an exchange in its favour; it finds it extremely difficult to ship the goods it desires to export to other countries. </para>

                            <para>- It works that way the whole time; I would certainly like to render assistance to the Minister in trying to demonstrate that fact. The assistance or detriment given by appreciated or depreciated exchanges, regulates the relations between the countries concerned. We cannot introduce an artificial measure to regulate the question of appreciated or depreciated exchange, such as the arbitrary and artificial basis of calculation taken by the Customs authorities in the past. But now that we have got rid of that artificial basis, it seems to me that the natural laws should apply to the position, and trade allowed to flow into its natural channels. </para>

                    <para>The Minister yesterday indicated - though not, perhaps, in the words I now use - the contention I have been fighting for for some time, namely, that to-day the goods of all countries, no matter what their currency may be, are all measured by the central currencies when it is a question of purchase for any central State. When we deal with Great Britain, for example, with her trade relations with America on the one hand, and France on the other, the whole thing boils down to what can be bought for £100 sterling ; and the tendency is for trade to go to the country that can give the greatest amount of goods of similar character for £100. The Minister yesterday suggested that very possibly the French manufacturer would bring his home-consumption price up to the point that would give him the same return as America got for the same amount of goods. I think that is extremely probable, but that is a natural law that will adjust exchanges for themselves in the future. If we try to interfere it is almost impossible to see  when  the basis of exchanges is going to come right, and when we shall get back to a normal gold basis with gold flowing freely between countries. Therefore, it seems to me that there is a great deal in the suggestion made- yesterday that if this proposal is to apply to depreciated exchange, why not to appreciated, exchange? So long as the position is that for a certain number of pounds we are going to get a certain supply of goods, but that when the goods - come to Australia that £100 worth of goods must pay two different rates of exchange, we are doing something to stop the natural flow of trade, which is eventually going to regularize exchange. </para>
                    <para>The Minister suggested that if the word " appreciated," as well as the word depreciated," were put in, it would make it impossible for America to trade with Australia; but I do not think that for a moment. The position to-day is that America, with a very appreciated exchange in her favour, is under a handicap; but, in the first place, that handicap flows from the natural results of her trade with the world" for the last few years, by means of which she has been able to consolidate her position. To-day she is paying a certain penalty for that; but it does not seem to me any part of Australia's job to do anything to interfere with the natural laws of exchange to assist any country, be it Japan or America. That is the position in the world to-day; and it seems to me that it ought to be faced.  There  is' the further point that America is not under the same penalty as other countries that at first sight might appear, for the simple reason that she has so consolidated her position that she can create machinery whereby she may trade, and, to a great extent, get over the exchange against her. That is by creating long-dated credits to countries she desires to trade with.  </para>

                            <para>- Is she? That is the very point. I do not take Australia as- one of the great trading countries that need to be helped by America, but the present position in regard to buying goods in America for Australia on terms of cash against documents in Australia appears to me to be significant of her general attitude. The Americans are now trying to induce Australian merchants to establish credits in America, or in Great Britain, against bills drawn on that basis, so that the American banks can take the bills and deal with them as soon as they come into their hands. The reason for that is that most people are rather alive to the fact, to their sorrow, that it is a little difficult to-day to get Australian money in London. The ordinary procedure, in regard to American bills, where it was a case of cash against documents in Australia, was not for America to send the documents back to Australia, and wait to collect here, and remit to America; the American bank probably sold the bills m New York, probably to the agents of an Australian bank in London. ' Today the Australian banks are not in a financial position to buy bills indiscriminately. </para>

                            <para>- I mean any trading bank, including the Commonwealth Bank. T think that the Commonwealth Bank has been one of the big buyers of such bills; but that matter seems very mysterious, and I shall leave it aside. The position is that these American banks cannot take an Australian bill .and get money for it to-morrow, as has been the habit in the past; and for that reason they are not at all enthusiastic about assisting the American trader to do w'hat was the original intention of the bargain entered into. That intention was to pay for the goods in Australia against documents when the goods came to hand. The banks now tell American traders that they must arrange with their Australian customers, against whom they have drawn bills, to establish credits in America or London, so that the bills will bc taken up by their particular banker. To me, personally, that does not seem as though America was very enthusiastically desirous of giving the assistance which I think she could give to-day. America is practically the strongest financial nation in the world to-day. I use the word " practically" because, while I still regard Britain as pre-eminent financially, America Ls to-day the strong financial nation of the world. If the exchanges are against America, she should open these credits and assist in that way, and thus do more than any other country could do to regularize exchanges. If America is going to sit back and take the attitude that she is not going to help - and we have to remember that in the past it has always been Britain that has put through these transactions and helped the whole world in financial matters - she will take her opportunity. T see no reason why in Australia we should do anything to affect the natural position that has come about in favour of any country, be it America, Japan, or any other country. While I have been endeavouring to get this measure introduced I have never contended that preferential treatment should be given' to any country, Belgium or France in" particular, but have merely asked that these countries should get equitable and even consideration with other nations of the world in paying Customs duties in Australia. </para>

As I have already said that I am prepared to accept the measure, I do not propose to take any objection to it owing to the fact that: some uncertainty will inevitably -bo created by reason of the fact that the question of the basis of exchange upon which Customs duties are to be calculated is to be determined by a Board, and may be subject to revision. It is bound to create a certain amount of apprehension in the mind of the merchant, who may have goods on order or on the water purchased, as he imagines, with the basis of exchange at a certain rate, that a  decision  may be given altering that basis. At the same time, the Minister yesterday made out a good enough case from his point of view, with which, as I have said.

                        <para>. -  I join with the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in offering my congratulations to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> upon the exhaustive and informative speech  in  which he introduced this Bill. It certainly showed that he has a full grasp of the importance of this subject, which he handled in a most interesting way. I regret that I did not hear the whole of the speech of the honorable member for Flinders, but I was very pleased to hear his concluding remarks, particularly his reference to the amendment which I suggested yesterday, and which the Minister has now intimated he is prepared to accept. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not propose to enter upon any theoretical discussion on the very interesting subject of exchange so ably dealt with by the Minister.' I content myself with recalling certain outstanding features whii.li are of immediate importance in considering this measure. In the first place we cannot ignore the fact that today the sovereign is of greater value in countries where there is a depreciation of currency than it is in countries where there is an appreciation of currency. That is to say, in the former countries, such as France, Belgium, and Italy, the sovereign to-day can purchase a greater quantity of goods than it can in the latter countries, such as America and Japan. </para>
                    <para>I next recall the fact that the prices of commodities are fixed by the cost of production in the country of manufacture, plus, of course, the element of supply and demand, and that the rate of exchange has practically no effect upon them. That is to say, if we buy goods f.o.b. at any French port, we buy them at the cost of producing them in France, or, if we buy goods at any Italian port, we buy them at the cost of producing them in Italy. The rate of exchange simply represents the selling price of the currency of any country, and is in no way a portion of the price of goods. </para>
                    <para>But there is a further condition which the Minister has to realize. That is, that a country which has a depreciated currency lends itself to dumping. It was the possibility of dumping the Minister had to face so that our industries might not suffer, nor the fundamental principles of our Tariff, which afford protection to our industries, and preferential treatment to the British manufacturer. This danger of dumping is so real and serious that the Minister was obliged to deal with it. If my memory serves me rightly, in 1917 the Customs Department accepted the current rates of exchange rather than the mint par rate, but the result was the creation of th» gravest inconsistencies. Substantial difficulties occurred as regards goods coming from countries where there was a  depreciated exchange, and these coming from other countries, the effect of which was realized about 1917, and the Department was driven to accept only the mint par value. This, by some, might be regarded- as a scientific means of dealing with the situation, but it was not a completely satisfactory method of doing so, because it also' created som« extraordinary anomalies. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> instance, it had the effect, in the case .of countries such as Prance, Italy, and Belgium, of running a 50 per cent, duty up to something like 120 or 130 per cent., and, in other directions, it created anomalies, although, perhaps, they were not so grave or serious as those which were created by the system previously adopted. Of course, in a matter of this kind we were too greatly disturbed by post-war conditions to fully realize the influences that were at work in regard to the operation of our Tariff against our Allies - France, Italy, and Belgium - but on the face of it, by reason of the operation of our Tariff and its apparent harshness, it did appear that we were determined to put an end to our trade with those countries, and to give preferential treatment to America and Japan because of their appreciated currency. No doubt, it was a source of great soreness to the merchants of Belgium, France, and Italy, but it was also of the greatest importance to our own merchants, and in these circumstances also, in view of the anomalies to which I have referred, I welcome this Bill as a real genuine effort on the part of the Government to overcome the complicated conditions that have recently been brought about. The measure lays down the fundamental principles that our Protective policy must not be prejudiced, nor our preferential treatment of British goods, by the operation of exchange. Of course, in such a complicated question it is quite impossible to lay down rigid or hard lines with the intention of dealing with any classes of goods that come under the notice of the Customs Department, and, therefore, it is provided that a Board shall exercise a discretion in the matter, always having regard to the fundamental restrictions laid down in the Bill, to the effect -which I have just mentioned. Fortunately, we have a very able and experienced Board which is capable of dealing with the mat- </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline>

                        ter.  It is instructed to provide the greatest facilities for trading with these other nations so long as a rigid adherence to- our Protective policy is maintained, and our preferential treatment of Britain does not suffer. The Bill provides 'that when the bank rate of exchange of any country is more than 10 per cent, below the mint par rate of exchange, the Minister can refer to the Board the whole question of the basis upon which duty shall be collected upon goods imported into Australia from that . country. I pointed out that it would be a grave mistake to limit the proposal simply to conditions under which the bank rate of exchange would be more than 10 per cent, below the mint par rate, and that the Bill should contemplate the possibility of an enabling power being given to the Board to deal with all cases above or below the mint par rate of exchange. This would mean that if the fundamental principles of Protection and preferential trade were affected by any operations from America or Japan it would be competent for the Board of Trade to deal, through the exercise of this suggested power, with the situation in the same manner as it would deal with operations from a country suffering a depreciated currency. I have no intention of injuring trade operations with America or Japan; but an enabling power should be included in the Bill to provide against contingencies, and particularly so in view of the terms of the American Webb Act. It might not result in any serious alteration of what is taking place at the present time. This appears to be the position. The value of the bank-note in America to-day is about 3.4.4 dollars, as against 4.86 in pre-war days, so that in the United States you have to pay £100 for £73 worth of goods. This is, undoubtedly, a handicap upon the American trader, and, in these circumstances, there is not the same risk of dumping; but we have to bear in mind that America has a valuable trade with Australia, and it is possible that American merchants are prepared to suffer heavy losses for the time being in order to maintain ' their trade, and for like purposes. I am. moreover, inclined to think that while appreciated rates of exchange may obtain in America, there may be a  heavy  slump in the price of goods and

                            <para>big drop in the cost of production of particular lines, which may be dumped in Australia. Therefore, the Board of Trade should have discretionary power to deal with contingencies of this kind as they arise. If the Bill contains a provision of this nature it. will be a warning to American merchants who may desire to trade in that way for their own purposes, and to the detriment of Australian interests. The Minister has not dealt with the important question of revenue. There is no doubt, in view of the condition of the American exchanges, that we have lost a vast sum of money,- so far as the collection of revenue is concerned, but I admit there are difficulties in connexion with that matter. I acknowledge that the Board of Trade i6 an excellent body; but, as the Bill specially provides for the protection of British merchants, I suggest to the Minister that some provision should be made for the representation on the Board of the British Association of Merchants in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. I mention the matter because " preferential trade, so far as Great Britain is concerned, is specifically dealt with in the Bill, and, therefore, I think it would be reasonable if British merchants had representation on the Board, especially as the Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures, as well as certain other business interests, are so represented. However, this is not a point which I desire to press, because I realize' it will be quite competent, having regard to the instructions contained in the Bill, for the Board of Trade to call any evidence it might think necessary to deal with the position. T heartily support the Bill as a genuine effort to solve a very difficult problem. </para>

                        <para>.- I recall when this question was brought before the House about four months ago by my honorable and gallant friend, the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> I very strongly opposed the manner in which the Customs Department was then levying duty upon imports from certain countries, especially France, Belgium, and Italy, our Allies in the late war, and whose currency has been sadly depreciated. I congratulate "the Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> upon the introduction of this measure, which in my judgment is an honest attempt, so far as seems possible,' to do justice to all, having due regard to the protection of our own manufacturers, to British manufacturers, and to the manufacturers and exporters of the countries referred to. I should also like to join with the honorable member for Flinders and the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> in congratulating the Minister on the exceedingly masterly way in which he marshalled his facts, and may I say, upon the statesman-like speech which he delivered. I followed him very closely, and I feel satisfied that the Bill will commend itself to practically every honorable member and to the commercial community as a satisfactory solution of a difficult subject. When this question was before the House on a former occasion I emphasized that the only fair and just principle upon which Customs duties should be levied was the cost of the goods to the Australian importer ; that is to say, if for £100 of Australian' money an importer is able by means of the fortunate or unfortunate condition of the exchanges in certain countries to buy a certain quantity of goods, the amount upon which duty should be levied should be the cost of the goods landed in Australia calculated in Australian money. The Customs authorities, however, by their method of calculating the duty were practically doubling the duty imposed by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The position which is now universally accepted is that the duty on goods which cost the Australian importer £100, irrespective of the rate of exchange, should be on the £100, subject to the safeguards provided in the Bill. The Bill proposes that where there is a depreciation of more than 10 per cent, in the exchange, the question shall be referred to the Board of Trade to decide  whether the amount of duty to be levied shall be calculated upon the bank rate of exchange. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Firstly, that preference shall be given to British  manufacturers,  and secondly that dumping shall be guarded against. I do not know of any one favouring the method based upon the commercial rate of exchange who has the slightest desire to do anything to prejudice preference to British manufacturers, or to favour dumping in any possible way. I believe the Government have acted wisely in introducing this measure, embodying the provisions which guard against dumping into Australia being allowed, and British preference being interfered with. As regards the question of dumping, I am in sympathy with the views expressed by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> ; and I do not think there is any probability of what is known as dumping being attempted by countries suffering from au adverse rate of exchange or a depreciated currency. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly . The dumping we have heard of in the past has generally been practised by rich countries and powerful manufacturers or combinations of manufacturers. It has not been attempted to any appreciable extent by countries suffering from an adverse rate of exchange arising from a depreciated currency. I agree with the Minister, that the Bill will enable the Board of Trade to most effectively protect the manufacturers in Australia from any attempt at what is known as dumping goods, which,' I understand, is deliberately selling goods to consumers in Australia at a lower rate than to other countries in order to injure or to antagonize Australian manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to draw attention to another important aspect of this exchange question, which in reality, at the present time, is largely a question of depreciated paper currencies. These countries suffering from an adverse rate of exchange have been severely commented upon by many critics. It has been implied that blame should be attached to such countries, and it does not seem to be understood that the adverse rate of exchange has arisen in consequence of the financial misfortunes of those countries which were not as rich relatively, perhaps, as other countries, and which perhaps, were in a more exhausted financial condition in consequence of the war. This resulted in their currency becoming more depreciated than that of other countries. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> gave the figures in relation to the exchanges of France, Italy, and Belgium as compared with the rate' of exchange which the "United States of America enjoy. I am not sure whether he explained to the House that, in reality, the adverse rate of exchange is measured by the depreciation of their paper currency. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, there were other explanations, but the main cause of what is termed ian adverse exchange is the depreciation of the currency of a particular country as compared with other countries. What I desire to point out to the House is that the depreciation in currency is not confined to France, Italy, and Belgium, and other countries. The adverse rate of exchange of the United Kingdom as compared with the United States of America is due to the fact that the currency of the United Kingdom is at present practically an entirely paper currency, and is not based upon the value of gold. The values of the paper moneys of France, Italy, and Belgium have now broken away from their former relation to the gold basis; but the United States of America is on a gold basis at present. The value of the paper dollar in America is practically the same in relation to gold as it wa3 before the war, and the paper currency of the United States of America, owing to her much more favorable financial position, has not depreciated at all, or hardly at all. The currency of the United Kingdom is, however, now on a paper basis, and the value of the paper has become, to a certain extent, depreciated, although not to the same extent as that of France, Italy, and Belgium. This is perfectly clear when we consider the British rate of exchange .with America and the market price of gold. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the holder of a £l-note could always obtain a sovereign for it, they were both of equal value, and standard gold could not rise materially above its normal price, namely, £3 17s. 10£d per oz. But when the bank-notes in England and our Commonwealth notes here ceased to be payable on demand, from that moment our £1 sterling became, not a sovereign, but a £l-note. Notes depreciated in value, and more notes had to be given for an ounce of gold. When notes and gold were at par with one another, the owner of notes could always buy gold at practically £3 17s. 10 jd. But because notes have depreciated in relation to gold, the price of gold has advanced beyond that, and the latest quotation for fine gold, as published in this morning's press, is £5 18s. 3d. per ounce - a few days ago it was £6. The difference between fine gold and standard gold is one-twelfth, and on that basis standard gold to-day is worth £5 Ss. 4$d. per oz. It must be understood that the money that is paid in London for that gold is British paper money. The standard value of gold is £3 17s. 10£d. per oz., and the difference between the present market price of gold and its former value of £3 17s. 10 1/2d.  measures the present depreciation of British currency. The actual value of the British note, based on the latest quotations for gold, is about 14s. 4£d. We should, therefore, be perfectly fair and considerate to our Allies in the matter of depreciated currency. The United States of America paper money has not depreciated at all, so that when paper money of Great Britain is exchanged for currency of the United States of America it is exchanging paper money for gold. If we were in London to-day, and had to remit 10,000 dollars to some one in the United States of America, we would have to give a larger number of British notes than formerly. We would have to pay more English money to get an equivalent in dollars, because we would be selling notes worth only 14s. 4jd. to purchase the equivalent of gold coin. </para>
                    <para>I have contended strongly in favour of the import duty being levied on the actual cost of the goods to the importer, regardless of the fluctuations in the rate of exchange. At the same time, I think, the Government are perfectly right in safeguarding British manufacturers, and also in making every possible provision against dumping. I support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Government on having introduced this measure, although, undoubtedly, it is somewhat belated. We must recognise the' enormous decline in the value of money in France, Italy, and Belgium, the loss that is occurring to the Customs Department from the method adopted, and the advantage being given to the United States of America and Japan. I think the position justified the Government in bringing this legislation forward much earlier, because it seems preposterous, in view of the cordial reception given to the French Commission and the protestations then made of our keen regard for the country with which we were allied during the great war, that we should hesitate so long in moving in this direction. It has really meant that, if £100 worth of goods were purchased in Italy, that duty would have to be paid on £300 worth at this end. This Bill will go a long way towards overcoming that difficulty. A good deal has been said and fears have been expressed regarding dumping in Australia; but I cannot see the slightest justification for anything of the kind, at least for many years to come. The Government are justified in providing against dumping, but the fear of anything of the kind arising in connexion with any country outside of America - and 'America, under the old system, was gaining everything- is unjustified. </para>

                            <para>- I have returns showing the exports from Great Britain in 1913 and 1919. In 1913, 13,000,000 yards of cotton-piece goods were exported to Denmark, and, in 1919, 118,000,000 yards, or eight times as much. The quantity sent to Belgium rose from 31,000,000 yards in 1913 to 120,000,000 yards in 1919, and' there was a similar increase in the supply to Sweden and Norway. To Australia, however, Great Britain sent, in 1913, 187,000,000 yards, and, in 1919, only 75,000,000 yards. As for woollen goods, Great Britain exported to Sweden 237,000 yards in 1913, and nearly 7.000,000 yards in 1919; to Norway, 174,000 yards in 1913, and about  7,750,000 yards in 1919; to Denmark, 600,000 yards in 1913, ' and over 14,000,000 yards in 1919; while to Australia there came 9,500,000 yards in 1913, and only 3,100,000 yards in 1919. The business in worsted piece goods was much on the same lines, Australia receiving 6,000,000 yards in 1913, and only 1,400,000 yards in 1919. As for iron and steel, galvanized iron, wire, and other commodities of that kind, our average importation in 1918 was only 30 per cent, of that in 1913. although prices had increased 233 per cent. The figures show the immense demand for British goods in European countries, and how slight is the possibility of dumping in this country. They show, too, the remarkable diminution of our imports. In 1918, our importation of wire-netting was only 4 per cent, of our average annual pre-war importation, though the price, compared with that of 1913, had risen 589 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- During the war, I had to go before the Board once or twice to seek its interest in matters affecting Western Australia, and I was much impressed with the views taken by its members, and with its possibilities of future usefulness. In connexion with the handling of goods, the regulation of trade, and many other matters affecting our commerce, the Board could give the Minister much assistance. I do not think officials should have too much power, because, generally speaking, they are inclined to grab more and more, and to be callous regarding the difficulties and troubles which they create for the public. An official gets a regulation issued, and then insists on its being complied with in its entirety, and to his complete satisfaction, perhaps at the cost of much commercial inconvenience. The Board of Trade might be found very useful in the encouragement of Australian industries in connexion with our trade and commerce laws. This, indeed, should be its chief work. I think that Parliament should have something to say about the constitution of the Board. I do not approve of having two Ministers and two officials as members. </para>

I do not think that the representative of the trade unions could claim to more truly represent the consumers than would any other representative; but, certainly, the trade union organizations should have representation. </para>

                            <para>- I have found that it is advantageous to place responsibility on people. If the trade organizations were represented, there would probably be less criticism from them, because matters could be explained to them by one of their own people who knew both sides  of every question. Now that the creation of a Board of Trade has been proposed, consideration should be given to its constitution and powers, even though it may be intended only to advise the Minister. I think the Minister should tell honorable members generally of the assistance that the Board was to him during the war time. I consider it an exceedingly useful body. </para>

                        <para>.- As this is the first proposal to give statutory recognition to the Board of Trade, I wish to know whether it is intended that the Board shall remain representative of the Ministry, and of the official and commercial classes only; are the workers generally to be absolutely excluded from representation on it? If they are, and there is a change of Government, no one can blame the Labour party should it act on the same principle, and ignore those opposed to it. I have already drawn attention to the fact that the workers are not represented in the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. Three representatives of the workers were invited, and attended the first meeting of the Bureau; but I am given to understand that when they found that there were eighteen other members, they felt that they were not wanted. Whether they were justified in withdrawing I do not know, but it must not be forgotten that some of the workers are very sensitive. Representation should not be given merely as a matter of form. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that that is so; but I unhesitatingly say that the workers are absolutely ignored by the Government in the constitution of these Boards. That is one reason why they have declined to be represented on the Taxation Commission. There are members of the Government who know that I pressed the claim of the workers to be represented on that Commission, and that, but for my action, they would not have been asked to select a representative. The members of the General Council of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry are as follow :  - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and the Director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> E.

The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook)</inline> disputed the correctness of a statement made by me last week that there were no representatives' of the consumers upon the Butter Control Board. Proof of the accuracy of my statement is published in this evening's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> The members of the Board may be consumers, but they are all producers or representatives of the butter agencies. This is the first Bill in which the Board of Trade has been specifically mentioned, and in connexion with which statutory powers are to he conferred upon it, and I therefore avail myself of the opportunity to urge that the workers should be represented upon it. Their representation should be something like equal to that of the commercial classes. The supporters of the Ministry profess to be in favour of the recommendations of the Whitley Commission, and it is difficult, therefore, to understand why, in the constitution of these Boards the representation of the workers is disregarded. Are the Government prepared to call to their aid representatives of trade organizations only when a strike takes place, and when they think they can use them ? If they persist in that attitude they will make a serious mistake. It seems to me that honorable members opposite speak with their tongues in their cheeks when they declare that they are in favour of the recommendations of the Whitley Commission. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope that the Committee will not in this Bill try to constitute a Board of Trade. What we are really proposing, to do is to appoint a Royal Commission for the purposes of this measure. We happened to have at hand a body of gentlemen who had been associated with the Government for some time in an advisory capacity, and who, we thought, would be, for the purposes of this Bill, an excellent body to deliberate upon the facts. After all is said and done, this Board will merely have to marshal the facts - to inform their minds by calling witnesses, if necessary, and getting from them evidence on oath, upon which they may come to a deliberate determination as to the particular matter which is before them. Whatever force the argument of the Leader of the Opposition might have in regard to the constitution of the Board of Trade <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> I fail to see that it has any weight in this instance. </para>

                            <para>- No. In the constitution of the Board of Trade our only desire was to call to our aid men who Ave thought would be best qualified to advise us. It was not a matter of calling to our assistance a representative of this or that industry. Our one object was to enlist the services of men who, in our opinion, were most competent to advise us on the various matters that came before us. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the Central Council of the Bureau  of  Commerce and Industry, of which the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> is a member. In creating that Council, the Government tried to bring together the principal interests of the  country, and they asked that three representatives of trade organizations should be nominated. The Leader of the Opposition does not suggest that one-half of the members of that Council should consist of representatives of the workers. All that he is asking is that the workers shall be represented. The Government gave them representation on that Council. Their representatives ' attended one meeting, and we have not seen them since. </para>

                            <para>- They might have thought they were not wanted, but I do not believe that was a fact. On quite a number of similar bodies created by the Government from time to time, Labour has been given definite representation. But when we came to create the -Wool Pool, the Butter Pool, and the Wheat Pool, it was recognised that the workers as such were not concerned in the actual management of those bodies, as they stood. The Dairy Pool Committee, to which the honorable member has referred, is a body of competent men intimately acquainted with the particular business that they are called upon to discuss. </para>

                            <para>- The Dairy Pool Committee has no more to do with prices than has the honorable member himself. Its sole duty is to carry out in all its ramifications - and they are fairly multitudinous - the contract which it has made. It was necessary, therefore, to have on that Committee men who were associated with the industry, and conversant with all the facts relating to it. Unless they were conversant with all the details of the industry, they would be of no use to us. Thus, the honorable member's argument does not apply to that Board. </para>

                    <para>When the Government created the Board of Trade, it did not clothe it with any statutory authority. We did not give them any executive power. Our object was to bring together a number of men who would be able to advise us from time to time on various subjects which we referred to them. They have  done  a lot of very useful work. No publicity has been given to their operations; they have been working quietly, and have gratuitously rendered us very valuable services. The Government chose the men whom it thought in all the circumstances were best qualified to do' the work in view. I was particularly anxious, as Minister for Trade and Customs, that the whole onus for the decisions under this measure should not be thrown upon me. Not merely for my own sake, but for other reasons, I was anxious 'that a Board should be created for the purpose. The Board of Trade was at hand, and its services, we recognised, would cost us nothing. That, in itself, is an argument that should appeal to the Economy party - and I think we are all members of the Economy party so long as economy is not applied to matters affecting our own electorates. If we had not availed ourselves of the Board of Trade for this particular .purpose, we should have had to create a special body. The Bill would have done no more, I think, than have provided for the appointment of what is practically a Royal Commission, and would have left it to the Governor-General in Council to nominate the members of that Commission. </para>
                    <para>Several honorable members, amongst them, I think, the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> suggested that certain interests should be represented on the Board. I do not think, broadly speaking, that we need to have interests represented upon it. What we require, it seems to me, is to secure the services of men who are capable of forming a sound judgment on the facts submitted to them - men who will know where they can get all the information they want, and be able to determine on the evidence where the truth lies. That is all the Board of Trade will have to do, and that is all that the Bill provides for. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> referred to the advisability of properly constituting a Board of Trade and extending its operations. I believe that such a Board would be able to do very useful work, and the Government are considering the matter at the present time. For the purposes of this Bill, however, I do not think it is necessary for us to constitute a new body. </para>
                    <para>I ask the Committee to accept the Board as it is, and if experience shows that the Board requires strengthening in any direction, the Government will not hesitate to take the necessary action. </para>

                            <para>- It is most unusual for a Bill to refer to a Board which is not in existence under any Statute, or, at least, a regulation. I do not remember anything of the kind having been done before. This Board is merely a departmental body which might cease to be at any time. It has no statutory existence. Thinking that the Board had been constituted under a War Precautions regulation, I intended to point out to the Minister that, as soon as that Act disappeared, the Board would cease to exist. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point I am making. The body referred to in the Bill has no statutory existence or recognition, and, therefore, the Minister is running a degree of risk in making the operation of this Bill dependent upon such a body. This Bill may give rise to litigation, in which event the question of the legality of the Board is bound to arise. Any Board referred to in an Act of Parliament must have some statutory existence. The Board may do excellent advisory work, but a new Government coming into power may have no regard for the Board, and can, by proclamation, or a mere stroke of the pen, immediately revoke  it3  appointment and put an end to its existence. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, for quite a different purpose, and then this measure will be rendered useless. The Board has no greater statutory existence than would a body of two or three departmental officials appointed by the Minister to advise him in regard to a particular proposition. I ask the Minister to further consider the question of properly constituting a Board of Trade. If he does not do that, the Bill will have no effect. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill was drafted in the form in which it now stands in order to overcome that difficulty. I desire the Board in its reference to have the right to review countries which have an appreciated rate of exchange. But the amendment will not achieve the  object  which I have in view, and, therefore, I ask leave to withdraw it. It will be best for the Committee to pass  the clause as it stands, and, if it is found desirable to make any alteration in it, I shall take steps to have the necessary amendment inserted in another place. </para>

                    <para>Mr.RYAN  (West Sydney) [8.15].- I see that Parliament is to have power to disallow any direction, but the amendment is not in the usual form. It is usually provided that such a resolution shall be introduced on notice, given within fifteen days, but here it is proposed that the resolution must be passed within that period. Very often a member is not given an opportunity to move' a resolution disallowing such a direction. </para>

                <para class="block">There was a general power in the Act to exempt Australian shipping, and that power, in our opinion, covered the charges, which, under the Bill, are thrown on the shipping companies. The Government are not prepared to go so far as to pay the whole cost of the upkeep of vessels that may be quarantined. I have seen the ship-owners in reference to the matter, and though they, very naturally in the circumstances, would have liked us to go further than we propose, I think that the amendment will satisfy them fairly well, and meet the main objection which the Sea-Carriage Committee had in mind when the matter was previously discussed. In the amendment we definitely set forth that under certain conditions Australian shipping may be exempted. It was never contemplated, I take it, that under all circumstances vessels undergoing quarantine should be exempted entirely from the cost. At all events, the amendment enables us, under conditions which we think warrant it, to exercise the power to exempt vessels. </para>

When, however, for the purpose of protecting the Commonwealth, it is considered desirable to maintain an internal quarantine, and the charges would weigh unfairly, as during the recent influenza epidemic, on the shipping companies, this power of exemption may be exercised. </para>

                        <para>- It is like the wretched, suspicious mind of the honorable member to make a suggestion which is absolutely contrary to fact. We have not been accustomed to that sort of talk in this Parliament. I hope that honorable members will allow me to put the case as it presented itself to the Select Committee on Sea Carriage, and to illustrate the necessity for some provision of this kind. I do not ask that the. shipping companies shall be exempt from any cost of quarantining, and all that the Select Committee asks is that no cost shall attach to them except that which is reasonable. For instance, during the influenza epidemic which occurred last year, some of the Inter-State ships were put to enormous cost, and if it had not been for the fact that at the time these vessels were controlled by the Commonwealth Government, I am afraid that if the ship-owners had been compelled to observe the severe, and in some respects unjustifiable, conditions forced upon them by the attitude of the States, and not by the Commonwealth Quarantine Department, they would not have maintained a service, but would have laid up  their  vessels. If I had known that this matter was to be brought forward to-night I would have been prepared to give actual instances of the cost of the quarantining of certain vessels. Of course, this cost was really borne by the Commonwealth, because the InterState vessels were then under control, and were running according to a BlueBook schedule of charges, but if the shipowners themselves had been obliged to face it I am afraid vessels would not have run to Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- According to my reading of the Bill the whole question is covered. No absolute direction is given to the Quarantine Department to pay all costs. It is left an open question to the Department to. pay whatever costs the Government deem fair and reasonable. When the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> was referring to the matter, I was under the impression that the provision referred only to the cost of quarantine incurred by the Department, but we should not stop there, because it would not be sufficient to insure the maintenance of a shipping service during the recurrence of another influenza epidemic. </para>

                <para class="block">I have not the figures with me in respect to the very heavy costs certain boats which were quarantined had to meet. As a matter of fact, the actual quarantine costs incurred at the instance of the Quarantine Department were only about 15 per cent, of the total cost to the ships in wages, victualling charges, and coal, and through changes of route, under the direction of the Director of Quarantine, these figures excluding altogether whatever losses were incurred through having to lay up vessels for a considerable period. However, as it appears that the matter is now left open, permitting, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> admits, the whole question 'to be reviewed by the Government, by which so much of the loss sustained by a ship which the Government may deem to be reasonable may be allowed, I think the Committee might very- well accept the Government's proposal. </para>

But the Government cannot force ship-owners to maintain a service if they are suffering heavy losses, and if the owners prefer to tie up their ships rather than meet those losses, it is the people generally who are the sufferers. </para>

                        <para>- A Queensland friend of mine, who was travelling south with his family, was held up in this way and billed for £27. The State Government threatened to sue him, and in his case it was cheaper for him to pay the money rather than travel 700 miles to Brisbane to defend the case. The Government threw up the sponge where people chose to defend themselves against this charge, but those who were willing to pay were allowed to do so. To be fair, we ought to put people travelling overland by train on the same footing as people travelling Inter-State by sea. If no protection is to be afforded to passengers who travel Inter-State by rail, I shall have to vote against this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I have been endeavouring to explain that the Bill throws upon the owners of ships in quarantine, whether passengers are actually landed or not, the same responsibility as if the passengers had been landed; that is to say, they have to find all that is necessary for quarantine purposes. The Sea-carriage Committee brought up an interim report dealing with this particular subject, and when the matter came up for discussion in the House, I promised that, if after studying the question I considered the Act did not go far enough, and did not give us power to exempt owners from quarantine charges in certain circumstances, I would recommit the clause of this Bill, and make the position perfectly clear. That is what I am doing now. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member is right; but, after all, section 59a deals with a comparatively minor matter. At the request of the Sea-carriage Committee I met the ship-owners to see if we could agree as to the method by which the object they had in view could be attained. Naturally, the shipping companies asked for a good deal more than I was prepared to grant. They asked for exemption in regard to the whole of the costs, including the upkeep of a vessel, wages, detention charges, and a number of other matters; but I said I was not prepared to do that, at all events in the Quarantine Bill, although I think it is proper that under certain circumstances such as, for instance, the establishment of strict quarantine for considerations of national safety involving enormously heavy charges upon the shipping companies, which, by law, they would be prevented from getting from the passengers directly at all events, it might be desirable for the Government to have the power of exemption. I said to them that, if it became impossible to ran the vessels under certain conditions which might arise, it would be a matter for consideration by the Administration of the day whether they should take over the ships for the time being, or come to some arrangement in regard to compensation, so that a reasonable service could be maintained. I was not prepared to grant their request <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> This must be a matter for determination by the Government in power- if ever such a set of circumstances arises. I think this is the only fair way in which the position can be met. No doubt, they would have been better pleased if I had agreed to their requests ; but, on the whole, I think they are satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like honorable members to under1 stand the position in which members of the Sea-carriage Committee were placed when this question arose. Evidence from Admiral Clarkson and from representatives of the Steam-ship Owners Federation showed conclusively that enormous charges had been made against vessels placed under quarantine restrictions, in the case of one ship the amount being as much as £1,942 15s. 9d., while in another case, although there was only one passenger on board quarantined, the whole of the quarantine costs were thrown upon the ship-owners. Fortunately, however, later, the vessels were under requisition by the Government, and these charges were ideally met by the Commonwealth out of the Consolidated Revenue. Admiral Clarkson said the charges on ship-owners were excessive, especially in view of the fact that if persons left Melbourne for, say, Queensland or Western Australia, by train, similar quarantine expenses were thrown on individual passengers, and not on the Railway Departments, although the cases were absolutely analogous. It was stated in sworn evidence that if another epidemic occurred the steam-ship companies would lay up their vessels rather than run them under the previous conditions. They contended that they were not responsible for the introduction of epidemics, and as these restrictions were imposed for national protection, it did not seem fair that the entire burden should fall upon one section of the community. When the Quarantine Bill was before the House, we suggested that, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> should now make arrangements for a conference with steam-ship companies, and if possible come to some agreement before another epidemic visited the Commonwealth, and thus secure a reasonable service in the interests of the people. In this amending Bill the Minister seeks power to make arrangements to exempt the steam-ship companies from some portion of any quarantine charges. The Sea-carriage Committee did not suggest that if a vessel were laid up under quarantine regulations, &amp;c, and if the crew had to be paid, the. entire expenditure should be recouped by the Government; but we did say that if any unfair charge imposed upon the shipping companies threatened to result in the laying-up of vessels and the disorganization of coastal trade, some consideration should be shown in regard to those overhead charges which are part and parcel of quarantine expenditure. </para>

                        <para>-Fortunately, for them, only in a few instances, because when they realized what enormous charges were involved they declined to run their vessels, and Admiral Clarkson was appointed to take them over and run them for the Commonwealth. We do not want any controversies in the future in respect of quarantine charges during an epidemic, with vessels tied up, goods lying on our wharfs, and the Minister powerless to do anything until he has consulted Parliament. Unless something is done, the Minister would have to take possession of the vessels, as in the past, and run them under the same arrangement. This did not yield any profit, because the Commonwealth had to pay the expenses of quarantine out of the Consolidated Revenue, with the result that there was a loss of between £150,000 and £200,000, of which somewhere about £20,000 was for quarantine expenses. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Committee did not suggest that, as it is a matter for arrangement between the Government and the ship-owners. We contend that if a vessel was laid up, the crew would be discharged, in which case the vessel would not be earning anything, and the shipping trade would be disorganized. I think it is only fair to place the true position before the Committee, to show that the Select Committee on Sea Carriage did not consider only the interests of the ship-owners, as has been suggested, but the whole community. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer will move an amendment in that direction, I am prepared to support it. It must be remembered that persons placed in quarantine when travelling from overseas or from State to State arc not placed there for their own benefit, but for the protection of every citizen in the Commonwealth. It is only fair to ask the Government to treat those who travel on Government railways in the same manner as they intend to treat those who travel on privately-owned ships. Many are compelled to use our railways for business purposes, in order to save time, and they will be penalized for not travelling on privately-owned vessels. </para>

                        <para>- No. I believe certain portions of Sydney were quarantined. With reference to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page),</inline> I may say that this Bill does not relate to passengers by land bearing any quarantine expenses. The section that he is asking the Committee to amend relates only to the master, owner, or agent of any vessel ordered into quarantine, and the- consequent expenses of which are thrown upon the persons I have named. It does not relate to other expenses; neither is there anything in the Quarantine Act which relates to the expenses of passengers carried by rail. If the amendment was inserted where he suggested it would have no meaning, and I do not know whether it is strictly in order. The reference to the Committed is confined to clause 22, and as that clause deals solely with an amendment of the Act of 1912, I do not think it is in order. </para>

In the case to which he referred, Queensland was visited by an epidemic, and that State established a quarantine station on its borders for the protection of its people. Queensland was in the same relative position as  the Commonwealth would be when it controls quarantine matters for the protection of the whole community. Therefore, a State should be responsible for all the expenses in a case of that nature, and the person to whom he referred should not have been mulcted to the extent of £27. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so; but the charge should not have been imposed, as a quarantine station was established for the benefit of the people of Queensland, and that State should have met the expense as the Commonwealth would have to do in the case of a visitation of an epidemic from outside.

                    <para>.- I desire to speak to this amendment if it is in order, but if it is not it is useless for me to proceed. Passengers by rail are in a very serious position indeed if, in future, they have to pay their own quarantine expenses as they were compelled to do during the influenza epidemic. The only result of making a charge in such cases is the inevitable one that people will endeavour to avoid the expense, and in doing so assist in the dissemination of disease. The position put forward by the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> in regard to a State having to meet its own expenses because it quarantines people on its border has no relevancy in this instance, because epidemics do not regard State borders. I do not think there should be any element of doubt in this matter, as quarantine should be solely under the control of the Commonwealth Government, and entirely removed from State jurisdiction. It is a matter with which the National Parliament should deal. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the amendment should be carried. If the Commonwealth is, at the discretion of the Government, to pay the quarantine expenses of ship-owners, it should also at least pay the quarantine expenses of overland travellers on its railway lines. It has been urged that the payment of quarantine expenses of travellers by land is a State matter; but the Commonwealth, as well as the States, possesses a railway, and should set an example. Yet, during the recent epidemic, it charged 10s. a day to overland travellers, between Western Australia and the eastern States, who were quarantined at Port Augusta. Many who were so quarantined were persons not too well-to-do. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I endeavoured to assist five such persons from New South Wales, who were detained in Melbourne for a considerable time and then quarantined at Port Augusta, where they had to pay to the Commonwealth 10s. a day for their maintenance. Travellers who are quarantined during an epidemic should not have to bear the cost of their maintenance during detention, because they have committed no fault, and are detained merely in the interests of the health of the general community. </para>

                    LAMOND (Illawarra) p9.21]. - The contention that the Commonwealth Government should bear the cost of protecting the community against epidemics is sound, and once it is agreed that the ship-owners should be reimbursed the expense3 of quarantine, the same treatment must  be extended to quarantined passengers. No reason has been alleged for the penalizing of shipowners on whose vessels there is an outbreak of disease.  During an epidemic, travellers call 1103 beard a ship or train until they have submitted themselves to medical examination, and have been declared free from dsease. When the Commonwealth has said to a ship-owner, " Your intending passengers have complied with our requirements, and are apparently .f re; from disease," that shipowner should net have to bear the expenses of quarantine should sickness subsequently occur on his vessel. The present law makes it to the interest of the ship-owner to conceal  suspicious  cases, whereas we should make it to the interest of every one concerned to declare cases of infectious sickness, so that epidemics may be stamped out promptly. What applies to sea travellers must apply to land travellers also. Further, the Commonwealth should have power to prevent the States from acting as they did during the last epidemic, when, their regulations were often farcical. In New South Wales, a cordon was drawn across a road, and through it any person riding an ordinary bicycle could pass, but those travelling in a motor car were stopped, as being possibly infectious. Again, a person was allowed to' go without question to a town a mile within the cordon, but was interfered with if he proposed to go to some place not so far .away. I am not satisfied with the explanation of the Minister that State interference can be prevented by the issue of a proclamation. Evidently the honorable member for West Sydney

                    anticipates that there will be a great deal of discussion in the Law Courts as to the legality of such a step.

                    <para>.- We did not get much information from the two members of the Sea Carriage Committee who have spoken. Apparently, the Committee has examined ship-owners, and has not bothered to get the opinions of the travelling public. It recommends the protection of the shipping companies, but pays no regard to those who travel by sea. When men or women are quarantined, and thus prevented from following their usual occupantions, as well as being kept away from their homes, they should at least be maintained at the expense of the Government. We have been told that the shipping companies have lost £20,000 in quarantine expenses; but I have not heard of any of them going insolvent. If they had to pay £20,000 in quarantine expenses, they have passed that expenditure on to the public by increasing fares and freights. </para>

                        <para>- They have not now the power, and we do not want to give them the power to do that. My view is that the Commonwealth should bear the cost of quarantine. That would mean that the whole public would contribute to it, whereas, if the steam-ship companies were required to pay it, and were allowed to pass it on, the merchants who were consequently called on to pay higher freights in respect of their seaborne goods would add those increased freights to the cost, and secure a profit of, say, 10 per cent. upon it. The retailers, to whom they sold, would in turn put on another 15 or 20 per cent., and the public would have to pay. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said anything against the honorable member's proposition. I agree with the amendment, and I hope that the Government can see their wav to give effect to it. The cost of any action taken for the benefit of the whole community should be borne by the Government. The shipping companies would not object if they were ordered to bear all these costs of quarantine, and were allowed to reimburse themselves by charging additional freights and fares. The public, however, would have to pay, not only the higher freights, but a profit on the added cost of the goods carried in such circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- Then why should my honorable friend suggest that the Select Committee on Sea Carriage, of which I am a member, has studied the matter from only one point of view? We took all the available evidence on the question, and expect the House to deal with our report in a reasonable way. I have held from the first that this is the most economical course to pursue, and that by adopting it we would not run any risk of having our shipping suddenly held up, and the whole trade of the Commonwealth disorganized, because of failure on our part to calmly consider the whole question now and to provide against such a contingency. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather pleased that the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is not giving, by means of his amendment, everything for which the steam-ship companies ask. When I read the interim report of the Select Committee on Sea Carriage, I formed the opinion that, if it had been prepared by the directors of the steamship companies, it could not have been more in their interests. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster),</inline> in reply to an interjection that I made to that effect, said that I had a suspicious mind. I do not think that I have; but my experience as a member of this House is that we can always depend on the honorable member and the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> to support the demands of any company that comesalong. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> in moving the second reading of this Bill last night, informed the House that it was far more liberal than the measure now on the statute-book. If I were asked to choose between the two, I should prefer the existing Act. This Bill is certainly not more liberal than the existing Act, since it  takes  away the papers of many persons now naturalized. During the recent war, men were interned who had received their naturalization papers more than twenty years before, and had not a stain on their character. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">That was by no means an uncommon occurrence. I have no doubt that the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt),</inline> the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> and other representatives of electorates in which there is a considerable German settlement, could cite many cases of the kind. Among those who interviewed me on the subject was a man whose naturalization papers were signed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Madden as  Deputy  Governor of Victoria many years ago, while other internees held papers signed by State Governors, who had long since passed away. Some of these people who were prevented from obtaining a living asked to be interned in order that their wives and families might receive sustenance. The Bill which we are now asked to pass practically makes permanent the practice then indulged in by the Government. Under clause 3, the Naturalization Act 1903-1917 is repealed, but it is provided that - </para>

He is as good a citizen of Australia as is any member of the House, and his loyalty has never been questioned, but he was not naturalized until long after the outbreak of war, because he was under the impression that his naturalization followed naturally upon that of his father. Sub-clause 2 of clause 5 says that a child whose name is included in the certificate granted to his parents shall be deemed to be naturalized, but what happens if his name does not appear on the parents' certificate ? </para>

                            <para>- By another clause a person who has been in gaol is debarred for all time. Apparently his imprisonment is not to be a sufficient punishment for his offence. I thought that when a man had suffered the punishment imposed by the law for a particular offence, he had purged his guilt, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> told us a few days ago that he did not believe in pursuing a life-long vendetta and hounding a person to his grave. Honorable members who cast their minds back for about twenty-five years will recollect that when the Boers decided to impose a residential qualification upon Britishers going to South Africa, the people who were after the gold of the Rand made a fuss, and Britain went to war with the Boer Republics. Many of us opposed that war, because we thought then, as I think now, that it was engineered by persons who desired to get control of the gold mines of the Rand. The Boers decided that a person should be resident in South Africa for three years before being granted a certificate of naturalization. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Starr-</inline> Jameson, of raid fame, was one of those who contended that the period should be only six months. </para>

                            <para>- I take it, however, that the Government will not provide legal assistance for a man in such a position. ' According to clause 13, when a certificate of naturalization is revoked, the Governor-General may direct that the wife and minor children of the person affected shall cease to be British subjects, and any such persons shall thereupon become aliens, but that, except where such a direction is given, the wife and children shall remain British subjects. Many persons during the war were interned and subsequently deported, and in the case of a married man, his wife had to decide whether she would remain in Australia, and fight out the battle of life for herself . and children, or accompany her husband. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but the Bill makes it lawful for the wife, within six months after the date of the revocation, to make a declaration of alienage. She may say whether she prefers to remain here or accompany her husband. In the case of deportations in the past, many of the wives would have preferred to remain here, but decided if their naturalized husbands were sent away, to go also to a land quite foreign to themselves and their children. Naturalization papers were taken away from people who had been interned for no crime at all. In my opinion, this is " panic" legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot agree with the Minister on that point. The power which he possesses at present to revoke naturalization certificates is given to him under the War Precautions Act, and not under a Statute agreed to by this Parliament. However, it is hopeless to have the Bill amended to make it more acceptable. We had an illustration last night of the futility of submitting amendments when honorable members opposite had the numbers to support the Government to retain in a Bill a fine of £100, or imprisonment for six months, for the offence of travelling without a passport, even though the offender might be only sixteen years of age. I think that this Bill will operate harshly on a number of people we profess to be anxious to help. However, I hope the time will come in Australia when we shall realize the errors of the past and adopt more humane legislation in regard to naturalization. </para>

                        <para>.- This is a very important Bill. I was sorry to hear the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> say, although he said it very politely, that he hoped it would not be amended, an intimation, I suppose, on his part, that he did not propose as a representative of the Government to agree to any amendment unless it was forced upon him by the House. However, as the measure is one that ought to be amended, I propose to move certain amendments. Apparently the Government have slavishly followed the precedent of the British Naturalization Act. In fact, every time this question is under consideration here we are coolly told that, because of international complications which might possibly arise, our discretion in this matter is limited by what has already been done by the Imperial Parliament. On every occasion when I have had the opportunity of doing so, I have either moved for a liberalization of the law in this regard, or urged it upon the Government, and it is rather curious that, while we follow with almost  literal accuracy the precedent set by the British Legislature, we insist at the same time upon our rights as a Commonwealth to grant or withhold certificates of naturalization. It is significant that at this time in our history Australia is insisting upon its right as a nation. It is even to be remarked of those who worship the fetish of Imperialism that they are claiming, in connexion with the League of Nations and our diplomatic representation in other countries, a status for Australia scarcely less than that of an independent nation. It will be remembered that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> at the Peace Conference, insisted that Australia should be a signatory to the Treaty, although, of course, for the purposes of peace and war the Empire was but one. And the fact that, as a. Commonwealth, we were signatories to the Peace Treaty is one reason, and a very strong reason, why the adoption of the Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations has been so displeasing to a very large section of the American public. ' While, on the one hand, the Imperialist is urging the status of Australia' as a free nation, and, on the other, the true Australian asserts, for different reasons and other motives, the standing of Australia as a practically independent nation, nevertheless in connexion with this matter of natura.1lization we are simply adopting as a schedule to the Bill one large section of the Imperial Naturalization Act, and adopting it in a single clause. </para>

                    <para>The first matter of principle to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention is the status of women, because it is in that regard that a great deal of dissatisfaction and indignation have been engendered among the people of this country, and particularly, of course, among the women of the Commonwealth. While the status of women has been generally improved in all enlightened communities, including Australia, while in regard to her rights to make contracts and to own property she now enjoys privileges equal to those possessed by the mere man, it is worthy of note that in connexion with naturalization we are still pursuing the antiquated policy of bracketing her with lunatics and idiots, as in the definitions contained in this Bill. The fact is, there is no logical reason for that at all. It is not just, and it is not logical. I. remember, of course, </para>

                            <para>somewhat facetious observation by the predecessor of the present Minister for Home and Territories, that there were certain real, objections to having two nationalities in the one house. As a matter of fact, there is no substantial objection at alL Indeed, tire Bill  recognises  the possibility of two nationalities*, because in a certain limited number of cases it admits the right of the woman to retain a nationality different from that of her husband. It is erroneously assumed as a settled principle that the nationality of the wife necessarily follows, and is, that of the husband. It is not too. much to say that that is so, but with a large number of exceptions, which are well worthy of consideration, ' and, in my opinion, worthy of imitation. For instance, in the great Republic of the United States of America the rule seems to be that a native-born woman marrying a foreigner retains her nationality, while, on the other hand, a foreign woman marrying a citizen of the United States of America becomes a citizen of the Republic. </para>

                            <para>- I do not, of course, know what is the view of the Government of a foreign woman's country of origin, but that is a matter upon which I shall have something to say a little later. In Ecuador the nationality of a married woman remains while she lives in that country, and in Venezuela and Hayti a native married woman retains her nationality in all circumstances. Under one clause of this Bill there is provision that where a certificate of nationalization has been revoked the Governor-General may by order direct the wife and minor children, or any of them, of the person whose certificate has been <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> revoked to cease to be British subjects. Such persons shall thereupon become aliens. Except . where the Governor-General makes such a direction, the nationality of the wife and children of the person denaturalized will not be affected by the revocation in the case of British subjects. A further clause in the Bill dealing with the position of women provides for the case o'f an alien of a country in a state of war with  His  Majesty. Where the wife was at birth a British subject, she may make a declaration that she desires to resume her British nationality! That is in the case of an alien losing his nationality, whether he wills it or not, by reason of the fact that the country in which he was born is at war with Great Britain, in which case the wife may, on the recommendation of the Governor-General, be granted a certificate of naturalization. </para>

                    <para>The Bill makes some advance in one particular - it liberalizes the existing law to the extent that in Australia we are to recognise a certificate of naturalization granted by a Minister representing the Imperial Government, and that is something which we have never done before. We were isolated, so far as naturalization laws were concerned, and the most recent case in point was the notorious Jerger case, where it was established beyond all doubt that Father Jerger was a naturalized British subject, according to the Imperial law, but where it was not established that he had become a naturalized subject according to the Australian law. </para>

I can, of course, understand the Minister's interest in this matter. We have taken a curious step in this Bill in that we have increased the period of residence necessary in this country from two to five years; and I regard that as a retrograde movement. We are supposed to encourage the white races of the world to come to this oountry. W'e are known to he in dire need of increased population in the Commonwealth. We claim to he willing to. open our doors to any respectable member of the white races of the world who is willing to come here, adopt our mode of living, and submit to our laws. Notwithstanding this, we are, telling the world that if a foreigner desires to come to Australia, he has to reside here at least five years before he can receive the rights, precarious as they are, incidental to naturalization. </para>

                            <para>- That is altogether immaterial to my argument, which is directed to the case of those desirable immigrants who may wish to come to Australia from foreign lands. If the Minister would take the responsibility of saying that we do not want foreigners in' this country, I would be enlightened to hear such a declaration of opinion. But when we remember that this refers to non-English-speaking people, and even to English-speaking foreigners such as Americans, I would join issue in any such declaration, and say that we do want reputable persons from all the white races of the world who are ready to come here and populate this country of ours. If the Minister depends for the successful peopling of this country upon those who are representatives of the British race alone, we are looking forward to many decades of insufficient population in the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>Mr.RYAN (West Sydney) [10.62].- I ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> if he can explain the reason for the Lan'd Ordinance of 1919, which prohibits transactions of any nature whatever in real property in German New Guinea? The matter has been brought under my notice by residents of those parts, who are at a loss to know the need for  prohibiting transactions in  real property between British subjects, whatever may be the law applied to  foreigners.  I, too, am unable to see why such an Ordinance should be in force. It must cause great inconvenience. If the right honorable gentleman cannot answer my question to-night, I hope that he will give me the assurance that he  will  answer it at the earliest moment possible. </para>
