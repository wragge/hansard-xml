                        <para>- The matter is a little complicated, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers is absent from the Commonwealth, and I do not know, officially, when he will return, nor am I aware whether he is prepared to continue as  Deputy President  of the Court. I am also unaware of the date on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins proposes to resign. The appointment of new Justices is materially affected by those facts. The Government is considering how. many new Justices will be required, and when it is able to satisfy itself on the two points to which I have referred, it will immediately make the appointments necessary, whether one or two. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is a fact that sugar can bc obtained in Sydney in the manner stated, because the last advice from that place was that we are 1,800 tons short on deliveries of orders there. As I have said repeatedly, as soon as we have in Australia a sufficient quantity of white sugar, which will be within a few days now, all orders will be delivered to the full extent. </para>

                    <para>I may add, for the honorable member&#39;s information, that the despatch of all trophies to towns in Queensland has hitherto been held up pending the acceptance by the Queensland Government of responsibility for transport changes after the trophies have been placed on board at Melbourne or Sydney, where they are now stored. The Queensland Government has now accepted responsibility, but has asked that ali trophies go forward in one consignment. The Premier has been asked to agree to monthly consignments, in order that the trophies may reach allottees promptly, instead of being held up until the final allotment has been made, as would be necessary if the trophies are to go forward in one consignment. </para>

                <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a little Bill, of only one clause, with which I hope it will not take the House many minutes to deal. There is practical agreement on all sides as to the advisability of the proposed reform, which may be a little one to us, but is a big one to the poor, unfortunate blind people. Under the circumstances, the measure might well be passed without debate. It is a proposal to permit a blind pensioner to earn an amount which, together with his pension, will give him the basic wage as determined from time to time in any State, including the rate now paid in New South Wales, namely, &#163;4 5s. per week. </para>
                <para>There is a distinction between these blind people and other pensioners, as shown by the fact of their being pensioners, who are more or less physically disabled, and are not able to stand up against the stress ana strain of life as other sections of the community are. I am particularly referring to those pensioners who may, in some sense, be considered as alongside the blind people - those who are pensioners because of some disease or other from which they suffer. The blind pensioners on the other hand, are healthy people who can and do marry, and have families. The marriage - of these people ought to be encouraged in a country like this, if we are to increase our population. They da all the other things that normal men always do - indeed, they have no disability but their blindness. That furnishes a reason, I think, for treating them in a category by themselves. There are only about 400 of these blind people in the whole Commonwealth, and only about 100 of these are in the various Institutions of the States. Altogether, it seems to me that this is a concession which they well deserve. It will cost in a full year about &#163;15,000. and it will come to them as a nice little Christmas box. I ask honorable members to pass the Bill without delay. </para>

                    <para>.- I an- pleased that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> has seen his way clear to introduce this Bill, which, no doubt, will, to an extent, relieve the disabilities under which some of the old-age and invalid pensioners suffer. I am sorry that the right honorable gentleman has not made &#34;the Bill wider; but I know he stipulated that he would not introduce the measure unless it was confined to this particular matter. For that reason, I do not propose to transgress in any way on the understanding, which, at all events, he had in his mind when he introduced the Bill&#39;. But I should like a little information in regard to one portion of the measure. I should like to know whether the amount that is not to be exceeded is to be the amount here mentioned as &#163;221 per annum, or such other amount as is declared by any Act, or by any authority constituted under an Act, to be a basic wage for the portion of the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides. Will this Bill enable the total amount of the wage to be raised to the amount of the basic wage, as recommended in the report of the Royal Commission, which is now in the hands of the Government ? </para>

I do not do so with any desire to embarrass the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> but because, according to clause 3, the wage is fixed at a sum not exceeding &#163;221 per annum, &#34; or such other amount as is declared by any Act, or by any authority constituted under an Act, to be a basic wage for the portion of the Commonwealth in which the pensioner resides.&#34; </para>

                    <para>The Government is therefore appointing a Royal Commission to inquire into the cost of living in relation to the minimum or basic wage. The Commission will be fully clothed with power to ascertain what is a fair basic wage, and how much the purchasing power of the sovereign has been depreciated during the war, and also how the basic wage may be adjusted to the purchasing power of the sovereign, and the best means when once it is adjusted of automatically adjusting it to the rise and fall of the sovereign. The &#39;Government will, at the earliest date possible, create effective machinery to give effect to these principles. </para>

                <para class="block">If I aim rightly informed, the Treasurer is aware that the Royal Commission has made its report; we have been told so by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I do not know whether I am correct,, but I believe that the amount recommended by the Commission is as high as &#163;5 16s. If that be so, why should we to-day - the very day on which the report is presented - give our imprimatur to the amount of &#163;221 ? The matter may not strike some honorable members as it strikes me, but, seeing that the Government have the report in their hands, and that it is available for the Treasurer to  see,  would it not be much better, instead of fixing the amount at &#163;221 - which means the New South Wales basic wage of &#163;4 5s. per week - to provide that it shall be the amount recommended by the Royal Commission on the basic wage  ? </para>

I understand that the contention of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> is that, although &#163;221 is the standard wage at the present time, at some future time when we may be dealing with the basic wage, we may be accused of having given only &#163;221 to the blind. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney merely put a question to the Treasurer in order that his vote to-day might not be used against him later on. When the Treasurer was in Opposition he used every endeavour to corner the Government on matters similar to this, and I think the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was acting quite within his province in the query he submitted. At any rate, he was quite right in contending that the fact that &#163;221 is set down in this Bill as the standard wage to-day should not be binding upon us when later on we come to deal with the basic wage. </para>

                <para class="block">That this Bill be now read a second time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JAMES</inline> PAGE (Maranoa) &#91;3.40&#93;. - I am sure that the Government have made a very serious mistake in introducing this measure as an Immigration Bill. It is really an Immigration Restriction Bill. Every amendment of the principal Act which it proposes imposes some restriction upon immigration. Under this Bill a person may be suffering from any disease whatever, but so long as he pays a first-class passage he can came to Australia; while persons who desire to come here under the provisions of this so-called Immigration Bill must undergo a medical examination by an officer of the Commonwealth at the port of embarkation, and must answer a series of questions, some of which are outrageous. An intending immigrant, for instance, may be asked whether he has been insane within the last five years, or whether he has twice been insane during that period. I have never heard that any one who has been insane is willing to admit it after he has recovered. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and a man might be forgiven for thinking that the Minister who could propose that an intending immigrant should be asked such a question must himself be insane. Honorable members will need to be very careful in the consideration of this Bill: We have recently been at war with several European countries, and the subjects of those countries are to be excluded from the benefits of this measure for twenty years, which practically amounts to the exclusion from Australia of subjects of those countries who are yet unborn. Sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge</inline> of clause 3 provides that the following persons may be excluded from the benefits of this measure - </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the matter only incidentally. If people of these countries are well conducted and of good character, why should we not admit them ? Every other country in the world admits such people, and why should Australia be the only country to exclude immigrants of alien nationality? In England to-day such people are admitted, and England also permits trading with them. </para>

                            <para>- What I am most concerned about is that we should get back t&#60;5 normal conditions as soon as possible. I remind the Government that in the Aliens Immigration Restriction Act they have all the powers that are necessary to enable them to exclude any undesirable person from Australia. Why such powers should be provided for in an Immigration Bill is beyond me. Under the Bill it is proposed that the Minister may appoint a Board to determine whether certain persons who were not born in Australia shall be deported from the Commonwealth. From the decision of this Tribunal there is to be no appeal. From my own knowledge of Boards that have been appointed by other Governments, I say, &#34; God help the man who hopes to get justice from the Tribunal which is here proposed ! &#34; The Board will merely reflect the views of the Minister. I should like to know whether it will sit openly as a Court, or whether it will adopt star chamber methods. Its proceedings most certainly ought to be open to the public. In Committee, I shall do my best to insure that an accused person may be afforded an opportunity of cross-examining his accusers and of being properly defended. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. We do not want in Australia people who have either unhealthy bodies or unhealthy minds. The result of admitting the latter class might be to subvert our government. I cannot understand how the honorable member for Maranoa can consistently oppose the proposals which are embodied in this Bill. I quite agree that the measure is chiefly one for consideration in Committee. But there are one or two matters connected with it to which I desire to direct attention. I think that some definite meaning should attach to every clause in an Act of Parliament. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 3 of the Bill, it is proposed to amend section 3 of the principal Act by inserting after paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge</inline> the following paragraph: - <inline font-style="italic">(gd)</inline> any person who advocates the overthrow, by force, or by violence, of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">One can understand the use of those words, because they are very definite. Any person who advocates the things mentioned in that paragraph ought to be regarded as an undersirable immigrant, and ought to be excluded from the Commonwealth. But my objection is to the inclusion of the words immediately following, namely, &#34; or who is opposed to organized government.&#34; I cannot support the retention of such words in a Bill of this character. There are many persons who come into the country, and who are known as &#34; philosophic anarchists &#34; - men who do not believe in any form of government whatever. If they hold these views, the Bill provides that they are to be kept out of Australia. But it will first be necessary to ascertain who they are. I can quite understand the exclusion of persona who advocate a certain course of action which is detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth. But it would be absolutely futile to attempt to deal with people who hold theoretical views in regard to forms of government. In Committee, therefore, I shall move for the exclusion of those words. I think that clause . 7 of the Bill is also capable of amendment, but I shall not deal with that matter now. </para>

                            <para>- We should absolutely prohibit the introduction of undesirables. I go all the way with the Government in that matter. If honorable members will take the trouble to read the up-to-date history of the United States, they will find that American writers are pointing out that the influx of undesirables into the country during the past twenty-five years is creating a difficulty quite as formidable as is the negro question there. Whilst the. immigration to the United States for many years was of a desirable class, it is recognised by all American students and writers that, during the past quarter of a century at least, there has been an immigration into that country of a class which is wholly undesirable. We do not want that class here. I go farther and say to any person who is not satisfied with this country, &#34; There is an open world before you.&#34; Even at the risk of being misunderstood, I think that we are too severe upon the Germans here. I have always understood that when a war was over the British race regarded it as a thing of the past. Take any two ordinary Britishers, whether they be English, Irish, Scotch, Canadians, or Australians, and if they have a fight it will not be later than the second Saturday when one of them will say to the other, &#34; Well, old fellow, it was a good &#39; go.&#39; Come and have a drink.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We must have immigration in Australia. There is no question about that. The figures concerning the position in the far north are startling. If we draw a line from Cairns across Queensland to the Northern Territory and Western Australia, we would find that there had been an absolute decrease of from 25,000 to 30,000 white people since Federation in the very localities that constitute the weakest spot in our armour. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> say the other day that immigration was to be one of the foremost planks in the new Government policy; but I make the reservation that we must be extremely careful not to admit to this country people who are likely to be a source of danger to it. After such a war as that through which we have passed there is likely to be an exodus of undesirables from the underworld of Europe, and it is only reasonable to provide against their entry into Australia. There is not one clause in the Bill that I regard as too stringent in this respect. We can breed quite enough criminals of our own without allowing undesirables from abroad to enter the Commonwealth. I hope the Government policy in this matter will be rigorously enforced. </para>

These words are only so many placards intended to alarm some people, and to induce support for the measure. They are not necessary at all. Will the Minister affirm that we have no law to deal with any person who attempts the assassination of any public official or, indeed, anybody else? We have the Crimes Act, and a number of other Acts, to meet every situation that may arise. This Bill is merely a duplication of existing legislation ; it is merely an advertisement suggesting that we have been neglecting to take these reasonable precautions in former legislation, and that the country is open to the ravages of the worst classes of individual to be found. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, or deported. It might happen, if this Sill becomes law, that if a man says anything about those in power, his words will be construed as opposed to organized government, and he might be deported. I agree with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> that the outstanding trait of the British character is a desire to shake hands with an enemy after a fight. There may be many undesirables in Germany and Austria, just as there are undesirables in Australia; but because of this are we going to declare, in respect of the 70,000,000 people in Germany, that simply because they happen to be of German origin they are to be regarded as undesirables, so far as our immigration policy is concerned? What would have been the result if this policy had been adopted with respect to the Boers? The first Boer War was fought with great bitterness, particularly on the part of the Dutch in. South Africa, but after the second war the British Government magnanimously extended to the South African Republics a full measure of constitutional liberty, with the result that to-day one of the greatest champions of the British Empire is General Smuts, and some of the most stalwart upholders of British law are to be found amongst the conquered Boers. I am not saying that we should find just that kind of feeling amongst the people of Germany to-day; but 1 believe thousands of Germans would be glad to get away from their own country, and, if permitted to come to Australia, would prove very desirable citizens. It is better to have those people here, and to make them good fellow citizens, so that some day, if it should be necessary, they might help us to defend their adopted country . It is better, too, to have them here rather than &#39;that our great spaces should remain empty. S&#39;ome of our most successful settlers, whose work has provided fine object lessons to all, are those who came here from Germany, or are of German origin. True, some of them allowed their racial feelings to get the better of their discretion during the war. But are we to remember that against them for all time? What did our soldiers do with their German enemies whom they took prisoner in the very heat of the fiercest days of the war, when it even seemed that the tide had turned against us ? Did our troops adopt any such policy of hostility as is displayed in this measure? It has been recorded over and over again that, even in those worst days, our boys would take their prisoners back behind the lines, and dispense their own comforts among them. They called them &#34; Fritz,&#34; and gave them cigarettes. If our soldiers were prepared to fraternize in the midst of war, why should not the Government display a little of that same spirit now that the war is over, and we are on the right side of it? This measure is, with- out doubt, ari Immigration Restriction Bill. It ought not to have been given the title, &#34; Immigration Bill.&#34; Indications at present are that, as an outcome of the Geneva Conference, the Germans will be admitted to the League of Nations. Even if such should not be the case, I venture to predict that, before two years have passed, Germany will be represented in the League. I sincerely hope so, for the safety and wellbeing of the world. What do the Government say in their Bill, however? For five years they propose to exclude all Germans, and Austrians, and Turks, and Bulgarians. What will be the feeling of the world at large five years hence if all that we hope for from the League of Nations has been brought about, and our former enemies are firmly at peace with us? Why should we shut our doors for so. long to desirable classes of new citizens? Should we not throw our doors open wide to the type of people we want ? I do not .advocate for one moment that we should offer a welcome to the offscourings  of the world. In the United States of America, numbers of undesirables have undoubtedly found their homes there; and the same may be said, to a large extent, of Britain. It was written of London, before the war, that the heart of the Empire had become a sanctuary for all the disaffected people of Europe; They had had to flee from their own country because they did not believe in the system of government existing there. </para>

                            <para>- They were. Reviewing legislation of this sort, one would think we were still in the midst of the great conflict, and had no knowledge of what its end might be. I do not see the necessity for this Bill. We have laws to deal with every class of offence mentioned therein. We complain every week of the costly growth of Federal . Departments; but if we pass unnecessary legislation, we assist in building up Departments still higher. If, with our present laws, we are adequately safeguarded, why should the Government introduce this Bill? It only supplies more work for more officials, and adds to the size and expense of one or other of the Federal Departments. Do the Government know or fear that people are actually endeavouring to get into this country with the object of assassinating the Ministry, or in the hope of over throwing the present form of government? If they  have  reason to expect, anything of the sort, have we not already enough&#39; laws to cope with the menace? I realize that Australia would be just as safe if this measure did not become law. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his seat, and other honorable members who preceded him, have regarded this Bill as of a restrictive character rather than one to encourage immigration ; but I take it that it would be a very difficult matter for this, or any other Government, to frame a Bill which would be the means of increasing the number of immigrants coming to Australia. It is true that we need men and women in Australia, but we require men and women of the right type, and they can only be secured by reserving to ourselves the right to say who shall be admitted. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> in a speech a few days ago, compared the results in America with those of Australia, and quoted figures to show how the United States of America had increased her population on an average of 1,000,000 a year for some considerable time past. The honorable member, however, overlooked the fact that emigration to America has been carried out almost entirely by individuals or corporations, and the two principal agents were the shipping companies, on one hand, and the railway companies on the other. These commercial organizations had not the interests of America at heart, and simply endeavoured to get the largest possible number in order to benefit their shareholders. The railway companies were anxious to secure the services of men for construction work as cheaply as possible, and nowhere else could they be more easily obtained than in the crowded cities of Europe. The companies sent their agents to Europe to obtain men, many of whom were of a highly undesirable type. On the other hand, the steam-ship companies merely sought to fill their steerage berths with passengers, and when once they landed them on Ellis Island, their responsibility and interest ceased. As a result, America is to-day suffering from many ills from which she would have been saved if she had sought to safeguard herself as we are doing, by passing a measure of this character. It is true, as the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> said, that many of the people who flocked to America were of a highly desirable type ; but that was in the earlier days of immigration, when only people with courage and perseverance would leave the land of their &#39;birth and go out and blaze the trail in the wilderness. Later, emigrants went from Central and Northern Europe to America, in total ignorance of the conditions prevailing, and they depended solely upon the information that was given them by the paid agents of the steam-ship and railway companies. They landed in great cities, and it was from that source that the shops and factories obtained their labour. They were used as a means for reducing wages, and I am sure we do not want that type of immigrant here. We are in need of desirable immigrants who are not anxious to settle in the cities, but who are prepared to go on to our vacant spaces and develop the country. There is room for people in all walks of life in Australia, and it is far better that we should obtain 25,000 or 50,000 a year of the right type than we should throw open wide the doors and admit all and sundry, regardless of whether their coming here would be for the good of Australia or not. I congratulate the Government upon having introduced this Bill, and I can assure them that it will have my hearty support. </para>

If the honorable member will peruse the immigration laws of the United States, he will find that the restrictions are very severe, because insane persons, or those suffering from diseases, are not permitted to land in America.

                    <para class="block">Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> our 1912 Act is sufficiently severe. The Bill we are now discussing is doubtless based upon the feeling of hatred and revenge that arose during the recent war, and is intended to prevent the landing in this country of those people who were our enemies, and of those who hold different views as to our form of government. If we had not any immigration restriction law there might be some justification for the Government introducing a Bill of this kind. In 1912, when the Government of the day introduced an Immigration Restriction Bill, honorable members opposite did their best to prevent it from becoming law, because they considered it too severe. I am strongly in favour of undesirable immigrants being prevented from settling in the Commonwealth, but I do not believe in adopting the measures suggested by the Government. The Bill, which appears to have been copied from the English Act, provides for the appointment of a Board &#39; to decide such cases as may come before it. If this measure had been law a few years ago, .1 venture to say that there are many of our most valuable citizens who would have been prevented from landing in the Commonwealth. I do not know whether I would not have been kept out of the country. In the land of my birth, we were always proud of the fact that if a man conducted himself properly, and obeyed the laws of the country, he could not be interfered with. In my young days I saw in London men like Thiers and Garibaldi, who had left their own country because they were in opposition to its form of government; but they were none the worse for that, and did not make undesirable citizens of Great Britain. Under the Bill a person might be refused admission to Australia who. was dissatisfied with the present Coalition Government of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I am entirely opposed to legislation of this character. There is no need for the Bill, because the Immigration Restriction Act contains all the provisions needed to keep out undesirable persons. Should such persons evade the Act, and get into Australia, they could be punished if they subsequently disobeyed the laws of the country. This is panic legislation. Yet I know that I am wasting my time in objecting to it, because whatever is introduced by the Government will be passed by its supporters. The noble ideals of the nation from which we sprung are entirely ignored. I would like the Government, in this instance, to follow the example of Great Britain. Under the Bill an Irishman who proved a reformer, and since whose day the question has been a burning one in all parts of the world, would have been denied admission to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, who had to leave England to save himself from getting into trouble with the Government there, would not have been allowed to land in Australia. The Government will be well advised if they let this measure be numbered with the slaughtered innocents of the session. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is as ignorant about that matter as a baby. It was the employing class, which is the class behind this Government, that brought the Poles and other cheap labour to England, where they lodged under conditions which, as a young man, it broke my heart to see; and I did my best to put an end to what was going on. The matter, however, is one which I cannot discuss now. 1 protest against the Bill as absolutely unnecessary. The community is already protected against the admission of insane and diseased persons. Indeed, the objection taken to the measure of 1912, while it was under discussion, was that it followed too much on the lines of the American immigration legislation. The Bill does not accord with the noble spirit of the Australians, and will interfere with the progress of the country. </para>

I do not think that the Minister has shown that the existing immigration restriction law is not sufficient to keep our population of the character that we desire it to toe. This measure seems the result of a panic that has overtaken the Government, judging by the manner in which some of its clauses are framed. Some of these provisions have been referred to by previous speakers, and it is not my intention to reiterate their arguments, though I desire to indorse them, and more particularly the comments of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> with regard to the provision dealing with those opposed to organized government&#34; - a very vague term. </para>

That observation applies generally to immigration laws. Much depends on the manner in which they are administered, and that, again, depends largely on the character of the Government in power. Some of the clauses of the Bill are too drastic, and I hope that the Minister will show his willingness to have them amended in Committee. </para>

                    <para>Mr.RYAN. - We may get him in an amiable mood, and he may be able to see matters less severely than he did when the measure was being considered by the Cabinet. The Bill provides that persons from the countries with which we were recently at war shall be prohibited immigrants for a period of five years, and for such further period as may be proclaimed by the Governor-General in Council. That is too drastic a provision. I understand that in the United Kingdom the period fixed is only three years. Why should Australia be more restrictive than Great Britain in regard to immigrants from former enemy countries? The views of the present Government are too drastic, and, I think, do not meet with the approval of the majority of Australians. In my opinion, the Prime Minister is the chief offender. He seems to have a rooted hatred of our former enemies, which is reflected in this legislation. The Government is too secretive as to its policy concerning countries with which we have lately been at war. Its views regarding trade with those countries are not in accordance with those  of the majority of our population, and are not sensible views. Our commodities will pass from Australia to those countries, just as their products will reach us, whether we trade directly with them or not. </para>

                            <para>-Great Britain&#39;s legislation may be a good guide for us in this matter. We are too restrictive. From what I have heard from persons who have recently been in Great Britain and France, the policy of this Government in regard to trading with former enemy countries is, on the other side of the world, considered ridiculous. It victimizes our own people by enabling persons in what were neutral countries, and in other countries as well, to set up as middlemen, and make profits at our expense. Why should we prohibit immigration from the Central European countries for a period of five years, if Great Britain says that a period of three years is long enough? </para>

                        <para>.- Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ge</inline> of this clause, it is proposed to prohibit for a period of five years the immigration of any person who is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality. We have already a very big population of settlers, originally from Germany, and their descendants down to the third and fourth generation. These people are naturalized, have made their home amongst us, and we now look upon them - at all events I do - as fellow Australians. It may happen that the nearest relative of a small orphan boy or girl living in Germany, where there has been a heavy death-roll during the last few years, is a naturalized settler in Australia, and that the natural guardian here would like to bring that orphan to Australia. No doubt the Minister has had such cases brought under his notice. I do not want any harsh restrictions to be put in the way of such a child being brought to Australia, where the natural guardians desire it, in order that it may be looked after, and become, eventually, one of our fellow citizens. </para>

                        (Grey- Minister for Home and Territories) T4.55&#93;.  -  I would point out to the honorable member that the Minister has already the power which he seeks by this amendment to provide. Under section 3 of the principal Act he has power to permit the entrance into the Commonwealth of any person possessing a certificate of exemption, and, that being so, there is no need to insert these words. I, therefore, ask him not to press his amendment.

                        <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">ye</inline> of sub-clause 3 is one of the most dangerous provisions in the Bill. It provides that, for a period of five years, and thereafter until the Governor-General, by proclamation, otherwise determines -  any person who, in the opinion of an officer -  mark the power given to an officer -  is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian  or  Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is&#62;  a  Turk of Ottoman race -  may be excluded from Australia. Under this provision the Australian-born son or daughter of any person of the nationality mentioned, who had been out of the country, could be debarred from returning to Australia. That would be a monstrous thing to do. </para>

                            <para>- No; but this interferes with the birthright of every Australian. The Government will allow persons of Asiatic parentage, born in Australia, who have been away on tour to come in at any time, and yet, under this provision, white men - men bora in Australia of German parentage would, in the same circumstances, be shut out. </para>

                            <para>- I. am satisfied that it would. Even supposing there is not power under the Constitution to exclude such persons, what if the poor devils have not enough money to fight the Government in order to secure return to their own country? Surely we are not going to allow panic legislation to run riot?; Many of these people were brought out here; in Queensland special envoys were sent to urge them to come. </para>

In Queensland I know of two women and four men - one of the latter a grandfather - who were born in Germany, came out here as infants in arms, and have remained ever since.What would happen in their case? In my opinion, the grandfather could be excluded under this Bill. </para>

These certainly should he given first choice;but when we are told that the British Parliament has passed a similar measure, in which the period is fixed at three years, I remind the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> that, when he was introducing another Bill a little while ago, he impressed on us how very valuable uniformity in legislation was. If the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> will definitely state that he is moving the omission of the word &#34; five &#34; with a view to inserting &#34; three,&#39;&#39; I shall feel inclined to support him. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> will see his way to accept the amendment. We understand that in June next there will be an Imperial Conference, when, no doubt, legislation dealing with the war period, and post-war period, will be discussed. It may then be found that different portions of the Empire have been legislating on different lines on the same subject. I agree that uniformity, as far as practicable, is desirable; and, instead of our trying to prove ourselves more British than the British at Home, I think we should be erring on the right side, if at all, if we fixed the period at three years. I see no particular virtue in five years for this purpose. True it is that we all desire, first of all, people of our own kith and kin as immigrants; but if there are others desirous of coming to this country, why should they not be permitted to do so after the lapse of three years? It is quite likely that one of the instructions from the Imperial Conference will be that legislation should tend to uniformity as far as possible; and no doubt South Africa and Canada will follow the British example. Should that be so, and we pass this Bill as it stands, we shall find Australia standing alone. </para>

                            <para>- Which means, I suppose, that New Zealand, by administration, may admit such immigrants in one year. Unless my reading is altogether wrong, it is a fact that since the signing of the armistice, and particularly since the beginning of this year, German commercial travellers have been free to traverse the United Kingdom with their wares. In Australia, however, we find! America buying, and then the Germans buying Australian produce from America. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but the prejudice exhibited in the Bill is disclosed in regard to trade. I am afraid that responsible British Ministers will laugh at us for passing such drastic legislation. If the Government were suddenly to declare that this Bill was unnecessary, and withdrew it, I should sleep just as calmly tonight as I did last night. Is the Minister bound by a Cabinet decision, perhaps arrived at by a small majority? Surely after free and open discussion of the matter, and after the intelligence of the Opposition has been brought to bear upon it, a Cabinet decision should not prevent the Minister from consenting to alter the Bill. We are all desirous of improving it. I would improve it out of existence if I could ; but here we are simply proposing to go no further than the British Government have done. Is the Minister still adamant ? </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to delay the Committee ; but as I did not avail myself of the opportunity to discuss the general question of immigration on the second reading of the Bill, I take this opportunity of registering my opposition to the general principle underlying the Bill as embodied in the clause now under consideration. It is pretty clearly recognised that the crying need of Australia is a rapidly increasing population, and, indeed, upon this question rests our whole national wellbeing, as well as the White Australia policy, which is so very dear to the hearts of the people of this country. But as long as the present Government is in power, we do not &#34;deserve to have a White Australia, and if the people persist in returning to this House men of the type we have in this Ministry, we cannot hope to retain it. The maintenance of a White Australia clearly depends upon the populating of the country by white men. If we are not prepared to use this continent in a sane way, we cannot expect for an indefinite series of decades to exclude the peoples of other races, whether they are at present pleasing to us or not. It is peculiarly germane to the consideration of this clause to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is now at Geneva, taking part in a Conference under the League of Nations, discussing what our attitude of the immediate future will be towards those who have recently been our enemies, and at war with us, and discussing the whole of the present day international problems, as&#39; they present themselves to the representatives of the nations assembled at the Conference. Whatever is done there in the name of Australia may vitally affect immigration. Anything which tends to make us ridiculous or unpopular in the eyes of friendly, or unfriendly, nations will react on us in the matter of populating this great continent. Therefore, I am very sorry to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is apparently among those reactionaries who want to carry on the deliberations of the Conference in accordance with the worn out and discredited practices of secret diplomacy - in the dark - and to notice also that he is likely to be among those who are persistently  opposed, two years after the war, to the admission to the League of Nations of those with whom we have recently been at war. Coming more closely to the purpose of this clause, I find that we propose to pursue an utterly foolish, and, in my eyes, malignant, vendetta against our late enemies, by preventing, for a period of five years, the admission into Australia of any of the citizens of those various belligerent countries. Already, under our White Australia policy, we have excluded millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, on the ground of colour - I am not attacking the policy - but, when we follow it up by excluding millions of highly civilized, efficient, and, on general principles, desirable immigrants from Central Europe, then, as I said at the beginning, whether we can retain a White Australia or not, we do not deserve it - under such conditions. The Minister has admitted that on this matter he is adamant. I am well aware that, by what I have said in this House more than once in regard to what our attitude should be towards these belligerent nations, I have not made friends, either politically, personally, or in any other way. It has not been a pleasant task ; it has not been a vote catching policy on my part; but I have felt it to be a public duty to declare that it is worse than folly to be pursuing this policy of creating and maintaining so long after the war a spirit of hate among the nations. That is what this legislation amounts to. It is only a policy of revenge. It is no safeguard. It is not put forward for our acceptance on the ground that there is any real, special danger in admitting those with whom we last fought, any more than there would be in admitting those with whom we fought before we fought those with whom we recently fought. For, at one time or another we have fought them all and cursed them all. We are a fighting race, as our friends opposite are so fond&#39; of boasting, and. later on, if our friends of the International Labour party do not prevent it, we shall be fighting again. We shall be turning all our weapons of poisonous propaganda against a new race and a new nation altogether. The whole thing is absurd. Nay, it is worse than absurd ; it is tragic. All that one can do, sitting as a member of a party which is in a minority, is to rise in his place whenever the occasion demands it, and protest against it. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> proposes to limit the period of exclusion to three years. Seeing that it is impossible to break down the determination of the Government to have some measure of exclusion, the honorable member naturally contends that at least we should not pursue the matter further, or put ourselves in a more invidious position, than the British Government proposes to do. The truth is, of course, that in all this international hate-mongering, which has been so evident throughout the world, Australia has always led the way, even as against the British Government. That Government has at least shown that it possesses a much juster conception of what is desirable amongst the nations. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is so far, at least, right. As a rule, in this matter, or in kindred matters, the British Government has set us an example which, if not a really good one, is one by comparison which we might have followed, but which we have not followed. I should be very glad indeed if this absurd restriction were removed altogether. After five years of blood and slaughter, and two years of the so-called peace which has followed after the signing of the armistice; after the declaration of peace, and the final ratification of it, T should -be very glad to think that our Government really meant what it said when it declared that we were at peace with the world so far as it could make it so, or that, at all events, it proposed - it cannot be contended that there is peace in the world, because there is not - officially and formally, as far as possible, to create a state of peace among those between whom&#39; this tragic war has been going on for so long. I am opposed to this time limit altogether. </para>

                            <para>- I never rise in my place to speak without discovering that if the Minister for Home and Territories happens to be at the table, and finds himself incapable of, or unwilling to, make a rejoinder which is logical, reasonable, or justified by the facts, he. is always to be depended on to make some incorrect and insulting observation. He knows that what he has just said is quite alien to the facts. Not very long ago I had occasion to require him to withdraw in this Chamber a similarly insulting observation. There is, however, always this advantage in saying that kind of thing : It is a passport to the votes of the class of persons from whom the Minister derives his right to sit in this Chamber.  His  interjection is circulated amongst his constituents, and the persons on his side who return ham to this Parliament will continue to do so so long as he says that kind of thing. It meets with no favour from1 the people who return Labour men to this House, and, who believe in a policy of international justice. </para>

Neither am I in favour of artificial barriers being raised against the admission of persons against whom no just objection can be urged. We are now discussing a particular aspect of the clause, but I am opposed to the whole of it. It raises barriers against persons who advocate the overthrow, by force or violence, of - the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State, or of any other civilized country or of all forms of law, or who advocate the overthrow of organized government. Of course, I believe that persons who are in favour of -the overthrow of government by force should get busy by force, and not bother talking about it. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will recall that on several occasions expression has been given to a desire that&#39; the War Precautions Act should be repealed&#39;. Speaking recently, after making some more or less flippant observations about the King of Hungary, I said that I trusted that peace with Hungary would be ratified, and that the proclamation repealing the War Precautions Act would then issue, or failing that, that legislation would be introduced by which the Act would be repealed. Since then Hungary has ratified the Treaty of Peace; but the essential preliminaries to the automatic repeal of the Act by proclamation having been delayed, the Government has introduced this Bill. </para>
                    <para>Clause 2 of the Bill repeals the War Precaution&#39;s Act, and the Bill proceeds to make statutory provision to deal with certain matters over which the Commonwealth must still necessarily exercise authority. I shall endeavour to explain those as shortly as possible. </para>
                    <para>The first is coal. The War Precautions Coal Regulations comprised in the Statutory Rules set out in clause 3 of the Bill will continue in force. This is essential in order that the Commonwealth may still exercise that control over coal which is desirable, and without which, indeed, the award recently made would be of little, if any, avail. It is necessary in order that we may exercise during the transition period that con  trol over the distribution of coal that some of the States of the Commonwealth deem to be essential until they are themselves ready to take over control of the matter. </para>
                    <para>Clause 4 deals with wharfs, and prescribes that Statutory Rule No. 79 dealing with wharfs shall remain in force. </para>
                    <para>Clause 5 gives authority to the Commonwealth to do all those things in connexion with wheat and other primary products to which this House has from time to time given its approval. With out its authority it would be impossible for us to do our part in connexion with the Wheat Pool, and to provide machinery for advancing the guarantee, and to make arrangements with the banks in regard thereto. It is proposed to extend this power of control, not only to wheat, but to all primary products. It may be necessary to take similar action in regard to the control of other things than wheat, and, if so, this clause will give the Government power, subject to the approval of Parliament from time to time, to do so. </para>
                    <para>Clause 6 deals with companies, firms and businesses. Honorable members are aware that for some considerable time past the Commonwealth has compelled companies desiring to register in this country, or companies registered here desiring to secure new capital, to obtain the approval of the Treasurer. The clause applies only to foreign companies, or companies whose shares are held by persons other than natural-born British subjects, or whose principal operations are outside the Commonwealth. In all such cases, the consent of the Treasurer is required for the issue of capital, for the disposal of assets in foreign countries, or the removal of the registration of a company from Australia to another country. Companies in which aliens have more than a one-third interest, are not to be allowed, without consent, to acquire a mine, or carry on a mining or metallurgical business, nor is an alien to be allowed, without the consent in writing of the Treasurer, to acquire any share in an Australian company. All this, I think, is very necessary, and it is merely the continuation of a policy that has been in force for .some years. </para>
                    <para>I come now to clause 7, which deals with an entirely different matter. This clause is designed to prevent the entry into the Commonwealth of disloyal and disaffected persons. An officer may require any person before he is permitted to land in the Commonwealth to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation in the form set out in the schedule to the Bill, which reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>I, A. B., do swear that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the King, and will loyally as in duty bound uphold the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia established under the Crown of the United Kingdom. So help me God ! </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">No doubt there is room for a difference of opinion upon this matter, but it is surely fitting and proper that the Commonwealth should have the right to exclude persons whose object is to stir up disloyalty, and to create disaffection amongst the citizens of the Commonwealth. Any person who is suspected of having that design will be required to take that oath. If he does not take it, he will be deported. If, having taken the oath, he is found by a competent tribunal to have violated it. he will also be deported. </para>
                    <para>The next clause deals with unlawful assemblies, and. is designed to give statutory effect to those War Precautions regulations which were introduced some years ago, for the prevention of crowds assembling within the precincts, and within the immediate neighbourhood of this Parliament, with the intention of overawing and disturbing its deliberations. It does no more than give the same statutory power to this Parliament that is already enjoyed by all State Parliaments. </para>
                    <para>For all practical purposes, clause 9 repeats the provision in the New South  Wales Crimes Prevention Act, No. 80, of 1916. It makes it an offence to incite by words or writing the commission of offences against Commonwealth law. At the present time, it is not an offence to incite the commission of offences against Commonwealth law, although it becomes so if an offence is committed. The person who, having incited its commission, may then be indicted as an accessory before or after the act. Clause 10 deals more particularly with the offence of sedition, and has been taken from the Queensland Criminal Code, which has been in existence for about twenty years. In order that honorable members may. better understand the matter, I take the liberty of reading the clause, all the provisions of which, save two, have been taken with such verbal emendations as to make the words apply to the Commonwealth in place of the State, directly from the Queensland Criminal Code. It provides that - </para>

                    <para class="block">These provisions will give ample freedom to the citizens of this country to obtain redress of all grievances, and to secure by lawful means any reforms which they may deem to be necessary. The clause provides the usual penalties. I have not looked at the penalties imposed under the Queensland Criminal Code, and consequently I am unable to say whether they are more severe than are those prescribed by this Bill, or whether in effect they are the same. Clause 12 deals with loans, and provides that public bodies and trustees may invest in Commonwealth  loans. It also empowers banks to make advances to their employees for the purpose of investing in such loans. Clause 15 forbids the publication of statements calculated to prejudice the raising of Commonwealth loans. Clause 16 continues the Council of Finance established by regulation, statutory rule 207 of 1910. This Council of Finance is now in existence, and it is desired, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, to continue it. Clause 17 requires the agents of oversea companies and firms to register certain particulars with the Comptroller-General of Customs. The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a miscellaneous character, and may be very briefly touched upon. Clause 18 provides that no person without the consent of the Treasurer shall deface or destroy, by melting or otherwise, any gold coins which are British coins within the meaning of the Coinage Act . 1909. Clause 19 sets out that - </para>

I shall not detain honorable members at any greater length. The Bill speaks for itself. It repeals the &#34;War Precautions Act, and makes statutory provision for certain War Precautions Regulations which are essential for the good government of this country. Upon a fair review of the measure, I think it will be admitted that it does no more than ought to be done either in repealing the War Precautions Act or barring the entry into the Commonwealth of those undesirables who wish to disturb the harmony and goodwill of our fellow-citizens or dealing with sedition. I commend the Bill to the House, and I trust that without any very protracted debate it will be approved. As it is a measure of some length, I have taken this opportunity to move its second reading, and I now wish to intimate that it is not proposed to continue the discussion upon it to-day. I shall set its further consideration down for to-morrow. It may be reached to-morrow, but possibly it may not be reached until Wednesday.

                    <para>.- I would not have spoken on this clause but for the remarks of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton).</inline> It appears to me that he wants to be enlightened on certain matters, and particularly in regard to his appeal to the sentiments of the fathers and mothers of soldiers who lost their lives in the war.  His  views are not shared by the soldiers of Europe. They resent his sentiments. The ex-soldiers of the continent, totalling in all about 5,000,000, and including ex-soldiers of Great Britain, France, Germany, and, indeed, all combatant countries, have formed an International for the purpose of making war impossible in the future. </para>

                        <para>- Rolande may be a beautiful idealist, and, as the Treasurer suggests, he may also be a dreamer. But these men fought throughout the war, and are pledged to use their endeavours to induce the people in every country of the world not only to forget the late war, with all its hatreds and prejudices, but also to get rid of all insignia and honours conferred upon them, such as the Legion of Honour, the Croix de Guerre, and every other symbol of merit awarded in connexion with the war. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Batman is one of the worst offenders in this House when any matter affecting the war is under discussion.  His  lips seem positively to drip gall whenever he talks about the attitude of Great Britain in the war. During the war feeling ran very high. We found workmen refusing to work alongside men of enemy origin. It was a source of constant trouble. And now we are told, by honorable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House, the war being over, we should allow erstwhile enemies to come to this country, and not insist on Germany making reparation. But we are suffering the aftermath of the war. The consequences of the war will be felt for many a long day to come, and bitter memories will certainly be retained for a long time by people of German origin.  If such men as the honorable members for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> resent Great Britain&#39;s treatment of Germany, how much more will German nationals resent that treatment? So, if we allow them to come to Australia, there will always be the possibility of trouble until, at all events, the bitter feeling engendered by the war shall have passed away. The honorable member for Barrier suggests that this Bill represents a spirit of revenge. It does nothing of the kind. It is purely a protective measure. </para>

                        <para>- It is not being submitted in a spirit of revenge at all. To hear this talk, one would almost imagine that the honorable member, and those who think with him, are full to overflowing with the milk of human kindness, and that honorable members on this side of the House are animated by a spirit of hatred. I resent that. We have no feelings of revenge. This Bill simply represents an ordinary common-sense precaution in the interests of good government and peace. We say that, until the feelings generated by the war have died down somewhat, we must postpone the immigration to this country of erstwhile enemy nationals. I hope the Committee will support the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- It is curious that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> should have overlooked the fact that the amendment is designed to give effect to the policy of Great Britain, and with the object of bringing our law into conformity with British law. Though the honorable member is loyal to Britain to the core, and resents that my lips should be dripping with gall, as he described it, in respect of Britain, when it becomes a matter of prolonging ill-feeling due to the war, he prefers to foster Australian hatred of our late enemies, instead of following the British policy of conciliation. It is very curious that the honorable member should have taken the trouble to point to the ill-feeling that existed in this country during the war, the international hatreds that were developed, propagated, and maintained while the war was on, and should then have argued, as a consequence, that we should now give effect to a policy which prolongs the very thing that he pretends to deprecate in relation to the past. I hope I do not forget the precise purpose of the clause under discussion, because it is one which is closely related with the war, and with its consequences. During the currency of the war, we had to listen to outpourings of bathos such as has just fallen from the lips of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> ; and it is a fact that, as part of the policy of hatred, that kind of stuff was undoubtedly effective during those five long tragic years; and as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> says, it is effective even to-day. To-day this policy of revenge divides this House, and is responsible for recriminations among ourselves - reflecting that greater measure of ill-will which we are endeavouring to develop on the other side of the world, Because the war is past, I do not want to revive the unpleasant state of mind which necessarily followed from the performance of the duty which rested upon public men to express their views firmly and courageously. It is because the war is past, and long past, that one cannot help protesting strongly against the introduction of a measure which seeks to perpetuate this mental disease in time of peace. Therefore, while there is nothing by any means revolutionary in the amendment; while it is mildness itself - for if one tried to give effect to the real views of the Labour party in this matter it would be impossible to do so in the present temper of honorable members opposite - in the small hope that we may soon return to an equitable, and therefore a normal, frame of mind,- I shall, at any rate, support it. The mere bandying about of insults concerning what we did, and what honorable members opposite did, during the war, can carry us no further. We, at any rate, acted consistently with our expressed opinions, and we did not sit in soft, safe places urging others to do the fighting while we did the talking. </para>

                    <para>,- It would be, perhaps, an impertinence to suggest that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> has, to a certain extent, missed the point. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member regarding the danger of doing anything to keep alive ill-feeling. But his remarks, and those also of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> would be more appropriate if by this amendment we were proposing to wipe out the whole clause, or even the subclause. In such circumstances I could understand the Minister&#39;s speech; but we are not proposing anything of the sort. The amendment is designed merely to bring our legislation into line with the British law. I personally repudiate  the remarks of the Minister when he says that one is apt to forget the effects of a war such as that through which we have lately passed, and that one is prone to fail to keep in mind the very heavy losses which we incurred. The amendment does not propose to permit citizens of those countries with which we were lately at war to come into Australia unrestricted; but we should now lay down a perfectly good policy upon these lines, namely, that in regard to matters of trade, and everything else, that which is deemed good enough for the Home country should be accented as good enough for us. We followed the Home country into the war. Surely, then, it would be rather anomalous that those of us who believed we acted rightly by so doing did not believe also that we would be right in following the British example with respect not only to trade and commerce, but also in regard to restrictions upon immigration. Surely no suggestion of disloyalty could be reasonably levelled against us for our consistency. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> must, of course, be responsible for their own views upon the clause and the amendment; but <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> hope that the tone which the discussion has taken will not influence honorable members against judging fairly upon the merits of the argument. Our desire is to bring the Commonwealth legislation into conformity with the British law; and that, to my mind, is the sole purpose of the amendment. </para>

                    <para>explain this measure during the second reading debate. As honorable members know, I have only just returned from Sydney, where I have been for the past fortnight in connexion with my duties as a member of the Public Works Committee. I did hear him explain this clause, however, and his arguments failed to convince me. If his remarks to-day were in keeping with those which he uttered when he moved the second reading of the Bill, it would seem that I did not lose much by my inability to hear them. The Minister has now said something to the effect that he would not be able to look a returned soldier in the face if he were to accept the amendment. It is rather unfortunate that, after having expressed such an opinion, the second  speaker  following the Minister should have been himself a returned soldier, and that he should have had to tell the Minister that he does not interpret .the true feelings of returned men upon the issue. However, it is not to the Minister that we look for an interpretation of the views of returned men, but t0 those who actually did the fighting. According to my reading, the clause does not limit the restriction to five years. It may be possible for citizens of former enemy countries to be debarred from entering Australia for a matter of twenty-five years. I draw the attention of honorable members to the phrase, &#39; &#39; until the Governor-General, by proclamation, otherwise determines.&#34; If, by any conceivable chance or misfortune the present Government were to continue in office for another twenty-five years, this immigration barrier could remain for the same period, or for so long as the Government thought they could make use of the restriction for political purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Before then, one . of our late enemies might be our firmest ally, and one of our present allies might be our hated enemy. On the last occasion when I heard the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> speaking in this Chamber he was. addressing himself to the Nationality Bill. He then employed the argument, respecting the naturalization of aliens, that Commonwealth legislation should be framed in conformity with the British law. Now, however, he turns right round. It does not suit the convenience of the Government that our immigration . restriction legislation should coincide with the British Statute, which provides for three years. Both Great Britain and France have entered into trade with Germany. We stand alone in the Empire in our insistence upon keeping the sore open; worse than that, we are rubbing salt into the wound. We are the only people who are continuing to promulgate the gospel of hatred. </para>

                        <para>- I have not very much to add to what I said before the dinner adjournment, and, unless the Minister in charge of the measure is in a different mood to what he was then, it is practically useless proceeding. It seems strange that there are people who are quite prepared to trade with countries which, two years ago, were our enemies, but, at the same time, are willing to penalize the people of those countries by making the period two years longer than even the British Government consider necessary. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the other day, in reply to a question by the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> said that he was quite in favour of trade being again undertaken with Germany, and would no longer offer any resistance to our crossbred and other wools being sold to that country. It is interesting to recall that, at the termination of hostilities, the Prime Minister said he would never consent, under any circumstances, to trade between Australia and Germany being reopened. But two years has evidently had an effect even upon the Prime Minister, and he now indicates that much of the old bitterness has died down, and he is prepared to reverse the decision he then gave. Purely for political purposes - I say it deliberately - he is willing to sanction a clause of this character which will not permit those people who proved themselves to be admirable settlers to come to Australia within a period of five years. The amendment simply provides that the term shall be reduced from five to three years, which would bring the Bill into conformity with the British Act, which was a strong argument the Government used in connexion with another measure recently passed by this Chamber. We are simply asking the Committee to do what the mother of Parliaments has already agreed to, and, if the British Government are satisfied, surely this Government should be. </para>

                <para class="block">That shows clearly that there is a great difference of opinion even amongst the Allies at the Geneva Conference. If that is the attitude of Great Britain, I cannot understand why we should support such a proposal as this, as one would expect the same kind of prejudice there as exists here, particularly when they are so close to German territory. I firmly believe that the German Government with which we would negotiate would be totally different from what it was in the past, because I believe the Junker class has gone forever. I wish I could say the same concerning every other country in the world, because this class is responsible for all wars. I too, believe that there are many people in Germany who would make good citizens if they came to Australia, and we should not restrict them unnecessarily. The Minister seems adamant in regard to this proposal, which, after all, is a reasonable one, and is strictly in accord with what has been done by the British Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.-I do not know precisely how this clause will read with the provision of the original Act which it amends, but I understand the intention to be to impose on the owner or charterer of a ship that has brought here a prohibited person who  has happened to enter the Commonwealth, the obligation to provide a passage for him back to his own country. As I object to the provision of the original Act, and as this clause is designed to give fuller effect to that provision, I am opposed to the clause. I do not think that an obligation of this kind should be imposed on the owner of a vessel or his agent, or on the vessel&#39;s charterer. I do not think that a person should be sent out of the country under the circumstances provided for, and I certainly do not think that it should be competent for the Government at any time within three years after a person has been brought to the country by a shipowner or charterer in good faith, and in the ordinary course of business, to impose on that ship-owner or charterer the obligation of taking him back to his own country. </para>

                        <para>- That may be the intention of the clause; but the wording of it is certainly wider, and would enable deportations of the kind to which I referred to take place. There might be a treaty existing between Great Britain and Italy to which the Commonwealth was a party, and under this provision the Minister would be able in such circumstances to deport Italian nationals to Italy in pursuance of that treaty. The amendment is wide enough to permit of that. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members sitting in the Opposition corner, unfortunately, can never hear anything that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> says. I do not think he cares whether we hear him or not; but it does make it unpleasant when one cannot hear his statements on a question of this kind. So far as I can understand the amendment now submitted, the object of it clearly appears to be to legalize future acts of the kind that were unlawfully carried out by the Government in connexion with Italian nationals. It will be remembered that these men were seized without the form of law, and in breach of the general practice obtaining in British communities. They were sent overseas, and many of them lost their lives; but, so far as I am aware, no compensation has been paid to their relatives or to any of the persons who were grossly wronged in connexion with that sorry business. I wonder what is meant by the words in this amendment, &#34; is liable to be returned to that country.&#34; Apparently, any man whom the Government are pleased to designate an alien, whether he is an alien or not, is liable, if the previous practice is followed, to be returned to the country of his origin. That part of the amendment is to me somewhat obscure. I gather generally, however, that the intention is in the future to cover up with the form of law that clearly unlawful and wrongful course of conduct, which in the recent past was pursued by the Government. Public attention has been called to it, and it is sought now by a kind of <inline font-style="italic">ex post facto</inline> manoeuvring on the part of the Government to give an appearance of lawfulness so far as any future acts of the kind are concerned to what is now recognised to have been an unlawful proceeding. I cannot take great exception to this belated recognition by the Government of its past wrong-doing. Indeed, I rather welcome it, in so far as it is clearly an admission, and take the opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the fact that arguments on this matter have evidently not been without effect. </para>

                            <para>- That is what the Government intend to do later on, when we have gained some experience in civil aviation&#39;. At present there is nothing to prevent persons flying any machine they like, no matter of what brand or make; there is no power to insure that the machines shall be, I cannot say seaworthy, and, therefore, I suppose I must say airworthy. Further, there is nothing now to prevent the owner of any machine taking hire from passengers for flights, and this, of course, is a real menace to the public; neither is there any law to compel the possession of certificates of competency by those who fly machines. The object of the Bill, as I say, is to take power to frame regulations for the control of all such matters, and it will be followed later on by a more comprehensive measure, dealing with civil aviation. The best man to be found in Australia will be appointed Controller of Civil Aviation, with a seat on the Air Council, with which he will act as general advisor. This Bill will not interfere in any shape or form with civil aviation enterprise. If ever Australia has to take part in defensive operations, an air service, in my opinion, will be one of the principal arms employed; and the encouragement of civil aviation will result in saving the country huge expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The Premiers of the States have agreed to put measures through their several Parliaments giving the necessary powers with two reservations. One reservation is that ordinary police powers shall be allowed to the State police, and the second that the States may possess their own machines. The reason that the control of aviation is left to regulations is, as I said before, that we have not had experience enough yet to enable us to frame proper laws; but the regulations to be adopted are those which were arrived at by a Convention held in Paris, at which the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> represented Australia. The following are the countries which have assented to the regulations then framed : - The United </para>

If these countries are satisfied that these are the best regulations that can be devised at present, I think we in Australia may also be satisfied. Some of the regulations, of course, may not be applicable to this country, but that is a matter for future consideration. I shall not trouble honorable members by reading the regulations, but simply say that they provide for certificates of air-worthiness, and so forth. There is nothing in the Bill to necessitate lengthy discussion.; and I ask honorable members to bear in mind that it will not in any way affect the Air Force Bill which will be introduced, not this year, but next, to deal with our Military and Naval branches of the Air Forces. Of course, the Military and Naval Air Forces will have to conform to those regulations, such as flying at a certain altitude over crowds, and so on. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Civil aviation will come more within the military than the naval sphere. The fact that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has introduced the Bill is sufficient answer to the honorable member&#39;s question. Those who saw what could be done by aeroplanes during the war realize that it is all-important that Australia should have an effective air force, and one way in which it can obtain it is by giving every possible encouragement to civil aviation. This Bill does not interfere with or restrict enterprise in civil aviation. It simply gives power to make regulations for the safety of the public. Accidents have occurred quite recently through aviators flying low over crowds, and unless air traffic is regulated in some way, there may be more serious accidents. </para>

If the States are not likely to interfere with our control, and . are prepared to pass the necessary legislation giving us this power, the sooner they do it the better. </para>

                            <para>- Nor do I. The Minister surprised me, and I presume many others, when he said that at present a man can go up in the air without being possessed of a certificate of competency. The driver of a motor car is required to have a certificate of competency. I thought the Defence Department were issuing certificates of competency to air pilots, because when I was at Point Cook at the invitation pf the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Basil</inline> Watson, who wanted me to see his machine, there was a man qualifying for his pilot&#39;s certificate. </para>

                            <para>- In this case, I understand, the man had no intention of securing the billet under the Defence Department, but was merely anxious to let it be known that he had attended a course of instruction at Point Cook qualifying him to make a flight. He was a motor car driver, and I understand that, because of their knowledge of mechanics, motor car drivers make the best aviators. Unless certificates are issued, the public will always be in danger. I am a frequent visitor to a seaside place about forty miles from Melbourne. Last year, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> partly to advertise itself and partly to allow visitors at Sorrento to get the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> at night, which otherwise they could not do, sent an aviator right down the east side of Port Phillip Bay. One afternoon, when he was landing at Mornington, the crowd overran the landing ground, and he, finding that he could not make a landing at the pre-arranged spot without injuring some one in the crowd, made for what he thought was a suitable ground on the other side of the railway line; but he came into contact with a telegraph wire, with the result that the son of a prominent Melbourne man who was accompanying him was killed. That accident was occasioned by the crowd. One reason why we must have active cooperation with the States is the fact that the control of crowds must rest with the State police. In another accident in Adelaide, which was not due to the crowd, the propeller of a machine cut off a boy&#39;s bead. Other accidents have occurred elsewhere. Another reason for cooperating with the States is the necessity for providing landing grounds. </para>

                            <para>-  I am prepared to admit that they are, but we ought to know what we are doing. The conditions in Australia might differ from those obtaining elsewhere. However, I see no reason why we should not pass the Bill as early  as  possible, and get active co-operation with the States, but I think that the Bill ought to state distinctly what Minister is to control it. Otherwise, the control of aviation may be transferred from one Minister to another, and honorable members may not know to what Minister questions or complaints should be directed. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a skeleton Bill, but we have become accustomed to government by regulations. However, I welcome the introduction of the measure. Aviation is quite new to all of us ; but every thinking person will admit that unless something is done to secure the control of the air, or what would be&#34; called on land &#34; the right of the road,&#34; we shall wake up some day and find that some terrific accident has occurred. We have been very close to it on some occasions, more often than some of us would care to think of. There is only one Department which can administer a measure like this, and that is the Defence Department. Necessarily it must have a Department to control its cwn air-craft, and no one would desire to create a secondDepartment to deal with what, after all, will be a very small affair once these regulations are put into operation. We do not know anything about aviation, and it is well for the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> to consider whether it would not be wise to place &#38; time limit in this Bill, so that the whole subject will come up for reconsideration later on. I do not think there will be the slightest difficulty in getting the co-ordination of the States. A small Bill giving the Commonwealth Parliament the control of the air could be passed in a couple of hours by each State Parliament, and as all the State Houses are now in session, . there should be no difficulty in this respect. With little management and careful handling much closer co-ordination could be achieved between the Federal Government and State Governments in many directions. It only requires a little give and take to meet the requirements of the different States. The State Premiers have already promised to introduce the necessary legislation in regard to bestowing upon the Commonwealth Parliament the control of the air, and I do not see any reason for doubting their ability to carry out their promises. In fact, I do not think there is a single State that will not be only too glad to get rid of its responsibility in this matter. The defence of Australia from .aggression will largely depend on our air-craft, and the only way in which a country like this can maintain an efficient air-craft service is by co-ordination of the military side and the civil side. A great deal can be done in the direction of conveying mails to the interior of Australia by aeroplanes. In such districts as the north-west coast of Western Australia, where the mail services are very irregular, a fortnight often intervening between the deliveries, the mail service of the future will be carried out by air-craft. It is only by the use of air-craft for commercial purposes that Australia can hope to maintain such an air-craft service as will be necessary for defence. I hope that the control of aviation will be left in the charge of the Defence Department. It would take a very great deal to induce me to consent to the creation of a new Department for the purpose. I support the Bill cordially, with the expression of the hope that the Minister will see his way to impose a time limit on its operation, because we are in this matter breaking new ground, and difficulties may arise which we cannot now foresee. If the course I suggest is followed, Parliament will then automatically be afforded an opportunity of reconsidering the position, and this </para>

                        <para>.- I welcome the advent of this Bill. Ever since this House met I have persistently asked questions dealing with aerial matters. Commercial and civil aviation have been considerably hindered in Australia for lack of air regulations. Whilst other parts of the world have made great advances in aviation. Australia has been standing still. At last we have a Bill before us which is based upon the report of a Conference at which Australia was represented, which was signed at Paris on 13th October, 1919. I have considered that report with expert airmen out here, and there can be no doubt that it is very full and very thorough.. Much of it, of course, applies to dividing lines between the great countries of the Old World, but a great deal of it also may be applied to Australia. I may mention the provision suggested for the marking of aeroplanes underneath so that each machine may be distinguished. If an aviator flies low over cities his machine will have its private mark, and he can thus be identified and brought to account. No aviator is allowed to go into the air, and no engineer is permitted to enter an aeroplane without a proper licence. More important than anything else, the regulations for preventing collisions at sea are adopted almost <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> If honorable members will read the regulations for preventing collisions in the air they will find that they are almost identical with those for preventing collisions at sea. Two ships meeting each other port their helms and .go to starboard, and thus pass in safety. Aeroplanes, it is suggested, also must carry red and green sidelights like the port and starboard sidelights of vessels, and also a stern light. There are other regulations to be complied with in order to avoid serious collisions. Up to the present time we have been extraordinarily lucky in not having a tragedy occurring in one of the principal cities of Australia. I have already directed attention in this House to low flying over the Randwick racecourse, and recently I have seen low flying over Melbourne and over Sydney. If, when an aviator is flying low over a city in that way, his engine should stop or misfire, a tragedy would be the result, because the aeroplane would probably fall into a mass of people. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This Bill adopts the proposals of the Conference to which I have referred, and confers power on the Governor-General to frame regulations controlling flying. The fear has been expressed tonight that the State Governments may be somewhat laggard in passing the necessary regulations to control flying, and may not leave the matter in the hands of the Commonwealth. But from what I can learn the State Governments are very keen about legislation controlling flying,&#39; and their representatives at the Premiers&#39; Conference have to be thanked for agreeing to hand over to the Commonwealth as the central authority the subject of flying legislation. The foundation of the whole business must be  civil and commercial aviation. If we encourage private individuals and companies to undertake aviation, the Government will save an enormous amount of money in the supply of machines for defence purposes. But private individuals will not make a start until satisfactory regulations are introduced. </para>
                    <para>It may interest honorable members if I give them a few facts to show what is </para>
                    <para class="block">I  taking place in aviation in other parts of the world. We are considerably behind in this matter. Our expert aviators and mechanics, for lack of proper encouragement, are going into civil occupations, or to other countries, such as America and the Old Country, to join up with aerial companies there. From the latest report from England, which I received two days ago, I find that some extraordinary figures are given in connexion with the Paris-London air route. During fourteen months, up to 30th October of this year, 4,000 passengers had been carried, and .&#163;200,000 worth of goods, whilst the distance covered in the fourteen months was 300,000 miles. The official report says that the route is absolutely reliable, and the service conducted with the most wonderful regularity. In South Africa, huge commercial aviation schemes are in hand. The Dutch, doubtless inspired by the wonderful flight of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ross</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Smith, and by Parer and Mcintosh, have established in Java aerial mail and passenger services. The Siamese have done likewise. The United States of America have, of course, made huge strides in aviation. From New York to Chicago, a daily service for mails and passengers has been established, and a  charge of only 2 cents per letter is made for the mail service, whilst there is a saving of twenty-four hours on the transcontinental route. The official report for 1919 says that it is 95 per cent, perfect. This shows to what a fine art civil aviation has been brought in America. </para>
                    <para>Without referring to other countries, it must be very clear to honorable members that great advances have been made in aviation almost everywhere except Australia. Now that this Bill has been introduced, I can tell honorable members that we shall make great strides in this country. Many time-tables have already been drawn up, and aviators are only waiting to get a start. There are some conditions essential to success in civil aviation and the carriage of mails by aeroplane. One is that there must be special machines&#39; employed for the purpose. It is not a bit of use to try to carry mails or passengers with military machines. I can give honorable members one example in proof of this statement. Recently an experiment was made in India from  Kurachi  to Bombay, a distance of 600 miles. The Government used D.H.10 machines- that are very expensive because of their large consumption of petrol. Notwithstanding the fact that these machines can carry 3,000 lbs., and that, on the trials to which I refer, they were used to carry only 48 lbs., the whole thing- was a colossal failure. A very big authority, in England, a man named Holt Thomas, who started the Paris to London flights, and, I believe, also the Paris to Amsterdam flights, that have been so successful, says that you cannot make a success of civil mail and passenger flights without building special machines for the purpose. In every case, you must build a special machine for the job you intend it to carry out. </para>
                    <para>I understand that in Australia we have machine? that can carry mails at an inexpensive rate. Experts out here are rather timid about the experiments that are to be undertaken by the Defence Department. I managed to set their fears somewhat ab rest by some weeks ago&#62; asking the Minister in charge of this Bill questions on the subject. I understand that the Department do not propose to use D.H.10 or D.H.9 machines, but have other machines that will do the job. I hope they have, because if we make a mistake at the start, it will have a most injurious effect upon aviation, in  Austra- </para>
                    <para class="block">Iia. People must be given every encouragement if we are to make aviation a success. If we give the business a good start, it will go right on; but if we make a slip it will take years to so far educate the public on this question that great business firms will be prepared to send their goods by these machines. I have already said that in fourteen months on the Paris-London route &#163;200,000 worth of goods were carried; and why should we not be able to do that in Australia between Sydney and Melbourne, Melbourne and Adelaide, or outback to the people in remote districts? </para>
                    <para>Another condition precedent to success is speed. I have been expecting to be asked by interjection if I have ever flown. As a matter of fact, I have never been up. I had about 200 invitations during the war to go up; but not on your life over the Belgian coast or over the lines during the war ! I preferred to be on my bridge. But I can tell honorable members that I have taken a huge interest in flight for many years, and I had a very big machine on order in 1914, before the war broke out. I have followed the matter closely, and have read up everything worth reading on the subject; and as I worked at sea with the Royal Naval Air Force on the Belgian coast and in the English Channel during the winter months, I feel justified in speaking upon any matter pertaining to flight. I have said that the question of speed is very vital. At 75 miles per hour you can carry 2 tons weight over 300 miles without landing. If you increase&#39; the speed to 100 miles per hour, the weight which can be carried drops from 2 tons to under 1 ton. The more speed you get, the less the weight-carrying capacity, and, of course, with increase of speed there is an increase of expense. </para>
                    <para>Another matter of importance is night flying.  You must fly at night, because business men will not&#39; fly in the day-time, when they need to be working in their offices. A business man could go up at night in Melbourne and land in Sydney at daylight next morning in a very comfortable machine. I have seen machines for carrying fifteen passengers, with plush seats and little round tables for playing cards, and a man engaged to serve drinks to passengers. </para>
                    <para>Another matter of great importance is that proper landing grounds must be provided, and these must be well lit up at night, so that if an aviator is compelled to make a forced landing, he will know where to come down by lights placed on the ground around an aerodrome. This involves expense; but I have heard with pleasure that when the Government begin to move in this matter, no less than 80 per cent, of the local councils have agreed to undertake the expense of laying out proper landing grounds, if the Government will provide the plans and an expert officer to superintend the work. That is an offer which should be clinched at once. The last condition,; as T mentioned before, is that of public support. The public are funny creatures. Indeed, we are all funny creatures. We take everything for granted. In the matter of aviation the public need educating, notwithstanding what they have seen accomplished during the war. They must be worked up to the position gradually, and our business firms especially must give aviation their support, if it is to be made a success. </para>
                    <para>There is just one other matter that I desire to bring under the notice of the House. It is a most important matter. There is a young Australian engineer inventor, named E. H. Friend, of New South Wales. He has invented an aeroplane engine, which, in comparison with the Rolls-Royce - the last word in aeroplane engines - costs only half as much, and is only one-third of the size. If a Rolls-Royce engine required to be dismantled about one-third of a day would be occupied in the task, whereas the engine invented by young Friend can be dismantled in an hour. The main point about this engine is that it possesses not only a petrol stroke, but also a steam stroke, thus having a double impulse, which gives it enormous power. Let me illustrate my point. In Australia to-day out of 106 points of power there is not a single engine which will give more than seventeen points. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Friend</inline> anticipates getting a minimum of power from his engine of 45 points. Experts have seen the model, including <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel Williams,</inline> Squadron-Commander Goble, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir C.</inline> B. White, and the late superintendent of Cockatoo Island, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, who wrote a strong report in its favour. Young Friend has offered this machine to the Commonwealth Government for its Army and Navy for nothing, if they will only defray his expenses to England immediately in order that he may take his model there, and compete for the &#163;12,000 prize which the Air Ministry have offered for the best aeroplane engine, and which he thinks he can win. This offer has been before the Commonwealth Government for the past twelve months, yet this young inventor is still in Melbourne, whither he comes from Sydney about once a week to see me in reference to it. If the Government do not want that engine, let them say so, because it will not then be many hours before a private company, or, perhaps, a foreign Power, will get it. I am told by experts that if the engine comes up to the claims of its inventor - and a number of them think that it will - it will revolutionize flying the whole world over. It may be asked, &#34; Where does the inventor come in?&#34; He will come in by sales to private individuals outside the Government. The Commonwealth, however, will get the engine for all its machines for the cost of this man&#39;s passage Home - perhaps an expenditure of &#163;150 under this heading- and a few additional pounds to enable. him to carry on whilst he is dealing with the Air Ministry there. I beseech the Government to look into the matter. I know that a report upon it was received in Melbourne a few days ago from a very junior officer at the Arsenal. But this officer had neither the inventor before him, nor the model, nor the specifications.  His  report was that he would not recommend sending the inventor Home, but that the papers relating to the invention might be sent to the Air Ministry, if Friend were willing that that course should be followed. Evidently there is something wrong somewhere - I am afraid that it is the cursed system of red tape again - and we are going to lose something which I think is a perfect marvel. I appeal to the Government to allow this lad to go Home at once. There is no time to lose if he is to be, in a position to compete for the &#163;12,000 prize to which I have already referred. The following information is contained in a note sent to me by Friend: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">The petrol engines of Australia are annually wasting, through their exhaust and cooling systems, 34,000,000 gallons of the 52,000,000 gallons of high-priced petrol, mainly bought from foreign Powers. The universal adoption of my motor would save Australia 10,000,000 gallons of petrol a year. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In other words, his engine eats up every bit of power that is usable. It avails itself of the heat engendered by the petrol, and of- the steam that it gets from tha water radiator, and it consumes all the waste, thereby yielding 45 per cent, of power. I urge the Government to look very carefully into this matter as early as possible, with a view to seeing if they cannot allow this young man to go Home and give Australia another big &#34; boost.&#34; I welcome the activity of the Ministry in getting down to bedrock by bringing this Air Convention into force, and by seeking to empower the Governor-General to make regulations to deal with civil aviation. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a word or two in connexion with this young man Friend who has invented an engine which it is claimed will revolutionize&#39; the manufacture of internal combustion engines throughout the world. I saw the young man in question, and I was very favorably impressed by him. I think that he is a very smart, keen, good Australian. I understand, too, that General White and. <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel Williams</inline> have seen the models and specifications of his invention, and that they, too, are favorably impressed with them. At all events, I promise the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> that I will place the matter before the Cabinet, and that I will* ask it to agree to a small expenditure on behalf of this young man. I asked Friend whether a first class passage Home would be sufficient for him, and his reply was, &#34;I do not want a first class passage. I will go second class.&#34; It is evident, therefore, that he is not out for a &#34;joy-ride.&#34; In conversation with me, he stated, &#34; I want to go Home to compete for the &#163;12?000 which is being offered for the best engine for aeroplanes.&#34; He is very anxious indeed to compete for this big prize; and I think, in all the circumstances, that we are justified in paying his passage to the Old Country. I told him that I was prepared to ask Cabinet to sanction an expenditure of &#163;100 to enable him to live in England whilst placing his invention before the proper authorities, and he said that he would be perfectly satisfied with that amount. We should be foolish to miss the chance of securing an invention of this sort for the Commonwealth. Of course, it may prove  a  &#34; dud &#34; ; but the risk is one which is well worth taking. </para>

                    <para>With regard to what has been said concerning the imposition of a time limit upon the operation of the Bill, I do not think that any good purpose would be served by such a restriction. We do not know how long these regulations will run smoothly and satisfactorily. But the moment it can be shown that they are not working satisfactorily fresh legislation will be brought down to deal with this matter of civil aviation. </para>

The honorable member stated that this young man had been travelling backwards and forwards from Sydney for about twelve months, and that so far he had been unable to get anything done in connexion with his request. I would like to know whether any reports have been obtained upon his invention. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members will recollect that some time ago I promised to remove the embargo against the importation of certain goods to Australia, amongst them  carbide of calcium. Without wearying the House at this hour with a recital of the history of what has happened, I remind them that when the war broke out carbide of calcium was one of the commodities that Australia became very short of, with the result that before long the price began to rise rapidly, reaching, ultimately, I think, something like &#163;85 per ton in 1917-18. This price did not last long, because the Japanese came into the market, and quotations fell to about &#163;60 per ton. Early in the war a company for the manufacture of carbide was formed in Hobart, but at the outset they were confronted with all sorts of troubles, the principal being the difficulty of obtaining the electrodes for the production of the carbide itself. Eventually, electrodes were supplied by a company operating in Scandinavia, but these broke down. They would not stand up to the current, and as a consequence the company could not manufacture carbide of calcium at all. I shall have a word or two to say directly concerning the reasons, possibly, that actuated the company supplying the electrodes. However, the Tasmanian company decided to manufacture their own, but at the outset they experienced great difficulty in acquiring the necessary machinery, including a very large hydraulic press. Eventually Australian engineers came to their rescue, and, to their great credit, be it said, they were able to turn out the necessary machinery, and to manufacture their own electrodes, though not until about the end of the war. Had these difficulties been overcome in the earlier stages of the war, the company would, by this time, have been on such a firm basis that the present difficulties would not have arisen. Carbide of calcium is now available at a price which makes it impossible for this Australian company to trade, and unless we can do something to help them they will have to close down their works altogether. They have a capital of &#163;100,000 invested in the industry, and came to the rescue of Australia at a critical period in the war. It was not their fault, at all events, that they were unable to meet the demand at the time. Carbide of calcium is used in many branches of the manufacturing industry as well as lighting in a number of country districts. </para>

                            <para>- It is, to some extent, for lighting purposes; but, nevertheless, it is the key chemical for many other branches of industry, among them being acetylene welding, cyanide for fertilizers, for ammonia, for gold extraction, and dicyandiancide for toning down explosives. These are some of the uses to which this chemical is put. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with that aspect of the question in a moment. In the United Kingdom, carbide of calcium is selling at from &#163;30 to &#163;35 per ton, and in the United States of America at &#163;28 16s. to &#163;35 4s., according to quality and converting the dollar at 3.50. Carbide of calcium is cheaper here than in any other part of the world to-day, and the Tasmanian company are prepared to give us a guarantee that the price will not exceed &#163;30 per ton, but if, owing to arrangements which they are now making with the Tasmanian Government for financial assistance, they are able to reduce the cost of production, and at the same time return a fair profit to the company, the Australian consumer will get the benefit of that reduction. I am satisfied, on the figures supplied to me by the company - and necessarily they are confidential - that &#163;30 per ton only gives the company a fair profit and a reasonable amount for amortisation. </para>

                        <para>.- Since the introduction of this subject-matter tonight, I have examined the statistics dealing with the imports of calcium carbide for the last five years available. Last year&#39;s figures are not yet to hand. In 1913-14, 288,195 cwt. was imported into Australia, and its value was &#163;184,844 - equal to about &#163;13 per ton landed here. In 1914-15 - the first year of the war - 234,923 cwt. was imported, and its value was &#163;139,033; the value still works out at about &#163;13 a ton. In 1915-16, importations totalled 237,143 cwt., and the value was &#163;118,715. That price works out at less than &#163;10 per ton. In 1916-17, the total quantity imported fell to about 98,000 cwt., the value of which was &#163;57,461. Again that works out at about &#163;13 a ton. In 1917-18, importation totalled 74,570 cwt., and the value was &#163;135,000. That is to say, the value for that year worked out at &#163;40 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- The extraordinary part of the situation is that the moment this Tasmanian company placed its product on the market the price fell from &#163;70 to &#163;29 per ton. We might just as well face the situation fairly. I have seen financial statements of this company, and I know its position exactly. It cannot produce and pay Australian rates of wages under existing conditions if it sells at less than &#163;30 a ton. </para>

                            <para>- The shipping companies on theAustralian coast - I think there are regulations governing the point - will not allow carbide to be carried below deck. This product must not be allowed to become moistened in any way; and, therefore, if the company is compelled to place it on the deck it has to incur considerable expense by using airtight and watertight casks as containers. The material that comes from Norway and Sweden is carried as ordinary cargo in the holds of ships, and is sometimes, I believe, shipped as ballast. I am prepared to publicly make this pledge on behalf of the company : That if it breaks away from the conditions in the slightest degree the Minister will be at liberty to lift the embargo. </para>

                            <para>- Only one small vessel. Thiscompany has enough to carry on its business as producers of &#39; calcium  carbide  without entering the shipping business, and it has only undertaken its own shipping because it has been forced to. The Minister has quoted some figures in relation to the prices ruling to-day. In New Zealand, where they are not producing and where no duty is imposed, &#163;40 per ton is being charged. In Great Britain, the price varies from &#163;30 to &#163;35 per ton, and in America, from &#163;28 16s. to &#163;35. Comparing these prices with that being charged by the Tasmanian company, it will be seen that we are obtaining carbide at a cheaper rate than any other part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- This company is using electric power at an exceedingly high voltage, and it takes 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit of heat to produce carbide. That temperature must be maintained continuously, otherwise the electrodes would explode, and the whole process be interfered with; The full capacity of the plant is between 7,000 and 8,000 tons, and the former quantity is, I believe, the Australian consumption: The company is endeavouring to increase the consumption to enable it to give its plant a full run. The price it is charging is lower than is being asked in any other part of the British Dominions, and is 20 per cent. cheaper than what New Zealand is paying. I know, as a matter of fact, that owing to the dumping that is taking place - no matter, at what price this company will sell it - the imported article is being sold at a lower rate. </para>

                            <para>- The pre-war price was less than half the present price. Had not the Tasmanian Government helped these people with advances to enable them to pay wages, the works would have closed already; and if they do close, we shall have to pay as much for carbide as they are now paying in New Zealand, namely, &#163;40 per ton, although importation there is free. This is a local company, the members of which have put every shilling they possess into the business, and if the motion is not passed this  week - the Minister for the Navy will bear me out in what I am saying - the works will close next Monday. </para>
