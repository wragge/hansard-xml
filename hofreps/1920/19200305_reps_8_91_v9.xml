                    <para>Mr.RYAN (West Sydney) [11.2].- I quite understand the position, , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> though I thank you for the reminder. If I am allowed as much scope as the Prime Minister was given when speaking on the amendment, I shall be quite satisfied. I have been very interested in the debate, and have listened with particular interest to the speeches of those whom I might call the country members sitting on this side of the House, especially these of the honorable members for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lavelle),Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> and Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> It has been impressed upon  me in a striking manner, and has been made clear to the public of Australia, that the programme of the Labour party embraces all the interests of the community, and that the members of the party regard the interests of the industrial workers and of the men on the land as identical. I am sorry that I have not had an opportunity to hear more speeches from the members who sit on the corner benches on the Ministerial side of the Chamber. I listened with pleasure to the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who took the Ministry to task for its departure from parliamentary government. </para>

                        <para>- It is some test of merit, but from the Country party I expected something broader. I would expect a real Country party to express some of the sentiments that have been uttered by members sitting on this side of the Chamber, in speeches like those of the honorable members for Hume/ Werriwa, and Angas. The criticism that came from the so-called Country party - I do not use the term in any offensive way - was very limited. No doubt, before the debate concludes, or on some future occasion - of which they must be the judges, because I do not for a moment wish to suggest to them what they should do - we may hear from them broader and more trenchant criticism of the general administration of this Government. The remarks of the honorable member for Cowper were put forward, I thought, rather timorously. He spoke of obtaining an assurance from some Minister, and, no doubt, referred to the matter with some inside knowledge, so that we may have such an assurance. I shall reserve any comments upon the promises of the Ministry until we have an opportunity of knowing what they are. There could be no' better illustration of the degree to which the Ministry has departed from parliamentary practice and control than the statement of the Prime Minister yesterday that in the whole of his experience he had not known procedure such as has been adopted by this party in connexion with the Government's request for Supply. Apparently he has entirely forgotten the time-honoured constitutional practice which prevails in the British House of Commons and in every Parliament of the oversea dominions of the British Empire. It is stated in the 11th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> on page 608, that- </para>

The Prime Minister has apparently entirely forgotten this constitutional usage, and he has told us that in his experience he has never seen the course followed that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>I expected that honorable members on the corner benches would have directed some criticism to the failure of the Government to properly protect the primary producer. I shall not occupy much time with that portion of my remarks dealing with the matter, but I would remind honorable members and the people of Australia that this Government is responsible to a large extent for the present shortage of sugar in this country, and I shall show how. When the agreement was made between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Queensland with regard to the acquisition of the sugar crop the Commonwealth Government insisted on the inclusion of a provision, under which there should be no extension of the milling power ; there was to be no further production. The inclusion of that provision was strenuously opposed by the Queensland Government, but the Commonwealth Government insisted on it, and it was finally accepted under protest. </para>

                    <para>Mr.RYAN.- The honorable gentleman may be able to say something about it, but the documents relating to it speak for themselves. That clause was included in the agreement at the behest of the Commonwealth Government, under protest from the Queensland Government. These facts are undeniable. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may say that, but the fact remains that that clause was included in the agreement, and I speak advisedly from an intimate knowledge of the matter, seeing that I was Premier of Queensland at the time. T know what the feelings of the growers were in regard to that clause; and if any future agreement is made they, and also the Queensland Government, will be insistent that no such limitation shall be included. Why was such a clause inserted? Who proposed, who instigated it? It was a most extraordinary stipulation that Queensland should produce no more sugar than she was then producing. I am quite satisfied myself that the provision was put in at the suggestion of the big refining interests, probably the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. While on this subject I wish to remove a wrong impression that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has created with regard to the origin of this agreement. The honorable gentleman is constantly claiming credit for having suggested it; but he knows perfectly well that the suggestion for the acquisition of the sugar by the Commonwealth Government came from me, as Premier of Queensland, as soon as my Government was returned to power in May, 1915. In case there should be any doubt, I have here the Prime Minister's own manuscript letter, which speaks for itself. It was written on the 3rd. July, 1915, and I shall quote relevant parts in order to show that it was the Queensland Government, and not the Commonwealth Government, who were responsible for the making of the agreement. This is his letter - 3rd July, 1915. </para>

                    <para>Last evening the Prime Minister, in his usual histrionic manner, interrupted the debate on this motion for the purpose of making a statement with regard to the financial position of Australia, and in order to inform the House that the Cabinet had agreed to send Home his colleague the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> on a certain mission. No doubt the honorable gentleman had all that information before the debate on this motion began yesterday, but he rose to make the statement at a time when, no doubt, he thought it would have some effect, not on honorable members of the Opposition, but on those honorable members who have their seats in the Government corner. </para>

                    <para>That statement discloses three things. It discloses how bad is the position into which the Government have got the finances of the Commonwealth. It illustrates their policy of " keep it dark," seeing that the information was in the hands of the Government long ago, and it should have been given to the people of Australia when the Government were asking the suffrages of the people. Imagine the honorable gentleman referring to the Queensland financial statement as having been kept back, and immediately afterwards making a statement which should have been disclosed to the people during the elections. </para>

                            <para>- Included in the Prime Minister's statement was a paragraph which I cannot allow to pass without notice. He referred to the Treasurer representing the Commonwealth " in the Imperial Cabinet in connexion with several important aspects of the Peace Treaty, including the German indemnity and the mandate for the Pacific Islands." There we have a definite and specific statement from the Government that a Commonwealth Minister of the Crown is to represent Australia " in the Imperial Cabinet." Is this the commencement of the establishment of Imperial Federation ? Honorable members may laugh at the suggestion, but any student of the matter knows that this is one of the methods advocated by the Round Table group in order to insidiously bring about Imperial Federation, and eventually take away some, not all, of our self-governing powers. I take it that if a Commonwealth Minister of the Crown takes his seat in the Imperial Cabinet, he will be bound by a majority decision. Is that not so? </para>

                            <para>- Then what is the good of him going there? I could understand a Minister going to London to represent the views of Australia, and to impress those views upon the Imperial Cabinet; but the statement made by the Prime Minister is that the Treasurer is going to London to represent Australia "in the Imperial Cabinet." It is all very well for the Prime Minister to exclaim "Oh!" but I am one of those who believe that he, and a great number of those supporting him, are insidiously working to bring about Imperial Federation, and reduce our self-governing powers. . I should be failing in my duty if I did not, at the earliest possible moment, enter my protest against such an innovation, lest it should appear that the Treasurer went to London and took his seat in the Imperial Cabinet without any protest being made by any member of this House. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection from the Country party is evidence that some of its members are only the tail of the Nationalist party. When the division bells ring we shall see where the Country party stands. Will its members vote with the representatives of the industrial workers and the workers on the land, or with the representatives of the profiteers and the middlemen? That is the only test, and I hope that we shall afford Country party members many opportunities during the life of this Parliament to show exactly where they stand. </para>

The balance-sheets of New South Wales and other States disclose that many of them are in a worse position than Queensland occupies ; in fact, Queensland is in a very good position, as has been demonstrated by the fact that it floated in London subsequent to the Federal election on the 13th December, a loan of £2,000,000, and the amount was doubly subscribed. I wonder could the Commonwealth do the same. And Queensland floated the loan without sending any special representative to London. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- If the financial position of Queensland had been rotten, the loan would not have been over-subscribed, no matter what the price was. An examination of statistics will disclose that during the twelve months from November, 1915, to November, 1916, representing the first year in office of the Government led by me, the cost of living in Queensland was reduced by 12.6 per cent. The Commonwealth Government then took over the matter of price fixing under the War Precautions Act. As soon as they did that the rise occurred in Queensland, just as it did in the other States. And, because Queensland had reduced the cost of living more than was the case in any other of the States, when the Federal authorities applied their War Precautions Act the percentage rise, of course, was greater in Queensland. Then they went round the country blaming us for that which they themselves were responsible. Examination also shows that in Queensland, not only was the cost of commodities reduced, but wages rose higher than in any other State. That fact is shown by reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> figures as under :  - </para>

                        thus demonstrates that rents were lower in Queensland than anywhere else. Here are further statistics, having to do with the amounts standing to the credit of depositors in the Savings Banks. They show that that credit is higher in Queensland than in any other State. Queensland is shown as holding in her Savings Banks, for each individual, the sum of £50 15s. 8d. The individual total in New South Wales is £45 10s.8d. ; South Australia, £37 10s. 3d. ; Victoria, £37 7s. 7d. ; Western Australia, £34 5s. 3d.; and Tasmania, £31 3s. 7d. The Savings Bank is the" institution to which one naturally refers in order to ascertain the comparative wealth of the workers throughout Australia. If we examine the banking institutions of the other States we find that general deposits have very considerably increased, but those are the accounts of the wealthy people. In Queensland, where there is very equitable distribution of wealth, the amounts standing to the credit of the workers, in the Savings Banks, average much higher than in any other part of the Commonwealth.
                    </para><para>But, after all, what is the best test with regard to this misrepresentation of Queensland? The best test lies in the hands of the Queensland people themselves - the people who are on the spot, who know all the facts, and are not so likely to be misled by misrepresentation. Now, what is their judgment ? </para><interjection>

The honorable member has been too long in South Africa; he does not know what is going on in Australia. In 1915 we went to the country with twenty-four in our ranks, and the Denham party numbered forty-eight. We were returned to power with forty-five adherents, and our opponents totalled twenty-seven. We again went to the country on 16th March, 1918, and what was the result? We were again returned to power, with forty-eight members - an increase of three; and our opponents were reduced to twenty-four. Now, what has the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wienholt)</inline> to say to those last election returns ? We retained power in Queensland with a majority of two to one of the elected representatives of the people. </para>

                            <para>- It is a long way to look forward to the next three years, or until the next Federal elections, whenever they may be ; but during that period the people will have had the scales removed from their eyes concerning the campaign of misrepresentation of Queensland. There was never more malicious misrepresentation associated with any contest than in regard to the last Federal elections. </para>

                            <para>- That is the case, particularly with regard to the State of Queensland, and to myself individually. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had_ the audacity, standing at this table yesterday, to talk .about the Ryan 'Thousand. He turned to one of his colleagues, alleging that he did not remember the number of enlistments. Was it seventy-eight, or was it only twenty ? Then he raked up the old lie about parading those recruits around a room. The facts are that when the Commonwealth Government asked me, through their Minister for recruiting, to allow my name to be associated with the raising of 1,000 men for service at the Front, 1 agreed to the project. And the Commonwealth recruited, not seventy-eight, or twenty, but they themselves have informed me upon official documents, despatched from their own officers, that there were well over 400 who enlisted, notwithstanding the attempts made to discredit the Ryan Thousand. If I went on the platform the criticism was hurled at me that I was hindering recruiting, and that I ought to get off; if I did not mount the platform I was told that I ought to do so. It did not matter what I did or refrained from doing, -my action or inaction was wrong in the eyes of some of those who support honorable members opposite, in the eyes of those who wrap the Union Jack around themselves for political purposes, and who stalk about the country thanking God that they are not as other men arn. I wrote to the Minister controlling the Federal Electoral Department with regard to the misrepresentation surrounding recruiting for the Thousand, and I asked him to institute proceedings against the official publicist of the National party. The people of Australia would be surprised to think that the Prime Minister should not have had the facts within hi» own knowledge, seeing that the communications were from an official under his own, Minsterial colleague controlling the Electoral Department. How could <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> have been under the impression that there were only twenty enlistments, when, as a matter of fact, he' must have known that, there were well over 400 ? </para>

You make it difficult for me, sir, if I am to be called upon to dissect the Prime Minister's speech in order to ascertain what part of his remarks had reference to the motion-, and what portions were addressed to the amendment. The Prime Minister will admit, I think, that nothing which he said concerning myself had reference to any portion of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra. At all events, I am satisfied with what I have Already said concerning enlistments for the Thousand, and I will take the opportunity, whenever it presents itself, to expose the misrepresentation employed during the recent Federal campaign, not only regarding that matter, but with respect to many others. I propose to reply to the Prime Minister's remarks on profiteering. Shortly put, he says we have no power to deal with profiteering. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member does not know it, it is a reflection on his legal knowledge. Yesterday, he said that I had no constitutional knowledge, notwithstanding the fact that during the four and a half years that I was Premier and Attorney-General of the State of Queensland, there were several very important constitutional cases in which the Government of Queensland and also the Commonwealth were involved, some of which were tested by the High Court of Australia, and others by the Privy Council, and that I did not send someone else to argue them on behalf of the Government, but argued them myself, and was legal adviser to the State Government myself. The right honorable gentleman knows that in every case the State Government was successful in the final Court of Appeal, whether it was in the High Court in the stock case, or in the Privy Council in the Mooraberrie cattle case. The question of profiteering is so important that I want to make it definitely clear that in my opinion, which I think will be accepted on matters affecting the Constitution of Australia, notwithstanding the comments of the Prime Minister, not only by supporters of the Labour Party, but also by a majority of supporters of his own party, the Commonwealth has power to legislate in order to deal with profiteering, under the existing Constitution, apart from the War Precautions Act. </para>

                            <para>- I want to make perfectly clear what I say, and to put my argument on record, so that it can be examined and tested and, if possible, refuted. Secondly, I say there is no possible doubt that the Government has power to deal with the matter under the War Precautions Act. If we want any  evidence of the opinion of the Prime Minister we find it in the regulation recently issued to deprive the members of the Institute of Marine Engineers of the use of their funds. I refer honorable members to the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution which, I claim, give the power to deal with profiteering. Section 51 provides - </para>

The Commonwealth Government have power over exportation and importation, and a great many of the evils of profiteering arise from the fact that, while goods are <inline font-style="italic">in transitu</inline> between overseas countries and Australia, they are sold and resold at huge profits. The Commonwealth has ample power to prevent that, and it is unnecessary for me to dilate upon the powers the Government possesses over exportation; but with the authority to take a census and get statistics they can secure all the requisite information for carrying out any of the powers referred to in section 51. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Quite apart from the fact whether it was correct or ' not, the Prime Minister, as Attorney-General of the Government of that day, was its legal adviser, which probably accounts for the bad legal advice that was given with regard to the powers of the Government. I understand that the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> and no doubt also the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and others, held views entirely different from the Prime Minister with regard to those powers, but the fact remains that before the Ministry of which he was a member took any steps towards dealing with price fixing, under the War Precautions Act, the right honorable gentleman was away in England, and the Government, I suppose, had to look to some one else for advice as to what their legal powers were. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government were badly advised as to what their legal  powers were, then the Prime Minister himself was responsible for it. I can understand that with his limited legal knowledge he might easily, make a mistake, but whoever was responsible, the fact remains that after the High Court of Australia had given that decision there was no excuse for the failure of the Government to use their powers to check profiteering. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Government did pass certain regulations but that on the signing of the Armistice they were relaxed in response to public opinion. In response to public opinion, from what quarter were those War Precautions Regulations repealed? They were repealed at the instance of the profiteers, who provided the funds to put honorable members opposite in power. </para>

The Prime Minister said yesterday that the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> when Minister for Trade and Customs, was unable to obtain certain information which he sought to obtain by means of circulars issued under the census and statistics power. But no matter how limited his legal knowledge, he must know that the honorable member did not seek' that information under the authority of any Statute. If the Commonwealth Parliament chooses to pass legislation requiring the supplying of these statistics there would then be the -necessary authority, and those to whom the circulars were sent would have, under penalty, to furnish the information. </para>

                            <para>- Then I did not hear it. That case, as he quoted it, has no bearing on the point I am making ; but the dictum of the Privy Council, on appeal, backs up to the hilt all for which I am contending. It was held by the High Court that the manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company could not be compelled to answer certain questions submitted to him. The case then went on appeal to the Privy Council, which came to the decision that the Act itself - the Royal Commissions Act - was invalid. But the Privy Council also held that if the Act were properly drafted it would be valid. There we have another testimonial - a monument - to the legal ability arid the draftsmanship of the Attorney-General, or whoever he was, who was responsible for the framing of that measure. The Lords of the Privy Council - and I propose to quote passages from their judgment, so that honorable members may read them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> specifically held that information, having for its purpose the carrying out of existing powers under the Constitution could be validly demanded. They held that companies, persons, and corporations could be compelled to give, the information so long as it was required for the purposes of the existing powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. One of the existing powers is in relation to taxation, and for the purposes of taxation the Government can obtain every detail of information they desire. </para>

It is almost in the nature of a </para><para class="block">Defence power. The Government have full and complete power over Defence, and that carries with it all incidental powers, such as the power to say how the war debt is to be defrayed, who shall pay it, and in what amounts, and whether they shall pas3 on their taxation. And, after all, is not this profiteering the passing on of taxation. It is admitted that the power exists to prevent  that-then  why not prevent it? It is because honorable gentlemen on the other side hold their seats by the support of money from the profiteers. We cannot expect, in the circumstances,- that they will do anything against it. But, in order to deceive the people of Australia, they ' tei E us that they have no power to deal with it. There are certain powerful sections of the press, from whom I should have expected something better, who make the same contention. I do think that there are some sections of the press who really desire to find out what are the facts with regard to this matter, and who are sincere, but they take up- the attitude that the necessary power does not exist in the Commonwealth to deal with profiteering.. I say that the power does exist, and all the special pleading of the Prime Minister for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and for the other capitalist interests cannot alter that fact. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman would never have accepted any such amendments of the original proposals.  His  last proposals included provisions which he specifically objected to when the original proposals of the Labour party were before this House. They were subject to conditions as to time of duration. . They were subject to the holding of a convention the constitution of which no one knew, or whether it would be appointed at all, and if it was not appointed, the proposals would have fallen to the ground, after being responsible for a dislocation of the relations between the States and the Commonwealth. In fact, if the later proposals had been carried, I fear that something would have happened which, in my opinion, would have discredited any genuine attempt on a subsequent occasion to amend the Constitution in the way desired. The later proposals were in the nature of a double headed penny. The Tight honorable gentleman had a majority in the Senate, and he said to the electors, " Give the Commonwealth powers which cannot extend beyond three years. If the members of the Labour party are returned to power they will not be able to use them, because, the profiteers in the Senate will block them, but if we get them we can use them to deal with the profiteer." </para>

He shakes his head. I repeat, however, that I do not intend to descend to personalities. I claim to represent the workers of Australia, and I remind honorable members supporting the Government that I did not follow precedent in resigning the Premiership and the portfolio of Attorney-General of Queensland to come into this Parliament. Had I followed precedent, it was within my power to take some fat billet. I did not do that. Oh the contrary, I responded to an invitation from the representatives of the large body of the workers of Australia to enter the Federal Parliament. I did  not  leave the Queensland Government when they were in any difficulties, struggling along not knowing whether they would "live or not, because, as a matter of fact, they had a majority of two to one, and they are likely to have that majority for at least another fifteen months, and, no doubt, longer. </para><para>There was much misrepresentation concerning me during the elections. It was said, for instance, that I had been a supporter of the Black Labour party in Queensland. That is not true. I was never a supporter of the Black Labour party, and my opponents know it. I challenge them to produce any evidence in support of their charge. I joined the Labour party in 1905 or 1906 because I believed in its policy, and I think I have shown since that I have been true to it. I have stood for the Labour party during the most trying period of its history in Australia. I kept the flag flying over at least one Government during the most strenuous period in the history of Labour in this country. I can say, too, that I have neve!" failed to stand up for its principles. [ have not " squibbed " when any difficulty was confronting us. I knew the danger aud risk confronting me when I left the State Premiership to enter Federal politics ; but, sitting on this side of the </para><para class="block">House as a private member for West Sydney, I have a clearer conscience than has the right honorable the Prime Minister sitting there in command of the Treasury bench as an instrument of the profiteering interests. I hurl back at my opponents the charges of disloyalty that have been levelled against me. The right honorable gentleman and some of his supporters during the last election campaign referred to the disloyalty of myself and the Labour party generally. We wanted, so they said, to break up the British Empire. They know perfectly well that there is no more loyal organization in Australia than the Labour party. We have no desire to break up the British Empire. On the contrary, I desire to make the bounds of freedom wider yet, and give a greater measure of self-government to certain portions of the Empire ; because I believe that, in doing this, we shall strengthen the bonds by making the people more satisfied'. I know, too, that to bring about these" reforms we must rely upon public opinion, and I have no wish to attain this end without that indorsement. I have sufficient confidence in the broadmindedness, the intelligence, and fairness of all the people within the British Empire. I believe they are quite prepared to extend a greater measure of self-government to certain portions of our Empire. We should be able to hold aud advocate these views without having ourselves misrepresented ; but the right honorable gentleman and his followers have gone up and down the country misleading the people in regard to this issue. I challenge any honorable members in this House or any of those who have been acquainted with me during my public career in Queensland to point to any act of mine, during the four and a half years of my Premiership in that State, that was influenced in any way by any man's creed or faith. They cannot do it. I was Premier of Queensland by the unanimous vote of the State Labour party, and I left that position in the height of my ,power and of my own volition to serve the people in the National Parliament. Tt :s a long road to go, but ths people will yet know that what I say is- true, for I intend that they shall have an opportunity of learning the truth. I come into this House with clean hands. There is no "Beady in- cident" for me to explain; no wheat scandal for me to defend; I come to this House with no broken pledges. If the party to which I belong is defeated its defeat ia only temporary. Talk about sectarianism ! I have too much faith in my Protestant brethren to think that sectarianism can defeat the Labour party. I know them too well. I believe that, taking them in the bulk, the people are too broadminded to allow these tactic3 to be successful for long. They will be checkmated as soon as the people learn the truth, as soon as they begin to feel the pinch of the shoe or the tightening up of the belt which must inevitably follow as a result of the policy which this Government have adopted in Australia. That awakening will perhaps come sooner than some honorable gentlemen opposite expect. </para><para>I am not going to reflect on the Prime Minister except to remind him of his claim that he left the Labour party over the Conscription issue. I do not want to enter into a discussion upon that subject, but I say that there was no need for him, even if he did leave the Labour party over Conscription, to go back on all the other principles of Labour. There is no doubt he has done that. He may be the willing or unwilling - I would not like to think him the willing - instrument, but the fact remains that at present he is the instrument of the profiteers. He sits there and gibes a.t me about the position I occupy in this House, as an indication of my ability and strategy. I can afford- to ignore his gibes. I value position only because of the power it gives me to be able to defend the interests of the workers. As soon as I find that I am unable to do that, I shall get out of politics, and I shall be able to live out of politics better than I can live in them. If I had my way the Leader of the Government would be chosen by the vote of the rank and file of the Ministerial party just as the Labour party stands for the election of the mayor by the ratepayers. May I apply that test to the Prime Minister? If he were to take a plebiscite of the party which he leads in this House where would he be? He would not be its leader. If he had to submit to a vote of the party that he leads in this House, would he be its leader? Do we not know that the </para><para>Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is one of the real leaders behind him, and that he possesses the power to destroy him whenever he chooses to exercise it? </para><continue>

                            <para>- Perhaps the Prime Minister will inform me whether he made his attack upon me on the motion or on the amendment? The right honorable gentleman is silent, and, therefore, I will not pursue that line of argument. In conclusion, I merely wish to say that I conceive it to be my duty to take every opportunity - and particularly these well-recognised opportunities - to place before Parliament and the people of this country the true position of affairs, because we must all realize that ultimately the decision of political matters rests with our constituencies. I propose, therefore, to use <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and every instrumentality that I can, in order to enable the people of Australia to realize how far they have been deceived by the Government, and what is the real position. I am satisfied that when that position is known to them we shall be able to snap our fingers at all. efforts to raise sectarian issues. I have an abiding faith in the broad-mindedness, the good sense, and the intelligence of tha people of this country. They will stand up for what is right, I do not care whether they are Protestants or Catholics, Englishmen, Irishmen, or Scotchmen. They will stand up for what is right eventually, no matter from whom the proposals may emanate. They will judge them on their merits, and I feel confident that when they have another opportunity of so deciding - if this House will not decide, and I do not anticipate that it will - they will come to a decision which will be more in the interests of the people than that at which they arrived on the 13th December last. </para>

                        <para>.- However much honorable members may disagree with the views expressed by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan),</inline> I am sure that all will re-echo the opinion that his entrance to this Chamber has added considerably to its debating power.  His  utterances to-day upon our Constitution remind me forcibly of the early days of the Federation, when the powers of the Commonwealth under ih©- Constitution used -frequently to come under review in the Senate, where there were then no less than ten lawyers, most of them eminent. May I mention their names? They included <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Downer, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake, Senator Harney, Senator Clemons, Senator Ewing, Senator Keating,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> It was not an infrequent thing to find these gentlemen equally divided upon questions involving the powers of the Commonwealth under our Constitution. There would be five barristers on one side and an equal number on the other. I imagine that there will always be a twilight zone between the daylight of State rights and the darkness of the Constitution about which lawyers will disagree. We, who  have been in this Parliament for a great number of years, have been led to believe by our experiences that under our Constitution the Commonwealth does not possess the powers which the honorable member for West Sydney thinks that it does possess. If the honorable member is right, he certainly has a very large body of legal opinion opposed to him. What had those who favoured an amendment of the Constitution to guide them in regard to this matter? We all know that the Railway and Tramway Employees Association of New South Wales desired to be registered as .an industrial organization under the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The case went before the  President  of -that tribunal in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who asked, " Why should a State be exempted from- the operation of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court?" But subsequently the High Court decided that the provision of the arbitration law per.mitting the registration of State railway servants was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of our Constitution, and therefore the applicant association could not be registered. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney spoke of the Commonwealth power over foreign£ corporations. But he has apparently forgotten that we cannot exercise power over local corporations. In his search through the lawbooks, he has evidently overlooked the case of Archibald Currie &amp; Co., of the State of Victoria. That company is a joint stock company registered in Victoria, and owning a line of steam-ships that is registered in Melbourne. These steamers trade between Australia, Calcutta, and South Africa. The officers of the company resided in Australia, and were engaged here, but the ships' articles were filled in and signed in Calcutta. The officers, though not entitled to be discharged in Australian ports, were allowed to leave at such ports if they wished to do so, subject to the consent of the master. The ships did no Inter-State trade, but occasionally made short trips from Calcutta to other Indian ports. The company desired the Arbitration Court to settle a dispute which involved questions of wages and hours and conditions of labour. The High Court held that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court had no jurisdiction to determine that dispute, holding that the vessels engaged in such a trade are not ships whose first port of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth within the meaning of section 51 of our Constitution Act. </para>

                    <para>The federated saw-mill employees of Australia took action against James Moore and Company, and the High Court decided that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court could not make an enforceable award which was inconsistent with the determination of a Wages Board, empowered by a State Statute to fix a minimum rate of wages. Surely the honorable gentleman who has contended this morning that the Commonwealth Government has all the powers which he said it had. must realize that if the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has no power to make an award which is inconsistent with the determination of a State Wages Board, we cannot possibly intervene in the way he has suggested. </para>
                    <para>The boot trade employees of Australia spent thousands of pounds in trying to get a wages log that would settle the rates of wages throughout Australia. Time after time they went to the Court, and the  President  of the Court made an award, but on appeal to the High Court it was decided that the award was in several matters invalid and beyond the powers of the  President  of the Arbitration Court, and therefore beyond the powers of the Constitution. </para>
                    <para>Take now the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barker and McKay,</inline> which has a bearing upon the honorable gentleman's contention that the Commonwealth Government can settle profiteering by means of its taxation power. This case will also answer the interjection of the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McDonald).</inline> It arose out of the efforts of the Australian Labour party to give the workers of Australia some of the benefits arising out of the Protection given by the Customs Tariff - to my mind a very admirable thing, because if we give Protection to the Australian manufacturer, we ought to endeavour, if we can do so, to pass on some of the benefits to the employees engaged in the protected industry. The Commonwealth Parliament tried to do this. </para>

                            <para>- Then I can only repeat that the Constitution will always provide grounds for debate, in which we shall find the legal fraternity almost equally divided, with very eminent lawyers on both sides, as to the powers conferred by it. We endeavoured to deal with Trusts and Combines, and found that it was impossible. The coal and shipping companies were combining to restrict the output of coal and to decide the price at which it was to be sold. The companies were called upon to answer certain questions, and when they refused were fined by the Court. An appeal was lodged in the High Court, and that Court decided that the Commonwealth had not the power to invade the field of State law as to domestic trade, the carrying on of which is within the capacity of trading and financial corporations formed under the laws of the States. In other words, said the late Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Samuel Griffith)-</inline></para>

Some of the writers in the Official Labour press have said that I delivered a certain speech in my district to secure a place in the Ministry. They are very much mistaken. </para>

                            <para>- Before I was elected to the Ministry I was extremely anxious to be a member of a Government. I would have been disappointed had I gone out of political life without having occupied such a position; but after twelve months' experience, I can assure honorable members that I am not now seeking such favours. Because, after all, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Duffy said in a poem he wrote many years before he was appointed to the High Court Bench, promotion is only, " the right to labour at the oar." That is my feeling regarding holding office as a Minister of the Crown. If I had my choice, I would like to end my political life, not lagging superfluous on the political stage, but able to come into the House and say what I think ought to be said and don© in the interests of all Australia - free and untrammelled by any party, and responsible only to the electors of Capricornia, the constituency I represent. I may not be able to do that. I may be compelled! to join a political party, for the position of an independent member is a peculiar one. The public wants its parliamentary representatives to join some political party, and to be prepared to take the blame for the sins of that party, as well as the credit for its good deeds. </para>

                    <para>If the Labour party had wished to defeat this Government, it would have accepted my advice, which was to come to some arrangement with a third party. It must be remembered that the formation of political parties is merely a means to an end. Parties are created to secure the legislation set out in their programme. How can a party which is not in a majority get its proposals for legislation passed into laws? Is it not the plain duty of such a party to get into touch with others by whose help they may hope to carry out their programme? To my suggestion the Labour party said, "No, we are independent, and intend to stand by ourselves, as a class party." I regret that decision. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Labour party has done a great deal of good for this Commonwealth. Before it was formed, no political party in any of the States had put forward any proposal for legislation to ameliorate the conditions of the masses engaged in industry. It was only after the formation of the Labour party that other political parties felt that they must recognise the political necessities of the people. </para>
                    <para>But the Labour party has altered its methods of late. There was a time when it would coalesce with those whose views were near to its own, though it will not do so to-day. The assistant secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> J. Holloway, says that compromise means sacrifice. It does not mean sacrifice to the people; it means sacrifice only to some men in Parliament, and to some others who hope to enter Parliament. There are only about a dozen Ministerial positions, and, consequently, when a coalition is mooted, there are men in Parliament who say, " I have no chance of getting into the Ministry that it is proposed to form, and, therefore, I shall vote against any coalition." Then, outside, there are other men who say, " The proposed coalition between the Labour party and the Farmers party will mean that the candidates of the Farmers party cannot be opposed by Labour candidates at the nest election, and this will deprive us of a chance of getting into Parliament, so we shall oppose the coalition.'' I regret that the Labour party has taken this stand, because, while it remains a class party, and is isolated, it must stay in Opposition for a very long time. </para>

                            <para>- He is educating men into the belief that the workers can improve their conditions only by direct action. That is the Gospel of Despair, and the honorable member must know it, although, possibly, when in an emotional state, he may feel that he would like to blow up everything, bring about the original chaos, and start again. The fault of the Labour movement to-day is, that the direct actionists are to be found everywhere in it. They are on the executive which lately expelled me. . Direct action means the doing away with parliamentary institutions, and the substituting  of  Soviets.  Yet everything that the working classes of Australia have gained they have gained through the trade unions, by political action, and the use of parliamentary and municipal institutions. Is it not wrong of honorable members to go about the country preaching the doctrine of direct action? The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> does not mean what he says. He is not prepared to take a rifle and lead a crowd on to some revolutionary movement, but he is prepared to preach revolution. </para>

                        <para>.- Before the lunch adjournment I was about to explain how I came to hoist the flag "Socialism in Our Time." After these words I wrote " That is to say, State Cooperation and Municipal Co-operation in Our Time." I speak from memory, but I believe I also added "As much State Co-operation as we can get in our day and generation." After the motto were set out the planks of the Labour platform of the time. Of course, we did not then have one-adult-one-vote; nor had we any Factories Acts or early closing in Queensland. I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Stephens, proprietor and editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Bookfellow,</inline> who was then editing the Red Page in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> expressed the opinion that the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> as conducted by myself for a period of five years, had had a great deal to do with creating the solidity and strength of the Labour movement in Queensland. Such is the jealousy even in the Labour movement that the motto " Socialism in Our Time " was removed in 1899 by the editor who followed me, never to be restored. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>What is the use of this House taking up any more time discussing what are our powers under the Constitution? The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> contends that we have power to deal with profiteering; but profiteering is a great deal more difficult to deal with than many people imagine. I am sure that it cannot be dealt with by means of taxation, and I doubt very much whether we can succeed by fixing prices. In  waT  time, no doubt, fixing prices may be more or less successfully managed; but to fix prices in peace time is an entirely different matter. For example, if we try to fix the price of gas, the result to the general community, who use gas, is poorer lighting; and if we try to fix the price of meat, the result is a supply of inferior quality - I mean, of course, when services and goods are distributed by private persons. There is only one way, to my mind, in which to lower prices, and that, as I have frequently said in the House, is for the Government to undertake to supply the services or goods in competition with the monopoly or combination of persons who have raised prices. If I am asked  for  an illustration, I refer to the Commonwealth Bank. What would be the use, in the absence of the Commonwealth Bank, of fixing the rate of interest that should be charged by the banks or money-lenders? What  would happen would be a private agreement between the lender and the borrower. The lender would express himself as dissatisfied with the security offered, and would arrange to take the rate of interest according to law, but, in addition, to be privately paid a bonus, and he would deduct the bonus from the principal before he handed it to the borrower. The Commonwealth Bank, however, enters into competition with the private banks, and if it fixes the rate of interest at 6 per cent., the private institutions have to follow suit. That is the only way in which profiteering can be dealt with. "We are told that the Commonwealth has power to nationalize a monopoly; yet on three different occasions a majority of electors and a majority of the States have declined to give the Commonwealth the power. What is to be done? Let us get back to the States, in most of which there is one-adult-one-vote, and allow them to try for success where the Commonwealth has failed. In any case, it is no use trying to abolish anything until a majority is in favour of the abolition. A little while ago the people of Queensland were asked to abolish the Legislative Council, and by a tremendous majority they turned down the proposal. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> if he has taken the trouble to inquire as to who will vote for the motion, knows that he cannot carry the amendment. He is really giving a smack in the face to the Country party, in view of the notice of motion given by the Leader of that party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> and I imagine that he will not expect the Country party to' vote for the  amendment. The division will merely disclose to the general public the smashing defeat suffered by the Labour party at the last election. It comprises now only twenty-six members out of 111 in the Senate and House of Representatives, and those who vote for the amendment to-day will probably number not more than twenty-three. We ought to cease going over the old ground just now. It is useless to recapitulate the past sins of the Government. They have a mandate from the people: the Ministerial party is the strongest in the House. The Government come before us and say tha.t they are prepared to do certain things which are outlined in the Governor-General's Speech. Every hour we spend in talking about the past sins of the Government means delay in the payment of the war . gratuity to the soldiers, which all parties had promised to pay at the earliest possible moment, and we shall be depriving the widows and orphans of the money we undertook to give them. </para>
                    <para>There are certain matters to be dealt with in regard to which the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth are undoubted. There is the gratuity and repatriation; a great deal has to be done in restoring our soldiers to civil life. We have, power to deal with a Protectionist Tariff; that is our first line pf industrial defence. There are the financial and banking problems; We have complete power to deal with banking. A duty devolves upon us to consider the financial situation and the extent to which the issue of p.aper money is responsible for high prices. The Commonwealth is like a man who is having a good time by increasing his overdraft. The nation is borrowing money, and we shall not be able to cease' borrowing for a time, because we cannot expect to raise by taxation the difference between our income and expenditure, and for some time it will be necessary for lis to .borrow in order to pay our way. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is to go to London to inquire into' the financial situation, for the purpose, I suppose, of. ascertaining to what amount and upon what conditions money can be borrowed abroad. </para>
                    <para>We have power to strengthen the Inter-State Commission. We all thought that that body would be able to do a great deal of good; it is comprised of three very able and earnest men, but  they  found themselves absolutely without any power to enforce their decisions. We ought to give them power to carry out the work for which they were appointed. </para>
                    <para>We have constitutional power to deal with the Commonwealth line of steamships. I very much doubt if we have power to engage in Inter-State shipping, but we have power to own and control an overseas line of ships, and we ought to give attention to that matter. </para>
                    <para class="block">We can apply ourselves to the question of immigration and decide what class of immigrant is to be assisted to come into the country. The representation of the Territories, the number of representatives they are to have, and the extent of their voting power in this Parliament are matters requiring attention. We have power to create new States, with the consent of the Stages, and I favour devoting attention to .that matter. External affairs and our relation with foreign Powers, the League of Nations, the defence of Australia, how many air-ships and submarines we shall have, and the efficiency or obsoleteness of the Dreadnought - all these are questions to which this Parliament could devote attention with great advantage to the Commonwealth. It is futile for us to dwell on the past sins of the Government.  In my opinion, they ought to be allowed a fair show to carry out their political programme. I shall give them that fair show, and I intend to vote for the Government against the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I had not intended to speak on this amendment, but I feel that probably the mind of the Blouse has been to some extent overawed by constitutional arguments on the question of price fixing. We have had from the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> a very ingenious contribution to the debate, and I desire to analyze his remarks and see how far they take us towards a solution of the high cost of living. That this Parliament may have constitutional power to deal with .the cost of living is one thing, but that it may have effective power is another.  As laymen, it is our duty to submit these legal and constitutional problems to practical analysis. The honorable member for West Sydney said that we had power to deal with taxation, export and import trade, statistics, and postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services. Admitting that these powers do exist, are they sufficient to effectively control the whole area affected by the cost of living? In effect, the honorable gentleman said that we had power over the import trade, and if we set up a blockade of Australia we should bring down the cost of living. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member was wily enough not to endeavour to show how, by 'controlling the import trade, we should reduce the cost of living. It is only in order that there may be a little more sincerity in regard to this matter that I am speaking. Never before in the history of the world was there less chance of getting cheap sea-borne goods into Australia. The cost of raw" material on the other side of the world was never dearer, the cost of fuel, the basis of manufacture, was never dearer, money was never dearer, wages were never higher, and shipping was never more scarce.  Having regard to this combination of circumstances, which means high-priced goods on the other side of the world, apart from the cost of bringing them to Australia, is it not humbug to tell the Australian people that they can expect to get cheap goods from overseas? </para>

                    <para>I wish to analyze the frame of mind of the honorable member for West Sydney, and to take Queensland as an illustration, for the - benefit of those who represent country interests, and whom I welcome into this House. Let us classify the various commodities, considering, first, foodstuffs. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> was not candid enough to-day to indicate that his policy would be to deprive the Australian producer of the world's parity. The policy of the Queensland Government, of which he was until recently the leader, is to bring down the cost of living by certain drastic means. Notwithstanding that today Australia has an Imperial contract for meat, the prices being 4$d. for beef, 5£d. for mutton, and 6£d, for lamb, the State Government of which the honorable member was until recently the head, by proclamation, expropriated all the rights, privileges, and interests of the owners of meat in the freezing chamber? of Queensland, and declared that for five years to come, irrespective of what the Australian parity might be, growers in this country should receive for home consumed meat only 3d. per. lb. </para>

                            <para>- I carried a copy of the proclamation in my pocket for weeks, and will produce it and hand it to the honorable gentleman. The proclamation was issued since the honorable member left the Queensland Government, but it is based upon what was his policy. I take it that he approves of the policy that for five years to come - notwithstanding devastating drought, . notwithstanding that the price of chaff has been £15 a ton, and that the people, if they succeed in saving their flocks and herds, will do so only by exhausting their last pound - producers are to be faced with the prospect of receiving one flat rate for their meat. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, there have been explanations. The Queensland Government have endeavoured to water down their attitude; but is the honorable member for West Sydney prepared, the while he coquettes with his friends in the corner, here, to say that the primary producer should have the benefit of the world's parity for all he raises in Australia for home consumption, as well as in respect to the exportable surplus? The honorable gentleman is dealing with the cost of living. Would he force the primary producer to carry a ruinous burden, in order to permit him to cheaply feed his followers in the city? Those followers of the honorable member yelled for cheap meat when he was in power in Queensland, whereupon his Government issued a proclamation and told their adherents they should have it. </para>

                            <para>- Because the honorable member announced in Sydney that he believed in our securing the world's parity for our exportable surplus. I followed with interest the constitutional arguments advanced by him; and I may add that all I know about constitutional lore is enough to enable me to listen intelligently to such able exponents as the honorable member for West Sydney and the Prime Minister. But I derive small comfort from an examination of the honorable member for West Sydney's schemes. He would hold up shipping; he would blockade Australia, in order to insure cheap supplies for his followers. He would hold up the post and telegraphic services; he would prevent trade and commerce from availing itself of those services; and yet he would expect business to carry on. By imposing additional taxation he hopes to bring down the cost of living. ' There was a time, during the war, when there was a good, clean public conscience, manifested and expounded by the representatives of the people in this chamber. Nobody desired to emerge from the conflict richer than he had entered it. There was a clean conscience, and no party politics. Then  came the imposition of the war-time profits tax, and it hoisted the cost of living more than anything else. Traders are human ; people engage in business for profit. Nobody in this chamber has yet defined just where fair profits end and profiteering commences. There have been lots of wild statements and all kinds of nostrums, but no one has been clever or candid enough to indicate where profiteering begins. </para>

                            <para>- It was based upon the same principles as the honorable gentleman has adopted. Analyzing the powers which the honorable member for West Sydney seeks to apply to trade and commerce, I am convinced that there would result only confusion; there could be only increased prices and cold comfort for the general community. While there is urgent need for greater production on the one hand, the holding up of public services, interference with shipping, and the discouragement generally of trade and commerce on the other hand would inevitably tend to confuse the whole situation - bad enough as it is at this moment. </para>

The honorable member for West Sydney said that if we found any firm guilty of profiteering we should deal with it under the powers we possess - by refusing it telephonic communication-, and so forth. Any one would think that would be the first time this Parliament had endeavoured to enforce its powers in order to prevent people from operating in a nefarious trade. We refuse the proprietors of Tattersalls sweeps the right to use the Post Office, and if a trading concern seeks to rob the people of the country, surely it is not wrong to tackle it in the way in, which this other supposed evil has been tackled. </para>

I am loath to believe that the British Government made such a demand ; but I am informed that, at the behest of certain members of the House of Commons, who have raised the point, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked our Government to kindly step into line in this particular matter. I hope I shall not be charged with any disloyalty to the Home people when I say that, considering the great amount of money Australia spent in connexion with the war, and the part it played in it, such an insult to the Australian public comes with, ill-grace from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Every honorable member should consider well whether we ought to permit this affront, for, as the Prime Minister put it, it means that it is thought the Australian people are not to be trusted to honour the bond into which they have entered. </para>

                            <para>- That may be; but we have given our bond to foot the bill for the maintenance of every soldier we put in the field from the time of his departure from our shores until his return. 1 wonder if all parts of the Empire have done the same. We have gone through the war without making any money out of it. Have other parts of the Empire done the same? Our wool growers, our wheat farmers, and our meat producers have given their product to help in the struggle at lower prices than other parts of the Empire received. But I have no desire to compare what we have done with what other Dependencies have done. We did what we did willingly and ungrudgingly. However, after having done so much, it is very unfair to Australia that we should receive such an "affront. If there are matters requiring adjustment I could understand the Home Government sending out a cablegram and a representative of the Commonwealth going from here to the Old Country to put these particular financial matters in order, and if our Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> does go to Great Britain I hope that he, as an Australian, will tell the people there that the Commonwealth will honour its obligations, as it has always done in the past. If I had my way that £42,000,000 would be paid" now. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish my utterance to be misinterpreted. If I had my way now, and it could be done, I would pay the money at once. During this debate much has been said as to the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to control prices and deal with profiteers, and the question of our constitutional powers has also been from time to time the subject of much argument in our Law Courts. It is being shown more clearly every day that it is -useless to play with our Constitution as the Government recently attempted to do. It is idle to adopt half measures. That has been my view from the&gt; inception of Federation. If we want to free trade and production in this country, if we want to solve the problems that confront us, we must ask the people themselves whether they are not tired of being governed by so many Parliaments. I shall not deal with the ramifications of our parliamentary system, but it is well known that almost every business man -and every industrial union, under the present system, has frequently to consult the lawyers, in order to ascertain whether their various enterprises are governed by State or Federal law. It has been said during this discussion that it costs many men more to prepare their income and land tax returns' than they have to pay by way of actual taxation. On every hand producers are hampered and harassed by conflicting decisions as to industrial and other disputes. The system of government in Australia is becoming more and more complex. One would think that the people of the different States were of different races, living wholly under differing conditions. My regret is that, at the outset, when Federation was first proposed, we did not go the whole way, and determine that in practice as well as in theory there should be a truly National Parliament. As it is, we are a National Parliament without national powers. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Because of artificial State boundaries, we have differing railway gauges and differential railway freights designed to divert produce from its natural ports, and to cause it to be carried over hundreds of miles of railway to particular State ports. There is only one course by which we can rid ourselves of these systems, and this is an opportune time for the National Parliament to take over national duties. There should be a devolution of the States, such as would permit of reasonable local government. With reasonable boundaries we should have local government in the truest sense of the term, and much less centralization than now obtains in the several States. In that way .we should have less of that centralized form of government which is  the curse of several of our larger States, and we would become a people with truly national aspirations. Would any one say that a Parliament meeting in Sydney is a truly local governing body for the whole of theState? Will any one say that of a Parliament meeting in Brisbane or Perth or Adelaide? I think not. The sooner we realize our present shortcomings in that regard, the sooner we shall recognise that the one way out of the difficulty is to rid ourselves of these existing encumbrances. Why should it be necessary, for instance, to have seven Governors in Australia? I have no desire that we should dissociate ourselves from the Empire; but surely one Governor for the whole of Australia would be a sufficient tie between the Homeland and ourselves. Then, again, what do we want with fourteen Houses of Parliament, with all their administrative machinery? Surely they should not be necessary to the government of a population of a little more than 5,000,000. We should shed these excrescences, and let trade have free and full play. Let us be in reality one people, with one destiny. </para>
