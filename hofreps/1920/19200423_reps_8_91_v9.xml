                        <para>- I humbly apologize to the honorable members of the Farmers party; I was speaking metaphorically, If it will please them better, I shall call them the " head " of the Ministerial party. Had there been a decrease in the strength of the Opposition party, I would not have objected to the lessening of its representation on this Committee, but we have, on the contrary, increased our strength. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that after the 30th June next there will be only one Labour senator. </para>

                        <para>- The Act itself fixes the  time  for its determination as the happening of a certain event, which  cannot  be brought about by honorable members, and certainly not by me. It must remain in force until that event has happened, or until legislation has been passed to amend it. Whether the Government will apply its provisions is a different question; and it will be for the honorable member to draw attention to any exercise of the powers conferred by it to which he may take exception. </para>

                    <para>- The anniversary of the day on which Australian  troops landed on Gallipoli is commemorated- by the Commonwealth by the making of it a public holiday. In Victoria, however, it falls this year on the day appointed for the eight hours' celebration, and as it was thought that the clashing of the two festivals might not conduce to harmony, and would not give the public a proper opportunity to express their appreciation of the deeds of the Anzacs, it was arranged to celebrate the landing to-day instead of next Monday. </para>

                    <para>- It has been privately suggested to me by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> that we might pay our tribute of respect to the memory of the heroes who fell at Gallipoli by rising and remaining silent for the space of one minute. I had anticipated that the Leader of the House would perhaps have asked leave to move a motion. I will, however, ask honorable members to stand silent in their places for a few moments as a tribute to the memory of the gallant heroes who fell at Gallipoli, and as a mark of honour and respect to those who still survive that memorable landing. </para>

                        <para>- It is presumed that the above question refers, to trainees of Senior Cadet age. Railway tickets are not issued, nor are any allowances made, except in the case of Senior Cadets proceeding to rifle ranges for the purpose of musketry, when rail tickets are issued. Attendance at ordinary parades does not, in the great majority of cases, involve any travelling. </para>

The Government of New Zealand, for some months past, have been pressing us. to permit the export of superphosphate to that country, as their stocks were completely exhausted, and they depend upon Australia for supplies. We are now permitting a limited quantity to go to New Zealand, but it is impossible to say what quantity will be exported, as it depends upon the consumption in Australia and the quantity of phosphate rock imported.

The construction of the divisional memorials was, however, taken in hand whilst the troops were still in France, it being the desire of members of the Australian Imperial Force to take part in the actual work. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to raise a question with respect to the phrase, " in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces." I would like to see some more accurate description of the ground upon which soldiers may be entitled to pensions and benefits. Every honorable member must have received scores of refusals from the Department to deal with cases of merit merely because the injury to the party concerned was stated not to have resulted from warlike operations. With respect to this Bill, while the phraseology is a little different from that in the original Act, it appears that the interpretations of the officials will be much the same. There are many men who were accepted for service abroad, and who were apparently in fit condition. Under the strain of war service, however, disabilities developed, and, upon their return to Australia, they were unable to earn a living, or to earn as good a living as before their departure for the Front. In stating their case for relief, they are now met by the medical report that the injury or complaint which has developed is not due to warlike operations. The wording of the clause before us seems to make it much more difficult for them to obtain relief. </para>

                        <para>- The clause provides that a member of the Forces must put his linger on an occurrence which happened during the period of his service in the Australian Imperial Force as something which has resulted in his present incapacity. But how can a man whose affection or disease has actually developed during his period of service with the Australian Imperial Force put his finger on any occurrence during that period of service as being such as to lead to the gradual growth of his infirmity ? The way ought to be made easy for relief to be obtained by any member of the Australian Imperial Force who has come back incapacitated because of the conditions under which he has laboured during his period of service. </para>

                        <para>. - The existing Act provides for relief being given where" the incapacity or death of a member of the Australian Imperial Force -has resulted from his employment in connexion with warlike operations; but on occasions death or incapacity has been brought about, not as the result of anything in connexion with warlike operations, but as the result of happenings during the term of his period of employment. The wording of the clause is expressly intended to cover occurrences not necessarily in connexion with warlike operations. It really extends the provision in the Act. It will enable a pension to be granted in cases which the Act does not cover. Assistance is to be given where the death or incapacity of a member of the Australian Imperial Force has resulted from an occurrence happening during the period when he was a member of the Forces. </para>

                    <para>.- It is purely a matter of administration, but while we are discussing a provision of this nature it is well to let those who are likely to administer it gain some idea as to what Parliament desires. I had before my notice some time ago the case of a miner who, before enlisting, was quite capable of following his employment, but after spending a couple of years in the trenches in France, he returned to Australia absolutely crippled with rheumatism. The Pensions Department declined to give him any pension, on the ground that he had suffered from rheumatism before enlisting. That was an administrative act, and I do not see how we can make the Statute clearer, because the determining factor in every case must be the Board; but in this instance I had to do that to which I always take particular objection- I had to bring the matter under the attention, of the Pensions Department, and point out that surely the., man's incapacity must have resulted from his employment in connexion with warlike operations. Owing to my representations, he. received a small pension. However, that is not the way in which the Act should be administered. </para>

I do not see how the wording of the clause can be altered with advantage, because we may throw upon the Board the onus of granting pensions to undeserving persons.

                    <para>.- I prefer the clause in the Bill to the provision in the Act, because it gives the Board greater discretion. Members of the Forces have lost their lives or become incapacitated, not actually as the result of warlike operations, but through accident. One man who was invalided home formed one of a party which left one of our base hospitals for a trip to Ringwood, but, owing to his incapacity, he wandered away from the others, and, as a result, met with his death.  His  widow was not able to obtain any relief from the Repatriation Board. Soldiers should not be put in the position of having to secure the services of members of Parliament to voice their claims for pensions. I know that quite a number of them are quite able to push their own claims, but others are more diffident, and we ought not to allow them to suffer on that account. I shall always vote for any amendment of this provision that will place all men in the position of being able to get fair treatment. </para>

The honorable member refers to the case of a man who has received such injury resulting from an occurrence happening during the war as to destroy the balance of his judgment, and after his discharge from the Forces has committed suicide. I would not like to say that such a case is definitely excluded from the provisions of the existing Act. Once a member of the Australian Imperial Force has been discharged, he carries only the rights of an ordinary civilian; but the general intention is to grant relief in regard to occurrences happening during the period of the war.

                <para>If this amendment is agreed to, each Board will be charged' with the duties of determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces resulted from his employment as a member of the Forces. I think the Government should assume responsibility for any injury which is suffered by a soldier through having enlisted, and that the competent Board which has power to investigate all cases should he able to deal with them on their merits. The clause as it stands does not cover the numerous cases of men who have been turned adrift unable to earn a livelihood, and whose applications for assistance are refused because the medical officers have determined that' before enlistment they were suffering from the various diseases and affections which now incapacitate them. Thus these men are placed in a position entirely different from that which they would have occupied had they not gone to the Front, because it is undoubted that their diseases or affections have been aggravated by their service in the Australian Imperial Force. Every honorable member has met dozens of such cases which are not due to any specific happening during the period of employment in the Australian Imperial Force, but have been aggravated owing to the worry and strain of their service, or to shell shock occurring during their employment in the Forces. At present we are helpless to deal with such cases. I have not heard any one attempt to set up a claim that we should not regard the aggravation of complaints which results in reduced efficiency as being on the same basis as accidents 'that occur during the time of a soldier's service at the Front. Yet these cases are not covered either by the provision in the Act or by the wording of the clause now before us. We ought to clothe the Board with the fullest power to deal equitably with every case on its merits; but with the limitations imposed by the provision in the Act or by the clause before us, they will not be in a position to do so. My amendment would leave it open for relief to be granted in regard to everything that happened to a soldier during the course of his employment in the Forces. A man may have gone away apparently well, having had no difficulty in passing the medical examination, but because of the conditions under which he served, he may have returned inefficient and unable to do the work he did previously. My amendment would enable relief to be given to such a man. It cannot be given to him under the clause as it stands. </para>

I am not pronouncing judgment upon the honorable member's case; I simply point out that it is merely a question of the application of the principle to the facts. Coming to the case stated by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> I learn that if the Medical Board certifies that a complaint from which an applicant for a pension was suffering has been aggravated by reason of his service a pension is granted. </para>

                <para>I ask the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> not to press his amendment, since it would really have the effect of restricting what we now propose to do. Under the wording of his proposed amendment it would be necessary for an applicant for a pension to prove that his incapacity was the result of his employment in the service; that is to say, he would have to prove that he was employed to do a certain act, and that in the performance of that duty he suffered a casualty. The wording of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 26 is much wider, and is intended to meet cases of the kind that have been brought under notice. There was a ease in Queensland where a man, while on leave,, met with an accident which incapacitated him. Such a case would come within the meaning of this clause, since the casualty would be " an occurrence happening during the period in which he was a member of the Forces." We are going a long way towards meeting many of the cases to which reference has been made. There must be some one to determine the facts, and the Board will simply have to decide whether death or incapacity in fact resulted from an occurrence which happened during the period of the man's employment in the Forces. The clause does not speak of incapacity sustained while acting in pursuance of a military order, but is much wider, since it covers occurrences happening to a man while a member of the Forces. </para>

I do not think any words we could insert would cover all the cases that might arise; but if, as I understand, from the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> the attitude of the Department now is to construe thé words " an occurrence happening during the period in which he was a member of the Forces " in such  s  way that a man who went away with some slight disease which was aggravated by his war service would be eligible- </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister in charge of the Bill is going to take up the very attitude which I suggested the Department would take up, it is perfectly obvious that we must amend the clause. If he would hear what we have to say instead of taking up a hostile attitude before he is able ,to appreciate the point we wish to make, it might be possible to allow the clause to go. I know of cases where men were rheumatic subjects when they enlisted, and would probably have suffered no serious inconvenience from the disease, but that they went on service. In some cases these men have come back practically hopeless cripples. They are crippled with rheumatism as a result of war service. I understand from the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)'</inline> that the Department now takes up the attitude that the aggravation of the disease in such a case would be an occurrence happening while a man was a member of the Forces, and would deal sympathetically with it. </para>

                    <para>. - The medical men examined volunteers for active service under very troublesome and difficult circumstances. The Defence Department foolishly rejected an offer made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. O'Hara</inline> to place at the disposal of the medical officers examining volunteers in Melbourne his consulting rooms, where they could' have been examined under the best conditions. As it was, the men were examined at the Town Hall, and the noise caused by passing trams made it very hard to listen to heart and lung sounds. Two men from the Hospital for Incurables here actually volunteered, and were passed for active service, and in face of that fact the Government are wise in trying to secure that justice shall be done, while at the same time protecting themselves from unreasonable claims. It was very unwise for the Government to make a grant of £4,500 to the dependants of a certain officer, since it raises in the minds of the public a suspicion that those in high positions, with influence to aid them, can obtain what those in more lowly positions are unable tosecure. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not be satisfied unless this clause is sufficiently wide to include every man who volunteered, and who contracted a disease while on active service, or developed it as a result of his service. Whether a man had the germ of a disease or not when he enlisted, if that disease developed while he was a member of the Forces, his case should come within this clause. I am prepared to admit, with the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney),</inline> that it is quite possible that, owing to the difficult circumstances in which the examinations were made, in some instances men were passed who ought not to have been accepted for service. In dealing with thousands of cases, the doctors, no matter how efficient they might have been, were bound, on the law of average, to pass some who should have been rejected. Long before he enlisted, a man might have had in his constitution the germ of a disease, or might have had some slight complaint which did not interfere with his industrial efficiency. Under active service conditions that disease might have been aggravated. The wonder to me is that every Australian soldier who spent any time in Europe did not come back troubled with rheumatism. Is the Board administering the Department to callously shelter itself behind' the paltry excuse that a man is disentitled to a pension because, although crippled with rheumatism on his return from the war, he had the germ of the disease in his constitution when he volunteered? That would be a barbarous attitude to take up. </para>

The Act will be regarded as a barbarous instrument if it allows men to be treated in the way described simply because some one can say that before they enlisted they had the germ of the disease which developed during their period of service, and led to their incapacity. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government should consider whether this clause can be satisfactorily administered. It throws upon each Board the  onus of inquiring, not merely into a man's war service at the Front, but clearly also into his condition of health before he went to the Front. That opens a very wide field for investigation ; and, as there will be six separate Boards making investigations, and probably coming to decisions not in consonance with one another, we may expect a crop of injustices to result. There is an immense difficulty once you begin to make limitations as to who shall -benefit and who shall be excluded from benefits, and it would almost pay this country to throw the door wide open and allow everybody who can prove incapacity within a certain period of the close of the war to share the benefits of this legislation. Otherwise we shall have some men receiving benefits under the law who, perhaps, are jot as much entitled to them as are men who have been excluded. It is not as if there was to be one body dealing with all the cases. There will be six Boards or Commissions, and the common experience of those accustomed to juries is that a verdict given by one set of men would be scouted by another set. Different bodies of men look at things from different angles, and draw different conclusions from the same facts. The Government would, therefore, be wise to withdraw the clause for further consideration, because as it stands it will undoubtedly lead to an immense amount of trouble and; which is worse, work out unjustly. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Government will accede to the honorable member's request. The men who volunteered for the Front had to submit to medical examination. They were passed by medical men as fit for active service. _ In some cases, they were on active service for four years or more. They come back, and ask for certain benefits under Acts that we have passed; and then it is discovered, under medical examination, that they have some constitutional defect which, the doctors say, originated prior to their enlistment. Because of that, they or their dependants are not to be entitled to the benefits of this measure. That is a most cruel way to deal with men who have served just as faithfully and well as have any others. In the medical and other professions, differences of opinion arise, and it is not easy to assign an actual date to the beginning of a disease in the human body. Medical testimony will be found equally divided in many cases as to whether the trouble originated in the pre-war period or during the war. If there is any doubt, the benefit of it should be given to the returned soldier and his dependants. </para>

                    <para>.- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> charges the Board with the duty of " determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces were in fact so dependent." Under the principal Act, the pension was assessed upon the average earnings of the soldier during the twelve months prior to his going to the Front. Many boys of eighteen enlisted, whose earnings prior to enlistment were probably nil. Applications were made by the mothers of those boys who were killed at the Front. The applicants were told that, as in many instances the boys had earned nothing during the year prior to enlistment, only the minimum pension of 7s. per week could be granted. When those boys went to the Front, they did men's work. I know an instance of a boy who enlisted on his eighteenth birthday, was four years at the Front, and was killed. When his mother applied for a pension, she was asked what his average earnings were in the year before he went away. As he had been at school, she had to tell them that his earnings were nil. I have not been able to read this Bill carefully, and do not know whether a similar provision is contained in it. I cannot find anything of that nature in it, but we must make it absolutely clear that the same pension must be paid in the case of every boy who went into the firing-line as is paid in the case of a man. The provision to which I refer was one of the greatest anomalies in the old Act, and I sincerely hope it will not be perpetuated in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>.. - The clause provides that where any assessment or determination in relation to the pension payable to a member of the Forces is required to be reviewed', the Commission may cancel the pension if the member refuses or fails to attend at the time and place fixed, or by his default makes it impossible to review the pension. Many of these men in the outback portions of Australia will be very hard to get at. One case was brought under my notice when I was away up the other side of Thargomindah. A letter was sent to a pensioner, care of the post office at Cunnamulla, where he used to draw his pension. He had left Cunnamulla and gone further out west, and consequently did not get the letter. Afterwards, when he came into the town he found that his pension had been stopped, because he had not turned up for the review. It appeared that the officer in charge of the Pensions Department had ordered him in the letter to go to the nearest Board for review. He came in from 170 to 200 miles for that pension, and when he got there he found himself absolutely stranded, and I had to get him Government rations. </para>

                        <para>.- I take no exception to the extension of the benefits of the Act to British reservists. The Government of which I was a member decided that British reservists who had made Australia their home, and were called up for service with the Imperial Army, should be placed on the same footing as members of the Australian Imperial Force. I wish to make an appeal, however, on behalf of another class of men - Australians who were abroad at the outbreak of war, and enlisted in England, Canada, and elsewhere in order to avoid the delay of returning to Australia for the purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> is very important to many men in Australia. I do not know the number of men who are affected, but five cases have been brought under my notice. One was that of a man who was resident in the Argentine Republic when the war broke out, and who paid his passage to England in order to enlist. He was not allowed to join the Australian Imperial Force. Of course, his pay, his pension, and all his privileges were considerably less than they would have been had he joined that Force. In another case which came under my notice only last week, a soldier who was rejected in Australia paid his passage to England, where he enlisted in the Imperial Forces, with which he served for a period of about three years. He was then given a free return passage to Australia. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> recently made application on his behalf </para>

                        <para>- I have not. But that is not sufficient. The admission by the Minister that this man has some claim to the difference between his Imperial rate of pay and the rate paid to the Australian Imperial Force puts him on an equality with the members of the Australian Imperial Force. If he is entitled to be placed on an equality with the Australian Imperial Force in regard to pay, he is certainly entitled to be similarly placed in regard to pensions. I have here an amendment, which I drafted some time ago, but I would prefer that the Minister himself should move it. I would like to insert after the word " service ", the words " and any soldier who enlisted in the British Forces." </para>

                    <para>. - If I understand it aright the amendment means either one of two things. If we adopt it we shall have to assume the obligation of providing pensions for these men, and in so far as we do that we shall relieve the Imperial Government of their responsibility to pay pensions which they are entitled to pay to those who enlisted in their service. On the other hand, it is just possible that these men may obtain a pension from the Imperial Government and also a pension from the Commonwealth. There is only one legitimate claim which can be made on their behalf, namely, that we shall make up the difference between the Imperial rate of pension and our own rate. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no doubt that the Minister is at heart kindly disposed towards these men, but we have had many promises by Ministers equally sympathetic - promises to which no effect has been given. Let me add <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the cases of hardship which have already been cited. 1 know of a young Australian who was in China when the war broke out. He was very anxious to serve his country, and, being offered an opportunity of securing a passage to Eng land, he accepted it, and went to the Old Country. Upon his arrival there he immediately approached those in charge of our Australian troops, with a view to enlisting, but they refused to accept him. He then enlisted in the Imperial Army, with which he served for three years, afterwards returning to Australia, his passage being paid by the Imperial Government. In such cases surely a reciprocal arrangement can be made between the oversea Dominions and the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- That would be an extreme case. I do not desire to see any man drawing two pensions or enjoying two sets of privileges. But the amendment would apply to so few cases that the Committee may very well adopt it. </para>

                        <para>- I think honorable members generally are of opinion that an Australian who went to considerable trouble to enlist should, at any rate, not 'be placed in a worse position than other Australians. We should so -provide that if an Imperial or Dominion pension is. less than our own it may be raised to an equal amount,  though I recognise that it is difficult, on the spur of the moment, to frame an amendment with that effect. </para>

                    <para>.- I have had brought to my attention some sad cases for which, unfortunately, no provision is made. A mother lost her only son through illness while he was on active service. When the boy enlisted his father was alive, but he died shortly after his boy's death, largely, I think, as the result of the loss of this, his only son. The mother of the dead soldier was now left absolutely penniless, and, under the existing Act and regulations, she is entitled to no assistance in the way of pension, simply because her husband was alive at the time of the boy's death. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> whether some cases I have in my mind are such as may be dealt with by the Commission. In one case, two young fellows before going to the Front had had some experience in engineering, and when they returned after some years' fighting they started a motor engineer's business in partnership. They are careful, steady men; but when they applied for assistance, the answer they received was to the effect that it was not within the scope of the regulations, on the ground that, prior to enlisting, they had not owned and conducted a similar business. It is true that, before enlisting, they were not in business for themselves, but were learning as paid employees. Why should young soldiers who are enterprising enough to start business, but who have not sufficient money to provide all the necessary tools, be debarred from advantages enjoyed by other members of the Forces? In another case, two young fellows, before enlisting, had been engaged on a newspaper for years, and the owner of the paper has stated that if they had not gone to the war they would have been made partners". Since their return to Australia, these young men have been offered, by a sleeping partner, an interest in this newspaper. The matter was brought before a member of the Cabinet, who told me that the men would be able to get assistance; and on that assurance they purchased the interest offered. For any advances made, they are prepared to give the full security of this interest, and also their gratuities; but they are informed that, under the existing Act and regulations, assistance cannot be given them.I should like to know whether if  this Bill passes, there will be vested in the Commission power to give assistance in cases of this kind; if not, it is my intention to move an amendment. </para>

The regulations made by the present Commission will lapse with the appointment of the new Commission, and the latter will be empowered to consider all such cases, and make recommendations. I wish to make it clear, however, that the recommendations of the Commission will be subject to Ministerial approval - a necessary provision for the protection of the finances. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I cannot see any reason why such cases as have been mentioned should not be assisted by the Commission. It would be very unwise, however, to stipulate in the Bill what particular classes of business shall be assisted. Quite a large amount of money will be involved in tie administration of this Bill, and it is only proper that the Commission should consider each case. There is no need, of course, why the new Commission should follow in the footsteps of the previous Commission- </para>

                    <para>.. - I hope that the Commission and the Boards will interpret the Bill in the generous spirit suggested by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton).</inline> There is no doubt that under the present Act there are cases of very grievous harship.  Men desire to be established in the businesses which they would have been following if they had not gone to the war, but under the present Act are unable to get the assistance necessary to enable them to do so. Many men who previously worked for their fathers or others in a variety of businesses would by this time have been partners had they not enlisted ; but simply because they were not actually established in the businesses before they enlisted they are refused the benefits of the Act. I am glad to hear that the Commission and the Boards will be enabled to take a wider view in the administration of the Act, the whole spirit of which is more generous than that of the old Act. According to this clause, the Commission is given power to make  recommendatons  for the granting of assistance to - the incapacitated fathers of deceased or incapacitated Australian soldiers who were, prior to the enlistment of the soldier, dependent upon them. </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that unless this provision is very widely administered it will fall far short of what is desired. I am prepared to admit that to strike out the words " who were prior to the enlistment of those soldiers dependent upon them " might lead to some cases of imposition, but I draw attention to 'the limitation imposed by the word's. ' There are cases such as that mentioned by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> a few moments ago, and his remarks apply not only to mothers, but to fathers. I think that an incapacitated father, although he may not have been dependent on the soldier before enlistment, ought in certain circumstances to come within the scheme, and the Government ought to make certain that such cases will be met. </para>

                    <para>.- I have on more than one occasion brought before honorable members the need for the more thorough auditing of public accounts. Under the Bill as it stands, the auditing of the accounts of the Local Committees may be done by some person not under the control of the Auditor-General. In my opinion, that officer is the sole authority . who can properly satisfy Parliament and the country of the correctness of public and quasi-public accounts. As one who a few years ago took a great part in forcing the Government to be more particular in requiring the auditing of the accounts by the Auditor-General's Department, I suggest that in this clause the words " as prescribed" should be left out, and the words "by the Auditor-General" substituted for them. I do not wish to say anything about discrepancies that have occurred in the past in connexion with war funds. The Committee is aware that the auditing of the Wool Committee's accounts is done by a person who is not under the Auditor-General. I have nothing to say against outside auditors, but the accounts of that Committee and of all similar bodies should be audited by the Auditor-General's Department. I have positive evidence that some of the outside auditors have not been as careful as they might have been. Had all the accounts of the kind I have in mind been subject to audit by the Auditor-General, many improper transactions would not have continued as long as they did, because under the Audit Act there would have been a constant supervision, whereas actually the auditing was done when accounts were being closed, or upon an annual statement. Nothing can be better than the prevention of crime, and the Minister in charge of a Department, who cannot be supposed to over-! look every detail of administration, has a guarantee, when provision is made for the auditing of accounts by the Auditor-General, that the money which he obtains from the Treasurer will not be wasted. Parliament should be very jealous for the proper accounting for moneys expended at its direction. The magnitude of our expenditure is in itself a special reason for very careful auditing, and the Auditor-General should control the auditing of all accounts of Government expenditure. After all, the purpose of the audit is to satisfy the Government that the accounts of these Committees are properly kept, and the moneys handled by them devoted to the proper purpose. </para>

                        <para>- That is but a greater justification for adopting the course I suggest. The operations under this Bill will cover a very large area, and a very large amount of public expenditure will be involved by them. There is nothing in our laws, Federal or State, to prevent any man who pleases putting up a brass plate and describing himself as an auditor. I am sure that if the Minister will seek advice in this matter he will realize the wisdom of the amendment I suggest. </para>

That is permitted by the Audit Act. No Government Department should, in a matter of this kind, be placed outside the supervision of the Auditor-General. It is said that figures do not lie, and, while that is so, our experience at election times shows that the persons who handle figures are often the greatest liars on earth. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that £250 be advanced per head of those employed in  the proposed co-operative enterprise. According to the honorable member for Corangamite, this sum would be ample. There may be some doubt as to whether a woollen mill run on these lines would be profitable; but the Inter-State Commission's report showed that the net profits made by the woollen mills of the Commonwealth during the first three years of the war, actually exceeded by £50,710 the total of capital employed in 1914. The capital invested in that year in woollen mills producing blankets, flannels, &amp;c., was £536,639, and the profits made in the three years 1915-16-17 totalled £541,135, while the capital employed in mills producing tweeds, serges, &amp;c, was £607,746, and the profits during those three years amounted to £655,960, showing a total capital investment of £1,144,385 and profits £1,195,095. </para>

                        <para>- I am not here to defend the great proprietary companies. I am here to put a word in for co-operative enterprises. It goes without saying that the profits can still be made, not only by woollen mills, but by co-operative boot factories, fellmongering establishments, tanneries, wool-scouring works, saw-mills, and other similar establishments; and I would like to see some of those profits distributed amongst the rank and file. If honorable gentlemen sitting on this side of the House are deeply interested in the welfare of our returned soldiers, they now have an opportunity of proving it. I hope they will support me to the hilt, and that something will be done for those of our returned men who do not go upon the land. Will the Minister accept the new clause if the proposed enterprises are made subject to the approval of the Minister? </para>

                        <para>- During the last two or three years a large amount of sustenance money has been paid to our returned soldiers. I do not wish to indulge in recriminations, but in my opinion this problem should have been tackled two or three years ago, and instead of paying sustenance money and keeping in idleness those men who did not want to go upon the land and had no qualifications for land settlement, they should have been placed in the Commonwealth Woollen Mills or other private concerns to learn a trade and been paid a living wage, so that by the time they had become proficient, factories would have been erected and machinery installed. </para>

If these industries are established, I hope that they will be set up as far as possible in country towns, with a view to bringing about decentralization. Honorable members opposite must recognise that the population of our capital cities is quite out of proportion - the disproportion is growing to an alarming extent - and we should be only too pleased to receive any support in the movement towards decentralization. </para>

                        <para>- When we realize that the average payment of sustenance to each soldier has been £8 5s., hardly exceeding a period of three weeks, it will be seen that expenditure in this direction has not been extravagant, especially when it is compared with the services the men have rendered Australia. The bulk of this money has been paid during one of the most troublesome periods we have had in Australia for many years past; that is  to say, during the influenza outbreak and the seamen's and marine engineers' strikes. Not only have we been obliged to sustain returned soldiers who were thrown out of employment because of these industrial troubles, but we have also had to provide relief for thousands of people in the State of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, the clause is unnecessary, because the Repatriation Commissioners will be perfectly entitled to give consideration to such projects. The proposed new clause would make it mandatory on them to accede to them. The honorable member has put forward a simple illustration in regard to the establishment of a cooperative woollen mill, with, perhaps, a capital of  £1,000,000;  but his proposal covers not only woollen mills, but also boot factories, clothing factories, canning factories, and, in fact, it is so worded as to cover almost any, enterprise under the sun. The Government cannot agree to any proposal which would commit the country in this way to the expenditure of scores of millions of pounds. </para>

                    <para>.- The object of the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Hill)</inline> is to make provision for those men who, prior to the war, were not engaged in farming or in some business calling. A man who was a farmer before the war is placed on the land on his return; the man who was in a small business before he went to the war is placed in business again on his return, and the man who wielded a pick and shovel before he went overseas is given a pick and shovel on his return. The farm labourer who worked for a weekly wage is, on his return, put on the land, and placed in a position to become his own employer, but  what  is done for the man who, before enlisting, worked for a saw-miller for a weekly wage? He is sent back to the sawmill under the old boss who was having a comfortable time while his employee was away fighting. In his remarks, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> as is often done by honorable gentlemen on the front bench, dealt with details, getting quite away from the vital principle at issue. We admit that there are obstacles in the way of the adoption of our proposal, but we are quite prepared to agree to any safeguard the Minister may think fit. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>These returned men should be given an opportunity, and I shall give an illustration of what I mean. When I was in the country the other day, I was in conversation with a number of men wearing military badges who were working at a saw-mill at a railway siding. They were engaged by an employer at a weekly wage, and I asked them whether, if provision were made for an advance from the Repatriation Department to enable them to purchase an engine, a bench and a few drays, they could not run a plant of their own. They replied emphatically in the affirmative, and said they would be only too glad to undertake the work on their own account if they could obtain the necessary capital. It is to cover such cases as this that we are endeavouring to incorporate this amendment in the Bill. We do not desire the measure to be amended in such a way that any one could come along and ask for an advance to launch some wildcat scheme, and we are quite agreeable to accept any reasonable safeguards. The bulk of the men . in the Australian Imperial Force before they went to the war  were  working for others. What have the Government done for the bulk of them? That is a question I desire the Government to consider, and I also appeal very strongly to those honorable members in this Chamber who are wearing military badges to support this reasonable proposition. </para>

                    <para>.- I  trust  the Government will see their way clear to deal with the amendment in a sympathetic manner, as the proposal is a reasonable one and cannot be regarded as a communistic experiment or anything of that nature. The proposal in the amendment is confined to cooperative businesses, which, after all, are voluntary associations of men carrying on industries for the benefit of themselves and the whole community. It is to be regretted that the co-operative system has not become more widely established in Australia. Objections may be raised to this proposal, and although the amendment may not be in the form the Government desire, the principle is a perfectly sound one. Criticisms have been made concerning the Repatriation Department or the administration of the Act, because proper (provision has not been made to advance money to soldiers who desire to start in business. Although many of the men who went to the Front were employees before they left Australia, as stated by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> there are many who would by now have been in business on their own account if they had not gone abroad in the interests of Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care, and I appeal to the honorable member for Grampians, who knows something about business, to say whether this is not the crudest proposition ever conceived by a responsible Parliament. I desire to know whether we have any authority, as representatives of the people, to assist in undertakings under the crude proposal before the House. It is an impossible proposition when considered from the financial aspect. Let honorable members who are so keen to include this provision in the Bill interview the heads of any financial institution and ask them if they are prepared to advance money on the basis of the proposal now before us. My entire sympathy is with the movement, but it must have some foundation. Comparison has been made between land settlement and the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca. While there is a risk of losing perhaps hundreds of thousands, or even millions, sterling in connexion with land settlement, the risk under this proposition is ten times greater. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure my honorable friend knows that in connexion with our land settlement problem there are painful instances where  men who have gone on the land and have accepted advances from the Department have been all right while the money was coming in, but when that ceased they have walked off their holdings and told the Department to take the land. I urge the Committee not to raise false hopes, by introducing into the Bill a scheme involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, which is not on a sound basis. </para>

                        <para>- I do; but not in the miserable way that has been followed by the Department. I am glad that this amendment has been moved by the honorable member for Echuca. When a number of poor fellows, most of them maimed, were earning a few paltry shillings a week at the Anzac weaving school, the wonderful Department of Repatriation used to deduct from their sustenance allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. a week the paltry 15s. a week that was accruing to the men by way of pension. That was not done in Sydney, where the industry is carried on under the auspices of the Red Cross. But for the Repatriation Department, and the influence of Flinders-lane, there would be in Victoria to-day 1,000 men engaged in the Anzac tweed industry. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not at all pleased with the way in which this question has been discussed, since there has been, on all sides a display' of bitterness, that we have no desire to arouse. I am a staunch believer in. co-operation, and as the result of twenty years.' experience of it in Victoria, I am able to say that it has been attended with splendid results. I am. associated at the present time with six very successful, cooperative enterprises, with, a turnover of £250,0.00 a year. I visited, the Repatriation. Trades. School,, Wirth's Park,, a few days ago, and saw. with  interest what is being, done- in . the vocational training of returned, men.' The work is a distinct credit to , the Minister. Many of them, are rapidly becoming efficient, and, in the near future,, will be splendid tradesmen. A man. who is learning the trade of a blacksmith, after four months' experience, was turning out work equal to that, of an apprentice, of two years' standing. The amendment simply proposes that these men  9hall  go on earning for themselves instead of making profits for employers. We feel that there is ample room for a very wide extension of the principle of co-operation, and that, under the wise guidance of the Minister, there is no likelihood of waste and extravagance. If the Minister cannot supervise cooperative ventures such as we propose, then how will it be possible for him to supervise other enterprises involving a considerable expenditure for which provision is made in this Bill. I hope that the amendment ' will not be dealt with in a party spirit, but that a united effort will be made to give these men real, sound, practical assistance through the channel of co-operation. </para>

                        <para>- This -is&gt; not a. Socialistic; movement. It is. simply, a. scheme to enable returned soldiers in certain, districts to combine so that they will secure the same help that is given to those who go on the land. Every man will then have a chance of entering into some concern that will be of advantage to himself: The honorable member- for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook)</inline> referred to what is being done in the way of vocational training at Wirth's Park. Very fine work is being done there, simply to enable  these men to become servants of other men-. We want to make them masters, not servants'. I am surprised at. the attitude' of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Foster),</inline> who waxed very eloquent on behalf of vested interests1. If these men- are given- an opportunity they will form themselves- into little companies, which will be an absolute success; The Government never had a better opportunity than -the present, to enter into this undertaking in- the- proper spirit. Little groups- of men trained at  Wirth's  Park could be given contracts for some of the houses being built to-day. They are actually building those houses, but are only getting wages- out of them, while somebody else is reaping- the profits. There are scores of saw-mill hands working in forest areas who only need to be advanced about £250 each, instead of the £2,500 advanced in other cases, and then the Government can let them as many contracts as they like to cut timber for the housing scheme. That decidedly should be done. The men are absolutely efficient, and know the job of saw-milling quite as well as the men who run the mills. These are some of the small schemes which this measure should be passed to promote. We should give returned men facilities to establish manufacturing undertakings in some of the decadent mining towns, and by that means the whole of the. existing housing problem could be solved. The houses I looked at the other day are costing about £700 each. The Government could obtain houses equal to them for half, or even a quarter, of the money in some of the mining districts. Those centres are admirably suited for small co-operative companies run by returned soldiers. I hope . the Government will see to these things, which are necessary in the interests of the men who cannot possibly go on the land. Tie honorable member for Wakefield spoke of the men on the land. The Government are placing £650 worth of improvements on 60 acres of ground. The result is to bring up the value of that ground by £10 per acre.. In some cases the land is not worth it when that £10 per acre improvement is placed upon it. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment provides that a person suffering from tubercular disease has to be discharged from the establishment before he can receive the pension. He may be a married man, and the special .rate of pension would, of course, be for the benefit of his family. It would be dangerous to grant it only if the man was discharged. We should not encourage persons suffering f.Tom this disease to be discharged amongst the community. While I have as much sympathy with these .sufferers as has any other honorable member, I believe it is recognised by the medical authorities that they are a menace to the public health :unless properly looked after. It is far better for them and for other people that they should be kept in a sanatorium. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is a rephrasing of the original one of which notice was given by the honorable member for Illawarra. It is dangerous to compel the men to be discharged from the sanatorium. I understand that if the pension is paid to men while they are inmates of an institution, the bulk of it is retained by the institution. In Victoria, the Department has adopted a very bad policy by sending the men who were at Mont Park, where tubercular cases were treated, to the Austin Hospital for Incurables, and placing them in the Kronheimer wing, which is the finest part of the institution. It is bad for the soldiers to be kept amongst incurables, and the policy is bad for the people, because it prevents other incurables from obtaining admission. The hardships experienced overseas caused many of our men to develop tubercular troubles, and I believe in doing everything possible to help them. I approve of paying the pension to them, but I do not like the provision that they shall not get it until they are discharged from the institution. It is better for them to be in a sanatorium, because they have a better chance of recovery, and are not so much a menace to the community. </para>

The object of the amendment is to give to them an opportunity of returning to their homes for the purpose of continuing the treatment. It is admitted that the institutions are conducted in the best possible way, but the inmates say that they are continually coming in contact with people similarly afflicted, and they can never forget that they are tubercular cases. </para>

                        <para>- That will be altered shortly; the Department will provide effectively for such cases being treated in the country under different conditions. The object I have in view is to enable tubercular patients who are not able to work to get the same attention as they would be able to get if they were living at home amongst their own people, if in the opinion of the medical officer of the institution there was no special danger to the community in allowing them to return to their homes. The reason for the provision that patients must remain in an institution for six months is that in that period they may learn how to avoid spreading contagion to others. I am assured by the Medical Superintendent that it is quite safe for these patients to mix with other people so long as they have been properly trained to look after themselves. At any rate, whether or not there is a danger in what is proposed, the present position is that the man who has money may go to his home, whilst the man dependent upon the low rate of pension at present paid has to remain in the institution, and in his own judgment has not the same chance to recover as he would have if he could join his own people in his home. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 approve of the amendment, which is an improvement upon the present practice, but I do not understand why we should compel an invalid to remain in an institution for six months if, at the end of one month, he is fit to be discharged. However, I am willing to give the proposal a trial, and if we find that it tends to counteract the benefits conferred by the clause, we ought to be able to amend it. </para>

                    <para>- I am adopting this course because the matter is one of great importance. The Bill seeks to create a new and unnecessary Department, and I do not wish the occasion to pass without honorable members being afforded an ample opportunity of saying whether or not they approve of this undesirable course. The present Pensions Department has already done three-fourths of this work, and has done it exceedingly well. The only reason which the Minister has assigned in favour of the creation of a new Department is that it will effect economy in the matter of time. From my stand-point, it will have precisely the opposite result. It is proposed to take from a Department which has all the necessary machinery at its disposal work which it is now performing, and to give it to a Department which  has no machinery whatever. The Government say they are pledged to economy; this retrograde step is the very antithesis of their promises to the electors. </para>

                    <para>.- In seconding the amendment, I congratulate the honorable member for Hume upon the course which he has taken, particularly in view of the importance of the principle which is involved and of the very close division which took place in this Committee last evening. In the majority which the Government commanded on that occasion were included two members of the party who, so far as this country has been informed, stand for economy - I refer to the  Deputy  Leader of the Country party, the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)-</inline> and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline> I particularly call attention to this fact, because it is not the first occasion upon which I have noticed that certain members of the Country party make it convenient to see that the Government obtain a majority whenever the latter are in a tight corner. Now an opportunity will be given them to say whether they really stand for economy or not. The honorable member for Hume put the position very clearly when he said that in this Bill the Government propose to establish two Pensions Departments where only one existed previously. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government will oppose this amendment, because the issue that is involved in it was definitely decided last evening in a full Committee. Upon that occasion the argument was advanced - just as it has been this afternoon - that the Bill provides for the creation of two Departments. It does nothing of the sort. The position is that there are a number of officers of the Old-age Pensions Department who are charged with administrative work in connexion with soldiers' pensions, and because of difficulties which may arise in affording all kinds of relief to soldiers and their dependants, these officers are about to be placed under the control of the Repatriation Commission. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and an important aspect is the medical side of the question. The activities of the Defence Department in this connexion are about to cease, and instead of creating a new Department, as has been alleged, we are merely transferring certain officers in order to insure efficient and economical administration. Those honorable members who have been taunted with failure to keep their pledges by insisting upon economy in our public Departments, have shown that they are the truest advocates of economy. That, however, is a policy which is entirely foreign to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan).We</inline> have had constant complaints from outside. Persons who are granted war pensions are under the impression that these represent all they are entitled to ; and the desire is that pensions and repatriation assistance shall be granted at the same time by the one body. </para>

                    <para>,- Before the. BUI leaves the Chamber I desire to say a few words in reference to a particular class of returned soldiers. The newspapers tell us. every clay- that men. have returned from the war physically wrecked and mentally deficient. I cannot speak of other States, but in Queensland there is no place to which these men can be sent, in order that they may be restored to health and made the reputable citizens many of them were before they left for the Front. Many of them are drinking about the big cities, .and I should like the Repatriation Department to provide an asylum to which they can be committed, instead of permitting them, as at present, to bc sent to gaol. It is the wish of. every honorable member; and of all the people of Australia, to do the right thing by these men. It grieves me to think that soldiers, who. have made this country safe for. us all-- and but for whose services things might have been very different to-day-- should, in their broken state, be sent to gaol. The police magistrate in Brisbane was very pained when I pleaded for a man who, after four years' fighting, had been arrested as a vagrant. He said, " There is nowhere else for me to send- this, man but to gaol." Of course, the man was down and out. He was .covered with vermin, and a complete human wreck. It behoves us to do what we can for .these men. I know that those at the head of the Repatriation administration, both in the States and in the Central Department, are &lt; sympathetic, and I appeal to them to.. get to work as early as they can, to save this human wreckage, and, if possible, bring it back to normal civil life. If these men could be sent to a military hostel, where they would enjoy a certain amount of freedom, but be kept from the cursed drink, some of them. would be reclaimed, and .if only 5 per cent, of them were thus saved, it would be a good thing for them and for the country. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, it is desirable that the Government should establish some sort of soldier force - not policemen exactly, but welfare men - whose business it would be to go about the cities, and get hold of soldiers before their state became, so. bad. as to bring them into the hands of the civil police. Nothing hurts me more than to see uniformed men being taken by civilian policemen to a lockup. A force such as I suggest would look after these men in the fraternal way that their mates would care for them, and, no doubt, prevent many of them from getting- into trouble, brought about by the strain of war work, from which they have not yet recovered.. I suggest some voluntary or paid organization for the service of those who have done so much for us. </para>

                        <para>. - The business at present on the paper; I cannot now say the exact order. One of the first matters to be considered is the Senate's message regarding the War Gratuity Bill. A motion to enable Parliament to record its appreciation of the services of our soldiers in connexion with the recent war will be submitted early next week, and there will be motions referring works proposals to the Public Works Committee. </para>
