                        <para>- On Friday a deputation put its case before me, and in reply I pointed out that at present prices the Government is losing £14 per ton on the sugar it is supplying to the community; but I promised to do what I could. I have not yet had an opportunity to put the matter before my colleagues. Probably the Government has no power except under the War Precautions Act to control the production of beet sugar, but we could control it under that Act until its expiry, which must come about within a certain period after the declaration of peace. At present I can only say that the Government will consider the matter. We are desirous of helping, not of crushing, the beet sugar industry, and I sincerely regret that, after eight years of encouragement by the Government of Victoria and the Commonwealth Government, the total production of beet sugar in this State is the paltry amount of 1,400 tons. </para>

                        <para>- The question was raised last week, when I said that I would see what could be done to make freight available. At least four Commonwealth vessels arc now carrying coal, and I have been conferring with the Manager of the Commonwealth fleet as to the extent to which other vessels could be made temporarily available. Of course, our vessels, like private vessels, are under contracts to load cargo. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say on the spur of the moment whether Parliament has or has not approved of the establishment of an arsenal, though I hardly imagine that it would disapprove of such a thing. Without an arsenal we might as well say to the nations of the world, " Come in, brothers, and take our appointed place." The material to which the honorable member refers was offered to us by the British Government at prices so much below cost that we felt that it would be absurd to refuse it;but, of course, the transaction could be cancelled, because there has not yet been delivery. I shall see that when we are discussing the Estimates, the fullest information is made available to honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, we shall, but I think I may be permitted to remind honorable members that this House almost went on its knees every day, but the Sabbath - which is the best day of all for such a purpose - to ask that, for God's sake they should have no more of Government control. The Government not only listened to, but heeded those prayers, and abolished Government control. Honorable members have now the full benefit  and glorious blessings of private enterprise, which seemed so attractive to them when they were afar off. Now they have got them. </para>

They will say that they conduct their business on commercial principles. The Government do not do that. The Government have bowels of compassion. They listen to what honorable members say. They do not want 30s. for every 20s. they expend. I am very sorry to hear what the honorable member for Wakefield has complained of. I shall speak to the shipping companies. </para>

                        <para>- On the 13th May the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> asked whether the Government intended to pay Commonwealth employees for the holidays they received during the visit 'of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. I then intimated that an announcement would shortly be made. I now desire to inform the House that, in order to have uniformity in this matter, it has been decided that where public holidays are granted to Commonwealth employees in connexion with the visit of  His  Royal Highness, such employees are to be paid for one public holiday. </para>

                        <para>- The best speech made last week on the Bill was, in my opinion, that made by the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> . And he ridiculed that part of the agreement relating to freight on crude oil at current rates, also that portion having reference to the amount of capital to be invested in the business. He stated that the £250,000 which the Government have agreed to put into the business, and the £250,000 to be invested by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, will not be more than sufficient for distribution expenses of the oil business in Australia. The company have taken up land at Fremantle, and have also mads arrangements for land in Port Melbourne for the erection of storage tanks, but there is nothing in the agreement providing that these tanks shall go over to the refinery company. What will be our position if oil refined in the Commonwealth refineries has to be stored in tanks belonging to the Anglo-Persian Company? It is quite possible that one-tenth of1d. per gallon per annum will be ample  for storage, but until we have information' on this subject we ' shall have no idea how much it will actually cost. The Anglo-Persian Company may charge what they like, and no doubt they will do so. We have been told that crude oil has increased in price all over the world. According to the Petrol Commission's report, the price in the United States of America at present is 6 dollars per barrel, and I understand a barrel contains 42 Imperial gallons, making the price about 8d. per gallon. If we can get the crude oil to Australia, not at 8d., but at 6d. per gallon, the 200,000 tons will, at 240 gallons to the ton, cost us about £1,200,000. </para>

                <para>Now on the question of freight, I may inform honorable members that the Anglo-Persian Company are the only people who trade in the Persian Gulf, and, according to the Petrol Commission's Report, they are charging more than £15 per ton freight from  Adaban,  in the Persian Gulf, to the United Kingdom, and as the distance to Australia is as great, if not greater than, to England, they are not  likely  to charge the Commonwealth less. ' The Prime Minister has stated that he will alter that portion cf the agreement relating to price, and that the rate for crude oil will be the same as that charged to the British Government. But the British Government are not buying crude oil at all. </para>

                        <para>- I know the British Government hold more than one-half the shares in, the company, but it is not likely that they would fix the price f.o.b. Persian Gulf, and then sell it to themselves after refining. If we discover oil in Papua, are we likely to fix the price f.o.b. there? The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> will bear me out when I say that these house-to-house transactions are always a source of trouble to the Customs Department with companies having establishments in Great Britain or other countries and Australia. Therefore, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would not be likely to fix the price for crude oil in Persia. Crude oil varies in quality.  During the war it was found that the product  of one of the other Combines was' infinitely superior for explosives to that obtained from the Persian Gulf. We have been told that 80 per cent, of the toluol used ' for explosives manufactured by the Allies was made 'from, the Sumatra oil, and the verdict, of the men " over there " was that had it not been for the Combine which1 the Prime Minister has denounced as " foreign " making available this product for high explosives, the Allies would not have won the war. That is the position. During the war we spoke of those who fought with us as our Allies, and of those who were against us as the enemy. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> apparently tried to confuse the issue by making it. appear that the Shell Oil Company was a foreign corporation, and, therefore, worthy of any ill-treatment to which we chose to subject it. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of them are in exactly the same position. I urge that we should have further information upon this subject,  firstly,  because the agreement would commit us in respect of too long a period, and, secondly, because of the amount of money involved. Let us assume that the crude oil to-day is worth 6d. per gallon, or 25 per cent, less than the American crude oil is worth to-day, according to the report of the Petrol Commission. That Commission was appointed by the British Government. It was not in any way connected' with the oil trade, and its report was denounced by the trade in Great Britain. It proved that the value of crude oil in America at the present time is about 8d. per .gal: lon, or 6 dollars per barrel, and it is said that the price is going up. Taking the value of the crude oil at 6d. per gallon; we have a total of £1,200,000 in respect of the annual supply from Persia. If we allow freight costs at £15 per ton, or less than is being charged the British Government at the present time, we have in respect of the 200,000 tons an expenditure of £3,000,000 per annum, making a total of £4,200,000. Thus, during the first' five years we should have a total of £21, 000,000 if before the end of that period we discovered oil in Papua, and they started to work it. The company's ten years' operation in Papua would represent, in respect to the cost of the oil, £1,200,000 per annum. Freight, at £7 10s. per ton - or one-half the rate at present charged between Persia and the United Kingdom - would amount to £1,500,000 per annum, making a total of £2,700,000. Thus, in respect of the ten years' period the amount involved is £27,000,000, or a grand total of £48,000,000, spread over the fifteen years covered by the agreement. We shall be committed to an expenditure of £21,000,000 during the first five years, assuming, of course, that by that time oil will have been found in Papua, and that the crude oil is still worth 6d. per gallon, or 25 per cent, less than it is to-day in America. The Prime Minister said last week that if we were dissatisfied with the freight charges it would practically be possible for us to bring the oil over in our own ships. Have we any oil-tank steamers available? As a matter of fact, we have none. There are only two or three companies in the world that have " oil tankers," and by means of this Bill we are saying to thos© companies to-day, " Clear out of Australia. We will have nothing to do with you." Under this Bill the Go'vernrnent are taking up an attitude which I hope will never be adopted by  the Labour party when in power. They are creating what may prove to be a valuable precedent. They are saying, in effect, in this Bill, " If you have an opponent, destroy him by fair means or foul. Freeze him out." They are saying to the oil companies now doing business here, " We will rob you of the trade you at present enjoy here; we will destroy your business." They are going to render valueless the storage places that they have scattered all over Australia. When I entered into possession of the room assigned to the Leader of the Opposition, which had previously been occupied by the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> and before him by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, the only book I found there was an album of photographs of the tank storages of the British Imperial Oil Company. That book shows that the company has storage places all over the Commonwealth. Under this Bill the Commonwealth intends to take such action is will prevent that company from doing any trade in Australia. If the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> were a director of that company, and received two years' notice of the intention of the Government to take over the whole of the oil business in Australia, what action would he take in regard to oil supplies for Australia in the meantime f </para>

                        <para>- In respect of some of the commodities dealt with more than 50 per cent, of the trade is to be taken over. The Government propose to favour a company with which they have entered into partnership, and to impose' a rate of duty on oil brought in by other companies which will lead to an absolute monopoly. If I happen to be in Parliament when such a proposal is made, I shall not hold myself bound by this agreement to give the company an absolute monopoly by imposing prohibitive Customs duties, and refund them later to one company only. I shall not be prepared to freeze out every other company by means of Tariff preferences. I shall not be prepared to join with the Government in a proposal to refund to this company every penny that it pays by way of Customs duty, so as to give it an advantage over its competitors. We are asked to tie ourselves up for the next fifteen years to this company. We are to have only three directors, while the other parties to the agreement are to have four. We shall thus have no real control over the £48,000,000 involved; but. if the House votes for an inquiry, it will be open to us to determine what terms should be imposed. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am not going to traverse the ground travelled by me last Tuesday when dealing with this question. I object to the agreement for the reasons given last week by the honorable member for Flinders and myself. The British Petrol Commission reported that the people in Great Britain who were supposed to be interested in keeping down the price of oil were apparently interested in keeping up the price. That will be the effect of this agreement. The Commonwealth, as a partner in this enterprise, will be more interested in getting revenue from its operations than in seeing that the people of Australia obtain oil at a reasonable price. </para>

                        <para>- Of course: but that is an entirely different proposition to the one I am submitting. There is no provision! in the agreement to say who is the owner of the crude oil when it is discovered. I suppose we are to assume that all indigenous oil belongs to the Commonwealth, and I am objecting to the Anglo-Persian Company taking one-half. </para>

                        <para>- I have gone into this question very carefully, and am more than ever convinced that if the agreement is adopted it will be a bad bargain for the Commonwealth. I stated last Thursday that during the nineteen years I have been in public life I have never received a single penny-piece from any outside source. I say that deliberately. I have not the slightest interest in any concern, either manufacturing or importing, inside or outside of Australia, and if honorable members dare to hint that I am in any way connected or interested in any commercial concern, I may inform them that they are absolutely wrong. I am justified in repeating this statement, because certain insinuations have been made that opposition has been taken to this agreement because some of those outside who are supporting me in my motion for an inquiry are interested parties. I am confident that if we enter into this arrangement with the Anglo-Persian Company we shall be making a bad bargain, and one which we shall always regret. We shall be encumbered for a period of fifteen years, and the Anglo-Persian Company will be in a position to charge what it likes for refined oil. </para>

But apparently we are to have - as a result of a meeting upstairs - an amended agreement. </para>

We have been led to believe by the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> that there were to be six amendments in the agreement, and the Prime Minister hinted on Friday last that some amendments would be made. I am anxious to know in what way the measure is to be modified. </para>

                    <para>.. - The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> suggests by his motion a most 'unusual course, in order  that we may obtain further information. The honorable member said a good deal, but very little about the proposed Committee, still less concerning the sources from which it would get its information. Committees aTe like human beings, neither good nor bad; they move <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> their appointed way, but the Father of all decides. Where this Committee is to get its information from the honorable member did not tell us. But I, when speaking on the second reading on Friday, told him where he would get it, that is, from those who know all about it. Curiously enough, a volcanic  eruption  of activity has taken place during the last few days. Meetings have been held in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, traders have been brought together, and, with singular unanimity, resolutions ha&lt;ve been passed asking for this same blessed thing, -more information. Roses do not grow on thistles, nor do meetings of this sort take place without some moving force- behind them. In this instance, it is ea"sy to locate. Those companies which for many years have exercised a monopoly over this essential to our welfare, and which this cruel Government proposes to crush, have appealed to the great heart of the trading companies of Australia, who buy their oil from them and can buy it from nobody else, and  these traders,, between the devil and the deep sea, have rolled up and sent sixpenny, and, in some cases, shilling, telegrams to honorable members of this Parliament, urging them, in the name of God, to stay their impious hands. When I heard the honorable member the other day - and this is the second time  I have heard him - put up his plea for private enterprise, I was amazed. If I did not know the circumstances in which he finds himself, bereft of any argument, I should be appalled; but, as it is, I am merely' amazed. He says, " You propose to crush these companies, without which the Allies would never have won the war. There would have been no toluene and no explosives, and. men would not have been shattered to atoms but for the philanthropic efforts of these companies." He admits that they are not in the business for their health. He: says that the Anglo-Persian Company is not in the business for its health. But what has all that to do with the Bill ? The alternative that presents itself ta honorable members is whether, in regard to this vitally necessary commodity - fuel oil and the other refined products of petrol - without which the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> Commonwealth is powerless, it is better that it should have some control over the price as well as an effective assurance of supplies, or whether we should go on and trust to the tender mercies of commercial companies who are domiciled in  foreign  countries. The honorable member has. spoken very harshly to me this afternoon about my attitude towards foreign companies. He has suddenly developed a. tenderness of heart -towards the foreigner, that seems a trifle inconsistent, coming from the lips of a Protectionist who first taught me to slip from that narrow footpath of Free Trade upon which my infant feet were firmly placed. I remember in the bygone days, when I was a convinced Free Trader, the honorable member coming forward with an absolutely appalling proposal, amounting, in effect, to about 40 to 60 per cent, duty «n hats. I have always liked the honorable member, and while, as a matter of principle, I was a convinced Free Trader, yet when he put these hats before me, I fell, and voted for his hats; I was prepared to crush at one fell blow the Austrian, the American, and the Englishman. What more could I have done to show that when it came to a choice between Australia and the rest of the world, I was for Australia? But now, when it is proposed to set up a. refinery in this country to refine oil, the honorable member says " No. Let the Standard Oil Company and the " Shell " group flourish in America or Holland, or wherever they are located." The honorable member has no ground for his feet to stand on. Let me take his points, one by one. He wants more information? He does not want more information.  His  trouble i3 that he has too much. He knows the facts. What are they? These companies, ever since they came to Australia in the dawn of the petrol age, as I have termed it, have- exploited it to the last penny. Not a trader in Australia dares to raise his voice against them. One trader wrote to me the other day, marking his letter " private and confidential," saying that he had been told to attend a meeting, and* at that meeting everybody had to sign this protest, to which reference has been made. He signed it. He had to do so, but he said, "I want to tell you that if you can get this agreement through, and the Anglo-Persian people are prepared to supply my wants, they can have my custom." This amazing activity of the companies throughout Australia against the Bill is the best argument why we should support it. We are asked to support an Australian industry, but the honorable member wants more time to support it. I have heard him get up and advocate the establishment even of such an exotic industry as the manufacture of matches in this country. He never lacks an argument as to why aru industry should be established and encouraged here, bub when it comes to something that is vital to the very existence of the Commonwealth, he wants more information. I have seen a whole Tariff bundled through the House with less information. Honorable members will have an opportunity of displaying their amazing knowledge on a Tariff very shortly, and there will not be one item in it on which honorable members will not want more information than is required in regard to this agreement. The honorable member, leaving the safe and pleasant path of generalities in which a man may wander at will, incurring no ill consequences, has committed, himself to a certain particular criticism of the Bill. He says, for example, that a monopoly will be established in this country. I have already said in the plainest possible terms that this will not be so, but he himself has said it in more emphatic terms this afternoon. He said that the point that struck him more than anything else in the speech of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was that the amount of capital these people were to put into the industry, together with that put in by the Commonwealth, would be insufficient to create a monopoly, because it would not supply one-half of the capital necessary for that purpose. Furthermore, it has been observed by honorable members on both sides of the House that not one-half of the petrol, kerosene, and lubricating oil required  in this country can be supplied under this proposal. Therefore, the Australian market will be open to the whole world. That is the first answer to the honorable member's statement. The world can enter upon as good terms as ever, excepting that it will now have a competitor inside Australia, who, at any rate, will be some protection to us against that combined influence of commercialism outside to which we have been exposed so long. The honorable member also said something about freight. He affirmed that the Anglo-Persian Company will be able to make huge profits out of its freight charges, and he mentioned £1,200,000 in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- Naturally  the freight would be more than the value of the oil. The honorable member affirmed that the value of the crude oil is such that we cannot even bring it here and refine it locally. He said that we cannot even do that, because the raw material would be too expensive, and the freight would be too heavy. But he did not say one word about the freight upon refined products. Does he think that these gentlemen bring their refined oil products here for nothing, and distribute them to the people as a gift from God ? He said that the Anglo Persian Oil Company was charging £15 15s. per ton freight from somewhere in Persia to Great Britain. I do not know where he got his figures. </para>

                        <para>- If I thought that it would interest the honorable member I would not mind doing so. As a matter of fa-ct, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company carries its own oil, in its own steamers, and it consigns that oil to itself and to nobody else. It does not carry oil to Great Britain for anybody else ; it does not carry any oil except in its own ships, and it carries no oil but its own. What benefit it derives from charging itself £15 15s. per ton freight upon that oil, I leave it to the honorable member to determine. </para>

                <para>But this has no relevance whatever to the point under discussion. If the Anglo-Persian Company is likely to charge too much by way of freight, we may then get freight wherever we are able to procure it. The honorable member said that there are no vessels available to carry oil from overseas. Then all I have to say is that we shall have to find oil in Papua. In the meantime we shall get oil at a reasonable rate, and freight at the world's rate. If we do not like the world's rate, we can get freight of our own. The honorable member stated that the Commonwealth will have no voice in the matter of the price at which oil will be sold here. I do not know why he said that in face of the amended schedule, which distinctly sets out that " The refinery company shall sell its oil products at such prices as are fair and reasonable." </para>

                        <para>- In speaking of a meeting at which he says this matter was discussed, the honorable member affirmed that certain alterations had been made in the agreement. He was annoyed that they had been made, because they cut the ground from under his feet; yet he now says that he cannot see them anywhere in the agreement.. What am I to do to please him? When I make alterations in the agreement they do not suit him, and he cannot find them. The honorable member, in speaking of this bowelless combine, which in its utter disregard for foreign companies is going to crush them out of existence, rather overstepped the limits of accuracy, because it is set down in paragraph 14 of the bond that the protection to be given to the refinery company is contingent upon its selling oil at a fair and reasonable price. When it ceases to do that, the protection accorded to it wholly disappears. I wish that a similar provision could be applied to all kinds of protection - every item of the Tariff. I do not think there is one honorable member who would cast a vote against a proposal of that sort. When local manufacturers or traders, whoever they are, exploit or take advantage of the community under the protection given them, there ought to be some kind of punishment, and that is here provided for under the provisions of this agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Let me advise the honorable member to retire into that cave of silence which he keeps with sp much dignity and so much success. These outbursts into speech, in which the honorable gentleman is at once irrelevant, inaccurate, and not at all amusing, only besmirch his fair reputation. Despite the interjection, this agreement has nothing to do with Papua. However, I may say - because one has to deal with things as they are - that the oil in Papua' belongs to the people of this country, and it is the intention of this Government that it shall always remain the property of the people of this country, to be sold neither to this refining company nor the Anglo-Persian Company, nor any individual whatsoever, but to be owned for ever as one of the vital necessities of the public and corporate activities of the Commonwealth. The price of crude oil is fixed under the amended schedule, and the price of the refined product is fixed, and both prices have to be fair and reasonable, with the Commonwealth as judge in both cases. Freights are to be supplied at our option, either by the Anglo-Persian Company or by whom we will. </para>

                <para>The proposal that we should delay the passage of this measure in order that we may get more information fails; it must fail, because it is obviously a proposal emanating - though I do not suggest for a moment that that is why the honorable gentleman puts it forward - from those great interests which have too long dominated this country, and which see in the agreement a blow at their supremacy. What are the great points we have to decide? The first is, whether we shall 'have an Australian company or a foreign company here - whether we shall have oil refined in Australia or outside Australia, whether we shall give work to our own people or to the foreigner. The second point is, whether we shall have a company which, in its essence, is British, or one which, in its essence, is foreign; the third, whether we shall have a company which is not only British, but is also dominated and  controlled  by the British Government, as full partners with ourselves, or whether we shall still hand ourselves over, tied hand and foot, without any protection, to the foreigner ; and the last point is, whether, since we have to depend on the Navy for defence, we shall take hold of this great opportunity to protect ourselves, and secure ample storage for crude oil around this coast. These are the four points on which honorable members are to form their judgment. </para>
                <para>One word more, and I have done. It is said that the Anglo-Persian Company has already, in anticipation of this agreement, bought land at Fremantle. </para>

                        <para>- Anybody who wants greater proof than that would be difficult to please. However, let me explain the position. What has happened is this: I am told that the Anglo-Persian Company has made, or is making, arrangements for leasing land in this country. But that has nothing to do with this agreement. What is proposed is that there shall be storage for oil for the British Navy in certain parts, where the China Squadron, or any other, can oil if circumstances require. That is a very necessary thing, which is being done, not only here, but right throughout the Empire. That is the answer to the honorable member, and, I think, a good one. What we require is oil for our own Navy, and the chance to control supplies, control prices, and prevent the community from exploitation. We have ample information - us much information, at any rate, as we should be able to get from a Select Committee, which can hope for information only from one of two sources. We follow an admirable example - that of the British Government. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Commonwealth would be more concerned about getting profits .than in reducing prices; but in the next breath he told us that the Geelong Woollen Mills sell cloth at a much lower price than do private firms. Those two statements, when put together, seem a trifle inconsistent. We are more likely to get oil at a reasonable rate when the Government has control. </para>

                        <para>- That has nothing to do with the Arbitration Court. It is a question of referring any point in dispute to an arbitrator. Time is the essence of the contract; we have much to do this week, and we must close at the end of the week. In all the circumstances, and in view of the statement which I have made, and which I think fairly covers the whole of the points - if it does not,  I  shall be glad to answer by way of interjection any question that may be put - I ask the House to reject the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition, and to take the Bill into Committee forthwith. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister has stated that the choice is between an Australian (Company and a foreign company. To me it is nothing of the kind. To me, it is a question of the safety of the Commonwealth in making an agreement which will have a vital influence on perhaps one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has shown by his remarks that he has not taken the trouble to read the one document where he can get information on this subject - I mean the report of the Petrol Commission, which dealt with these matters in Great Britain lately. For the honorable member to gibe at a Commission such as that, is an insult to the. intelligence of the House, and shows the depths to which some men will stoop in order to carry their way through the House. Is it fair to ask us to discuss an agreement which has been amended in caucus, and distributed in caucus, when the House has not had the information before it until now? </para>

                        <para>- When honorable members learn the rules of debate,  and the procedure of the House, they will find that principles should be discussed in the House, and that the details of those principles should be dealt with in Committee. We have been told of a clause which it is said affords the protection that some of us ask for. Clause 14 of the agreement, as amended - the only clause that I have seen in the new form - provides that where the Commonwealth believes that the company is charging an unfair price it may open the Customs House door, and allow competition. Competition from whom? From one of the greatest monopolies in the world. In spite of everything that has been said, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company does control the Refinery Company. It has a majority of four out of seven on the board of directors. Whilst the Commonwealth retains the majority of the shares, it can elect only its own three directors, while the other four, comprising the majority of the board, are elected by the company. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable member will allow me to make my own speech in my own way. The Commonwealth Government has been fighting a Combine. If honorable members look up the speeches of the Prime Minister and the then Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> they will see how bitterly they resented the attempt made by the Inchcape Shipping Combine to crush the Commonwealth line of steamers. Inchcape, who controls that Combine, is the man who represents the British Government on this Combine. The Inchcape combine entered into an alliance with the Morgan combine to control the shipping of the world. Who can say that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, under the presidency of Lord Inchcape, will not enter into a similar combine here with the American oil companies to control the oil supplies of the world ? </para>

                    <para>- You give, the company a majority of four on the directorate, and say that if oil is not being sold by it at a fair and reasonable price, the door of the Customs House will be opened to admit competition. It is reasonable to argue that Lord Inchcape, who has engineered in Great Britain a combine with an American shipping trust may, in Australia, engineer another combine with the American Oil Trust. What conditions in the agreement would prevent him from doing that? </para>

                        <para>- The agreement with the parent company has no bearing on the question. The Petrol Commission has shown that the rate of freight - not that charged to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but that charged to the British Government - is £15 10s. We know, of course, that the oil is carried in tank steamers which cannot take return cargo, so that a profit has to be made out of vessels that travel one way empty. </para>

But it would be improper to allow, at this stage, the discussion of those amendments, they being purely matters for the Committee of the whole House to consider. </para>

                        <para>- A certain amount of latitude is always given to a Minister in charge of a Bill in the explaining of its provisions, and when, during a debate, suggestions have been made for the improvement of a Bill, the Minister in charge of it is entitled to indicate what he proposes to do to meet those suggestions. That is what I understood the Prime Minister to do. He may have been led by interjections to go more fully into matters than he would otherwise have done; but it would certainly be irregular to allow now a general discussion, on proposals which will properly come up for discussion in Committee of the whole House, and which can there be discussed in every detail. </para>

                        <para>- I accept your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The statement of the Prime Minister that the only information that could be obtained by a Select Committee would be the evidence of interested parties is at variance with what I know. My object in pressing for a Select Committee is not to hear what may be said by the representatives of the American Oil Trust- if I were on the Committee I would not want them to be summoned - but to get the evidence of experts. This agreement has been drawn up, presumably, by the persons who- drew up the shipping agreement and other agreements under which the Commonwealth has been so unfortunate. In regard to all these agreements, the Commonwealth has been let down badly, and has lost, I think, most of the cases that it has entered into. It is not clear what the agreement means. If, as the Prime Minister has stated, the Commonwealth is to be the sole arbiter of the price at which oil shall be sold in Australia, the monopoly which some of us fear will be prevented; but there is a yet greater monopoly to fear. The extent to which this company will control discoveries of oil in Australia and its Territories has not been made clear. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the permission of the person whom I have in mind to give his name before the House; but I ask honorable members to remember that we are tying up the industry for fifteen years, and that an adequate supply of oil is essential, not only for city industries and pleasures, but also f ot rural occupations. I welcome the introduction of an oil refinery into Australia; but there are certain doubts in my mind which I wish to have cleared up. I do not wish to .place our oil- supplies in the hands of some outside combine, especially in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is now fighting a shipping combine, which is trying its best to strangle our line of Government steamers, and whose  chairman  has entered into an alliance with the Morgan 'Shipping Combine of America to dominate the shipping of the world. As this man is also at the head of the concern with which it is proposed that we should enter into an agreement for the supply of oil, I dread the effect of his influence on our oil supplies. Lord Inchcape controls the biggest combine in the world, the Shipping Combine that beat the -British, American, and Australian Governments. It is now fighting our Commonwealth line of steamers, and causing them to come out here half empty. It is. doing its best to prevent them from securing a ton of cargo. Therefore, it is our duty to see that the Commonwealth does not again enter into a contract fatal to its interests. I shall vote for sending the Bill to a Select Committee. No harm can be done by a short delay. </para>

It is in its present form that i must discuss it, because I have not seen any proposals for its amendment. I believe that, if passed as it stands, it would give a monopoly to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The operations of that company are not confined to Persia. It has interests in Mexico and other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I have given notice of an amendment which I hope will be accepted if the Bill is not sent to a Select Committee. I want to make it perfectly clear that there shall be no monopoly. Clause 14 of the Schedule means nothing. It provides for the opening of the door of the Customs House; but an arrangement may be made between the Oil Trusts to prevent competition. The amendments spoken of by the Prime Minister may remove some of the objections to the Bill, but the measure, as it stands, does not make clear the position of the Commonwealth and of the company in regard to discoveries in Papua and British New Guinea. So far as I can understand the whole of the operations in exploiting the oil resources of Papua are to be handed over to this company. </para>

                        <para>- is that not exactly what I have said? The British Government and the Australian Government have entered into a partnership under which each is to expend a certain amount of money in boring and exploring for oil in Papua. The Minister for the Navy says that it is not true that we have handed over to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the expenditure of this money, but that the British Governmentwill hand over its expenditure to that' company. What is the difference? </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that you, sir, have ruled that the amended schedule to the Bill cannot, be discussed on the motion to refer the measure to a Select Committee, . because the airy fairy pictures painted', by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> when' he informed me that it would be better for me to remain silent, were based upon his statement that I had not read the amended schedule. I had not seen it at the time, and the basis of all theridiculoius pictures which the Prime Minister drew was that we had not seen the amended schedule. I thoroughly understand the reason for the ruling that has been given, but it is a pity that because of it honorable members who desire to refer to the statements made by the Prime Minister should be unable to do so. For three-quarters of an hour the right honorable gentleman laboured in ridiculing those opposed to him because they did not know what was contained in the amended schedule. </para>

                        <para>- There has been some reference to the agreement having been referred to the Ministerial Caucus. I make no complaint about that. The Government found that some honorable members opposite were slipping away from them, and they were justified in trying, in Caucus, to secure a majority in favour of their proposal. The Prime Minister became eloquent in his appeal to Protectionists to support the agreement, and, pointing to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> he said that, while that honorable gentleman was in favour of Protection for hats, matches, and other things manufactured in Australia, he was apparently slipping on the question of Protection for kerosene. I suppose that there is not an honorable member on either side of the House who is not in favour of the production and refining of oil in Australia. </para>

                <para>As a reason for referring the Bill to a Select Committee, I may mention the fact that the Government have, themselves recognised that the schedule, as originally introduced, was not what it ought to be. If the Bill had been referred to a Select Committee, -it would have been shown that alterations were necessary. I think it can be shown that there is still much in the agreement which should be altered. I see no reason why, if a Select Committee considered the measure, they should not be able to submit an agreement in accordance with Australian policy which would be accepted unanimously by. this House. We have been told that we have been tied for years to an overseas and foreign monopoly, and we should prefer a so-called British and Australian monopoly; but there is one matter in connexion with this proposal which should be inquired into if a Committee were appointed to do nothing else.

The British Government have interests in this matter, and I am glad to find them seek: ing an interest in productions required by the people. I am assured that the crude oil produced by the Anglo-Persian Company is inferior, and that there is a greater loss in refining it than in the case of any other oil. I do not claim to be able to say what is the value of either crude or refined oil, but I do think that we should inquire into the assertion that the crude oil supplied by the Anglo-Persian Company is inferior in quality, and that from an economical stand-point it would not be beneficial to the people of Australia to use it. We should not lose sight of the fact that some of the people who have put their money into the Ang-10: Persian Company have not shown themselves to be friends of the Commonwealth. Having control of the directorate in the. matter of administration they will direct operations under the agreement. </para>

                <para>In his endeavour to ridicule honorable members on this side, the Prime Minister pointed to the fact that under the amended schedule a "fair and reasonable " price for oil would be fixed by the Commonwealth. I have not been  a  member of. this House for thirteen  or  fourteen years without knowing that the phrase used is about as vague as it could possibly be. From time to time we have had Bills under consideration in this Chamber, which we have been assured would stand the test in any Court, but the. High Court has subsequently driven the proverbial coach and four through them. Under the schedule to this Bill, we may have to go to the High Court every now and again to find out what is a " fair and reasonable " price, and  to  find out whether fixed " by the Commonwealth'' means by this Parliament  or  by the Ministry. I know that if the directors of the Anglo-Persian Company have anything to do with the matter the price will be a fair and reasonable one for them, and not for the people of Australia. What is to be a " fair and reasonable" price for this oil will have to be more clearly defined before the proposal will suit me. </para>
                <para>The Minister for the Navy has said that this agreement has nothing whatever to do with the exploitation of the oil fields of Papua.

I have not a word to say against that very estimable gentleman, but in view of the number of years during which he has been associated with the production of oil and with the Anglo-Persian Company - and that does not make him any the worse - and the fact that he has been in Papua for, I think, about three years, he should now be able  to  give  us  some very definite information concerning the prospect of the discovery of oil in payable quantities in Papua. </para>

                        <para>- Then by this time he should be able to express a definite opinion as to the probability of the production of oil in Papua. If he cannot do so, he is not the man who is wanted. I shall not approve of the Anglo-Persian Company having any control whatever of those appointed to investigate the possibilities of Papua for the production of oil. If we could appoint some one outside to go into the matter I would be quite satisfied, because under this agreement the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's crude oil will be used until we are in a position to refine our own crude supplies, drawn either from the mainland of Australia or from the Territories. I wish to help the Government in the production of oil in Australia, but if that cannot be brought about at once I want to assist in the matter of securing refineries here. However, we should have all the evidence concerning the suitability of the product and the economic possibilities of refining in Australia before we bind ourselves hand and foot for fifteen years. We know Lord Inchcape as a gentleman who is in business for the " quids " he can get out of it; and even though he represents the Imperial Government that should not entirely disarm this Government. Indeed, the Imperial authorities were indiscreet in placing upon the directorate as one of their representatives a gentleman having such interests, and we would be indiscreet, also, if we were to accept Lord Inchcape in the character of a guardian of our interests, seeing that at the same time he is doing his utmost to break up another Australian enterprise, namely, our shipping. A Select Committee should particularly inquire into three things - into Lord Inchcape's association with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; into the matter of the inferiority of their crude oil ; and with respect to who shall fix a fair and reasonable price. We are entitled to, and should see that we secure all that information, despite the ridiculous criticisms of the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>. - I  rise not to criticise the Bill - because I think the agreement is a good one - but to ' make a statement which is rather in the nature of a personal explanation. I de sire to make clear my own connexion with exploration for oil in Papua. When, in 1916, I was appointed Minister for External Affairs - the Department is now known as that of Home and Territories - one of the first matters to which I directed my attention had to do with prospecting for oil in Papua. There had been a great deal of dissatisfaction concerning these activities, and I, personally, shared in that dissatisfaction. The fact is that the position of the Commonwealth in respect to oil investigations has been unfortunate. When I made my first inquiries I discovered that up to that stage we, had expended about £60,000 in exploration work, with a return of about 2,000 gallons of oil. That was very poor, of course; but at least it indicated that there was oil in Papua, although it did not determine whether or not it was there in payable quantities. It was still considered that scientific and practical investigations might discover payable deposits. Soon after I had assumed office the representatives of two separate syndicates waited upon me to ascertain whether private enterprise would be allowed to prospect for oil in Papua. So far as I was concerned, I said "Yes." One of these gentlemen represented a Californian company, and the other a local syndicate. Both concerns were apparently in a position to conduct exploration work on a practical basis. I went into the matter very thoroughly, and formulated a scheme which provided for the prospecting to be undertaken in such a way as to secure the Commonwealth Government in every conceivable direction. The information at my disposal was insufficient ' for me to know whether the oil was likely to be struck in the form of a continuous stream, or lode, or in reservoirs. In either case, however, I had arranged that there should be areas of 5 square miles allotted, and that every alternate area should be held by the Commonwealth Government, so that we would be protected, no matter whether the oil was discovered in lode formation - that is to say, in a continuous canal - or in subterranean reservoirs. I set forth that the Commonwealth should have' first call upon all oil produced, and that the price should not exceed 3d. per gallon, which would amount to about 10s. per barrel on the basis of 40 gallons to the barrel ; also that the company should build such wharfs as might be necessary, and should lay a pipe line from the source of oil supply to the wharfs on the coast ; further, that it should find its own tank steamers. The representatives of the syndicates were quite willing to accept all that I had laid down, and all this was to be done without cost in any way to the Government. I then wrote to the Legislative" Council in Papua, submitting my proposition, and asking for concurrence. I was informed, however, that that body could not concur, that it would not agree to my proposition, because, if the field were developed by private enterprise, the labour engaged  thereon  would be drawn from the rubber and cocoanut plantations, so that the latter would be left shorthanded. I responded that no matter by whom the oilfield was developed the same conditions would arise, providing prospecting proved to be successful. Prom all appearances, then, the curtain was rising on what promised to be a successful commercial drama ; but soon there followed the tragedy. Before I had received a reply to my second letter to the Legislative Council in Papua I had departed from office. Nothing further, so far as I could ascertain, was done; and that was three years ago last February. Had my project been given effect to, the oil industry in Papua might have been flourishing to-day. Of course, I want to make it clear that I could not have overridden the dictum of the Papuan Council without the sanction of the Commonwealth Cabinet, and that up to that stage i had submitted nothing to- my colleagues, because I desired first to have all the facts, marshalled in order that Cabinet might be in a position to accept or reject a complete and definite project. As I say, nothing more was done after my retirement. I have often wondered why, and have come to the conclusion that - perhaps, notwithstanding his wonderful versatility, and despite his numerous  speeches  and voluminous writings - the subject of boring for oil was never once mentioned or described by Edmund Burke. That is the only reason that I can attribute for the failure of my successor in office to go on with the Papuan oil project. Had it been proceeded with, this agreement  might  never have been called for. Three years ago we ".vere in dire need of oil, and it is not impossible that to-day we might have been floating prosperously along a stream of oil emanating from our own Papuan fields. Wherefore, there would have been no necessity to enter into an agreement with any outside organization. </para>

In the matter of Australia's oil interests, there is something actually more dangerous than the creation of a monopoly-; that is the factor of delay. What does the reference to a Select Committee mean ? Ma-ny honorable members have had experience of such inquiries. After all, the Prime Minister appears to have met the objections of those who are appealing for the appointment of a Committee. How can there be a monopoly when the Prime Minister has promised to insert a clause which will insure that the Commonwealth authorities shall fix the price? And the proposed amendment of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> is of a character calculated to doubly safeguard the position. The Prime Minister has told us that prospecting is not to be prevented. </para>

I am opposed to the motion to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, because it is of vital importance that this great question of discovering oil should be. settled as soon as possible. We must find oil deposits in the Commonwealth territory. It is almost criminal on the part of honorable members to take any action, either here or elsewhere,. that will lead to delay. No sound reason has been- advanced to justify the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this matter. We now have all the safeguards that are necessary, for this afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> told the Leader ' of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> that if he were not satisfied with the Ministerial interpretation of the clause relating to the price to be fixed for crude oil - and the Prime Minister's interpretation is backed up by the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garram, who does not make many mistakes - then the Government are willing that the clause shall definitely state that the Commonwealth shall fix the price. What more can we ask? And is it not better to be associated with a company that belongs to the Empire? </para>

Consequently it is inexpedient to do anything that is likely to lead to delay. The appointment of a Select Committee would mean delay, and for that reason I intend to support the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened attentively to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> this afternoon, and came to the conclusion that he was entirely governed by sentiment, due, no doubt, to the fact that for the- last four or five years sentiment has entered so largely into all Government undertakings. But the time for that sort of thing has passed. Our financial position is such that sentimental considerations must be put on one side. We must endeavour to do something practical. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has moved to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, for the purpose of eliciting further information with regard to the agreement, and during the debate this afternoon, by a marvellous piece of conjuring, the amended schedule was placed in honorable members' hands. I was so surprised and annoyed that in speaking plainly I gave utterance to words at which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> took offence. It is not in my nature to insult anybody, but I think the circumstances warranted a strong statement. I am informed, on credible authority, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's crude oil is not a  first-class  article, or at least that there is better. And, moreover, I believe that the Anglo-Persian Company draw their chief supply from wells that are not under the protection of the British flag, so that it is possible that foreign Governments may be in a position to place an embargo on the output. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to Russia, for one. Those who are interested in this matter have written to me on the subject, and in interviews with me have made statements which, I think, warrant honorable members in giving more mature consideration to this agreement before it is ratified. I . can understand the Prime Minister's confidence because of the environment in which he has moved in Great Britain during recent years. But he appears to have lost sight of the fact that he is now in Australia, and that we are dealing with what is purely an Australian matter. If this agreement is heaven-born, then not much harm can be done if it is scrutinized by members of a Select Committee, to make sure that it contains nothing that is likely to be detrimental to Australian interests. I do not know whether members realize their position as representatives of the people.' I regard myself as a trustee of the public interests, and as such I want to make sure that this agreement is quite in order before I attach my signature - for I regard my vote as my signature - in ratification of it. </para>

                        <para>- When dealing with the question of the . freight on the oil from the wells to the refinery, the Prime Minister, in reply, to an interjection made by the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> said that under the agreement the rates must be fair and reasonable. The determination of what i9 a fair and reasonable rate to charge for anything depends upon whether one is a buyer or a seller. We ought to have more information on this subject. If the company fixed upon exorbitant freights, it seems to me that under this agreement we could not object to them, and that the Government would be powerless to take action if it were dissatisfied with the way in which the oil was shipped to the refinery. -It is all very well to say that we could use our own steamers, but the wells from which the oil is at present being obtained are in other countries over which we have no control, and we might not be permitted to use our own vessels. </para>

                <para>The schedule to the Bill is so full of anomalies that it might well be described as " A Schedule of Anomalies for the most part Telling against Australia." We ought to exercise the greatest caution' in accepting an agreement involving, as this does, a gigantic financial deal and binding us down for fifteen years. We have no idea what Australia's future oil supplies may be. The whole position is so uncertain that there ought to be no hostility to the proposal to appoint a Select Committee to ascertain who are the moving spirits in this enterprise, and whether a better agreement could not be drafted. If these oil people are the monuments of perfection they claim to be, and are so anxious to help Australia, they have nothing to fear from the appointment, of a Select Committee. </para>

The people concerned are citizens of repute, and are surely deserving of some consideration. They are evidently dissatisfied with the agreement, and do not approve of the Commonwealth binding itself in this way for fifteen years. The original agreement, as brought before the House, was found to be so dangerous that a caucus meeting of Ministerial supporters was held, and drew the attention of the Government to certain defects in it, with the result that a further agreement was drawn up and put before the House in some mysterious way. -In business phraseology* it seems to be suggested that the Government have "fallen into a trap."

If that is done, and the Committee recommends the ratification of the agreement, no one will be better pleased than I shall be. My own belief is that inquiry will show that it should not be adopted in its present form. We are the custodians of the public purse, and should be watchful of the people's interests.

                    <para>.- I should very much like this agreement to be referred to a Select Committee empowered to make the fullest investigations. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stated that the Government would have to continue the policy of assisting and developing the Australian shale oil industry. I fear, however, that <inline font-style="italic">by the</inline> establishment of this enterprise we shall practically extinguish the whole of the shale oil companies now operating in Australia. The Prime Minister contends that the agreement will not interfere with them in the slightest degree. There does not, however, seem to be any reason for rushing this agreement through the House. If it were referred to a Select Committee that Committee could make the fullest inquiries in regard to our present shale oil industries, and also as to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Anglo-Persian Company. I have not had time to carefully consider  the whole schedule to the Bill, but I have perused it, and can find in it no provision for empowering a private company to establish oil refineries here and to import its crude oil free of duty. If any other private company established refineries here, and attempted to import crude oil, it would thus be crushed out of -existence by this monopoly. That appears to be the stumbling block to the ratification of the agreement. If the Government are anxious that Australia shall have an adequate supply of crude oil, it has an excellent opportunity to develop the oil-fields of the Commonwealth.

There is ample scope for developmental work, particularly in connexion with our shale oil deposits, which, if properly worked, would enable us to obtain supplies for the requirements of the Navy at the same price as the Anglo-Persian Company will be able to supply it. For some time, I have taken a considerable interest in- the operations of the British-Australian Corporation, and I do not want to see anything done that will be detrimental to- its interests, because I knew the shareholders of that concern have expended an enormous sum of money in developmental work. I am not particularly concerned in the shareholders' interests, but I do not want to see development retarded in such a way that it will result in men being thrown out of employment. The greatest obstacle in connexion with this- proposal is that if any other refinery were to start, there is a possibility of the Government refusing to allow it to obtain crude oil from abroad. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot agree with the statement made by the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nicholls)</inline> that honorable members have not had time to peruse the agreement. But I agree with him that it might be here for a very long time, and yet many of us would not fully grasp the meaning of its contents, or what it may lead to. It is an extremely intricate document, and I fail to understand the need for urgency, or the occasion for the fulminations  of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> this afternoon when he seemed to assume that there was something wrong in the attitude of honorable members who urge that the Bill should be sent to a Select Committee. In this House we have passed various kinds of legislation, and we have heard many statements made that would not stand the light of day. We are now dealing with a very important agreement, and I defy half-a-dozen honorable members to say honestly that they have fully grasped its contents. It deals with, something entirely new. None of us have had any knowledge of oil refining. Can it be contended that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> or any honorable member is urging anything on the House in the interests of the Standard Oil Corporation or people dealing in oil? The charge of the Prime Minister in that regard was a monstrous one; it was, as I felt, an imputation against those who, when something novel is brought into the chamber, have a perfect right to be fully satisfied that they grasp its contents, and thoroughly understand what they are giving away. I cannot understand the urgency for the establishment of a refinery. We are told there is to be a bonus of £50,000 for the discovery of oil in Australia. .But there is no need to give a bonus. The men who discover oil in Australia will make a fortune. An honorable member was discussing the question with me a little while ago, and insisted  that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's association with the Government in boring for oil in Papua was part and parcel of this agreement. It only shows how little honorable members know of the matter. The Anglo-Persian, Oil Company are simply acting as agents of the Commonwealth in boring for oil in Papua, and that arrangement has no connexion with the Bill before the House. </para>

Until we discover oil in Australia, we must get our crude oil from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. They may charge a higher price for their crude oil, and for the cost of refining than the cost of other imported oils; but if some other firm proposes to start a refinery in, Australia, bringing oil here for that purpose, and charging half the price which the Anglo-Persian Company may be asking, this Parliament is pledged under the agreement to pass legislation imposing a duty on crude oil coming into this country if there is unfair competition. </para>

                <para>I do not think there is much justification for the Bill, because I cannot see what we are to gain by having an oil refinery here. Enormous gain would result if sound, practical efforts were made to prove the existence of oil in Australia. For a great number of years, we have been spending money in Papua with bad results, because the work has been undertaken by the Government, instead of endeavouring to carry on the work under a political Minister. I commend them now for taking steps to utilize the services of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who have special experts and geologists who thoroughly understand the business. I am also pleased that, instead of adhering to the terms of the memorandum., which provided for retaining the field of exploration to Government efforts, such a policy has been renounced, and the Government are now prepared to allow outsiders to prospect for oil in that field. Before we talk about establishing a refinery, we should give every assistance to people to prospect, not only in Papua, but also on the mainland, to see if oil can be developed here. Once we discover oil in Australia, we shall soon have a refinery established. I think) the Government would be justified in giving a bonus or financial assistance such as is given to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, for the purpose of endeavouring to establish such refineries here, but our first step should be to do all we possibly can to . discover oil. Some of my constituents recently paid a  very large fee . to one of the best oil experts in Australia for a geological report on certain portions of Western Australia, and he gave a very favorable report. Other persons are applying for land in. the Northern Territory, believing from reports and indications that it would be possible to obtain oil there. If these people are prepared to spend their money, and if it can be certified by a geological Department that the conditions are in any way favorable for the discovery of oil, the Government will be justified in spending many thousands of pounds in the purchase of drills, which could be lent out to parties, prepared to guarantee the expenditure of a certain amount of money in prospecting work. In my opinion, the offer of a large bonus is worthless. Let us give assistance to prospectors. However, as we are dealing with something novel, which carries with it many; important functions and conditions, and as I cannot see any justification for urgency, I strongly support- the motion to send the Bill to a Select Committee, so that we may be able to secure advice, and see that the measure gives the best possible protection to the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

I must again refer to that most valuable report of the Committee of the House of Commons on petrol supplies from . Great Britain. It would have, been of great benefit to honorable members if the Government had had the whole of the Committee's report printed, because it is so educative. Unfortunately, I do not think the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had taken the trouble to scan it when he introduced the Bill; otherwise he would not have given expression to so many erroneous ideas.

                <para>It is proved up to the hilt that the great bulk of the oil supplies of the world are under the control of American, Mexican, and Dutch companies. It is admitted that had. it not been for the supply received from these quarters, Great Britain would have been bankrupt in oil supplies during the recent war. If this agreement be adopted, it will give the Anglo-Persian Company a big Government backing and a considerable monopoly so far as supplies of oil for Australia are concerned. Now it has been admitted upon all sides that that company, either from its Persian wells or from any other source, cannot supply one-fourth of the requirements of Britain and Australia. </para>

It had the best possible evidence at its command, and, after going into the whole question exhaustively, it arrived at certain conclusions. Amongst other things, it concludes that one of the factors contributing to the high cost of oil is the Shipping Ring. Now, who . is one of the chief instruments of that great Shipping Combine? The very man who occupies the position of representative of the British Government in connexion with this Anglo-Persian Oil Company - I refer to Lord Inchcape. He is at the head of this great Shipping Combine, and, to a large extent, he and his associates can control the freights of the world. It was admitted in evidence before the Committee which investigated this matter that one of the chief factors in the high price of oil is the cost of transferring it either from the oil wells or the refineries to its various destinations. The Committee says in its report - </para>

                    <para>The . recent advance to 3s.81/2d. in the price of petrol is, according to a public announcement, largely based on the increase in freight, although it is stated in the announcement referred to that only one-half of the present nominal market freight is included in that price. </para>

                    <para>Figures furnished by the Ministry of Shipping show that early in December, 1919, the rates between the United Kingdom and the northern ports of the United States were 150s. per ton, between the United Kingdom and Trinidad 170s., between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf 210s., and between the United Kingdom and Borneo 280s. </para>

                <para>Honorable members, I am sure, are grateful to the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> for the splendid way in which he dealt with this question the other evening. He said that he could only see two ways by which the Anglo-Persian Company can make a profit out of this agreement. It will certainly make a profit out of the production of crude oil, but it will derive a much greater profit out of the freights from Persia to Australia. What matter, then, if the Commonwealth has a bite at the small portion of the cherry which is left? Freights are dearer from Persia to Britain than they are from the United States to Britain, or from Trinidad to Britain. During the war, although the British Government were supposed to exercise a dominating influence in the affairs of the Anglo-Persian Company, that company exacted from the British public more profits by way of freights than it obtained in any other way. </para>

I am giving him the facts as they are related by an expert body which was formed of members of the House of Commons and experts of the oil industry. Can he do any better than that? He is dumb now. Evidently he is prepared to listen to what takes place at the caucus meeting of his party, and to swallow whatever the Prime Minister may say. Even the British Government cannot control the supplies of oil that enter Britain to-day. What does the Committee to which I have alluded say in this connexion ?. It says that the only way of rescuing the British public is by the League of Nations assuming control of the matter. The British Government have not been able to keep down freights, have not been able to leg-rope Lord Inchcape. </para>

                        <para>- It will be two years before the proposed refinery is established  in  Australia. In three weeks, a Select Committee could obtain sufficient information to satisfy even the most critical honorable member.- Then, if certain amendments were suggested by it, the House would readily accept them so long as they safeguarded the interests of the Commonwealth, and the passage of the Bill would thus be expedited. In the absence of such an inquiry, there will be grave suspicion that everything connected with this agreement is not quite above board. What will happen during the  two years which must elapse before the Anglo-Persian Company is able to refine a gallon of oil in Australia ? After the refinery has been established, the company will supply us with only a portion of the oil that is required to carry' on industry in Australia. Every day, in every part of the world, the demand for petrol is increasing; and the day may soon dawn when America will put its long arras practically around, the whole of the American supplies. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and it predicts a world famine in petrol. That being so, we should hesitate to shut out supplies of oil from Australia. There is the shale oil industry here which we should encourage more than we have encouraged it in the past. We are assured by those who are interested in it that that industry will be seriously imperilled, if it be not actually wiped out, if this agreement be adopted. I would like to give the representatives of the shale oil industry an opportunity of stating the reasons why they fear that it will be ruined if this agreement be approved. I ask honorable members to look at the amended agreement, though I understand that you, sir, will not allow me to deal with that. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I must again remind honorable members that this is neither a second-reading debate nor a debate in Committee upon the Bill. So far, I have allowed a considerable amount of latitude; and what honorable members have really been doing is to go over a lot of matter which has already been thoroughly- threshed, out in the House. When they desire to go farther, and to debate details of the schedule, and possibly details of suggested amendments, obviously, I must draw the line, because those are matters which can be dealt with only in Committee. When we reach that stage, honorable members, may dissect every word, every letter, and every comma of the Bill, or any proposed amendments to the Bill, if they so desire. Consequently it will not be in order at this stage of the proceedings to debate the matters to which I have alluded. The proposal is to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, when such matters would be freely open, to discussion, as they would also be in a Committee of the whole. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the numbers appear to be up. It is set out in the Bill that this Anglo-Persian Company is to use its best endeavours to obtain a full supply of oil for Australia. It may very soon report to the Prime Minister that it has used. its best endeavours in the direction indicated, and without success. But if, on the other hand, it obtains a full supply of oil for Australia, it will be obliged to go for that supply to the very people against whom honorable members opposite have inveighed so vigorously. If the Bill be referred to, a Select Committee, I hope that that body will examine representatives of the Vacuum Oil Company, of the Standard Oil Company, of the Shell Company, of the Anglo-Persian Company, and other' experts who may be available. </para>

                <para class="block">I understand, for example, that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> is still in Australia. If honorable members were sitting in judgment upon any case, would they limit the evidence to . one side? I claim that if any information can be obtained, even from an enemy source, that information should be made available. I should have no hesitation in telling any Select Committee appointed to get evidence where it could, so long as it obtained necessary information, and surely some information could be obtained from the men to whom I am referring. A Select Committee appointed by this House would no doubt possess sufficient brains to judicially examine evidence, and the whole inquiry could be completed in two or three weeks, and the report presented to Parliament when we meet again after the adjournment for the Royal visit. The question to be decided is a momentous one to' Australia, and we ought to see, when starting a business of this kind, that the foundations are firmly laid. There are columns in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 2nd March this year which disclose to me, at any rate, that we are in some danger if, without inquiry, we close with this- company. What is being done in other parts of the world where the oil industry is developing by leaps and bounds? In Mexico there are not fewer than 150 American companies obtaining and exporting oil, and if we depart from the State system of developing our oil resources we ought to allow other companies to send their experts to Australia. Personally, I should like to see the best experts employed, because, if we could get twenty companies to establish themselves in Australia, it would not- be long before we should be self-contained so far as oil is concerned. If this were so, we in Australia would be able to rejoice in the fact that by the development of our oil wells we were conferring immense benefits, not only on ourselves, but on all the world. </para>

                    <para>. -The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has expressed the joy with which he would welcome twenty companies to explore the Australian . oil resources. But Australia has been open to these companies all along, and one result of our neglect to do anything to provide ourselves' with oil was that petrol and other oils that come from petroleum were exceptionally dear in the Commonwealth all through the war period. One would think, to listen to some honorable members, that this was a new question suddenly sprung upon us; but those who follow the news of Australia will remember that the operations of the American Oil Combines in this country were fully investigated in the Courts of New South Wales only a year or two ago. It was shown that these Combines had made enormous profits at the cost of this country during the war period,  and when the Necessary Commodities Commission fixed a price which was considered fair, the Combines boycotted the State until the price was lifted to a level they thought they had a right to demand. Now, when the Commonwealth Government submit an agreement with a company which will provide, at any rate, some cheap oil, we have, from 'Unexpected quarters, these extraordinary arguments against the proposal. I was astounded to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> say that, because the Government would hold half the stock, they will become a party to the extortion of high prices. I never heard a more damaging argument against any proposal to nationalize an industry. If the Government would do such a thing, are they not just as likely to extort high prices through the medium .of other industries they might wholly control ? </para>

                <para>I have been waiting to hear one sound reason advanced for sending this Bill to a Select Committee. We heard reasons last week in the House and in the lobbies, but those reasons have all been dissipated into thin air; and we now hear great fear expressed that a giant monopoly is being established. We in Australia have suffered under at least two oil monopolies for many years. In New South Wales a Labour Ministry introduced a proposal to deal with the matter by establishing a State monopoly, not of crude oil, but of petrol ; and that proposal was supported, not only by the Labour party, but by a large section out- ' side. </para>
                <para>The proposal now before us is to refer to a Select Committee the agreement which the Government have entered into subject, to the approval of this House. The agreement does not establish a monopoly; and there is nothing in the way of the establishment of a monopoly to inquire into. The contract is to deliver certain quantities of crude oil yearly, and that quantity is not sufficient to meet the demands of Australia; thus the contract can have little effect on competing companies so long as their prices are as satisfactory as the prices of others. If the prices of those competing companies are better for the public than those charged by the Anglo-Persian Company the trade will soon go to them. But the fear that the public are going to be charged more is not the reason that we are inundated with expensive telegrams and literature - the- fear is that the presence of a company controlled by the Government will bring down the price of oil, and that the competing companies will have to leave the market or sell at the same figure. The whole agitation against the Bill is founded on an idea that by the establishment of refineries in Australia, where our people may find employment, we are striking a blow at the monopoly prices to which the Commonwealth has hitherto had to submit. That is not a matter for a Select Committee, but a matter on which every one who has followed the profiteering operations in this country can come to a speedy determination. </para>

                        <para>- If the object of the Leader of the Opposition is to get from a Select Committee a report in favour of nationalization, the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine')</inline> knows that such a proposal has no chance at all of being accepted by this Parliament. That choice is not open to Parliament; the choice is between the Bill as presented and no attempt to control the price of oil. The suggestion that we are to refer this matter to a Select Committee in order to get a report in favour of nationalization is an idle pretence which I do not think appeals to many honorable members. The practical suggestion is made that we should have our own refinery; but there is nothing to prevent the Shell Company or any other company from starting business here. Not many years ago, when I was on the same platform as honorable members opposite, the Standard Oil Company was an organization of which we spoke most scathingly; but to-day, apparently, the interests of that company are the inspiring theme of the opposition to the Bill. The Standard Oil Company is quite free to open refineries in Australia, give employment to our people, and sell us cheap oil if it can. There is not a line in the Bill which removes the power of the Commonwealth to encourage exploration for oil. The agreement has nothing to do with exploration for oil that is dealt with in- an entirely different agreement, which does not bind the Commonwealth to any one company. Any one of the twenty companies which the honorable member for Maribyrnong pictures in his imagination is free to explore for oil in Australia as much as it likes ; the agreement establishes no monopoly - gives no monopoly rights. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to the powers that may be exercised in connexion with the Customs duties; but under what conditions? If the Commonwealth Government thinks the price charged is fair and reasonable it may do the things provided, and can only do them through this Parliament; not only is the Government to be satisfied that the price is fair and reasonable, but the majority of honorable members has to be satisfied before any one of these three conditions apply. The fear that a monopoly will be created is the emptiest of all the suggestions made in support of a Select Committee. There is not a line in the . Bill that gives a monopoly to the Anglo-Persian Company, or prevents any other company establishing refineries here; and all the arguments advanced, one after the other, against the agreement are arguments that do not touch the case. </para>
                <para>For myself, I am prepared to accept the Bill in its present form. After all this talk about the amendments those we have so far seen in print are only explanations of the Bill, or intended to more clearly phrase the provisions already in the measure. To me the Bill seems entirely unobjectionable from the point of view of the establishment of a monopoly. And we must remember that we are not in a position to make a free choice. If we could have got our oil refined and sold at a reasonable price, there would have been no necessity for this Bill; but at present we are absolutely in the grip of monopolies which have been levying toll on us all along, and which will continue to do so unless we take some action. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it has; and, therefore, all the more necessity there is for an agreement to prevent it doing it in the future. If we could make similar agreements with other companies it would, be for the benefit of the Commonwealth, for that would, at any rate, give us some cheap oil, and enable the public to see the comparative prices, and judge what ought to be paid under present world conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so easily "bluffed " that I accept some of the speeches which have been made in this Chamber to-day, as expressing the real opinion of those who made them. Nor am I so easily " bluffed " that I can be induced to repeat here the statements which appear in pamphlets issued by what is one of the greatest monopolies in the world to-day, the Standard Oil Company. Honorable members opposite have condemned these monopolies, and yet in their speeches on this Bill they have re-hashed the arguments which the Standard Oil Company has caused to appear in the newspapers, and has circulated wherever they would find acceptance.I should have liked to hear from the honorable member for Maribyrnong something  in the vein of the ' old Labour opposition to monopolies, and some slight approval of the action of the Prime Minister in making an agreement which will enable us to at least reduce the toll that some of these monopolies levy on the Commonwealth. I believe that the effect of the Bill will be to reduce the cost of fuel oil to Australian industries, and it is because I so regard it that I shall support it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member would not be in order in doing that. As I have pointed out, the second-reading debate has closed, the House having, on a division, agreed to the second reading of the Bill, and thus having approved of its principles. The honorable member would not be in order in discussing the agreement, which is a schedule to the Bill, and, virtually, the whole Bill, at this stage. He may address himself only to the motion before the Chair, for referring the Bill to a Select Committee. He will be in order in giving reasons why that should or should not be done, but he would not be in order in making a second-reading speech on the Bill itself. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has told us that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company came into existence as the result of the activities of a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> d'Arcy, who obtained a concession from the Persian Government for the purpose of exploiting the oil resources of Persia, excepting that part of it which borders on the Caspian Sea. In what has happened since we have an illustration of the new phase of Imperialism. The explorations of. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. d'Arcy,</inline> and the energetic persuasions of certain high British officials who are mixed up in this company have become responsible for the fact that Persia is now to all intents and purposes a part of the British Empire. It seems to me that the scheme is part and parcel of the activities of what is known as the <inline font-style="italic">Round I1 able</inline> group, or the newer Imperialism, that seeks to exploit the outlying parts of the Empire in the interests of a gang of financiers in London. It is eighteen years since Persia became an oil-producing country. Close upon the discovery of oil there, Persia was partitioned between Russia and Great Britain, but as the result of the European war Britain now holds not merely the part allotted to her by the agreement with Russia, but the whole of Persia. The internal composition of this Anglo-Persian Oil Company makes it apparent that it is intended to act towards the oil fields which are thought to exist in the Commonwealth and its Territories in the same way, and. to my mind, the development of the oil industry in Australia under the terms of the Bill would be fraught with as great danger to the liberties of the people of this country as the discovery of oil brought to the people of Persia. </para>

                <para>In a. booklet issued during the war by the Society of Friends in Great Britain, and entitled, <inline font-style="italic">Whence Come Wars,</inline> there is a very illuminating reference to this matter. The writer points out how the great armament firms were supported by their various Governments, and were the  cause of precipitating the nations into war. He goes on to say: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Powers depend on their Vickers, their Schneiders, and their Krupps, their  Ternis  their  Skodas,  and 'their  Putiloffs.  With these they endeavour - snaking the best terms they can, according as the State or the corporation is more self-assertive and independent-to obtain allies and to weaken their enemies. They foster their firms, wink at their extortions (Schneider in Morocco), disregard their corruptions (Krupp and Carnegie in Germany and United States of America), and ignore their briberies (Vickers in Japan). </para>
                    <para>France helps Schneider by every means in its power to obtain the iron deposits in Morocco which Germany endeavours to prevent becoming French.  Terni  and Skoda both cast their eyes on the mineral riches of the Balkans. The Persian Oil Syndicate and the European Petroleum Union contend for the finest oil wells, and, when war threatens them, the Governments behind each group divert large forces to the Tigris Basin. The French Government likewise, intervene to keep Krupp from acquiring an interest in the  Putiloff  Steel Works, whilst the same Government works with might and main, to secure the railway contracts of Anatolia for its own capitalists as against the Germans. </para>
                    <para>These are the kinds of economic conflicts which bring nations to the brink of war, for the reason that on the prosperity and consequent efficiency of certain highly-developed industrial concerns depends the success of the countries -themselves should war break out. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite wrong. What I object to is the establishment of an autocracy in this country as well as in Germany, or, for the matter of that, in any other country. I am afraid that I cannot help the honorable member if he is unable to see the drift of my argument, but what I am endeavouring to show is that the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company represent  simply  one of the newest methods of extending the frontiers of the Empire, by securing, by one means or another, materials essential to the development of certain industries, and especially those necessary in war time. I have said- ako that the adoption of these methods is one of the most potent factors in fomenting wars. The honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> must know very well that Mesopotamia and Persia are, for all practical purposes, part and parcel of the British Empire, simply because of the existence of oil wells in those countries. The Prime Minister, in introducing the measure now under consideration, pointed out that oil has to-day become an essential requirement for warships, for war industries, and for transport by land and sea. It is now on the same plane as iron, cotton, rubber, and other commodities essential to the operations of people bent upon, Empire building and land grabbing, if they are to successfully make war against their trade rivals. In the view of these people, countries or small nations weak in defence have no rights, and must be wiped off the face of the earth, or be forcibly incorporated with one or other of the great Powers in order that the world may be divided up into new Imperial groups. </para>

When addressing myself to subjects under consideration in this Chamber, I am not concerned about the individual opinions of honorable members opposite, or even of honorable members on this side, but my purpose is to discuss various matters from the view-point of the industrialists in all countries, who, I may tell honorable members, are very much concerned about the system of concession giving and exploitation of which the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are a sample. If honorable members take the trouble to read such organs of the New Imperialism as the <inline font-style="italic">Bound Table,</inline> they will know that there is a combination in Great Britain whose idea is to exploit the Dominions of the Empire in the interests of a financial group whose head-quarters are in London. </para>

                        <para>- Not under present circumstances. Honorable members should be aware that the world to-day is being divided into huge international Trusts. The nations are taking on the aspect of Trusts. They have become huge industrial workshops that must have control of the materials they require or go under in the industrial struggle to maintain their supremacy. It every  day  becomes increasingly necessary for them to control in one way or another countries rich in iron and the other articles I have referred to that are essential for the maintenance of their superiority in armaments. They must acquire these countries by force, or, if they have them, must use force to retain them. Taking this view of the question, I find no reason for supporting the oil agreement which has been submitted to us. In my opinion, it calls for a very exhaustive inquiry by a Select Committee, or by some other body, to justify the Government in asking us to consent to it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member believes that the rulers of this country claim to possess brains enough to exercise control over such matters as shipping, mills, and several other phases of commercial activity. But this oil business seems to be surrounded by a mysterious halo which cannot be penetrated. When it is a matter of Australia desiring, to build submarines and destroyers we can send men to Great Britain to learn their job. Are there no refineries in other parts of the world where Australian citizens can be sent to learn the technique of refining oil during the period which is to be occupied by endeavours to discover oil deposits here? I have been reading a book in which I learned that the trouble with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been, not that it has had insufficient supplies of oil, or that the. quality has not been up to the mark, but that it has not had enough refineries to cope with its output. The nature of this agreement, in my mind, tends to support that fact. Can it be expected that the Anglo-Persian Company's experts will be particularly keen on discovering oil m Australia and its Territories, seeing that they have, in their Persian fields, more than sufficient oil to  keep all their refineries going, including , the proposed refinery in Australia? Here is a quotation from <inline font-style="italic">The Mineral Industry During 1917 -</inline></para>

                    <para>It is now stated that the oil-fields that are being developed and tested by the producing companies of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are among the most extensive and prolific in the world. Were refineries existing to deal with the oil, the field from which crude is now being obtained would produce about 4,000,000 tons annually. Most of the wells, however, have to be kept shut down for want of facilities to deal with the crude. Some idea of the richness of this field is given by the statement that the present obtainable production exceeds that of the whole of the Roumanian and .Galician oil-fields before the war. </para>

                    <para>.- We know that Australia is lamentably short of oil, and that it is all-important that we should be in the way of securing cheap supplies in order to increase our production, primary and secondary. This agreement provides a means of securing oil fuel more cheaply, and it should certainly stimulate efforts to discover oil in Australia. If a monopoly were to be given to the Anglo-Persian Company I would endeavour to secure the insertion in the Bill of clauses calculated to frustrate such a purpose. But the satisfactory fact is that, under the terms of the Bill as it stands, the company's interests will be acquirable by the Commonwealth within fifteen years. I trust that this House will specifically define in the Bill the duties of the two independent persons who are to be called upon to fix a valuation. The factor of goodwill in relation to this matter should be considered now, and in cold blood. I know that in Western Australia the neglect to make definite that point in the drawing up of an agreement with a certain company cost the city of Perth over £240,000. I hope the Commonwealth will never be called upon to pay anything for goodwill; and that, indeed, nothing but the question of actual value will be taken into consideration. Now is the time to safeguard the position. I feel that a House comprising, as it does', seventy-five honorable members representative of every part of Australia, should be capable of saying whether this agreement is in accordance with the wishes of the people without calling for the appointment of a Select Committee. It would be dangerous to try to secure expert evidence in Australia upon the oil question. I certainly was not helped in that direction by a certain telegram which I received to-day. I have not had too much sympathy - and neither have the people of Australia, generally - from these people who are concerned 'in the supply of Australia's oil requirements. The House is indebted to the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> for his able contribution to the debate. The honorable member correctly expressed the feeling that if any alterations in the agreement were necessary they could be effected during the Committee stage of this Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I approach this subject with diffidence, because of the attitude I have always adopted towards great Trusts or Combines. I regret that we are not sufficiently advanced in our ideas of Democracy to follow the example of Japan, and deal with these corporations as effectively as has the Government of that country. Last year the people of Australia paid £6,500,000 for the petroleum used in this country, and when we remember that the total cost of production, including mining, casing, and refining, was only about £500,000, and freight absorbed another £500,000 at the outside, we find there was a clear profit of £5,500,000 for the oil companies. I have no great regard for the Standard 'Oil or Vacuum companies, because, in my opinion, they are all joined together against the interests of Democracy. Their only god is pelf, and their only desire is to secure dividends. Let us look at this proposal in a common-sense way. It seems to me that its only effect will be to prevent the development of our oil deposits in Australia or Papua, and to encourage the crude oil products of Persia in the refineries to be erected in Australia. Therefore, I earnestly urge honorable members to follow the lead set by Japan and support the motion for a thorough investigation into the agreement. Lord Inchcape is at the head of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I only mention his name as a reminder to honorable members of the difficulties we have experienced of late years in connexion with the Shipping Trust. </para>

                <para>I have had many differences of opinion with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> but in connexion with this Trust evil I should like to quote briefly from <inline font-style="italic">The Uprising of the Many,</inline> by Russell, who, by the way, gives a good deal of credit to the Minister for Defence for action which he took some years ago fighting Trusts that were threatening Australia. A former Premier of South Australia, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price, had trouble with the Shipping Trusts of Australia. This is what happened - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The Trust got a verdict of 500 dollars. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> owned his cottage, the result of years of toiling at his trade, and beyond that he had not a dollar. So the great Shipping Trust, which annually gouged millions from the people of Australia, purposed to seize the 900- dollar cottage to punish him for telling the truth. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Then an agent tried to tempt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> by offering to advance him the money, and it is related by one eye-witness that a somewhat portly gentleman was seen rushing out of a house with an infuriated member of Parliament behind him. This agent, we are told, was finally kicked like a bundle of rags into the gutter. The writer also has something to say about George Ryland, who was eliminated from the Northern Territory by that man who, in my judgment, ought to be in gaol for his administration there.

He made a study of mines; no man knew them better; but no employer would have him on any terms. Finally a miner, who was an old friend, and to whom he had made a rather pleading application, said to him, " Fisher, I should like to have you here, for I know your ability, but it is impossible. You know what would happen to me if I employed you. In six months we would both be looking for jobs." </para>

                <para>I have referred to these incidents in order to bring home to honorable members the evils that confront us in connexion with these Combines. I may also relate my own experience of Standard Oil methods. A gentleman who, I understand, enjoyed a salary of £16,000 a year, and commission, boasted, I believe, at a meeting in South Africa, that, if necessary, he would buy the Commonwealth  Parliament iri order to advance the interests of his company. I was introduced to him a few years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alcock,</inline> of Messrs. James Service and Company. He at once commenced to speak about Standard oil, which, as honorable members know, is not a pleasant subject with me. I said to him, I do not care to talk about Standard oil. Let us talk about something else." In the course of our conversation I was interrupted by a constituent, and upon my return he again started to talk Standard oil. Another interruption in the conversation occurred, and for the third time he introduced the subject of Standard oil. I then said to him, " I will eat with you, drink with you, or smoke with you, but I will not talk Standard oil with you." He at once replied, "But, doctor, you must know that we give the public a better article at a cheaper price than any other company, and we pay better wages." It then flashed across my mind that he was the man from South Africa, and I said to him, " I believe you are the man who boasted he could buy the Commonwealth Parliament. Let me tell you that your Standard Oil Trust may be rich enough to buy anything, but, by the Living God, you will not buy the Australian people, who have the adult franchise." At that moment my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alcock,</inline> joined in and asked the reason for my display of temper, and the Standard Oil- Company's representative at once replied, " The doctor is not to blame; h© gave me three warnings." I then remarked that I would like to fling the Standard Oil Company " down below.*' He replied, "It would make a mighty fine blaze." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alcock</inline> was pacified, and there the matter ended. The man, however, attained his object. "We were trying to bring about the importation of oil in bulk, so that it might be tinned and cased in Australia, and thus give employment to tinsmiths and carpenters. In that effort we were defeated by two votes, and I believe that those two votes were had." The two men who were suspected have long since been relegated to oblivion. </para>

                        <para>- There are no Trusts in Switzerland. Under the Constitution of that country a law may be altered or amended at any time. If the referendum, the initiative and recall were in operation here the position would be very different. As it is I view with some degree of trepidation the proposal to bind the Commonwealth in this way for fifteen years. Why should Australia be delivered into the hands of this wealthy Combine, with Lord Inchcape at its head, for such a period? The time fixed for the operation of the agreement is too long. In the words of one of the brightest Englishmen that ever lived, no generation has a right to make laws that future generations must obey. No King or Parliament should impress upon future generations laws which are thought suitable for the control of the people in their day. This Parliament has no right to impress upon future Parliaments any agreement made between the Government or a Trust or Combine that may be found to be detrimental to Australia. In <inline font-style="italic">The Uprising of the Many,</inline> honorable members will find further arguments in support of the view I have put forward.

On the other hand, what power should we have to control the wages of those employed by this company in Persia? People work there under conditions of semi-slavery. What power should we have over them? None whatever. Honorable members will find in <inline font-style="italic">The Mineral Industry During 1917,</inline> which was quoted by the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> a very strong argument in favour of the reference of this question to a Select Committee.

Honorable members then saw it for the first time, and no man, no matter what his ability, could in the meantime have made a thorough study of the issues involved. We are to have next week a visit from a very high and cultured individual - a Prince of the Royal House, of England - and we are to adjourn for something like a month. During that time the Select Committee could make full inquiries, so that there would be very little delay in dealing with the agreement if the amendment were adopted. I shall vote for the appointment of a Select Committee, and I regret very much that the Government has not seen fit to accept our proposal. </para>

We have already threshed this matter out, and I, therefore, do not intend to repeat what I have already said; but, for the safety of the industry in Australia, I think it is necessary that such a provision as this should be inserted. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know the object of the proposed new clause ; it is entirely new to me. This is a proposal for a co-operative enterprise in which the Government is the predominant partner, and the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> now desires that everybody shall be able to operate, and that nothing in this Bill shall be held to prevent them coming in and cutting the throat of the Government at the earliest opportunity. That is what it means if it means anything at all. These gentle aids to Government enterprise no doubt appeal to some honorable members ; but I am bound to say that I cannot conceive of anything more calculated to assist the foreign exploiter than such a proposal as this. It is an invitation for every one to come here and do whatever they please. It is as foreign to the Bill as it is possible to conceive. All that the Bill does is to give effect to the agreement. The amendment proposes that nothing contained in this measure, meaning the Bill as distinct from the agreement, shall be deemed to prevent any person or persons, either individually or collectively, from prospecting for, developing, manufacturing, refining, and marketing any well oil, shale or other oil in any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in the Act. The proposal goes very much further than the honorable member intends, if one is to deduce his intentions from his words. For example, it may be held that the agreement gives persons the right to prospect for oil in any Territory of the Commonwealth. But it does not. We do not propose to allow any person to prospect for oil in New Guinea, except under our direction and under certain prescribed and proper restrictions. </para>

                        <para>- God forbid that I should do anything to dissolve the bonds of this unholy alliance between the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> and the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams).</inline> I can only say, as I nave said frequently in the discussion of this Bill, that there is nothing to prevent any one from coming here to start another refinery, or to prospect for oil. Furthermore, i said this afternoon that the Government proposed to aid in the search by offering £50,000 for the discovery of oil . But now the honorable mem"ber wishes to sweep this to one side by putting in a' clause the scope of which may go, for aught I know, very much further than honorable members are prepared to let it go. Since the Bill cannot take away any right from anybody, except as set -out in the agreement, and since the agreement does not prevent any one from coming here to prospect for, or develop, or refine oil, the proposed new clause is superfluous, and to the extent that it mentions the Territories, which we are resolved to reserve as the prerogative of the Crown, it is dangerous. I hope honorable members will not agree to it. </para>

Honorable members opposite advocate open competition, while we on this side stand for Government monopoly ; but I propose to support the clause because it will permit others to come here and erect refineries1, and will nob permit the people of Australia to be swallowed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. </para>

                    <para>.- If the new clause were inserted in the Bill, it would most effectively reduce to nothing the agreement entered' into between the Government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and open wide the opportunity to the Standard Oil Corporation, the Shell Group, and other companies to operate here while not bound by any of the  conditions by which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company undertake to refine oil for the Commonwealth. It would make the Territories of the Commonwealth the spoil of the great concerns that bold a monopoly here to-day. No attempt is made by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> to harness any outsider to the 'conditions under which the Commonwealth is endeavouring to safeguard the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. All the trouble the Government have taken to insure the supply of  oil  to Australia  in  the hour of  emergency will be put in jeopardy. At the very foundation  of  the agreement is the recognition of the fact that the hour of danger may arrive when the whole of the Pacific may be in turmoil. If the two great contending Powers bordering the Pacific to-day come into conflict, we may be cut off from the rest of the world, and the mobility of our Fleet reduced , to naught. We would look in vain for a supply of oil from one of the great competitors in the struggle, and assuredly we would be drawn into the maelstrom of war, because these two great contending forces which are to-day more or' less our Allies, would, certainly require our foodstuffs and our raw material, and as soon as either secured supplies from us, those very supplies would be declared contraband by the other. In such circumstances, we should look in vain for supplies of oil from any other source. This agreement is an honest endeavour to provide supplies of oil within the Commonwealth or our Territories for the hour that may arise, and the company with whom we are making it is good enough for Great Britain. I repeat that the proposal of the honorable member  fm  Franklin would render valueless all the trouble the Government have taken to safeguard Australia from the need to depend on foreign competitors for supplies of  oil. </para>

                    <para>.- I voted against the second reading for reasons I previously advanced. I voted to refer the measure to a Select Committee'. The motion was defeated. I have already voted . against giving a semi-Government institution the right of a monopoly over oil, because nothing will satisfy me but a Government monopoly in the commodity. Now, as I do npt propose to allow any of the subsidiary companies of the giant oil corporations to come into Australia, or one of its Territories, or one of the Possessions over which we have a mandate, I shall vote against this clause.' There are two brothers named Stewart. One of them is " sitting down " on oil wells discovered by the Germans in Rabaul. The other is in Melbourne to-day. They are trying to get some fledglings on the Stock Exchange. They desire to float a syndicate and ultimately to dispose of the oil wells which the Germans unsuccessfully attempted to conceal. It may be that there are sufficient persons in Melbourne who are willing to aid them financially. But I am not prepared to allow them to go there. If this amendment be carried, they will be at liberty to go there; and for that reason I shall vote against it. </para>

The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has talked more absurdly upon this question than has any other honorable member to whom I have listened. Throughout the debate upon the Bill the objection urged to its reference to a Select Committee has been that there is nothing to prevent anybody outside the Anglo-Persian Company from embarking upon the industry. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment ought not to be agreed to for many reasons. It says that nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to prevent any person or persons from prospecting or developing, manufacturing, refining, and marketing any well oil, shale, or other oil " in any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in this Act." Now, no Territories or areas are mentioned in the Bill. It has nothing whatever to do with the finding of oil, but merely with its treatment when found. If the words in the amendment relating to " any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in this Act," but which are not mentioned in it, were struck out, and there were substituted a provision that the Commonwealth should have the same right to fix the price of oil as it has in connexion with the Anglo- </para>

                        <para>- The only "areas" mentioned in the Bill are in Persia.. That is where the crude oil will come from. There are no "Territories " mentioned in the measure. We merely say to the Anglo-Persian Company, " You shall not sell oil here except under certain conditions, and we shall fix the price of it." But the amendment would allow the foreigner to come here and to ruin our industry. That will not do. The honorable member sought to kill the Bill in one way, and now he is seeking to kill it in another way. Neither method will be successful. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I submit that the amendment is not in order, inasmuch as it is outside the order of leave. The Bill is one to approve of an agreement which has been entered into by the Commonwealth with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited. Clause 2 approves of that agreement, and! the remainder of the measure is practically the agreement itself. The amendment is an attempt to introduce extraneous matter, and I submit that it is, therefore, out of order. </para>

                <para>I say to the honorable gentleman who, as I have before admitted, by example and precept led my footsteps along the road which the Free Trader believes to lead to perdition, but which the Protectionist knows is the way to salvation, that if he gives up that he gives up all, and undermines the corner stone of the temple. We cannot allow unfair competition within the Commonwealth, and one of the things that we have always been trying to do is to prevent outside competitors from ruining our industries. There are two reasons why the company should be given a refund of any Customs duties paid. It should be given a refund because the prices of its finished material are to be fixed by us, and must depend on the cost of the raw material. The less the raw material costs, the lower will be the cost of the finished product. How absurd it would be to say that what the people of this country want is cheap oil, and at the same time to charge a duty on crude oil. Then, again, the Commonwealth is . to be a partner with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Yet the honorable member, who is a believer in Protection and in State enterprise, says to the Government, " Charge yourself duty, and do not refund any of it." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman considers it pernicious for the Government to refund to itself the duty charged, which is absurd. The clause, as it stands, is one which would be very useful if it could be applied to all our industries. If we could' say to every manufacturer in Australia, " Unless you sell your goods at fair and reasonable prices we will open the Customs barriers, and let foreign articles come in; but if you will sell at reasonable prices we will protect you," the consumers and the country at large would benefit. I hope that the honorable gentleman now sees that his amendment lays the axe at the root of the evergreen and fruitful tree of Protection, whose growth has been so stimulated by his oratory and watered by the tears of his enemies. </para>

The agreement is "to last for fifteen years, and before the end of that time there will have been in all probability some changes of Government. Could a Ministry which did not favour the Inchcape Combine be forced against its will to bring in a Bill in opposition to its policy, and compel its supporters  to vote for it? Whatever action may be taken will depend entirely on the views of the Government in office. If there is a Government in office in favour of continuing this Combine it will be prepared to pass this legislation, but if there is in office a Government opposed to a monopoly of this kind there is no power under this agreement to compel a majority in this Parliament to do anything. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member is correct in saying that if the Government in power is opposed to this agreement it may under paragraph 14 of the schedule take away a great deal of the power the Anglo-Persian Company will have by means of the Tariff. But I have said twice already in the discussion upon this Bill that I desire to be perfectly honest with these people, and so far as the provision with respect to the duty is concerned, I say that I do not feel myself bound by it. If the Government intend to bolster up the Anglo-Persian Company they can impose a duty of1s. per gallon, and refund it under the circumstances set forth, but there is nothing in the agreement to prevent the next Government, should it be opposed to the company, imposing a duty of one-thousandth part of a penny per gallon, and refunding that. I was glad to hear the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> say that my efforts in connexion with the Tariff diverted his infant footsteps into the path of Protection. I hope that the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> and the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> have also been converted. </para>
