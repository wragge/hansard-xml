        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned Volunteer Firemen attached to the New South Wales Fire Brigade Service respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That the Volunteer Firemen of the New South Wales Fire Brigades are performing an essentia] community service in suburban and country towns by providing low cost fire protection and in sacrificing their leisure and rest hours to perform this essential service, are being subjected to severe financial loss by having to pay income tax on two incomes which under the present taxation system discourages most individuals from having two jobs. </para>
        <para>That the present situation has resulted in the resignation of a large number of volunteer firemen because of the effects of taxation, leaving a number of fire brigades under strength and a reluctance of potential recruits to pay excessive taxation. </para>
        <para>That this growing problem could be effectively dealt with by granting taxation concessions to volunteer firemen in the State of New South Wales similar to those being received by members of the Citizens Military Forces. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to review the Taxation Act to exempt the earnings of volunteer firemen in the State of New South Wales from income tax, or give consideration to separate assessment of earnings and so protect the future of the volunteer fire service in New South Wales. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Treasurer: Is it a fact that discussions have been undertaken by or for the Government with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in an attempt to postpone to mid- 1978 the publication of the OECD review of Australia which is due for publication in December 1977? Is it a fact that these discussions were undertaken on the initiative of the Australian Government? Is it a fact that an arrangement is under way, perhaps even concluded, for a swap with New Zealand in respect of the publication of this review so that the New Zealand review is published in December rather than later? Is it a fact that this effort to suppress, at least temporarily, the publication of this report has been undertaken because, on early indications, it will be embarrassing to the Government, especially on matters like inflation, economic activity and the level of unemployment that might be expected in the near future? </para>

            <para>- I can understand why the honourable gentleman should seek to put a proposition of this kind. At the outset I want to deny the thrust of what the honourable gentleman said. The honourable gentleman, as a former Treasurer, knows full well that the OECD makes a regular study of Australia. In due course that study becomes a public document. It is different from the study undertaken by the International Monetary Fund. I recall this matter being brought to my attention about two months ago or thereabouts. Certain recommendations were put to me at the time by the Treasury. It was a matter of scheduling the OECD visit to Australia in conjunction with its commitments in other parts of the world and the scheduling of the intended visit of the International Monetary Fund. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I can assure the honourable gentleman that this Government, unlike his Administration, has nothing whatsoever to fear from any objective study of the nature of the Australian economy at the present time. All such a study would do would be to reveal, in very stark measure indeed, the simple fact- a fact unknown to the honourable gentleman-that this Government's economic policies are working well and are a consequence of our adherence to a consistent economic program since we were elected to office in late 1975. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman as a former Treasurer, in a spirit of supporting Australia and not knocking Australia, might be the first to say to this Administration: Full marks for what you have done. Notwithstanding the distortions which he has sought to create in relation to Australia's inflation program, inflation is very significantly on the way down. The 2 per centrise in the consumer price index recently was a major breakthrough in the fight against inflation. </para>
          <para>The Australian community knows that this Government is winning that fight against inflation and I look forward very optimistically, as do my colleagues on this side of the House, to the continuing results which will flow from a further sustainable winding-down of inflationary pressures during the course of this financial year. Without wanting to put figures on the table at this time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because I want the opportunity for further examination and discussion of them by the Treasury and other advisers to the Government, I would say that the forecast on inflation, as set out in Statement No. 2, which I hope the honourable gentleman will take the opportunity of reading, is very significantly a conservative one. So far as objective studies are concerned, the facts are there and confidence is there. The honourable member who is now interjecting is the second economic spokesman for the Opposition. I am not sure whether it is Bib or Bub who is speaking as this Question Time proceeds but I reject the thrust of what the honourable gentleman has said. This Government welcomes any objective study of the Australian economy because it will support greatly the thrust of all that we are doing. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable member for McMillan for providing me with a very useful follow-on to the question posed by the honourable member for Oxley. It is true that small business in particular has been very much inhibited in recent years by high interest rates. I have no doubt- and other members of the Government have no doubt- that the indications now are becoming more and more conclusive that the economic strategy upon which we embarked nearly two years ago is working significantly to relieve that burden. The Government's policies have been and will continue to be very strongly directed towards controlling and reducing Australia's inflation rate. In the longer run that is the only way in which we can obtain a sustainable reduction in interest rates. I mentioned previously that the 2 per cent figure was a major breakthrough. May I be excused for repeating that in response to the honourable member for McMillan? More and more people in the financial markets and in the community - </para>

              <para>-The shrill parrot from the Opposition cannot contain himself yet again. More and more people, both in the financial markets and in the community at large, know that inflation is being beaten. There is no doubt whatsoever about that. After consultation between the monetary authorities and the Government, let me say this: The authorities, through careful management, have reduced the yields on Government bonds and Treasury Notes in recent weeks. As a matter of fact and information to the House, as at the latest market report which I received from the Reserve Bank of Australia, covering trading in the markets to noon today, the selling yield on long term government bonds-that is the October 1996 bonds- is now 9.98 per cent. In other words, it has broken through the 10 per cent barrier. It is the first time in more than two years that that has been accomplished in the markets. I go on to say- putting the position in relation to both short term and long term bonds- that it is the first time in more than four years that the whole structure of government securities has been subject to such reductions. Let me conclude by saying, in summary, that the low consumer price index figure and the change of structure of interest rates in recent days and weeks should be a major encouragement to the business community, and small business in particular, and much to the chagrin of so many honourable gentlemen on the other side of this House it is a further reflection that this Government's policies are working and working well. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for McMillan, is directed to the Treasurer. It is a fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia is meeting only one-fifth of orders lodged by brokers for the purchase of Commonwealth bonds? Does this action and the fact that only a conversion loan is to be offered in October mean that the Government is attempting to flood the economy with liquidity to force a cosmetic reduction in interest rates? Further, is the Treasurer aware that the rate of interest on 180-day bank bills is 9.65 per cent, that on 180-day treasury notes it is 8.84 per cent and that the three-quarter per cent spread is greater than the normal one-quarter to one-half per cent spread? I ask the Treasurer In view of the unattractive interest rates, what level of subscription to treasury notes is anticipated in the next three months? </para>

            <para>-This is very tired old stuff from a rather tired old  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. On other occasions he has sought to raise in a quite irresponsible fashion the question of interest rates. I regret that he now seeks in this House some estimate from me of the level of treasury note sales during the next three months. He knows that these are sensitive matters which, in terms of this Government's effective control of monetary policy, require constant monitoring. I simply observe, if the honourable gentleman has not caught up with the facts of life, that last night treasury notes were shaved. Obviously the return on them will be the subject of continuing monitoring during the period ahead. The honourable gentleman should know, and I repeat, that interest rates are not the subject of speculation by Treasurers or senior members of this Administration in this House or outside in the precise terms in which the honourable gentleman seeks a response from me to his question. </para>

              <para>-As I recall it, the earlier reply was in response to part of the asinine nonsense the honourable gentleman seeks to perpetrate in this House. Let me simply mention why there should not be a cash loan. I would have thought that the reason would have been clear to the honourable gentleman. We decided not to pro- pose a cash loan to the Loan Council with the folowing considerations in mind: The very satisfactory flow of funds from the Commonwealth's account from the July loan- the figure was $6 10m; the net take up to date of securities by the non-bank sector of $670m in the three months to the end of September; and the reduced financing requirement of the Commonwealth in 1977-78. I think I have covered the treasury note point. </para>

          <para>May I finally mention to the honourable gentleman that one of the important objectives of monetary policy, of course, remains the provision of adequate capacity to the private sector to underwrite economic recovery, but not at the same time as accommodating inflation? If there is one thing this Government has done, I believe, it has made a very significant contribution towards the reduction of inflation because of its effective monetary policies. When I think of the 20 per cent M3 figure which was running when we inherited government towards the end of 1975, and when I think also of the fact that this year the guidelines, subject to the events as they may work out during the year, are 8 per cent to 10 per cent, I think this Government has a record of which it can be proud in getting the money supply under control. If the honourable gentleman looks back to his own history, I think he will see he has a lot to apologise to the Australian people for. </para>

            <para>-One of the real problems we have with postal services is the ability to provide the sort of service that is desired and required within New South Wales. Overall it is regrettable in Australia that in New South Wales, particularly in Redfern, there is a constant disruption which affects the mail service not only within New South Wales but also, because of the size of the Redfern Mail Exchange, throughout Australia. The instance that the honourable member for Macquarie has given the House will indicate the seriousness of the disruption that has been caused by the intolerable attitude of members of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union to the Redfern Mail Exchange. We have had this constant disruption now over a number of years. Former Postmasters-General in the previous administration as well as administration before that will be well aware of the unco-operative- to use the kindest word- attitude of employees at the Redfern Mail Exchange. It is a decision of the Australian Postal Commission, which is completely supported by the Government, that we will not have a continuation of this inability to give adequate service. The Commission has decided to decentralise the distribution of mail within New South Wales. That will have the effect of improving it not only in that State but also throughout Australia. The Commission is determined upon this course and it would have every encouragement from the Government to see that mail services in New South Wales are restored to a satisfactory situation within that State and throughout Australia. </para>

How many applications have been received from private health funds, including Medibank Private, to raise their medical and hospital insurance premiums in the near future? Is it a fact that some private funds have already applied for increases in their medical or hospital premiums to apply from 1 November? Will any such requests be agreed to by the Minister? If not, is this part of the Government's policy to maintain artificially low health insurance premiums until after the December elections in an attempt to hide the real costs of private health insurance from the public? </para>

            <para>-That is the sort of sneaky question one would expect from the Opposition. Perhaps that is the sort of motive that would be in its mind if it were facing an election. My Department has received a number of applications from health funds in the various States. I have not yet received a formal response from the departmental registration committee recommending the fee increases that would be required. Some time ago I had discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moon,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Voluntary Health Insurance Association, who indicated that most of the funds would be thinking in terms of increasing their premiums as from 1 February next year. </para>

              <para>-No, not doubling them. The increase will vary from State to State. We are finding that in New South Wales, for instance, the services provided to patients by doctors has been far in excess of the services provided in other States. So one would expect the premiums to rise more substantially in New South Wales than in any other State. I would not expect there to be much variation in the premiums in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and indeed Queensland. I will be considering the recommendations from the departmental registration committee when they come to me for consideration and not before. </para>

            <para>-By no means, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> That legislation was passed through Parliament last week. It went through speedily in case it was going to be necessary in the face of a devastating dispute in Victoria. But at the same time it was legislation that my colleague had been examining and which had been before the Government over a very long period. In relation to the three areas- the rights of individual trade unionists, the authority and reach of the Industrial Relations Bureau and demarcation disputes in particular- the changes enormously strengthen industrial law. I believe that in recent times it has been demonstrated very clearly that industrial law does need strengthening. My colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has pointed out on a number of occasions that there is a growing tactic of using a few people in isolated cases, but in cases of importance, to disrupt very large sections of the Australian community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course in the Victorian dispute, about 2,000 people have caused immeasurable harm to a great many families. I think they themselves have lost $2,000 and obviously their own family finances will be very much behind as a result. The whole strike was a sad and tragic affair and I am very glad indeed that those directly involved have now decided that power must be returned to Victorian homes and factories so that there can be a beginning of the repairing of the damage. The damage was great and the number of unemployed will be significantly increased. I believe that many of them will not get their jobs back for a significant period because of the liquidity problems many businesses will face as a result. So, while 2,000 people have been striking, some tens of thousands of people are likely to be out of work for a much longer period as a direct result of that. In the face of that kind of situation, for anyone, whether it be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> or anyone else, to suggest that that legislation would be withdrawn is an oddity indeed. If he believes it would be withdrawn he certainly does not know this Government. </para>

Of course, that capacity has been and remains with private enterprise at all times. I believe that there is an even greater obligation on a government to take the responsibility to see that those people who are paid by the taxpayers provide a service to the taxpayers. As I have said, the Government regards this legislation as conferring a power which is required by governments and necessary for them to have. It will be used with discretion when circumstances warrant it. </para>

In view of the fact that South Pacific countries are moving together to establish simultaneously 200-nule fishing zones, has Australia been informed officially of the New Zealand position?

            <para>- I do not think that it would be proper for me to speak in relation to New Zealand's views or in relation to the precise thrust of New Zealand policy objectives which that country is seeking to achieve by these means. I had heard some time ago that action of that kind might be taken by New Zealand because of its concern over marketing access to Japan. Obviously I do not know in any specific detail what has happened in relation to the Japanese and New Zealand negotiations and I would not want to comment on them. I would hope that Australia would not be in the position of having to use a tactic of that kind. I believe that it is better not to have to use such a tactic and I hope very much that Japan, as a major trading partner of Australia, will be able to see the intrinsic merit of certain propositions that have been put to her over recent times. It was put forcibly and quite directly to the Japanese Prime Minister when I was in Kuala Lumpur, and in more recent times by a group of officials and also in correspondence from me, that some aspects of the trading relationship between Japan and Australia are unequal. For example, beef producing is a long term business and producers cannot have a breeding program running at six-monthly intervals. Clearly, they need long term market access. It is not reasonable for them to have to argue every six months for the right of access to the Japanese market. It is reasonable to know whether they can export 80,000 tonnes, 90,000 tonnes or something better than that. There needs to be stability and also a growth factor in that market. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The original group of officials, as I think everyone knows, did not make a great deal of progress. I then wrote to the Japanese Prime Minister and he replied that he would willingly accede to further official discussions and also discussions at a ministerial level at the appropriate time. I hope that acceptance of the Australian point of view, which is based in fairness and plain logic, on what a reasonable and proper trading relationship should be about will bear fruit in relation to that particular matter. I have pointed out on other occasions that, although there are quotas on cars coming into this country, this Government does not suggest that there should be six-monthly quotas. People have a right of access and they know that that will not be altered arbitrarily in the way in which our access to the Japanese market for beef was altered, for example, in 1974 when the previous year's quota of 120,000 tonnes was cut to nothing in the course of a year. These things need to be understood. The force of the Australian case is, I think, now understood in Japan. Obviously we will have to wait and see what comes out of the negotiations between officials and, if necessary, between Ministers. This is a matter that the Government will continue to press with all the force at its command. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Maranoa asks for an assurance that I cannot give him when he asks whether every town in western Queensland will be provided with television facilities, although I recognise that the honourable member represents a very large and important slice of western Queensland. This Government is committed to providing better communication services throughout rural Australia- unlike its predecessor, which, in the course of its three years in office, did everything to downgrade communication services, whether telephone, postal or television viewing facilities. A former Postmaster-General seeks to interject. I remind him of some of the answers that he gave during Question Time to members of the National Country Party who, quite rightly, were pressing for greater and improved services. This Government is committed not only to improving television viewing facilities but also to ensuring that there are adequate services in the whole range of communication. A program of television facilities for this year has been announced. It was limited because of the budgetary constraints. I am now working on a three-year program which I will be putting to the Government and which will give people in rural Australia an indication of this Government's determination to provide adequate services in the not too distant inure. As well, a task force is being set up to look at the possible use of domestic satellites, and if that is embraced before too long it will revolutionise the approach by government to providing services. The honourable member for Maranoa may say to all the people within his electorate that this Government is committed to seeing that their needs in television are satisfied as quickly as possible. </para>

            <para>-I am pleased to confirm, as my colleague the Minister for Transport indicated a couple of days ago, that following urgent action at the United Nations to consider the problem of hijacking the International Federation of Airline Pilots Association did decide to defer its strike action. In answering the honourable member's question I would like to point out that so far as I understand it a draft resolution has been agreed to by a number of delegations calling on states to take all necessary steps to give effect to international agreements and recommendations dealing with the safety of civil aircraft. The Australian delegation has been instructed by me to co-sponsor that resolution. A number of states, including Australia, have also requested the inscription of a proposed new item entitled 'Safety of International Civil Aviation' which I am informed will be examined at the General Assembly shortly. It is important that practical and widely supported solutions to combat hijacking should be found under the proposed new items. I can assure the honourable member that Australia will continue to give full support at the United Nations to efforts to find ways of preventing and suppressing acts of hijacking and of protecting the victims of such acts. </para>

          <para>Before concluding I also would like to add a word of congratulations to the members of our mission at the United Nations.

It is another example of the effectiveness of the Australian representation in the United Nations. I wish we could always be so successful. </para>

          <para>-As a result of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and a parliamentary inquiry, officials are examining a possible code which could apply to public servants and to politicians. I have indicated that previously. The report is not yet before the Government. Arrangements that I have made in relation to the ministry and to ministerial staffs are, I believe, stricter than those which have prevailed in any former Administration. That was a grave omission of the previous Government at a certain stage in its career. The question is really quite interesting. It is a new approach to the Labor Party's socialist objective to make sure that no representatives in Parliament can have any interest in private enterprise of any kind at all. Members of the Labor Party will never give up. They want to destroy private enterprise in any way that they can-back door, front door or side door.

            <para>- I must confess some surprise and disappointment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Northey</inline> would make such a wild and stupid accusation. The fact is that there was a derailment of the Tasman Limited on 24 October. It was carrying 24 passengers and five crew at the time. Fortunately for everybody concerned no one was injured although a number of people were badly shaken by the accident. The Australian National Railways has set up a board of inquiry. Therefore, it would not be proper of me to make any comment on the accident itself until such time as the board of inquiry reports. If there has been any neglect of the railway line on which the Tasman Limited runs, it has not been by this Government. The fact is that the Tasmanian Labor Government for years and years starved the State railway systems of funds. When the Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister, his Minister for Transport bought out the Tasmanian railway system. The Labor Party bought at the highest price the worst railway system in Australia, the most neglected railway system in Australia, and a railway system that had had less capital injection than any other railway system in Australia. One can see that the job confronting the Australian National Railways in getting the Tasmanian system into any sense of order is difficult. </para>

I gave an instruction to the ANR that there should be no consideration of this question until 1978 when a proper opportunity would be given for the tourist industry of Tasmania to see whether there would be value in maintaining the Tasman Limited service. It does run at a heavy loss. There will be no change from that date. It will still be 1978.

            <para>-The report I have just tabled deals with a single item omitted from the 64th series of variations to the city plan tabled last week. The proposal involves a road variation in Corinna and Keltie Streets at Phillip in the Woden Town Centre to enable the construction of boom-gate parking adjacent to shops at the centre. Similar proposals relating to Civic were contained in the report on the 64th series and the Committee recommended their implementation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>The introduction of boom-gate parking is, in the Committee's view, an appropriate innovation in Canberra at present. The new system is intended to ensure that parking costs are distributed more equitably between those wishing to park all day and those making short visits for the purpose of shopping or other business. It will also mean that parking can be controlled more effectively and that parking charges are paid. The Committee recommends implementation of the proposal. However, the Committee is firmly of the view that the public should not be inconvenienced by construction work being undertaken during the Christmas period and that work should not begin before 1 January 1978. It is noted that the project is planned for completion by March 1978. The total cost with associated works is estimated to be $850,000. I commend the report to the House. </para></speech>

            <para>-Neglect by this Government and incompetence by the Queensland Government are undermining the confidence of hundreds of thousands of Australians in permanent building societies. Those who lend are insecure; those who want to build cannot borrow. Inactivity by this Government is preventing building societies fulfilling their real function to help Australians build then* own homes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under the Financial Corporations Act 1974, the Labor Government made it possible for the Federal Parliament to obtain the same information and exercise the same surveillance in the case of building societies and hire purchase companies and other financial institutions as it has been possible to do, since the war, in the case of banks. This Government has never proclaimed Part IV of that Act. At best, the Government has tried- after the event, after each crisis- to guarantee the security of depositors. It has done nothing to to secure the position of borrowers. It has concerned itself- in the manner of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted- with deposits, but never with advances. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> had the consent of the House to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a statement he made after the last crisis involving a permanent building society in Queensland. He twice mentioned depositors; he never mentioned borrowers. What is the use of a building society which cannot build? </para>
          <para>During the last two years the housing finance industry has gone from crisis to crisis as a direct result of this Government's policies. Monetary policy has been severely misjudged. For example, the Australian savings bonds were introduced with too high an interest rate. People thereupon withdrew funds from permanent building societies to buy the new bonds, thus sharply reducing the liquid assets of the societies and forcing them to curtail their lending. I give another example: The excessively tight monetary policy at the beginning of this year caused a reduction in lending for construction or purchase of housing. Like much other Government policy, this credit squeeze was justified on doctrinaire grounds- a naive and ignorant attempt to apply Friedmanite doctrines in Australia; a doctrine designed to entrench privilege and to extend inequalities in our country. The speed with which the money supply was reduced was far faster than even Friedman himself would ever have proposed. The effect was to reduce the level of real output and so to increase unemployment. The effect on the building industry was sharply to reduce approvals for new housing. This August, they were 10 per cent below the same month in the previous year. </para>
          <para>The instability created by these policies has affected the building societies with special severity. The crisis has been particularly pronounced in Queensland. In that State, the deep instability of an unstable Premier and a warring coalition has compounded the problem. In October and November 1975 permanent building societies in Queensland were approving new housing loans at the rate of 1,800 a month. By June 1976, only 84 new loans were approved in the month, and though lending has recovered, it remains far below the level at the end of 1975. The tragedy of this situation is clear when it is recalled that the permanent building societies were the major lenders for house purchase in </para>
          <para class="block">Queensland. In the last three months of 1975, 48 per cent of all loans for housing in Queensland came from building societies. During 1976, the proportion of loans from building societies in Queensland fell to 23 per cent-less than half. </para>
          <para>Queensland Government regulation and supervision of building societies has been totally inadequate. The crisis was begun by the inept launching of the Australian savings bonds at the beginning of last year. But this simply exposed the ineptness of the Bjelke-Petersen Government's policies and the poor management of a few of the societies. The effect of Government policy was to encourage some of the societies to maintain reserves of liquid assets which were dangerously low; consequently, when withdrawals accelerated as a result of this Federal Government's Australian savings bond issue, a few societies quickly got into trouble. Further, State Government supervision was so inadequate that even basic accounting practices were not applied. The Federal Government should have responded to this situation by taking steps immediately to increase the security of building societies and the community's confidence in the societies. Although building societies are registered under State legislation they are, in fact, a national industry. Lack of confidence in one State creates unease in all other States. Lack of confidence in the national Government's will to back the societies in one State undermines confidence in all other societies and in all other States. </para>
          <para>The lethargy and neglect of this Government have allowed an unstable situation to persist and deepen. The problems resulting from the 1976 crisis have continued. Some societies had to borrow at high interest rates to maintain their liquidity. When there is doubt about the capacity of a financial institution to meet its obligations, cautious savers withdraw their deposits. So the run started on the Queensland Permanent Building Society a month ago and, apparently, about $18m was withdrawn. Eventually, the Queensland Permanent had to close its doors, leaving its 140,000 members without access to their $ 1 65m of savings. Insecurity created by this event led, fairly quickly, to a run on the Metropolitan Permanent. This forced the Federal Government to step in, with the Treasurer, the Acting Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank making statements. The Governor said that the Commonwealth Trading Bank was, with the support of the Reserve Bank of Australia, making available a very substantial line of credit to the society which would enable it to fully match demands for withdrawal of depositors' funds. This is a hasty response to a crisis. It does nothing to secure the future of the industry. There have been small runs on building societies in many parts of the country in recent years. </para>
          <para>The fierce yet farcical battle between leading members of the Liberal Party for control of the NSW Permanent Building Society shows the importance which some members of the conservative establishment place on these powerful financial institutions. Immense prestige comes from being the director of a permanent building society. Such a society will give one a personal loan of $100,000. If one is a State President or a former federal President of the Liberal Party, it is all so easy. Yet the Liberal-National Country Party Government has done nothing to strengthen or regulate the structure within which building societies operate in order to prevent the kinds of crises which are now occurring quite regularly. A hasty response to an impending disaster is not a policy. What is required is responsible regulation and supervision which would ensure the permanence of the permanents. </para>
          <para>The building societies are now a crucial part of the housing industry. They have grown rapidly in recent years. In 1953, seven per cent of all housing advances to individuals were made by permanent building societies. In 1970 the proportion had risen to 14 per cent. Over the following four years, the proportion rose to 23 per cent. In the seventies, there has been a very rapid expansion of the activities of the societies. Even in 1976-77, 25 per cent of all loans approved to individuals for the construction or purchase of housing came from the permanent building societies, and this was in a year in which their activities were constrained by the inept savings bond issue. It is clear that there are structural problems in the regulation of building societies which only the national Government can tackle effectively. The building societies are now a national industry. Problems in one State or one society affect all States and every society. The industry would welcome government intervention which guarantees its viability in the eyes of the public and is quite prepared to accept the greater regulation which would have to accompany such guarantees. </para>
          <para>It is clear too that some of the State governments have not been prepared to supervise properly the financial standards of the building societies. The Bjelke-Petersen Government is the worst offender. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> said in an editorial on the seventh of this month: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is fairly clear that the Queensland Government was much too slow in appreciating the depth of trouble at the Queensland Permanent and the degree of public uncertainty about it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In an editorial a week earlier the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To support the whole system of financial institutions (the trading banks) and the Reserve Bank must turn their attention to preserving the liquidity of the building societies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Queensland building societies are required to hold <inline font-style="italic">VA</inline> per cent of their assets in liquid form. This is a low level compared with the liquid asset ratio of the trading banks of 18 per cent. The problem is that the building societies are paying such a high rate of interest on the funds they borrow that they have to lend as high a proportion as possible of their funds in order to earn adequate income to cover their own interest payments and other costs. If the building societies were more carefully regulated they would be able to borrow at lower rates of interest and also to lend at lower rates because of the increase in confidence in their viability. The national authorities must enter this field more effectively. At present they do it only whenever a crisis occurs. Whenever the building societies encounter serious financial problems they fall back on the trading bank system to borrow on overdraft to cover their liquidity needs. In turn, the trading banks can provide the necessary support only with the assistance of the Reserve Bank. The de facto lending of last resort facilities being provided by the Reserve Bank must be replaced by a clear system of support and regulation. </para>
          <para>Another cause for deep concern is the Queensland Government's recent allocation to itself of extraordinarily sweeping arbitrary powers to cope with the current crisis. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review,</inline> in commenting on these excessive powers, said that they 'seemed to indicate at least that the Queensland Government simply can't be trusted with the important-role of supervision of the building society movement'. The same editorial also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is high time that the Reserve Bank should give a more convincing account of its own stewardship with respect to its supervision of the financial standards and therefore stability of the banking system ... a bailing-out operation is not sufficient. If a free enterprise financial system is to survive their supervision to detect the few offenders who can bring the whole system into disrepute seems to be continuous, extensive and strict. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course I have no objection to the other act by the Queensland government- allowing the State Government Insurance Office Building Society to take over the Queensland Permanent. Such a solution gives members of a society the confidence that the society has the backing of the Government. But the problem is that this decision was hasty and forced on the Bjelke-Petersen Government by the crisis. As I have said, the structure must be changed. </para>
          <para>Labor established the framework for regulation and control of building societies in the Financial Corporations Act. The Treasurer continues to say that the Government will not proclaim Part IV of the Act. That part gives the Government, through the Reserve Bank, the power to make regulations over asset ratios, ending policies and interest rates of financial corporations, including building societies. The Treasurer says, however, that 'as a matter of absolute responsibility this issue is very much under consideration. How much longer do we have to wait before this consideration bears fruit? The Treasurer has been giving me the same kind of response in answer to questions since the beginning of last year. I asked two in March of last year and one in April of last year. I have asked two in the last month. It cannot be said that the problem is a novel one. The Treasurer still considers it and does nothing. I hope I will not be accused of being irresponsible in raising a matter under an Act which is now more than three years old. Under a Labor government, the Australian Housing Corporation, which has been abolished by the Fraser Government, would be required again to act in a responsible way in order to support effectively building societies. </para>
          <para>Another possibility, which the permanent building societies themselves, through their Australian association, have been proposing, is the introduction of federal insurance of shares and deposits, such as applies in the United States and Canada. This proposal also has been circulating for 18 months. The Fraser Government has done nothing about it. There are alternatives. There are workable proposals. They exist. I quote the words of the Prime Minister in another context: </para>

          <para class="block">Because of this Government's doctrinaire attitudes the building societies lurch from crisis to crisis. As each crisis occurs, general public confidence is further undermined. Such a situation is intolerable when the security of savings of hundreds of thousands of Australians is at risk in institutions providing over a quarter of all lending for housing. As recently as the latter part of 1975 my Government provided nearly half of the housing funds made available in Queensland. The biggest investment which most Australians ever made in their lives- their investment in their homes- is at stake. Doctrinaire neglect by this Government is directly to blame for the undermining of the faith of hundreds of thousands of Australians in the security of their life savings and the most important investment they can ever make. </para>

            <para>- One can tell, from listening to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam),</inline> that an election is on at least in Queensland. A considerable part of his comment was designed to detract from the record of the Queensland Government. I found it extraordinary that he would say that the Queensland Government is not trusted. One would have thought that if a government were not trusted it would not be re-elected each election with an increased majority. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition that the Queensland Government is not only competent but obviously is trusted by those people who have an opportunity to vote for it. </para>

          <para>This question of building societies is a sensitive one. I am not suggesting that the Leader of the Opposition is irresponsible in bringing up this matter of public importance today. I do not believe it is designed to be helpful as regards the stability of permanent building societies. He referred not only to a government that is not trusted but to an unstable Premier. I would have thought that he might have been sufficiently objective to discern that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> is a very durable Premier. The least description that one could use of him, the most unacceptable description that one could use of him, is that he is unstable. He can be criticised, but one cannot say that he is unstable; nor can one say that he is unreliable. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline>When I used the terms as I did I was speaking about the Labor Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the Queensland Permanent Building Society and the Metropolitan Permanent Building Society. Let us look at the record. It was the prompt action by State authorities in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government that got the building societies in difficulty back on the rails. The quick decision of the Queensland Government supported by the Federal Government represents clearly evidence of the importance that the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments attach to the building society movement as a major source of housing finance in Queensland and throughout Australia. Let us look at the role of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The best way for everybody to understand the role of the Reserve Bank is to refer to what the  Deputy  Governor has said. He stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This action - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the action that was taken to assist- is a particular instance of the general arrangements by which, against the background of the Reserve Bank's support of banking liquidity, banks stand behind financial institutions which are responsibly managed and have adequate asset backing. </para>
          <para class="block">That has been said time and time again. It was because of the attitude of the Reserve Bank and the Government that the position in Queensland- the problem is largely one that has emerged in Queensland- has now been stabilised. The matter of public importance being discussed today will not be helpful in creating the sort of confidence that is necessary in the permanent building societies and, indeed, in financial institutions other than banks. What has to be recognised is that the depositors have lost nothing. They have nothing to fear. I hope that out of this debate today comes a clear understandingthe Queensland constituents have it on record from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Governor of the Reserve Bank- that there is nothing to fear. I am concerned with seeing that that message gets through today in case comments made by members of the Opposition are misunderstood. Depositors have nothing to fear by way of loss of either capital or interest. One would have expected that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition economic spokesman would have wanted to contribute in a way which caused greater stability, not simply to try to use the forms of the House as part of a Queensland election campaign. In contrast again to what the Leader of the Opposition has said I refer to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> had to say in a second reading speech when he was Treasurer. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The financial Corporations Act was designed for purposes of general economic management and not the financial stability of particular institutions or the protection of borrowers and lenders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what one of three Treasurers in the Whitlam Government had to say. Maybe a later Treasurer had a different view. That would not be surprising. We became rather used to different views and different policies of the Ministers in the previous Administration. Under Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act which was referred to you by the Leader of the Opposition, which has not yet been proclaimed, the Government may impose controls in relation to asset ratios, lending policies and interest rates receivable or payable by financial corporations, including building societies. These powers would not enable the Government to control the balance sheet structures of individual societies or to ensure their financial stability; nor could they protect against bad management, incompetence, fraud or anything similar. Such controls, therefore, would not provide protection to the borrowers and lenders in individual societies; nor would they have prevented the collapse of the Queensland Permanent Building Society. Again in contrast to what the Leader of the Opposition has informed the Parliament is what the industry has to say. The Leader of the Opposition said that the industry would be happy to support the proclamation of Part IV. As Minister Assisting the Treasurer I received a letter dated 2 1 October from the Association of Australian Permanent Building Societies. Part of the letter reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As regards the use of Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act, I confirm the Association's opinion that this would not contribute to the solution of the problems which arose in Queensland nor to greater stability in the longer term. Of particular concern is that the financial media and the public would perceive the proclamation of Part IV as providing federal monetary authorities with the mechanism to prevent these occurrences. This, of course, would be a total misconception of the Financial Corporations Act and the powers provided under Part IV. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is part of a letter from the Association of Australian Permanent Building Societies which I received only a few days ago. Quite clearly, the Leader of the Opposition has made comment in contrast to the views of one of his Treasurers and in contrast to what the Australian Permanent Building Societies spokesman has to say to the present Government. With regard to housing finance generally, it may be useful to put on record what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> said in his Budget Speech, because this Government is concerned that adequate finance should be available for housing. The Treasurer said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government has been concerned, in reviewing the overall housing scene, to ensure that availability of finance is not a barrier to steady and sustainable growth in home building activity, including additions and renovations. </para>
            <para>If borrowers are credit worthy, we would not want them to be denied housing finance because of official restraints. </para>
            <para>Accordingly, the Government has advised the Reserve Bank that it wants to see banks and other financial institutions encouraged to increase their lending for private home building, particularly in those States and areas where the capacity of trie building industry is under-utilised. </para>
            <para>It is of course being left to individual lenders to determine their levels of lending, taking into account their particular balance sheet positions and their assessments of the housing situation in their areas of operations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government wants to co-operate with the private sector to ensure that adequate finance is available for an increasing housing industry. As further evidence of the Government's concern to maintain an adequate level for housing finance, the Reserve Bank has said to banks: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Against the background of the policy of encouraging housing finance, their lending operations might as far as practicable keep in view the desirability of some added temporary emphasis on housing lending in Queensland to ameliorate in part the expected small temporary drop in lending for housing arising from the recent experience of building societies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Therefore the Government has moved to see that the regrettable but temporary problems of the permanent building societies in Queensland with regard to finance available for housing will be ameliorated. For the record let us look at the permanent building societies' loans approval. In the September quarter of 1976 the overall approvals totalled $354m and Queensland 's portion of that was $53m. A year later, in the September quarter of 1977, the total has risen to $500m and Queensland's portion to $64m. So despite the problems there has been a substantial increase in loan approvals by permanent building societies throughout Australia and particularly in Queensland. The Government has made it perfectly clear to permanent building societies directly and through the Reserve Bank that it wants them to have the greatest degree of flexibility to increase available finance for housing throughout Australia. Despite the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, the quick decisions of the Queensland Government have res.tored confidence and we will see an improvement before long in housing activity through the permanent building societies in that State. This question of how much Commonwealth involvement there ought to be in the permanent building societies and the financial institutions under the Financial Corporations Act is one for valid debate. But it is not the best way to debate it on the basis that there have been problems in Queensland and in reaction to those problems there ought to be some instinctive reaction. </para>
          <para>Let me say quite clearly that this Government's view is that the responsibility for maintaining surveillance of the activities of permanent building societies currently and traditionally rests with the State governments which have available specific legislation concerning the rights of borrowers and lenders and the stability of building societies and the administrative machinery necessary to discharge that responsibility. This is not to say that there is not room for improvement in some areas or that societies should not be taking action to reduce their exposure to unfounded losses of investor confidence. Naturally the Government keeps these kinds of matters under constant review. This is what we are doing. We have been very closely monitoring the problems within Queensland. We have been in constant consultation with the Reserve Bank, with the trading banks and with the permanent building societies with a view to ensuring that decisions of the Government are made, first of all, to restore as quickly as possible confidence in the permanent building societies. </para>
          <para>I am bound to observe that part of the problem- and only part of it- has been that Queensland Labor politicians- one in particularused one of the permanent building societies as part of a political ploy to create problems within that particular financial structure. This Government sees the permanent building societies as being very important and having a very important role to play. Through the Reserve Bank we will stand behind those that are well managed and those that have adequate asset backing. They need have no fear. The Government, through the Reserve Bank, will always ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for those building societies to discharge their responsibilities. I do not think it is helpful to have a debate such as this which the Leader of the Opposition is obviously using as part of the Queensland election campaign. This is a very serious matter. We are dealing with a host of small investors whose life savings are involved. </para>

            <para>-Listening to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> took me back to the time we were in government and I noticed that one public servant had a tendency to note particularly acidic comments for the attention of subordinates. I noted in a file one day the comment: 'Rather than use a cup full of vinegar, it might be better to try a spoonful of honey'. After listening to the Minister, I would much rather have the cup full of vinegar than the truck load of honey he seeks to serve up with every issue he brings before this House. It is remarkable that in all those areas where the Government's failures are most obvious and where the public is likely to suffer most, the Government moralises about the need to maintain discretion and silence. It maintains that it is not in the public interest to raise these issues. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is an important issue. A vast amount of money is involved in building societies in Australia. For instance, in 1976-77 some $ 1,553m was approved as loans through permanent building societies for housing. That was about 30 per cent of total approvals for the purchase of dwellings through such financial institutions as savings banks, trading banks, permanent building societies, terminating building societies, finance companies, government and other sources. So building societies are a most substantial source of finance. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the matter from another direction. Depositors' funds as at June 1977 in selected financial institutions show that of those selected financial institutions, permanent building societies held $6,243 m out of a total of over $5 1,000m. The institutions involved, being somewhat different from the others I have mentioned, were trading banks, savings banks, permanent building societies, life insurance com- panies, the short-term money market, unit trusts, and trusts and mutual funds. So there is, I repeat, a vast amount of the public's money involved. It is the public's money- not the Minister's, not the Government's, not the Taxation Department's or any other official institution'swhich is tied up in those institutions called permanent building societies. People invest their money in those funds and other people borrow from them on the basis of trust. They trust the system in which they live and through which they function in this social economic order of ours. They trust it because they happen to believe- quite wrongly, as it turns out in this matter- that the Government will make sufficient arrangements to protect their interests. Yet the evidence is quite clear, as a result of a succession of crises affecting the permanent building societies, especially in Queensland, that there is need for more effective regulation in the public interest. The Minister suggested in a disturbingly uncritical way that he was satisfied with the administration of building societies in Queensland. Well, I am not and neither are a lot of other people. I quote from an article in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> of '29 September this year: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There must be a searching inquiry into all the events leading to the collapse of the Queensland Permanent Building Society. </para>
            <para>But who should make such an investigation? Not, as normally would be assumed, the State Government. </para>
            <para>The Government's own pan in this sorry mess is as much open to question as any aspect. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a damning condemnation of the Queensland Government. It scarcely endorses the sort of uncritical satisfaction expressed by the Minister here today. I repeat: There is not adequate regulation of these institutions. I also want to put on the record that from my knowledge of them, when we were in government and I was Acting Treasurer on several occasions, including one occasion when there was a most disturbing run on lending institutions, especially the building societies in 1974 and subsequently when I was Treasurer, I was convinced that mostly these institutions are well run, well administered institutions. But this is not true in all cases. So government must take action to ensure that people's financial interests and the security of those interests are protected. </para>
          <para>One of the facts that contributes to the defectiveness of the administration of some of these institutions arises from the hothouse way in which they developed. In the 1950s and early 1960s there was a rapid growth, almost from a cold start, of many of these permanent building societies. They grew from very small origins to quite large financial institutions. But the people who remained with those institutions, administering them, did not have the capacity, did not have the experience, did not have the equipment necessary to administer a fairly large financial institution with all the complexities of financial administration which is attendant with that. Presumably they successfully ran small organisations but it was a different ball game when they had to administer large institutions. This is why we are suggesting that adequate provision must be made to ensure that the administration and the general financial arrangements of these institutions are as secure as can be established. There is not adequate security. The Minister seems to imply otherwise. Let us just pare away the words the Minister is using so that we can have a clear view of what he is saying. The Minister is saying that there will be Reserve Bank backing for those permanent building societies which, when they run into trouble, show they are. competently managed and have adequate asset backing. Now that does not mean all of those institutions. It means only those which are competently managed and which have adequate asset backing, that is, those that are gold plated risks. This would exclude, for instance, the Queensland Permanent Building Society. </para>
          <para>I want to focus on this point to illustrate the general nature of the concern that people experience especially in Queensland and the justification for the Opposition raising this matter today. The Queensland Permanent Building Society represented a $150m crash- a crash that should have jolted the Queensland and the Australian governments into action but they indifferently slumber on. The crash of Queensland Permanent is a remarkable saga of incompetence, maladministration and, quite frankly, book-keeping covering up. In 1975-76, some $2.6m was lost in the computer balances. It must have been a goldplated computer. After 12 months investigation the auditors could locate only $300,000 of that missing $2.6m. </para>
          <para>A superficial review of the 1976-77 balance sheet of the Queensland Permanent Building Society showed initially a profit of $218,000, but when the analysis was applied more vigorously it was discovered in footnotes and in various other offhanded comments in the annual report that other losses had not been clearly set out in the general balance sheet. Accordingly, a profit of $2 1 8,000 was converted into a deficit of $8 1,759. For instance, dividends due to June 1977 had hot been included, and they represented over $204,000. There was an overpayment to shareholders of over $51,000. There were incorrect entries totalling nearly $44,000. This is evidence of the most appalling display of financial incompetence and maladministration in a very large financial institution- a $150m financial institution; an institution in which people on good trust invested their money; an institution from which other people in good faith borrowed money, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> said, to make the most important and most expensive investment of their lifetime, in their own home. </para>
          <para>Desperately, to get itself out of trouble, the Queensland Permanent Building Society increased its interest rates on mortgages to as much as 15 per cent. It eliminated daily balances for interest payments on deposits and replaced them with monthly balances. The upshot was that it had the widest operating margins in the industry. That seems to me to be quite immoral and improper action. There seems to have been no action taken by government to prevent depositors and borrowers from being put through the cleaners in this way to pay for this massive incompetence. </para>
          <para>A number of things ought to be done to protect the public interest more competently. Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act ought to be proclaimed- although it is not the answer to everything- to put these institutions on a sounder footing. A secondary housing mortgage market perhaps ought to be established through the Australian Housing Corporation so that the liquidity of these institutions could be improved during financial rundowns. There should be Federal insurance of shares and deposits held with these institutions. If these institutions are going to argue that they should have lender of last resort facilities they have to accept some government supervision of the sort I have outlined to ensure that the sort of shocking maladministration for which the Queensland Permanent Building Society was responsible never occurs again. That is all the Opposition is saying and that is not an unreasonable proposition. </para>

            <para>- It is a matter of some interest to know why the Opposition has brought forward this matter of public importance today. One would have thought that, in the present climate in this country, the Opposition might have been more concerned with other things. Perhaps the fact that there will be an election in Queensland soon has prompted the Opposition to bring this matter forward. I think it is necessary to put the situation into some perspective. Since the mid-1960s, when the building societies came into prominence and achieved major significance, there have been four periods which have involved runs, as they are known, on building societies and in no case has there been any loss to depositors. I think it is important that we bear that m mind because the Opposition is trying to lead us to believe that there is a continuing crisis in this industry. That is not the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are a number of reasons why the building society industry has experienced some difficulty from time to time, and I think it might be worth while to outline some of those reasons. There has been rapid growth in the industry. This has strained management expertise and in some circumstances it has tended to outrun the resources which have been devoted to the supervision of the societies by the relevant State authorities. Another reason for some of the difficulties facing this industry is the strong concentration on call funds, with a high proportion of money coming from investors who are interest-sensitive and who will switch their investments from one form to another, depending on the interest rate that is available to them. This obviously means that building society deposits are always subject to being pulled out by the people who have lodged them. The industry is a very competitive one and this has contributed to a tendency for building societies to work on very fine margins between the cost of the funds that they take in from depositors and the earnings that they gain on lending them out. The fact that the industry is competitive and that there is this relatively fine margin obviously leads to a situation in which building societies can get themselves into degrees of difficulty if there are rapid changes in the financial situation. </para>
          <para>Building societies have always tended to run relatively low liquidity ratios, particularly in times when a demand for housing loans is anticipated. It is necessary to keep coming back to the point that there has been no loss to depositors in any of these so-called crises or runs on building societies. I think it is irresponsible for the Opposition to try to suggest in the Parliament that there is a crisis in the industry. All the Opposition is doing is adding to the concerns that some people may have, concerns which certainly are unfounded. We need also to look at where the responsibility lies in the area of building society control, management or government intervention. For many years now it has been accepted that the responsibility for sound management and appropriate financial practices among building societies lies with the State governments through their registrars. Most State governments have Ministers who are designated as being responsible for building societies. That is where the responsibility for this control lies. </para>
          <para>The Federal Government obviously has a role to play, but the responsibility is principally one that rests with the States. The Commonwealth may be able to promote national legislation which applies uniform standards, ratios and things of this nature to companies which operate in the building society industry, but at this stage the responsibility is primarily one that rests with the States. The Commonwealth has no hesitation in coming out and making it perfectly clear that the Reserve Bank of Australia is prepared to back the building societies when they are experiencing liquidity problems. The trading banks have made it clear that they will consider sympathetically requests for finance from building societies which are responsibly managed and which have adequate asset backing. The Reserve Bank stands ready to ensure that liquidity or other policy considerations will not be an impediment to the use of those banks' resources in backing the building societies. I think that is a fairly significant contribution from the Federal Government in an area in which it really does not have statutory control. It is an area in which we seek to co-operate with the States in seeing that the confidence of investors is not shaken. The fact that the Reserve Bank stands ready to assist is proof of our bona fides in this instance. </para>
          <para>It has been suggested by the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and no doubt by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> that deposit insurance ought to be looked at. Although there is some reassurance to investors in having some system of deposit insurance, it does not necessarily ensure sound management, it does not provide an alternative to sound management of societies and it does not necessarily offer protection against runs on societies. The legislation that exists in the banking field does not rule out the possibility that a bank itself might fail. It provides for intervention to manage a bank in the interests of depositors. State authorities can exercise a similar power in the case of building societies. It is true that central bank loan facilities are available to banks and authorised short term money market dealers, but these are for monetary management purposes and do not guarantee the solvency of these institutions. I think it is clear that there is not really any guarantee offered by government for the safety of depositors' funds in societies which are badly managed, which are run by incompetent management or in which frauds are involved. The Government is prepared to go as far as it can to protect the interests of depositors. Obviously, this is a moral compulsion that governments often feel bound by, but there is no compulsion on government at a federal level to involve itself in this field. What the Government is seeking to do is to regulate, to see that responsible practices are adhered to and that its money market policy, interest rate policy, money supply policy and things of this nature are not being abused. </para>
          <para>There has been a great deal of emphasis on the Financial Corporations Act by the Leader of the Opposition and by the honourable member for Oxley. I think it was stated by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> and the Minister assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> that that Act was not intentionally formulated with the object of providing a means for protecting investors or the financial stability of individual building societies. It was acknowledged at the time the Act was passed that it was a matter for the States within the framework of registration and supervision which they have had over a long period of time. If Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act were implemented, it would not enhance the scope of the sorts of things the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley are talking about. The intention of Part IV of the Act primarily is to enhance the scope of effective monetary policy rather than to supervise the management of individual corporations. Even if they were fully exercised, those powers in Part IV are not adequate or appropriate to ensure the financial stability of individual societies. We come back to the situation that there must be an understanding of where the responsibility lies in this particular area and what the Commonwealth Government has done. It has thrown the weight of the Reserve Bank behind the properly managed building societies that are experiencing liquidity problems. It is necessary to have an understanding of the industry to realise why and where and how these societies are different from the other financial institutions, particularly in this area of a reliance on call funds and a reliance on funds from depositors who are interest sensitive. The Federal Government will continue to do what is within its power to ensure that confidence is retained by depositors in building societies. </para>

            <para>-by leaveMembers may recall that on 10 November 1976 I informed the House on behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Committee had agreed under section la. of its terms of reference to undertake an inquiry into the status of Soviet Jewry. I indicated also that due to the Committee's commitments in relation to other inquiries there would be considerable delay before the Committee could undertake investigation of this subject. However, public hearings on the status of Soviet Jewry commenced on 7 October. The emerging issue is that the Committee is faced with the problem of elucidating what the officially established Soviet ideology means in relation to any form of dissent, any form of separate national or ethnic sentiment and any form of religious conviction. In any case, in undertaking the considerable task of investigating alleged discrimination against Jews in the Soviet Union, the-. Committee needs to make comparisons with other groups in the Soviet Union which may or may not be disadvantaged. What, for instance, is the bearing of the Soviet Government's general religious policy on Judaism in particular? Is it selective against Soviet Jews. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It has therefore been decided by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to rename the Sub-Committee on the Petition regarding Soviet Jewry as the Sub-Committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union. However, the Sub-Committee will concentrate at least its initial attention on the status of Soviet Jewry in order to honour its advertisements which appeared in the national Press in late September.

          <para class="block">This Bill proposes an amendment to the income tax law to provide for the reinstatement of an income tax exemption for income derived by bona fide prospectors from the sale, transfer or assignment of rights to mine for gold or any other metal or mineral that is prescribed for the purposes of the exemption. Our decision to reintroduce this exemption was announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in Kalgoorlie on 7 October and this amending Bill was foreshadowed in the second reading speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1977. Until it was repealed in 1973 by the former Government, this exemption had been part of the income tax law for a great many years. </para>
          <para>A consequence of the repeal was that prospectors in the mineral fields of Western Australia and other parts of Australia were denied the special incentive they had enjoyed for so long in recognition of their special position in the search for and development of the mineral wealth of the nation. Not unnaturally strong representations have been made to the Government to restore this incentive, none stronger, I might emphasise, than those made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mick Cotter, continuously since he entered this House at the 1975 elections. </para>
          <para>This Government believes that it is important to encourage the search for minerals which today form such an important part of the Australian economy. It also recognises that many prospectors are forced, for economic reasons, to transfer the right to mine minerals discovered by them to companies with both the finance and the knowhow to develop a large scale mining operation. </para>
          <para>Prospectors are encouraged to look for minerals they cannot hope to mine themselves if they know that any income that they will receive from transferring rights to mine their discoveries is not going to be reduced by taxation.

          <para>-The debate on the estimates for the Department of Science is one of the few opportunities granted to the Parliament to discuss matters of science and science policy. Unfortunately the time allocated for discussion is so short that the subject cannot be given the treatment if deserves in full. Practical attempts by members of Parliament to come to grips with the role we expect science and technology to play never match the optimism inherent in our public statements- statements such as that which forms part of the introduction to the Liberal and National Country Party Science and Technology Policy published in November 1975 and which states quite confidently that 'advances in science and technology provide a major means for economic growth and progress towards a better quality of life'. If the Government had fulfilled the undertakings made in this policy document there would have been ample opportunity for an extended parliamentary debate on science and technology policy. Under a list of what is called 'special initiatives' the Government's pre-election science policy clearly states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>As recommended by the OECD Examiners' Report we will present to Parliament an annual science statement indicating trends in research and development in terms of overall priorities. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This Government has been in office for almost two full years and still there has been no sign of such a statement. </para>
        <para>Little evidence exists that the Government has taken any steps to build upon the major developments in science policy which occurred under the Labor Government. Between 1972 and 1975, a separate Department of Science was established, the Australian Science and Technology Council was formed, a team of examiners from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported on science and technology policy in Australia and a separate science task force reported to the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. The report of the Coombs Commission special science task force had dramatic implications for the Department of Science. The Department's abolition was recommended. The special task force concluded that the Department had virtually no policy role and as its functions were primarily administrative these functions could be reasonably elsewhere. The task force took the view that scientific advice from within government could be effectively provided by individual departments having their own science sections. From these they could draw advice on scientific and technological aspects of their particular departmental policies. Such a system operates in the United Kingdom but as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, a department with specific responsibilities for science policy. The Department of Science predictably found little merit with the task force recommendations and was quick to put a counter submission to the Royal Commission. Despite the fact that the Department survived that threat to its existence, the suspicion remains that it is little more than an administrative centre. There is little public evidence to suggest that its policy role has developed at all in the last couple of years. </para>
        <para>Recent revelations that at least three inquiries are being held at present into scientific research and development in Australia, none of which directly involves the Department of Science, lend credence to the belief that the Department is not being allowed to play a role which would fully justify its existence. The Department has had experience with 'Project Score' which catalogued information on the distribution of science funds and science manpower in Australia and which required five years of effort to complete. One would have imagined that this could have formed the basis for a wider inquiry into research and development. In 1974, the OECD examiners found that Australia lagged well behind other OECD countries in the development of industrial and energy policy and that in particular there was a noticeable lack of co-ordination between various research and development sectors. It does not take much imagination to suggest a role for the Department of Science in overcoming this lack of co-ordination. To the present, we do not appear to have had any success at integrating science policy and technology policy and, until we do, our approach to such matters will be piecemeal and non-productive. </para>
        <para>At the moment the Department of Productivity is looking at industrial research and development. The Department of National Resources is inquiring into energy research. The Australian Science and Technology Council and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment are supposedly looking at all research and development. It is obvious that there will be considerable duplication of effort in these undertakings and little possibility of unanimity in their conclusions. I do not regard that by itself as a bad thing as long as we get some sort of propositions put up that can be intelligently discussed by people who finally have to make the decisions. It is critical that a thorough review of scientific and technological research and development be undertaken in Australia. The Industries Assistance Commission stressed the importance of such a review in both its 1975 and 1976 annual reports when it requested a reference on the topic. It would be preferable that such an inquiry be given considerable status and be performed by a single entity which might be expected to have a continuing influence on the direction of Australia's scientific effort. Unless the Department of Science in one way or another can form the nucleus of such an entity, there appears to be little reason for continued rejection of the recommendations of the Coombs Commission's science task force. </para>
        <para>Having said that as a general statement on science, I will deal with two more specific problems. The first one relates to an invitation from the Minister for Science, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> dated 1 June 1977, concerning the possible formation of a scientific group of Federal Parliament. In that letter to myself- I think it was sent to all membershe said, amongst other things: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Several people have suggested to me that scientific interests in the community generally, and members of Parliament in particular, may be well served by a Parliamentary Scientific Committee. </para>

        <para class="block">The Minister referred to the original British idea and stated that such a committee presently operates. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The UK body is unofficial, non statutory and non partisan. It is made up of members of both Houses of Parliament and nominated representatives of scientific and technical organisations. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think the proposition was first raised in Australiato the best of my knowledge it was- by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Ann</inline> Moyle who is at present the Director of the Science Policy Research Centre in the School of Science at Griffith University in Brisbane. After giving some examples of what a scientific group of the Federal Parliament would do- such as meeting with scientists and technologists- the Minister completed his letter by stating: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Should you be interested I would appreciate your comment on the suggestion that some similar group be brought together in Canberra. At present I foresee all secretarial work being carried out within my office. </para>
          <para>Your response will be welcome. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I replied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> I said that I supported the principle as outlined by him but that I could see dangers in the existence of such a group unless fairly critical and intelligent parliamentarians formed that scientific group. As I put it: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. I can see dangers should smooth talking rather than critical scientists succeed in 'snowing ' parliamentarians. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I can well see the danger involved in exposing many of our parliamentarians to some of the scientists who try to push Parliament into spending large amounts of money on their particular interests at any particular time, whether it be solar energy, nuclear energy or whatever. There is a risk when people who are not terribly critical in their approach meet with the so-called experts in the field. They are likely to be hesitant in asking the appropriate questions and possibly would give the wrong advice to the Government. </para>
        <para>But, in principle and provided that rational critical parliamentarians joined that group- I do not suppose anybody could be excluded from joining that group-and participated actively in that group, I feel that it certainly would be of benefit to this Parliament and to any government, whether it be a Labor government or a Liberal-National Country Party government, to have a group of parliamentarians who are well informed on reasonably current issues of science and technology. I feel that many of the comments that are made in the debates in this chamber on such issues as nuclear energy are, to put it at its lowest, highly debatable from a scientific point of view. </para>

          <para>-Ih speaking to the estimates for the Department of Science for 1977-78, I commend the Government on providing for a number of important new initiatives through its allocation of $204.4m to the Department of Science. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This allocation allows for an increase of approximately one-third in spending on research in Australia 's Antarctic Territory. This, of course, is a region of increasing importance. Another initiative is the provision of funding for Australian owned and operated facilities for receiving and processing data from the Landsat earth resources technology satellites. The data from these satellites has a series of applications of both economic and environmental importance. </para>
        <para>I particularly commend the Government's allocation of funds to 16 research projects related to the development of solar energy. This demonstrates the Fraser Government 's consciousness of our future energy needs and the role which solar energy will play in the future in fulfilling those needs. </para>
        <para>However, there is one area which I believe needs increased attention and needs to be given a higher priority by the Government- that is, our knowledge of the resources of the sea. Honourable members may recall that last week I asked the Minister for National Resources a question without notice concerning this matter. </para>
        <para>Australia, despite its long coastline and the proposed extension of the coastal economic zone to 200 miles, still does not have a properly equipped seismological survey ship. Australian scientists virtually have to hitch rides on ships of other countries to undertake their research or, as the Minister for National Resources prefers to describe it, they have to enter joint arrangements with other international institutions. In answering that question last week the Minister indicated that he would like to see more oceanographic research undertaken and also indicated the Government's continuing interest in this sphere. He said that, although funds are not available within the current expenditure restraints, he hoped that we would be able to provide funds for the purchase of such a ship in the future. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding the expenditure restraints, I believe that this issue is a matter of priority. I believe that the need for a seismological survey ship is urgent. I encourage the Government to give the purchase of such a ship a far higher priority than is apparent thus far. </para>
        <para>The joint arrangements in which Australian scientists have been involved are not totally satisfactory. They lack flexibility in the undertaking of research and also, of course, there is always a security problem with the sort of research which some scientists may desire to undertake in regard to our resources of the sea. One of the current objections to the purchase of a seismological survey ship is its cost, as I mentioned a moment ago, in relation to expenditure restraints. Firstly, I refer to the capital cost of such an initiative. The initial cost, of course, is for the purchase of a vessel. A suitable vessel need not be a new ship. There are a number of suitable secondhand vessels available; for example, those which oil companies may have used in the past for similar work. In fact, last year one such vessel was sold for $1.3m. Certainly a suitable ship could be obtained for an overall capital cost of less than $4m. </para>
        <para>On top of the cost of the basic ship there is the need for the appropriate research equipment. The capital cost of this would amount to less than $lm. There is a need for equipment related to geophysical research, hydrography and core drilling. Examples of the sort of equipment and the costs of such equipment would be: A gravimeter, which would cost approximately $250,000; a magnetometer, at a cost of approximately $ 100,000; and air guns, at a cost of approximately $50,000. In addition to that, there would be some need for computing facilities. Some universities and other research institutions already have appropriate equipment which could be applied to this purpose. In addition, some funds could be provided for the purchase of equipment through the Australian Research Grants Committee. </para>
        <para>In addition to these capital items, running costs, of course, are associated with such a survey ship. In the United States and West Germany, similar types of vessels operate at a cost of approximately $10,000 a day, including the cost of crew. When we consider the overall cost of the purchase and operation of a seismological survey ship, I believe that it is a relatively small amount in the context of the Government's total Budget expenditure. </para>
        <para>I acknowledge the need for overall expenditure restraint in the current economic situation. I also acknowledge that there are, of course, always competing priorities to which the Government must give attention, but I do believe that the Government should give this matter a high priority. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, there is a range of uses to which a seismological survey ship could be applied to fulfil vital needs in Australia. The extension of the coastal economic zone to 200 miles provides Australia with a very large continental shelf. It is a continental shelf of which we have very little knowledge. There is an absence of basic geological research to establish, for example, the minerals potential within that continental shelf. We do not know what minerals are available there for exploitation; equally we do not know what minerals are in fact lacking. A second important aspect of this issue and a use to which the ship could be applied is the establishment of the extent of Australia's fishing capabilities and the extent of available fisheries. Of course, quite apart from the economic potential of this aspect there is its importance in a hungry world. </para>
        <para>Another use to which such a vessel could be applied is the study of the currents surrounding Australia. A close and detailed knowledge of currents, for example, could save sailing time. As all honourable members are aware, Australia's trade is still, to a very large degree, dependent on ships for transport. It has been estimated by West Germany, for example, that a detailed knowledge of the currents of the Atlantic Ocean saves that country one day's sailing time each trip in trade between West Germany and the United States. Certainly, with the degree to which Australia depends on sea transport for its trade, similar savings could be effected by a detailed knowledge of currents around Australia which could be obtained from research undertaken by a seismological survey vessel. In addition, knowledge of the currents is important also for determining harbour locations and structures. On top of that is the more esoteric and purely scientific research to which such a ship could be devoted. </para>
        <para>The need is urgent because it is quite possible that other countries know more about our offshore areas than we do. I believe that in the long run the cost of not having such a vessel could be more than the cost of providing funds for its purchase as soon as possible. Almost every development seaboard country has at least one seismological vessel. </para>
        <para>I believe that the Government should set up a section within the Department of Science to administer the purchase and operation of such a vessel. The Department should establish a base from which the vessel would operate, provide for its maintenance and provide training for its crew and other people involved in its operations. </para>

            <para>- It is not the same but I shall discuss the matter afterwards with the honourable member for Hunter. I believe also that the Department should provide data processing facilities to process the various items of information which would be obtained as a result of the research undertaken by this vessel. On this basis institutions could apply for the use of the ship, for an allocation of the time of the ship for their individual purposes. That time would be allocated through the Department. Institutions such as the universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Bureau of Mineral Research would be such bodies. A committee should be established to oversee the research priorities and to allocate the use of the vessel to particular institutions. There certainly is ample demand for the use of such a ship and it would not lie idle. </para>

        <para>In conclusion I want to commend the Government for its overall commitment to scientific research as indicated in the Budget appropriation for the Department of Science. I congratulate the Minister for Science, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> for his enthusiastic and efficient management of the portfolio. However I urge the Government to give high priority to the purchase of a seismological survey ship to ensure that Australia maximises its knowledge of its undersea resources and reaps the economic rewards for the benefit of all Australians. </para>

          <para>-By picking out individual items it is easy to suggest that there has been a dramatic increase in funding for this and that in the estimates for the Department of Science but the reality is that in overall terms there has been a reduction of probably over 5 per cent in real terms in the funds set aside for this Department. I am not going to go into details; I am much more interested in discussing some of the other features. I would just highlight the point, as an example, that the funds for the Bureau of Meteorology are to be exactly the same. Given inflation, that means it has had a real cut of something over 10 per cent. Research grants probably have been nearly halved. The Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science has been wiped and this has happened at a time when more and more people think it is important to have better communication between scientists and the community. ANZAAS was a good forum for scientists to explain their views and feelings about things in an atmosphere where the Press and the media bothered to take notice. So it helped improve communication. The Government has dropped its subsidy for ANZAAS. Finally I mention the Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organisation. In real terms its funding also has been cut, despite the juggling of the figures. The apparent increase is due to a transfer of some research programs to CSIRO which were carried out in other departments. In real terms there has been a cut in funding. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What is the CSIRO, all about? Well, the present Government commissioned a report on the CISRO and I would like to quote from or refer to that report. First of all this committee of inquiry discussed the place of scientific research in Australia. It pointed out that the argument has been put that since we are a small country we do not contribute all that much to world research and perhaps we could stop it altogether and deend on the rest of the world. The Committee beeves that in the long run it would be disastrous to do so. Apart from the argument that we are part of the world and draw from it and therefore, to the best of our capacity, we ought to contribute to it, the Committee thinks there are practical reasons why this is a bad suggestion. It makes the point that we have a unique continent and that we are the custodians and exploiters of it. We have to find out about it, if for no other reason than so that we can better utilise its resources. There are problems associated with our geography, weather and geology, and even our own particular social structures that are all unique. The Committee said:  . . world science and technology give guidelines but cannot solve our particular problems or delineate our particular opportunities. </para>
        <para class="block">In other words, we have to do it ourselves. The Committee made the point that research is needed both for long-term use of our resources to best advantage and also to overcome short-term difficulties. The Committee conceded that while research is significant it is not the only component involved in the problem of promoting social and economic progress but 'if decreased below the present level, where we barely keep up with the advanced world, and indeed fall behind in many places, the long-term result could be economic and social stagnation'. The Committee mentioned some of our industries which are rather more fortunate, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and so on, but pointed out that many of our resources are exhaustable, and even in the renewable resource area we have problems and need to learn how to manage them. We need to develop an energy policy in relation to our particular needs and our particular resources situation as against the rest of the world, and so the Committee went on. </para>
        <para>The Committee made the point quite clearly that we should not depend unduly upon the rest of the world because undue dependence on overseas science and technology also implies general dependence, and dependence also implies taking what we are given, not necessarily what we want. Those who have nothing to sell or exchange in the world of technology frequently do not receive the latest developments and they pay a high price at the same time. </para>
        <para>When it comes to a discussion of the level of research the Committee made the point that examiners from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that our effort is low compared with that of many other countries, countries with which we ought to com- pete- not the under-developed countries but theetter developed countries. In 1973-74 we expended 1.2 per cent of our gross domestic product and that is below the expenditure of countries such as America, Japan, Sweden and so on. They think we come somewhere in the middle to lower level of the effort put in by countries such as ours which seem to be dependent. We are in the area of countries which depend mainly on rural industries and so on whereas we would have thought that we are dependent more upon high technology industries. So we are in the wrong league, if you like to put it that way. Research basically is an investment in the future. That is one of the conclusions drawn by this Committee. </para>
        <para>The Committee then discussed the role of the CSIRO, but I do not want to go into it in detail as it is all perfectly obvious. It made something of the fact that activity should be expanded in interpreting and disseminating information from world science and technology for the benefit of technological innovation in Australia and for increased use by Australian industry. We cannot do that if we are going to cut back funding and impose additional burdens and the CSIRO at the same time. How are we to do it? The honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> gave a hint of it and I would like to discuss that point. I shall not go on with some of the other detail that I was going to mention because my time is running out. I do not want to have to speak when we continue after the sittings are suspended for dinner. </para>
        <para>I would like to make some comments about the Australian Science and Technology Council. The honourable member for Prospect mentioned that the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> has written to him and said that people were being invited to give their views on the establishment of a parliamentary science group. I think that is a good idea; we ought to be better involved. However, I think that a more important and more significant factor would be the establishment of ASTEC in the way that the Labor Government attempted. The Labor Government set up the organisation much along the lines that the present Government has followed except that we chose younger people who were more actively involved in the forefront of scientific endeavour rather than the venerable gentlemen who had proved their worth many years before. In this area we need people actively engaged in scientific research if we want to get the best advice. The more signficant factor was that we thought there should be a meeting of ASTEC and a council of Ministers, not just backbench members of Parliament, although I am not ruling that out. There ought to be a meeting of ASTEC and a council of Ministers to discuss specific issues, otherwise ASTEC will prepare a report and the Ministers will not have been involved. Honourable members know what will happen; the Ministers will not read it and that will be the end of it. If Ministers are involved with scientists in formulating a report they will then understand it and then we might get some action. It is the only way. Science councils have been set up all over the world and they have been proved disappointing. </para>
        <para>The only place where the OECD examiners thought there had been some measure of success was West Germany where they had this meeting of the scientists and the ministers. The report was not an ASTEC report; it was a joint report by both groups- the parliamentarians or politicians and the scientists. They both had to bend their minds to understand the problems on the other side and so they came up with a report which was likely to be implemented. I would recommend that course to the Government. </para>

          <para>-I speak in support of the estimates for the Department of Science, particularly in support of the allocation of additional staff and funds and the expansion of areas of research provided in the Budget in respect of the Australian Antarctic Division. There is a certain curiosity and fascination about the Antarctic. It is still the great unknown. Man has not yet tamed or conquered it. In the middle of summer heavy clothing must be worn. It is still a new frontier for man. Its resources are now attracting world-wide attention. Some of these are minerals. Coal and iron ore have been discovered and there has been exploration for oil and gas. A hole has been drilled by the <inline font-style="italic">Glomar</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Challenger.</inline>Methane and ethane have been discovered. Manganese nodules which are found in other parts of the world have been found there. </para>
        <para>Of course, there is fish and the subject of whether whales should or should not be caught. There is krill, which is an enormous protein resource. It is a small lobster or prawn-like creature. It is already harvested by a number of countries including, I think, West Germany and the Soviet Union. Fresh water, in the form of icebergs, is now attracting attention as to whether it could solve the problems of some of the drier regions of the world. Of course there is tourism. The Budget provides for expenditure on an examination of a proposal for an intercontinental airship at one of Australia's Antarctic stations. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Law,</inline> the famous Australian who pioneered so much of our work in the Antarctic, is in fact in favour of an intercontinental polar route to South America via Antarctica. He has pointed out that the route from Melbourne to New York would be only 600 miles longer than the route via Honolulu. In fact, the proposal has a lot of attraction about it. Already Qantas Airways Ltd has had nights over the Pole. Cruise ships have been in the area. The polar route to Europe is something that I think we need to explore. </para>
        <para>We need to have more in common with our South American colleagues. I think one of the fascinations of South America is how much geographically we have in common and how little we know about each other. In this country we still look to the northern hemisphere. Perhaps we could learn more about our part of the world by seeing what other occupants of the southern hemisphere have done. We of course share in common with the South Americans interest in the Antarctic region. I think this is something that might bring us together. It has recently become more widely known that Russia has three bases in the Australian Antarctic Territory. These were established in, I think, the International Geophysical Year and are there quite properly for scientific reasons. In fact one of the hypocrisies of world politics is, I believe, that the Russians in fact fly to their bases through South Africa, but not very much is heard about that. </para>
        <para>I would like to raise the question of the interchange of information under the Antarctic Treaty. I understand that there is great goodwill between scientists of various nations, including the Russians and the Australians in the Antarctic. That is as it ought to be. I think the vicissitudes of the climate and the common scientific challenge of the unknown there ensure that there are no apparent ideological differences. This is to be encouraged. Regrettably communist ideology interfere at the bureaucratic level. I think traditionally exchanges of information by the Soviets have always been behind time. I think the commissars must get involved at a bureaucratic level. In the 1971-72 Australian summer expedition Australian geologists were working in the Southern Prince Charles Mountains and made contact with a Soviet exploration team of geologists working in the same area. There were very cordial discussions between people who have a lot in common- both being in the Antarctic and both being geologists. I understand that whilst informally there are good relationships between the geologists of these countries there has not been any formal exchange of information, and that in fact the Soviet Union has not honoured its undertaking which was apparently given to that expedition and which was in accordance with the Treaty to provide Australia with this information. I hope that that situation will be remedied. One must ask whether the Soviet Union has anything to hide. I call upon the Soviet Union to make that information available. </para>
        <para>The question of resources has attracted a lot of interest I return to one of the areas to which I referred earlier, namely, minerals. I think we must be careful that we do not get rushed into the thought that these can be quickly exploited. The iron ore there is of a lower grade than that which is available in Australia. I think one could work out the Australian iron ore fields long before one needed to go to Antarctica and face the challenges of actually digging the material out of the ground, getting it over snow, setting up equipment to load and unload and in fact bringing it out of the Antarctic. I think such a scheme is many years away. There are problems of course with oil and gas exploration also. A vertical hole is drilled on-shore. In a year, because of the pressure of the ice, it will be a horizontal hole. There are enormous technical challenges, and I am sure they will be met although I do not think they will be met quickly. The areas of potential are tourism and of course the harvesting of the krill to which I referred earlier. That is where I think our efforts will need to lie. Additionally, of course, we have a responsibility to explore the Territory. We will be able to do that in an expanded way because of this Budget. </para>
        <para>I refer briefly to some comments made in the House by the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> on 20 October about the Antarctic Division Headquarters. He was speaking on the proposal recommended by the Standing Committee on Public Works to build a new complex of the Antarctic Division at Hobart. He said that it was not clear whether this Government would continue with Antarctic research. I have great respect for the honourable member's knowledge of C. J. Dennis's Australian poetry- I say that seriously- but I am afraid that his knowledge of the Antarctic leaves a little to be desired. He is wrong in that regard. The Government is committed. This Budget commits the Government to expansion in the areas of research in the Antarctic. The Government has an on-going program. </para>

          <para>- I do not rise to defend myself against the puerile attack from the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton).</inline> In fact, what he was saying was not altogether true. At no time did I attack the locating of the headquarters of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science in Hobart. In fact, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, of which I was Vice-Chairman, strongly recommended that the Division should go to Hobart. So for the honourable member for Higgins to talk about my being critical in any way of the location of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science in Hobart of course is quite fallacious. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have not been to the Antarctic, as has the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Falconer).</inline> I have only spoken with people very knowledgeable about the area. I think that everybody would agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr P.</inline> G. Law is probably one of the most knowledgeable people in Australia on the Antarctic. He was a witness before the Public Works Committee. Everybody would agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> White, who for many years was  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, is another acknowledged authority throughout the world on the Antarctic. He also appeared before the Committee, as did Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger from the Flinders University and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Budd</inline> of the glaciology section of the Antarctic Division attached to the department of meteorology at the Melbourne University. </para>
        <para>Although I have not been to the Antarctic, having sat through four days of the Public Works Committee inquiry, I feel that I can speak with some authority about Australia 's role in the Antarctic. I hope that the honourable member for </para>
        <para class="block">Higgins will read the ninth report of 1977 of the Public Works Committee that was presented to this Parliament. I see that he has a copy of it. He is waving it in the air. Cheers. The honourable member should read it Perhaps he has not had the advantage of reading the transcript of evidence, but if he reads the transcript of evidence in conjunction with the report he will find that the Fraser Government has not yet brought down a White Paper on Australia's future role in the Antarctic. If the Government is of a mind to set out a White Paper on Australia's future role in the Antarctic, it could do no better than read the transcript of the evidence that was taken in Melbourne, and probably more importantly the later evidence that was taken in Hobart on 29 and 30 August 1977. </para>
        <para>The Committee, albeit that it was sent there by the Parliament to examine a particular project, delved widely and deeply into the reasons why the Antarctic Division complex ought to be established at Kingston. Because of the world acclaimed credits attachable to the witnesses who appeared before the Committee, the honourable member should read the transcript of their evidence and indeed the Government should read it. What the Public Works Committee did on those two days in Hobart was write a White Paper on Australia's future role in the Antarctic. There are a number of deficiencies in Australia's role. The area of the Antarctic to which Australia lays claim is two-thirds the area of the Australian Continent. It is 2 million square miles in area- an enormous area of land. It has been reported by people who are knowledgeable in this area that Australia, compared with other nations, is regarded as a squatter in the area. </para>
        <para>Our contribution to Antarctic research has not been particularly great. I heard the honourable member for Higgins talking about resources available in the Antarctic. My information is that the technology is not yet available to bore through- if my memory serves me correctlysomething like 7 million cubic miles of ice. It is not as simple as boring a hole in the desert and pumping oil out of it. The depth of the ice is so great that as drills are driven into the ice it immediately contracts around the drills and snaps the shafts. All these technological problems have to be overcome. </para>
        <para>Surely Australia's role in the Antarctic is not going to be seen as that of another colonial power. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics maintains a base in the Antarctic, but claims no territorial grounds at all. The United States of America, our great and powerful friend, as somebody was once wont to call it, does not maintain any territorial claims to the Antarctic continent, but it gathers scientific research material in that area. Australia is a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty. Honourable members would have read in the Press recently that Australia is a very significant participant in world contribution and world dissemination of all of the scientific information that comes from the Antarctic. This is not a political question; it is not a question about who is to do what. It is a question about the Australian Government determining a course of action. It is time the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> stopped playing his parlour games and told us when the next election is to be so that the people of Australia can elect a decent government. The Government of Australia, whichever party it may be, must of necessity take a positive role in the Antarctic. </para>
        <para>I heard the honourable member for Higgins talking about the harvesting of krill. It is a very important food. It is a high protein food. It is a very small shellfish that exists in the Antarctic in large numbers. What are we to do if the Japanese, the Koreans, the Taiwanese or anybody else send their ships to harvest the krill in the Antarctic oceans? Are we to send gunboats to shoot them out of the water because they intend to feed the starving people of their countries? Of course we are not. </para>
        <para>It must also be said that Australia does not yet own a ship that will take our expeditions to the Antarctic. It charters the <inline font-style="italic">Thala Dan</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Nella Dan</inline> from the Danish Government. One of those ships is out of commission at the moment. They make two voyages in the southern summer to the Antarctic continent and they have a limited time in which to do it. There is no way known that the Australian Government can fly Australian aircraft into the Antarctic and land in the 2 million square miles to which we lay claim, take in supplies or personnel and bring out personnel. We do not own an airstrip. We have not built one on the Antarctic continent. We rely on our great and powerful friend, the United States, and the New Zealanders to fly aircraft into the Antarctic continent. We have no Australian Government owned lines of communication between Australia and the area we claim in the Antarctic. </para>
        <para>These are questions with which the Australian Government must grapple. It has not given any indication in the estimates that it intends to do that. It has not moved one inch from the Green Paper that was prepared by Bill Morrison in 1975 when he was Minister for Science. It is now late 1977. For almost two years that discussion paper has been available to the present Government, but it still has not brought down a White Paper. It still has not announced its policy on the Antarctic. That was one of the problems that confronted the Public Works Committee. It was mentioned in the report. It was mentioned by every member of the Committee, irrespective of political persuasion, that the Australian Government does not have a firm policy on its role in the Antarctic. Unless it establishes a firm significant policy it will be seen by the rest of the world as a squatter in this area, hoping that it is going to maintain sovereignty over an area two-thirds the size of its homeland and hoping that no other nation will challenge it for the resources allegedly underneath the ice. </para>

          <para>-The estimates for the Department of Science, which are now before the Committee, involve the sum of $186,760,000. This amount is over $14m more than the appropriation for the year 1976-77. The activities of the Department of Science cover a great range. It is also true to say that those activities, whilst being of the greatest importance to Australia's development, are of such a nature that they do not consistently retain the public's awareness. Apart from the administrative sector which commands an appropriation of $5,502,800, the Department maintains operations in analytical services, providing security for Australians in matters as far apart as food purity standards and drug analysis. In the latter area, the analytical services section provides evidence in court in matters of illegal drug imports and in many cases is able to establish the source of such drugs. This service is a valuable weapon in the nation's efforts to cope with an increasingly serious drug problem. </para>

That body, incidentally, commands an appropriation of $34,950,000, which is rather staggering in quantum but which demonstrates again the vastness of our nation and the sophistication of the meteorological services needed to maintain efficient operation of security not only for our aviation industry but for all those who are required to have an awareness of the mischief inherent in the elements. The Bureau of Meteorology, the Antarctic Division, the Ionospheric Prediction Service, the Metric Conversion Board, the National Standards Commission, the Institute of Marine Science and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation demonstrate the breadth of the Department's responsibilities. </para>
        <para>In recent times, as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I have had the opportunity to inquire, during public hearings, into the activities of the Antarctic Division in the matter of the transfer of the headquarters complex to Kingston, Tasmania; the proposal to construct an analytical laboratory at Pymble, New South Wales; and, more recently, the proposed construction of a beef research station at Rockhampton, Queensland. In all situations I was unimpressed with the spirit of the officers and scientists involved, particularly when viewed, in many instances, against a background of incredibly cramped working conditions. </para>
        <para>On this occasion I wish to address myself to the activities of the CSIRO. The CSIRO, of course, has been subject to an inquiry initiated by the Government. The report, commonly referred to as the Birch report, was furnished to the Parliament as recently as August last. In that report, the CSIRO 's involvement in rural research was examined closely. Recommendations from the Committee foreshadowed a lessening of input in rural research. The actual recommendation was: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>CSIRO should examine the relevance to its role as a national organisation of the composition of its rural research effort, particularly in relation to the capabilities and responsibilities of other organisations, such as State Departments of Agriculture. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This expression of view has occasioned some ap- prehension within the sugar industry which, asonourable gentlemen undoubtedly realise, is an exceedingly efficient industry, with more than 90 per cent of Australia's total production being produced in Queensland. The sugar industry has enjoyed a most productive and satisfying association with the CSIRO. It is reluctant in the extreme to contemplate a diminution of the CSIRO 's involvement, particularly when no adequate alternative machinery appears in immediate prospect. </para>
        <para>The sugar industry, of course, makes a very substantial contribution to the funds that the CSIRO needs in order to perform its research. It is noteworthy that the sugar industry has a cash output, in production terms, of in execess of $600m a year, with more than $500m representing export earnings. The Sugar Research Institute is a body through which the industry funds research. This Institute is financed by a voluntary levy on the tonnage of cane crushed by every sugar mill in Queensland. This contribution to research funds attracts a grant from the Australian Government, through the CSIRO, of $1 for every $2 contributed by the industry, up to a limiting contribution from CSIRO of $400,000. The sugar milling industry has found this general basis of Australian governmental support for effective research important and satisfactory. It is stimulating but self-regulatory. The 1976-77 budget for Sugar Research Ltd, which is the registered device through which these funds are channelled, represents an expenditure of approximately $1.6m directed towards sugar milling research. </para>
        <para>It is fair to question the extent to which research expenditure should relate to the value of a particular industry's level of production. The Industries Assistance Commission's report on financing rural industry drew attention to this consideration. That report pointed out that, in contrast to the relatively slow rate of growth of the rural sector, rural research has expanded at a much more rapid and continuing rate from the low base level of 1939-40. An examination of growth in staff numbers and cost per scientist shows approximately a SO-fold increase in research costs over 30 years, compared with an eight-fold increase in the gross value of agricultural production over the same period. Expressed in terms of the ratio of research cost to rural product value, the upward trend, however, is remarkably steady. It increased from approximately 0.2 per cent in 1939-40 to approximately 1.6 per cent in 1969-70. </para>
        <para>It is pertinent, therefore, that the Government and those who are charged with the responsibility of administering properly the nation's resources should ensure that research is responsibly relevant to the industry's requirement for that research. That, of course, is the dilemma that confronts those who are funding research. A peculiar characteristic of research is that its value cannot be measured in quantum terms until the research is substantially advanced and in some cases completed. The alternative to not funding this speculative exercise is to do nothing. Clearly, if research had not been a continuing involvement both of governments and of the industries themselves, not only Australia's rural industries but also Australia's manufacturing and secondary industries would be less well served in terms of capacity. So, the essence of the CSIRO 's efforts as they relate to the sugar industry are well received by that industry. There would be considerable regret if, for one reason or another, following the reports that are before the Government, it was found necessary to intrude at all into an arrangement that is working exceedingly well. </para>
        <para>As I mentioned earlier, the Department of Science is charged in the first instance with some of the less dramatic activities of government; but these activities are purposeful and productive. </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member for Darling Downs says, the Department of Science is hard working. Perhaps it sets an admirable example for many other Australians who are not imbued with the same spirit. But, whether the Department's activities are directed towards the ice shelf in the Antarctic, to pasture research in the far north, to beef research at Belmont near Rockhampton or to any of the other numerous activities, it is an effort directed towards making Australia more productive and, as a consequence, a securer place in which Australians may enjoy the standard of living to which they may have become accustomed and from which they can expect an even greater bounty in the future. </para>

          <para>- The estimates under discussion are for the Postal and Telecommunications Department. I draw the attention of honourable members to one very important factor; that is, that the Committee has just disposed of the estimates for the Department of Science and during the Committee's discussion the Minister representing the Minister for Science in this chamber was nowhere to be seen. We have now moved on to the estimates for the Post and Telecommunications Department and once again the Minister responsible, in this case the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson),</inline> is nowhere to be seen. Likewise, last week when we dealt with the estimates for the Department of Transport, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> was missing. The Postal and Telecommunications Department, comprising Telecom Australia, Australia Post and a number of other bodies, is one of the largest employers of labour in Australia. It covers the television and broadcasting media of this country. Yet the Minister for Post and Telecommunications is conspicuous by his absence from the chamber. I think that indicates the Government's whole attitude towards this Parliament, as we have seen from the way in which the Government has treated it over the years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Telecom Australia employs 88,000 people and Australia Post employs 32,000 people. That makes them the largest employers of labour. Billions of dollars are invested in the capitalisation of the industry. So these estimates are important. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications has now joined us in the debate. I am concerned about the manner in which a number of matters have been brought before the Parliament. On 22 September, on two hours notice, which is the standing agreement, the Opposition was presented with a paper concerning a domestic satellite system for broadcasting and telecommunications. In my comments on that occasion I drew attention to the fact that when the Australian Labor Party was in government between 1972 and 1975 the Postmaster-General, as he was then called, was commissioned to report on a domestic satellite system. Obviously that report, together with the later report from Australian Consolidated Press, is in the hands of the Minister. On 22 September I asked that the reports be made available so that Opposition members who were interested would have the opportunity of perusing them and taking advice on them. About a fortnight ago I asked whether the Minister would table the reports. To this date no reports have been tabled and so honourable members in this place have not had the opportunity to study them. </para>
        <para>We are not talking about a satellite costing some minimal amount. According to the advice I have received, it could cost something like $140m. It is a major item of expenditure for the Minister's Department I feel that the Minister is handling this Parliament in a very casual way in not bringing these facts and figures to the attention of honourable members so that all of us can have the opportunity to study them. It is pretty obvious that the new Government after December of this year will be in a position to study them. I hope that the new Minister will at least show the courtesy to the Parliament of reverting back to open government and of making facts and figures available to the members of the Opposition. As I mentioned, we are talking about the largest employer of labour in Australia. I am concerned about the way in which the Government is continuously bringing that industry to the verge of disruption. </para>

            <para>-We set up the commissions. That is perfectly true and we do not withdraw from it for one second. All we set out to do was set up what has proved to be a more efficient method of handling postal and telecommunications matters. What concerns me is the obvious Government intrusion into the industry which is continually on the verge of industrial action brought about by unnecessary, provocative action. The Government decided to take the preliminary steps of bringing in improvements and of expanding and modernising the telecommunications system. We on this side of the chamber supported those moves. I indicated that on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. But what concerns me is that the men in the industry have imposed work bans and limitations because they cannot reach understanding with the Minister or the Australian Telecommunications Commission. I am not blaming the Commission because I think it is deliberate Government action, as we saw in the case of the State Electricity Commission workers strike in Victoria in which that State was brought to the point of collapse because this Government wanted an election on the issue of industrial problems. </para>

He is afraid of the facts. I was saying that the Opposition is concerned about the industrial problems that exist today in the Minister's Department which have been brought about and provoked because the Government desires to have an election on the issue of industrial problems throughout the country. I ask the Minister to review this question. The Opposition supports the introduction of a new system of telephones and everything that goes with it. We support it because we believe that in the long term the country will benefit by it. But we ask the Minister at least to ensure that there is enough sense and enough reason in the system so that men will not be afraid of losing their jobs. That is what causes industrial troubles. Men are afraid of where they will finish up as a result of modernisation. That is why they strike and why they impose work bans. They are looking for security, and that is what most workers look for. </para>

That city has one of the highest levels of unemployment, and that has been caused by this Liberal-National Country Party Government. We want to make sure that the provocation that is taking place at present of the people who work at the Redfern Mail Exchange is minimised. The Government should reach some basis of understanding with these people, because once again their concern is for the security of their position and their future. They do not want to finish up on the dole, being accused of being dole bludgers when all they want is work. So we look to the Government to do something in these three areas to bring about development with industrial peace and harmony, not the trouble caused by the Minister, in response to provocative questions directed to him, giving provocative answers which stirs the men up rather than settling them down. This action has been taken deliberately to cause trouble in the trade union movement. No other workers come in contact with John Citizen more than do the people who deliver the mail, make telephone calls and send telegrams. </para>

          <para>- I would like to raise a number of points in speaking to the estimates for the Postal and Telecommunications Department. The first one concerns a new form of communications that was legalised just a few months ago. I refer, of course, to citizen band radio. Obviously citizen band radio is one of the greatest potential forms of communication for every member of our community. What, in fact, has happened with citizen band radio? We have unleashed a monster on the community. I do not say that lightly. Being a member of the Government's communications committee and having an obvious interest in communications, I invested in a citzen band radio some six weeks ago. I might mention that I applied for a licence some six weeks ago and I am still waiting for that licence. The purpose of the investment was, firstly, to listen to citizen band radio to find out exactly what was going on because a number of complaints had come through and, secondly, because I intend to use citizen band radio as a means of communication with the people in my electorate. It is obviously a wonderful form of communication and a wonderful point of contact for people who want to contact one in a hurry. If somebody- I believe this situation would exist in any city in Australia- had to listen to citizen band radio, I think they would be quite shocked with what they would hear. The language is unbelievable. In fact, if one listens to the youthful voices that are heard on the air on citizen band radio, there may be some real need to rename it children's band radio. It would seem to me that the vast majority of those who are using that particular medium at the moment are children. If one wants to spend a most - </para>

            <para>- A lot of them do behave like children but there are, in fact, many young children on the air. I invite any honourable member to come to Brisbane to my electorate on a sunny Sunday afternoon and listen to the Black Python having a yarn to Tinker Bell. It is the most amazing conversation one will ever hear. The standard topic of conversation, apart from the type of rig that is being used by the particular operator, seems to be about pop records or trips to the Gold Coast. Obviously, that is not really what the potential for citizen band radio is all about. More than that, it has already come to light at a number of court hearings that citizen band radio has been used for the peddling of drugs. There was a front page article in the <inline font-style="italic">Gold Coast Bulletin</inline> just a couple of days ago which alleged that citizen band radio was being used in the prostitution and massage parlour rackets on the Gold Coast. This undesirable element certainly seems to be very deeply involved in CB radio. The honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chapman)</inline> said that a lot of the people who are on the air with citizen band radio sound like children. In fact, they are. A definite element on the air have no idea of the proper use of the medium or the potential of the medium. That worries me too. The language that is used on the air is frankly quite unbelievable. I am not quite sure just which way we should go to overcome the problem. There have been numbers of complaints to me that inspectors of the Department are overworked, that the Department is understaffed and that there are not enough staff to handle the situation as it exists at the moment. Already it would seem to me that citizen band radio is so deeply ingrained into the community at this stage that it will be very hard indeed to overcome the problem. Perhaps we should be looking at a situation where it does become children's band radio, where we take away the old crystal sets and the two tin cans tied together on a piece of wire and give them these new electronic devices which, of course, are reasonably cheap to purchase and reasonably cheap to operate. </para>

        <para>One would hope, with the advent of UHF next year, that this will make somewhat of a difference to the operation. One would hope also that the serious operators would look to the new type of set that will be coming onto the market, I understand in February, and use it seriously. Perhaps the present system and the present bands being used will have to be thrown away altogether to be used by the children and the ratbag element in our community. </para>

            <para>- A lot of people cannot change because, obviously, they cannot afford to change at this stage. Perhaps the five year period that was introduced was too long. Perhaps we should be looking at a two year introduction or a three year introduction period instead. I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> to look at the possibility of appointing more inspectors into that particular area of his Department's operations because it is a problem and one that will be with us for a long time. Frankly, unless we have more inspectors, I am not quite sure how the problem will be overcome. </para>

            <para>- This is another area. I understand that in Brisbane at the moment there are some five complaints daily about interference of CB radio with television sets. I understand in central Queensland there is interference from CB sets to the 2-way ambulance radio system. It is potentially a very great worry. The second point I would like to mention tonight is the situation confronting country radio stations in Australia. We have been hearing of some quite exceptional profits being made by certain television and radio stations throughout Australia but this is certainly not the case in a number of country centres in all States of the Commonwealth. At the moment there are 20 country radio stations which are not operating profitably. A number of those stations would quite willingly hand back their licences, I believe. With the advent of the Special Broadcasting Service and with other pressures that are occurring in these particular country areas, it would seem that their operations will not become very much easier. One of the points that is continually raised to me by various country stations and members of the Federation of Commercial Radio Broadcasters is the fact that the landline charges, which were increased quite dramatically two or three years ago, have stifled the dissemination of local information, of news and of other services to country people. That worries me. I understand there has been quite a deal of curtailing of news bulletins fed from capital city stations to the far flung areas of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I think that we should remember that these country radio stations are primarily a service vehicle for those areas. The Australian Broadcasting Commission provides a very fine service to the outback areas but the ABC tends to operate on a network basis to a very great degree. It tends not to provide the local news and the local knowledge that people want. It is very sad, I think, if a country radio station cannot provide coverage of local sporting events in a neighbouring town. It is very sad if it cannot provide coverage of the country shows. This is certainly a problem which is facing the nation at the moment The honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fisher)</inline> was talking to me earlier this evening. I know he has a very real problem in his area and he has expressed a lot of concern in this regard in the last few weeks. The problem is that the permanent landline stations on regular relays overcome their cost factors reasonably well. It would seem that it is the part-time permanent landlines that are the most expensive and these are the lines that may be up five times a day between a capital city and a country station to provide those news relays. I understand that the charges are based on trunk telephone line costs over the same period but even that is an exceptionally high cost when one considers that a lot of these stations are not operating profitably. One certainly can understand Telecom saying: 'If we give concessions in this area, we will open up the flood gates'. I think we must weigh up whether or not we want to be able to provide the people of the country with local radio services, with local news, local coverage of sporting events and those things which bring a little bit of comfort and information into often lonely lives in those particular areas. </para>
        <para>Finally, in mentioning landline charges, there have been a number of complaints lodged with me from the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade. It, too, is facing exceptionally big charges with its landline costs. In my electorate of Bowman there is one small ambulance brigade which has an annual cost of some $420. That may not sound too much over a yearly period but when one considers that the ambulance is financed to a very great degree by private donations, it certainly adds up and it certainly adds up in those small country communities. Honourable members know that Telecom is an independent statutory body but I think there would be some very great advantages if the Minister was prepared to approach that corporation and ask whether there could be some investigation into providing some concessions, at least for the ambulance, which after all, provides a humanitarian service and, most especially, some consideration of the people in our far flung remote country areas in providing a cheaper system of landline charges so that they will not be deprived of the news, the sporting events and the general interest items that until now have been broadcast and appreciated in those country areas. </para>

          <para>-I must agree with the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> in regard to citizen band radio. Its indiscriminate use is reaching quite chaotic proportions. I have received many complaints and petitions in my office. I have sent them to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson).</inline> I might mention that they have been with him for some considerable time and I sent reminder letters only last week because I have not received any replies to them. I suggest to the Minister that he look at this matter because, frankly, it is reaching chaotic proportions. Citizen band radio is a plaything today. It is a thing which parents give to their children and they have the time of their lives with it. I have no doubt that I would have loved one myself when I was a kid. But, after all, the basic use of citizen band radio is for such things as safety. What is decided today by the Minister in regard to CB radio could result in a loss of life. Citizen band radio is essential for safety purposes in regard to boats and so on. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The main matter about which I wish to speak tonight is the proposal to issue a radio licence for the western suburbs of Sydney. I have referred to this matter before. As the Minister knows, I have referred to it as a scandal. I have made the point that on two occasions he has circumvented decisions of a judicial authority. In the first instance, he circumvented a decision of the High Court of Australia. He knew that the decision of the Broadcasting Control Board had been challenged before the High Court; that is to say, a writ had been issued to restrain the Minister from acting on the recommendation of the Board. He knew that it was to go to court on 1 5 March. Accordingly, on 10 March he cancelled the decision of the Board because he knew from legal advice that he had received that the High Court would not uphold the writ for an injunction which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cottee</inline> had taken out. The Minister made that decision. </para>
        <para>Later, of course, there was the inquiry into whether radio station 2KA could move its aerial further down the mountain, increase its power and so fan out over the western suburbs. That matter went to the Broadcasting Tribunal. Virtually on the day the inquiry started the Minister announced to the Tribunal that he had decided to call for fresh applications for a radio licence for the western suburbs of Sydney, thereby once again indicating to the Tribunal that a licence was to be issued. In other words, he was indicating to the Tribunal by direct inference that it should not grant the application made by 2KA. That is another example of deliberate circumvention of a decision of a judicial authority. And at whose behest? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Cottee, of Cottees drinks fame, is a very prominent member of the Liberal Party, has direct access to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and works directly through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> He has direct access to the Prime Minister, and he does his day to day dealings with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who is sitting at the table, is merely a pawn in the game, the messenger boy who is doing the bidding of the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> It is well known throughout the industry that the licence has been promised to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cottee.</inline></para>
        <para>The Minister is well aware of this and without a doubt it is a scandal. There is no doubt that it is a deliberate attempt by the Liberal Party of Australia to get direct control of a radio licence in this country- in the western suburbs of Sydney. That is the whole of the motivation behind everything that is being done. As I have said, the Minister is only a pawn in the game. He has been told- so it is stated throughout the industry- by the Prime Minister that Cottee is to get the licence. Cottee 's main contact day by day is through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who is a former general secretary of the Liberal Party. Of course, the Minister is said to be going to do his bidding. </para>
        <para>Let us have a look at what has happened. On 10 September there was an advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper calling for fresh applications for a licence for the western surburbs of Sydney and stating that the radio station should be sited, if I recollect the words, at or in the proximity of Blacktown. The advertisement statedkeep in mind that it was put in an obscure section of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper and was not advertised generally- that applications would close on 7 November. Fortunately, there were a few people who had their eyes opened. My wife happened to spot the advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian.</inline> It also was announced that the inquiry was to take place on 22 November. I repeat: The advertisement appeared on 10 September; applications close on 7 November and the inquiry starts on 22 November. It is stated that this is going to be the fastest inquiry of all time and that the Government is not going to allow legal representation at the inquiry. One of the motives is that the Government hopes to get the recommendation of the Broadcasting Tribunal through before the election so that the Minister can grant the licence. If it is correct, as the stories which are circulating in the industry indicate, that he will not allow legal representation on the excuse that there is a good deal of cost involved in legal representation, it will mean that some of the applicants for the licence will not be properly represented. An inquiry of this nature is a judicial inquiry. It is a highly complicated matter. It is a matter which requires trained minds to put a case. If there is to be no legal representation it will be a complete disgrace. </para>
        <para>I say that the Minister has been dodging this issue. He has not been prepared to reply to the statements I have made in the past. For example, he has refused to table the papers. I call upon him again tonight to table all the papers relating to this whole matter of a licence for the western suburbs of Sydney and the papers relating to the application for a licence for the north-western suburbs of Sydney. I call upon the Minister particularly to table the minutes of the last meeting of the Broadcasting Control Board. They win show just what a scandal this whole matter is and the nefarious activities of the Minister himself in regard to it. I call upon the Minister quite firmly to hold an open and public inquiry into this whole matter, so that all the facts can be revealed, and particularly to take action before that inquiry to table those papers and particularly the minutes of the last meeting of the Broadcasting Control Board before he got rid of it. I believe that a very interesting story is to be found in those papers. </para>
        <para>I repeat that this whole matter is a scandal bordering on corruption. It is time the Minister, instead of endeavouring to duck the issue, refusing to reply to statements that are made, refusing to give adequate reasons for cancelling the recommendations of the former Broadcasting Control Board and then later calling for fresh applications, answered all of these things. I believe that he must be quite frank about it. The facts are that it is right through the industry that he has promised the licence to Harold Cottee, who is a prominent member of the Liberal Party, who has direct access to the Prime Minister, who is dealing directly day by day with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick-</inline> a Minister in this Government and a former general secretary of the Liberal Party. The Minister himself is only a pawn in the game. </para>

            <para>-As honourable members will recall, and as my colleague says, the Labor Party put up the telephone charges. One of the problems facing industries in country areas is the extremely high cost of telephone services. The high cost results for the simple reason that a business in a country or regional area to make contact with a metropolitan area must use the subscriber trunk dialling system or make a trunk line call. These calls attract a charge at a much higher rate than the standard urban charge of 9c a call of unlimited duration. The Government Members Committee on Communications and Administrative Services of which I am a member has requested on a number of occasions that Telecom Australia provide it with information as to the costs involved and the revenue which would be raised through the introduction of a system- not the STD system- by which subscribers were charged on a time consumed basis for each telephone call. After all, at present, the STD system works against country people only. A person in business in the metropolitan area who makes telephone calls within that area faces lower charges for those telephone calls than does a businessman in a country area who makes calls to a metropolitan area. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I dare say that any honourable member representing a rural electorate would be able to quote information on telephone costs that must be met by a number of companies in his electorate. A company with 100 employees is quite a reasonably sized business to have in one's area. Such a company pays from $50,000 to $70,000 a year in telephone charges. This is a tremendous burden. One of the worst features of these costs is that such a high level of charges is a great deterrent to people setting up business in country areas. That Committee has asked for information. We have not received that information that we require. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson),</inline> who is at the table, will no doubt as he always does quote what I say and make sure that his Department provides our Committee with the information that it seeks. </para>
        <para>It is our firm conviction that there is a basis for charging a standard telephone call rate throughout the country on the basis of time consumed. Let us not get carried away with this idea. People who live in towns and cities in the country are charged 9c for each local call. They, together with metropolitan citizens, would be charged on a time basis under the system proposed. I know that the Minister and all his friends, when they ring their friends and talk for hours, are charged the standard fee of 9c for each call. But we in the country areas must dial STD for many such calls. This costs us a fortune. Let us take the case of members of Parliament. If there were a standard charge for each telephone call, the cost to the Government of our use of telephone services would be cut. We need a system by which telephone calls are charged for on a duration basis. It is about time that the Minister's Department decided to have a serious look at this matter instead of coming back with the constant old answers that it always gives, as it did under Labor. In fact, I do not know that it did this under Labor; under Labor it did nothing. It says to us: 'If you have a standard telephone charge for each call on a time used basis, what you will do is push up the cost of each local call in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Surfers Paradise to 50c or 60c a call'. That is a lot of rot. We are talking about introducing a new system for charging so that everybody pays a penalty if he or she talks too long. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that there are people who talk too long- </para>

            <para>-It is not quite time yet, Charlie. I will keep going. This, quite seriously, is a matter for grave concern. The introduction of this system by the Government would show that it really supported the rural sector-not only the farmers and the many rural business people but also those industries which are trying to set up business outside metropolitan areas. We are trying to provide them with a service which will encourage them to leave the smog-ridden cities and come out to the fresh country air where plenty of good labour which does not go on strike all the time is available. Businesses will not move to country areas because telephone charges are so great. Out of all expenses, telephone charges are the greatest deterrent to industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Some people in country areas have decided that they make use of telex facilities. This is all very well, but Telecom, not to be deterred or defeated, has imposed such a high rental that it is impossible for an average business to introduce a telex service. I suggest to the Minister that, if his Department provides telex services free of charge, industries in the country will use them and will be able to increase their business, increase employment and increase service to the general area. If the Department cannot see its way clear to provide telex services free of charge, what about a lower rate of rental? The Government should have a serious look at this matter. By taking action, the Government will show that it is prepared to do something for the rural sector. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> has brought in a decentralisation scheme. Let us see the Minister for Post and Telecommunications join in this thrust and make his contribution to decentralisation. Let us see the Minister take some positive action. We know that he is capable of it. We know that he will override his Department. We know that he will stand up and be counted in the Cabinet room. We know that he will say to Ministers in that little sanctum: Gentleman, we need standard telephone charges'. We know that the Minister will take this action. We know that he is out to support the development of rural areas in this country. </para>
        <para>I will mention quickly one other matter in the couple of minutes that I have left. I know that the Minister is determined to protect private enterprise. That is a policy of this Government. </para>
        <para class="block">In pursuing that policy, I know that the Minister will insist that television station BCV8 at Bendigo will get a translator station at Seymour. The television station is prepared to buy the translator. It will not cost this Government one red cent. But no! The Department is saying: 'Let us have a look at it. Let us see whether we can push it towards metropolitan Melbourne'. We do not want Melbourne stations broadcasting in Seymour. In such a case, we would get programs from only one channel whereas BCV8 shows programs from the whole range shown on Melbourne commercial channels. It provides the best possible choice. If the Minister intends to show some sympathy towards country industries and to give some protection to the country television stations, he will support the Seymour translator station. One of my friends from the National Country Party has said that he will try to do something for rural Queensland also. But I emphasise the need for the Seymour translator station. I thank you very much. </para>

            <para>-No, I think for the moment I will barrack with the side supported by the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier).</inline> The Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> really must do all those things suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo. I completely support the statement that has just been made. The only problem is that the Liberal and National Country parties have been the Government of this country for 25 of the last 28 years. They should not talk as if all of these problems are due solely to the three short interrupted years of Labor Government. If honourable members opposite have a grizzle it is against their own Government. What we did do while we were in power- I will now side with the Minister- was to stop the confusion which surrounded the Post Office and its various functions. The community generally thought that it was a most incompetent organisation losing a lot of money. The result of the Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Post Office and the moves to create separate authorities for postal and telecommunications services was to show what really is the cost of these services to the community. It has been shown that a lot of the apparent loss was due not to the inefficiency of the Post Office, as it was, but was in fact due to the hidden subsidies that the Government of the day insisted that the Post Office carry and provide to the community. When the Post Office was unable to show a profit the cry went up: 'How inefficient. Turn it over to private enterprise'. All the Labor Government did was establish a technique whereby one could see where the subsidies were going and how much they cost the community. If the Government of the day then decided that those subsidies should continue, let them continue. Let the Government give the Post Office or the Telecommunications Commission a specific grant to cover the needs of, say, country areas. We do not object to that. Now the ball is in your court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Minister,</inline> and it is for you to decide what you want to do with it. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I want to make a couple of comments. I make a slightly sad observation on the fact that when I was Minister I was accused, I think, of being like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Goebbels.</inline> The claim being made by the Liberals was based on the ground that I was behind a massive multi-million dollar enterprise to hoodwink the Australian community. I have added up the sums of money allocated to the various functions which used to come within the Department of the Media. The same tasks presumably are being carried out but they have been dispersed to at least two departments. The sum total of their expenses is exactly the same as when I was Minister. I am sorry that the Minister now, presumably, can be called the <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Goebbels</inline> of the Liberal Party because he has continued the same outrageous behaviour. But of course, that is sheer nonsense. I was doing no more than continuing functions that had been going on for 23 years before we took over government. The present Minister is continuing those functions now that this Government has taken over. My only regret is that expenditure has not been increased enough in some areas to maintain the services that the community obviously requires. </para>
        <para>I should like to concentrate on expenditure for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In real terms, despite all the juggling, there has probably been a reduction of a considerable sum. In monetary terms, it is a reduction of 3 per cent but if one takes into account the effects of inflation it is probably even more than that. The trouble is that we expect a lot from the ABC. The shortage of funds means that it is unable to make programs- programs which will employ Australian talent. The ABC does make some programs but nowhere near as many as it could if it had more funds. The ABC's reputation is very high in the field of Australian-made programs. When the ABC has to buy films as it does because Australia does not produce enough, the ABC is at a distinct disadvantage compared with the commercial stations, which are all making larger profits than they have ever made and can afford to pay much more for their films. So, of course, the poor old ABC has to buy what are generally considered to be inferior films to be used in competition with the commercial stations. The only way this can be overcome is by allocating more funds to the ABC. </para>
        <para>Another area of difficulty experienced by the ABC is that it is expected to provide services in areas where the commercial stations will not gomainly country areas- simply because the potential audience is too low to ensure any worthwhile commercial return in advertising revenue for the commercial operators. I am not blaming them. They are in the business to make money and to provide a service to the best of their ability. I am not quibbling about that. But one has to acknowledge in a country like this that there are areas where commercial operators cannot function and where the ABC is expected to function. Of course, that costs a lot of money. But then we hear people whinge and say: 'Look how much the ABC costs for such a small audience'. That is a false argument because if we allowed the ABC to compete with the commercial stations two things would happen, the first of which, I would like to suggest, is that the ABC would be very successful. This has been shown by the talk-back programs conducted by the radio station 2JJ. I will come to the axing of the Terry Lane talkback radio program in a moment. It was one of the most popular programs on the air at the time it was axed. In fact, it was the most popular show. </para>
        <para>Whenever the ABC is given the opportunity to compete it is able to compete very effectively with the commercial stations, but the trouble is that the commercial stations protest about the ABC's success. They say that it is their job to provide for the popular taste and it is the job of the ABC to cater for minority interests. I do not necessarily disagree with that. But let us at least be fair and not criticise the ABC when it puts on a program which clearly is for a minority tastesomething that the community expects it to do. Do not let us then say: 'The ABC has a rating of 2 per cent. How outrageous to have spent so much money on a program that has so little popular appeal'. The truth is that if we want a proper assessment and a proper comparison, we must look at the matter in perspective. The popular radio and television channels are appealing to a potential audience of perhaps 80 per cent or 90 per cent and they crow if they get a rating of 20 per cent. They are terribly successful. The ABC gets a rating of 2 per cent or 3 per cent. How about looking at the potential audience for that particular program? If one finds that the potential audience for that particular program in the community is only 4 per cent and the ABC is getting a rating of 2 per cent, in fact in its potential audience it is getting a rating of SO per cent. It is getting half its potential audience which is a damn sight more than most commercial stations ever achieve. </para>
        <para>Another problem is that the ABC has to cater for the minority interests. Our biological functions being what they are, our interests cannot be shown in straight lines but must be shown as a curve. Most people's interests are in the middle of the curve. There are interests at one end and at the other end. We expect the ABC to cater for those who like way out programs- for example, a lot of sport, very light entertainment and so on. I do not want to specify any particular program because I do not want to insult anyone. I simply am referring to a group in a minority area on one side of the spectrum. At the same time, we expect the ABC to cater for people on the other side of the spectrum, the people who like to listen to that sort of music that one hopes might break into tune at any moment but it never does- classical music. I hope I have made my point. The potential audience for that sort of program is totally different to the potential audience on the other side of the spectrum. The ABC cannot expect to cover the whole lot simultaneously. The answer is that if we genuinely want the ABC to provide for the whole range of interests we need more ABC channels than commercial channels because the interest range covered by the commercial interests is narrower. It is much more popular, I agree, but it is a much narrower field. The truth, of course, is that the minority interests suffer; the minority interests are deprived. I think the reaction to the axing of the Terry Lane program proves my point. After it happened, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> published a story headed 'Access Age'. Not one single caller out of 50 people who telephoned the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was in favour of the axing of the Terry Lane program. The others who rang protested against it. One of the remarks published by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The ABC <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr Norgard,</inline> is cutting his own throat, I hope! </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think he might be cutting his own throat. The irony of the situation is that the very people who are being insulted by this action by the ABC are the sort of people who are mainly interested, I would guess, in the Liberal Party. Sadly, the Government is insulting the very people who mainly support it. They are the people who want intellectual stimulation and not pulp. As one lady said in her letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> removal of that program means a return to the kitchen sink and soap operas for women. </para>

          <para>-In this debate on the estimates for the Postal and Telecommunications Department I wish to direct most of my remarks to the excessive telephone charges imposed on country people- as has been referred to by the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)-</inline> and the disincentives that these charges are having on growth and services in areas outside the metropolitan areas. Since coming to office, our Government and Telecom Australia have made several significant policy changes in both the telecommunications and postal fields that have been of benefit to rural subscribers. I could, of course, instance the free telephone line extension to an automatic exchange which has been increased from 8 kilometres to 12 kilometres. This has been a most significant advance and has assisted some 80 per cent of those people who are new subscribers by an amount of up to $1,280. It is a major initiative. I am sure that the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett)</inline> and the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sullivan)</inline> will have many people in their electorates, as I have, who still are being required to pay in excess of $4,000 and $5,000 simply to have a new telephone connection. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Last week we approved a recommendation from Telecom for reduced Sunday charges. There is spare capacity on Sundays, and while this measure will allow a saving to be made it will no doubt increase Telecom's revenue and will be of advantage to subscribers making only social calls. It does nothing to assist subscribers in industry, trade or commerce to reduce their costs and so improve their services. </para>
        <para>For many years now, since the time the Australian Labor Party Government reduced the 15 mile free telephone connection, I have been submitting to Telecom proposals aimed at reducing costs and providing some equality to country people. I wish to mention a few of these submissions and give to the Committee the reasons supplied by Telecom. I submitted that in the interests of decentralisation and the continued viability of non-urban areas, telephone charges, including the cost of calls, should be levied at a standard rate throughout Australia. This was the reply from Telecom: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If concessional tariffs are granted to country industry for the telephone or telex services, existing facilities, including telephone exchanges and underground cable, would have to be upgraded to cope with the additional traffic which would result. The existing telephone network is designed to accommodate a particular movement of traffic. Any substantial increase in the use of available lines could be met only by a costly program to increase the facilities which serve particular rural areas. It was estimated in 1976 that the introduction of uniform trunk telephone charges would, in order to maintain the same trading result as at present, require the charge for a three-minute trunk call of the order of $1.38 . . . It was also estimated that if uniform charging were introduced a local call and a three-minute trunk call would each have to be priced at 47c to achieve the same trading result as given by the present differential tariff structure. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">When that submission was rejected another was put to Telecom. It was that the radius for local telephone calls be extended to 100 kilometres and that all subscribers should have access to a local call charge to their main centres of commerce, or medical or education facility. I quote the reply that came from Telecom: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The provision of reduced telephone call charges between areas is not simply a matter of rearranging zone boundaries to meet any request. The boundaries of telephone zones and districts must be determined according to criteria applicable to the telephone system and must recognise switching and technical requirements. Consequently, any alteration to the existing arrangements would entail extensive restructuring of the telephone network at substantial cost to cater for the changed traffic patterns . . . Telecom Australia has considered sympathetically the case of rural subscribers who cannot call a large business centre for a local call ... If the radius for local calls was increased as suggested, in general terms calls over 30 kilometres would have to be subsidised by calls under 30 kilometres. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">As the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King)</inline> said, what the Government should be looking at and what Telecom should be looking at is a change in the system. Those replies from Telecom all say much the same thing- country people will continue to be charged excessive costs for what is supposed to be a national instrument of service and for something that promotes development in country areas. The reasons and excuses are based on either economic or technical reasons, and tonight I would like to examine this matter in greater depth with the aim of promoting a realistic and viable alternative to the current country subscriber tariff charges that can be considered and accepted by Telecom. </para>
        <para>Generally, the difficulties promoted by Telecom are, firstly, the unsuitability of a new tariff system from an engineering point of view; secondly, the cost of converting to any new system as funding comes from Telecom's profits; thirdly, the development of a system to operate throughout Australia and not only in designated areas; fourthly, the need to find political acceptability for any proposal and consensus throughout the nation; and, fifthly, any new system must maintain Telecom revenue. I now put to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson),</inline> his Department and Telecom that our telephone system should and can be converted to operate on a time- fee basis. Local call charging can be levied on a time factor and an additional charge made for any extension of calls. Research has been carried out which indicates that 97 per cent of all telephone calls are made in major metropolitan areas and that the average time of a business or professional call is six minutes. I therefore submit that a time-fee charging basis could be acceptable politically and financially. An additional levy for extended call times would not unreasonably vary the basic metropolitan rate. This system would add to efficiency in that telephones would not be engaged for lengthy periods and when they were so engaged there should be a valid reason; if not a penalty rate should apply, justifiably. I appreciate the support I am getting from other members of my party. I believe that metropolitan subscribers would appreciate having responsibility for effective use of the telephone. There would be penalties for calls of excessive time duration. This would also allow Telecom to adjust its subscriber fees. I sincerely hope that this will not be necessary but fee movements, whether they be up or down, could be adjusted by decreasing or increasing the time allowed for the call and not by the charge. </para>
        <para>Telecom has not accepted many proposals because there are technical difficulties or impossibilities in the technical area. I suggest that Telecom has the capacity to vary the time factor for calls. So far as country based subscribers are concerned, this would have the additional benefit of eliminating the unjust situation about calls that do not relate to distance but are currently levied on non-adjoining zones. This is an archaic and unreasonable system. For example, a call over some eight kilometres in one direction can be a trunk call while another call over 30 kilometres in another direction is a local call. In my electorate of Mallee some subscribers pay up to 90c a call simply to order a loaf of bread or essential items such as fuel, machinery parts or household needs. This is a scandal in a modern community. It is discriminatory and a major handicap to normal living. Currently metropolitan Melbourne users can telephone from Werribee to Frankston, a distance of some 70 kilometres, for a charge of 10c and without time limit. The system I have suggested would not vary the basic cost of telephone calls in metropolitan areas but would apply a penalty for lengthy calls. If this method is presented to the public in the correct manner I am certain it would be found to be agreeable. </para>
        <para>Country telephone accounts are now so excessive that the country operator is forced to use postal services more frequently. This is slower, ess convenient and more expensive if one takes into account the cost of additional staff salaries. So many governments in the past gave only lip service to decentralisation. This one example, of the cost of telephone calls, is a major deterrent to industrial expansion in the country. I am a member of the National Country Party and I live in a vast rural area, but this problem applies also to people in the growth centres of Geelong and Campbelltown. Those centres are not in the metropolitan call zones and they suffer similar disadvantages in costs and services. Businesses large and small will not tolerate this because they cannot remain viable when their communication costs are so high. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Chairman,</inline>if defence expenditure were to increase by one per cent in real terms this year it would have to increase by $ 100m more than has been proposed in this Budget. That is a simple, undeniable fact. If defence expenditure this year were to be as great as proposed in the White Paper of only 12 months ago it would be some $360m more than it is in this Budget. This means very simply that, by whatever measure one uses, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has been forced to make a major retreat from the position which he asserted so confidently in Opposition and nearly as firmly in his early day in government after 1 975. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I suppose, in mitigation, one could say that if Napoleon had his Waterloo, Cardigan his Crimea, Haig his Somme and Kitchener his Gallipoli, the Minister is entitled to his Nowra naval station fire and his White Paper on defence. He is in the gallery of the greats. We are really saying, of course, that now is the sobering up, the morning after, the extended Walpurgisnacht after the rhetoric that we have had on defence matters until fairly recently.  His  statement of 22 September is probably the most important that we have had on defence for some time. It indicates a dramatic departure from the guidelines which had been outlined so easily in Opposition and so generously committed to by the Government in 1976. The Government in fact has been forced to curtail enormously the commitments it optimistically made then. I want to rivet this discussion on defence more in terms of economic realities. A simple fact that often is lost sight of is that what we can spend on defence is regulated by a number of factors- the level of threat that we perceive or may perceive at the time or into the near future and, in terms of that, the resources which can be made available, bearing in mind that resources are limited. </para>
        <para>So I move from that to talk more specifically about the nature of some of the dismantling of the five-year defence program outlined in the White Paper for which the Minister was responsible and which he presented to this Parliament on 22 September this year. Honourable members will recall that the fighter replacement program has been deferred indefinitely; that the Macchi trainer replacement program has been scrapped; and that there was no mention at all of the Caribou transport replacement program. Presumably that, too, has been jettisoned into the limbo. Each of those programs and a number of others referred to in that statement on 22 September are important, for this reason: They make claims on our external account. When I followed the Minister on 22 September I mentioned that the extensive cuts to which he had referred were the product of economic circumstances as perceived by the Government and the result of the policies that it was applying. 1 did not have sufficient time to go into detail on the implications, in economic terms, of what the Government was doing. If the Government is cutting into programs which make demands on our external account, that has particular significance which is beyond the general nature of economic discussion in the community. </para>
        <para>Let me move to the next point which I want to make broadly in economic terms and relate it to what the Government has decided in its program covered by the defence review of September this year. Presently we are running what I think could be called fairly reasonably a chronic balance of payments deficit. It is obvious that this balance of payments deficit problem will be with us for some time. We must clearly understand that substantial borrowings overseas merely give us breathing space in which to get the domestic economy into order, in the hope that that balance of payments deficit problem can be eliminated. The nature of that balance of payments deficit problem is this: Following the devaluation of late last year exports have not picked up as much as the Government had hoped. It has been claimed fairly recently that in the latest quarter exports have responded to that devaluation. I express the greatest reservations about that claim. It is also said that imports have fallen as a result of that devaluation, according to the figures for the latest quarter. I deny completely that suggestion. The fall in demand for imports is a product very largely, if not exclusively, of the unintended accumulation of stocks which has occurred on a quite substantial basis in the Australian economy. So, it is not the conscious efforts of government economic policy that have brought about changes there. </para>
        <para>The next aspect at which we must look in our external account is the inflow of foreign capital. </para>

I make the point that I am establishing the case that the substantial cutbacks in defence expenditure outlined in the five year program- the White Paper, as it is calledare a result of the economic circumstances of the moment and, more especially, of the chronic balance of payments deficit which we are running at present. There can be nothing more particular or pertinent than that. I do not ask the Minister for Defence to understand economics. I sometimes ask him to understand defence. Occasionally he has been known to indicate some understanding of that topic. I suggest that on this occasion, so that the cognoscente will not be embarrassed, he sit down and remain silent. </para>

            <para>-It would take two days just to scratch the surface with you. The point I must make succinctly is that the balance of trade will not give us much by way of a surplus and capital inflow will be negligible. The Reserve Bank of Australia makes that clear. In spite of that, our net invisibles outflow is mounting enormously. On a monthly basis it has gone from less than $200m in the 1975 period to more than $300m now. What does that mean simply? It means a chronic balance of payments deficit problem throughout this year. Borrowings can only give us time to get breathing space and get the economy in order. Clearly this will proceed not for one year but for some time. Accordingly the Government has scrapped major components of its five-year defence program, especially those related to the import of capital equipment such as essential replacement aircraft for the Air Force and no doubt major capital items for the Navy and the Army. Those are casualties of the shortcomings of the Government's economic management. That is probably the most important issue at stake now in any discussion on economic management and flows over into considerations of all matters. </para>

          <para>- I support the proposed expenditure. The essential reason for this expenditure is an attempt by this nation to prepare for the worst. The sacrifices that we have made in the past in blood and treasure may have to be made again unless this nation adopts a policy of preparing for the worst. The worst does not always happen-only nearly always. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> should be commended for his frequent warnings to this Parliament that the democracies have never been properly ready to protect themselves. I know the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Minister personally believes this, and whilst he is reasonably satisfied with the expenditure, of course, being a Minister for Defence, he would like more. I have the feeling from the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> that the honourable member too would like more. I think that is the essence of what he was getting at. If that is what he was getting at, I commend him and I am sure the Minister does too. I am pleased to see that there is a rather happier frame of mind prevailing between the two of them now than there was before. </para>
        <para>The drastic curtailment of all government expenditure was a necessary part of the national economic recovery. We still have the main objectives to achieve, but some light has been obvious in the last couple of months. It is possible that in the future we may be able to do all of the things which the Minister has spoken about previously in a statement on defence and which, of course, are absolutely vital if we are to maintain any sort of preparedness. The stated objectives of the defence policy still exist and will be pursued. When there is no clearly perceived threat it is very difficult to determine what our immediate response to a perceived threat would be. There are several obvious difficulties for us in the immediate future. If I speculated about those I would probably get myself into trouble with the Department of Foreign Affairs, so I will not do that. I would prefer just to quote from the Minister's statement. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Our present peace-time strategy is to support as best we may over a range of policies the continuation of the presently favourable prospects for our national security; to maintain effective defence relations with our friends and allies, especially the United States and in our neighbouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient forceinbeing that demonstrates our military capability to deal with situations that could develop with shorter warning and to expand in time should the need for this arise during the longer term. </para>
          <para>In recent years, such contingency studies in our Department of Defence have focussed on the defence of Australia. </para>
          <para>As these studies progress, certain conclusions provide a broad basis for the development of strategic and operational concepts to deal with specific situations. But we are not going to produce a single, final answer to all our problems. The studies are manifold and involve continuing exploration of our defence problems in the light of strategic developments, changing technology and infrastructure, and changes over the years in the defence force itself. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">They are the basic concepts for which this expenditure is necessary. Something else is certain. We are not going to have the necessary population to defend this vast and rich continent. We have therefore to rely on machines rather than on men. The most efficient machines of defence are, of course, nuclear but we are presently excluded from having them for a number of reasons which I will not canvass. If all of our ambitions of exploitation and control of the 200-mile zone are to be fulfilled, we will need a range of equipment suitable for the extremities of the tropics and Antarctica. Presently we have no substantial equipment capable of serious work in the Antarctic. We must in the future spend very heavily on machines and technology. Defence science will be a most important part of future expenditure. </para>
        <para>There seems to be a clear public opinion that we should seize the initiative in exploiting and controlling the 200-mile economic zone. There is a demand in public opinion also for better surveillance of our existing coastal waters, particularly in the north-west of Western Australia. I think I may say that that has been attended to. I understand that three Grumman trackers based at Darwin are to attend better to the surveillance of this area in the future. Public opinion is a strange thing. Very often an opposing view cancels out another view. </para>
        <para>I think it is our basic duty in Parliament to inform and educate our people about our present position. We are a long way from great and powerful friends, we are underpopulated and we are also rich beyond dreams. All of this betokens a self-reliance in defence, which points to a selfreliant defence production. Actually we are worse off than we were in 1939. Imagine the problems of oil supply in any difficulty in the next few years. Would the seamen sail the tankers? We could not produce sufficient ammunition to respond quickly to any sort of crisis. The foreseeable contingencies that we face demand a defence response with lead times of eight to ten years. With our present productivity- there does not seem to be much dispute at the moment that it is low- those lead times run out to 12 to 14 years. Can we afford to keep living in a situation in which our foreseeable contingencies are based on an eight to ten year time lead? Because of our productivity and other circumstances, in reality we have a 12 to 14 year lead time. </para>
        <para>There is a more important and continuing problem which over many years both people and government have not helped. Prior to 1967-68 the proportion of Federal budgetary expenditure on defence was 17.1 per cent. In the 10 years from 1967-68 to 1977-78 the proportion was reduced to 8.8 per cent. That was a fantastic decrease. During the same period social spendingexpenditure on education, health and social security- nearly doubled. It increased from 25 per cent to 47 per cent of the total Budget. It is easy for each of us to blame the other. There has been a head in the sand, hedonistic attitude which I think is quite obvious to everybody on both sides of the chamber. This attitude has existed amongst our people and in this Parliament for a long time. I prefer to label it as bipartisan neglect, not bipartisan concern. All of us in this Parliament who owe allegiance to Australia's flag and a duty to its people have a basic obligation to rectify this situation before we have a serious crisis. This means an education program which we should keep up in the Parliament. It means an education program to acquaint our people with what must be done to make this country safe. </para>
        <para>It is essential that we do all we can for those Service men and women and their backups in defence science and all the other ancillary departments which are necessary to keep our forces in the field. We must give them encouragement, we must increase their morale and we must keep them in the Services. I see a notable ex-serviceman on the other side of the chamber who always interests himself in what I have to say. He would know that we may face a crisis within the next eight to 10 years, or even sooner, and that we must be prepared for it. That is precisely why this expenditure is so extensive and so necessary. </para>

The honourable member for Swan mentioned that we were rich beyond dreams. No one would ever believe that if they looked at budgetary situations and the way in which we are chiselling every deprived person in this country out of his just entitlements. I do not think it is valid to argue percentages in 1966 as compared with percentages in 1976. It is now a different country and a different economic environment. We are not necessarily getting better value simply because the percentage has gone up or down. We have to look at the reality on the ground. </para>

        <para>I should like to remind honourable members of the Labor Party's record on defence during its three years in office. It is part of the furphyism in the community arising out of the continual denigration of Labor's efforts by honourable members opposite to say that we neglected defence. The facts are that we had to finalise the reequipment of the Air Force with the FI 1 1. That was a difficult decision in view of various attitudes as to whether it was the best and most relevant aircraft. Many millions of dollars had been spent on defence and we finalised that re-equipment. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Construction may speak later rather than interject now. He is the Minister for interjections. The point is that we continued with the purchase of the Fill. We began the program of re-equipping the armed services with the leopard tank. I think we also went into the business of setting up the new destroyer program. We set out on a re-organisation of the defence system; something that was years overdue. It was a difficult matter to carry through and I pay a tribute to the defence services because they behaved much more creditably than did their colleagues in Canada on this matter. We also gave security to the Services personnel. The Minister can try to interject and talk as loudly as he likes. I am accustomed to people shouting at me. The honourable member for Swan talked about my notable ex-military record. I think it is a very ex-military record, but I have halted a thousand men on parade with the band playing, so the Minister is not going to talk me down. </para>

        <para>What is the Government's record in this instance? As a matter of fact the Government has made a continual political gimmick out of a national inferiority complex. Every election up until the last five or six years has been fought on Australia's incapacity to defend itself- on the hordes swirling down from the north while we are helpless. So we neglect all the elements of self-sufficiency in this country. I am one of those who hold the view that Australia can defend itself. It would take an extraordinary effort on the part of anybody, even the Americans or the Russians, to launch a successful attack upon this country. I am discounting the long range nuclear missile attacks because that is a different environment. I suppose if the chips were down and we had seven, eight or 10 years' notice of this sort of thing, as the honourable member for Swan mentioned, we could produce the missiles ourselves. But our manpower is not inconsiderable. We still talk about ourselves as if we were a tiny country, as if our population were equivalent to that of Israel or New Zealand. Fourteen million people is not an inconsiderable number. It gives us a mobilisation capacity, I should think, of somewhere between 1.5 million and two million people. We are one of the largest industrial countries-twelfth or fourteenth. Despite what has been done to national morale because of the national divisions created in politics in recent years by my friends opposite, Australia's national morale is basically high. We have a great administrative competence. We have an internal communications system which is very good. We have an infrastructure which involves airports and things like that and we have very great military experience. </para>
        <para>In the last five minutes available to me in this debate I want to mention two areas of neglect. One is in the defence industry and the other is in what I choose to call still the citizen forces. I shall take three examples. I pose the question: How self-sufficient ought Australia be in the defence industry? My own view is that we ought to be basically self-sufficient in all areas of need as far as the defence industry is concerned. We should neither trade in arms nor buy arms. That is simply a point of philosophy, I suppose, which might be regarded as Utopian in this troubled world. But I believe it is the sort of target we ought to set for ourselves. The fact is that over the last five or six years the electronics industry has almost been run out of business. We have come to the stage where very large areas of important manufacture are now extinct, so we buy it all in. We might be able to fly in a plane load of super-sophisticated equipment at some stage or other, but unless we maintain our manufacturing capacity and our design capacity we will not keep up the manpower necessary to maintain it, design it or refurbish it. In the present world context, in view of what I would call the eccentric, erratic and unreliable behaviour of America and the rest of the world as far as alliances are concerned, it is quite possible that we could well be on our own. So our electronics industry ought to be maintained not just for the purposes of employment in this country, which I regard as important, but because of its vital nature with regard to defence. I do not think we ought to under-rate the exceptional skills of the Australian scientists employed in this field. </para>
        <para>There is also the question of shipbuilding. There has been a continuing argument that if we build ships here they could cost, say, $50m whereas we could buy those ships from Japan for only $30m. Nobody has done any effective homework on what it would actually mean it we spent the money at home. I have some figures which I have extracted from an Industries Assistance Commission report which set out exactly how much of the money that is spent internally generates other activity. However, there is not enough time in this debate to expand on that point. But I believe it is essential that we maintain at least one major commercial shipyard and possibly two. </para>

        <para>Let me turn to the aircraft industry. We managed to sustain the industry over the years. Of course the Nomad program gave it another fillip but it, needs to be supported substantially by some major development of some sort. I recognise the difficulties. If we are to build up a tactical fighter force, can we, starting from scratch, design the aircraft and do all the other things necessary to build them? This brings us back to the point that my friend the honourable member for Oxley was making- the extraordinary economic cost involved in these matters. </para>
        <para>I wish to raise for the umpteenth time since I entered this Parliament the question of the citizen forces, now called the reserve forces. I think the word 'citizen' better suits the kind of context in which Australians have normally operated. We are in a new environment. We now have a highly skilled community in which enormous talents are lying around unused in the spare time of the young men and the young women of Australia. The education level is higher than when I was launched into the scene 40 years ago. That provides a resource which is not tapped. What we have to ask is: How much of our defence is actually military? For instance, how much of what the Royal Australian Air Force does is different from what Qantas Airways Limited, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia do? How much of their workshops and air control systems are different? How much of the resources that are available in the non-military services could be made available in that area? I was a little alarmed to see that the strength of the Reserve Forces had declined to such a low level. We have to find a totally new way to induce people to serve in those forces. It is not good enough for Saturday afternoons - </para>

          <para>-It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the estimates for the Department of Defence. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martyr)</inline> on an excellent speech outlining the broad strategic problems in defence which face us over the next few years. I would like to turn my attention to the Army Reserve to which the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> alluded in the latter part of his address. I would particularly like to stress the role that the Reserve plays at the moment, has played in the past and is likely to play in the future. The citizen soldier has a very long and distinguished history in this country, going back over some 100 years to 1860-64 when this country for the first time sent volunteers overseas, to fight in the Maori Wars in New Zealand. That record of service continued throughout the Sudan and Boer Wars, the two World Wars and a number of minor conflicts following the Second World War, right up until the recent conflict in Vietnam when a number of individual Reserve officers and noncommissioned officers served in the forces in Vietnam, including one of the members of this House, the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil),</inline> who served in Vietnam as a Citizen Military Forces officer. I believe that he will be following me later in this debate. </para>

            <para>- He is an officer and a very fine gentleman too, I might add. The honourable member for Wills alluded to the fact that one of the things that is often said about this country is that we have a small population. He stated in response that it is really not as small as it is often made out to be and that in fact we can mobilise a much larger force than is often contended. There is some truth in that, but at the same time it has to be kept in perspective. We have a population of only 14 million people. Even though it is not a minute population it is still only a medium sized population. On that basis we can only hope to maintain at any time a relatively limited standing Army. Because this population limitation means that we cannot maintain a very large regular force of either the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, obviously in our particular circumstance, as in countries such as Canada, the Reserve Forces are of great importance. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Reserve Forces are also significant from another point of view. In a liberal democracy such as ours- this is often overlooked- having a large and viable Reserve Force working in cooperation with the Regular Forces establishes an essential link, which is important in any democracy, between the Regular Forces and the Reserve Forces. Both have a lot to gain from that link and that co-operation. The Reserves have to gain from the Regulars knowledge in the way of expertise that the Regulars have built up over a period of time. At the same time, because of the more open situation that operates in the community, the Reserve is capable of passing on many new ideas from the community and also of providing many professional services that may exist in the community but which are not available often in the Regular services themselves. The significance of the Reserve and the importance of a link between the Reserve Forces and the Regular Forces were very clearly laid out in the report of the Millar Committee of Inquiry into the Citizen Military Forces in 1974. Let me quote from one section of the report which clearly underlines what I have been saying. On page 129 of the report the Committee stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That a Reserve of partly-trained army units and personnel is an essential component of the defence of Australia. </para>
          <para>That such a Reserve is only possible and effectual if the Government of the day, the community, the Regular Army and the Reserve believe it has a role which gives it present significance, which provides for effective action in the future, and which it is known the Government will implement if necessary. </para>
          <para>That any Reserve component must be prepared for total integration with the rest of the Army in the event of call-up for full-time duty, and that in peace both Regular and Reserve components should be treated and act as part of a single force. </para>
          <para>That the Reserve should be divided into operational units, logistic units and a training organisation, geared to provide both an effective operational force at short notice and also the basis for expansion over a longer term. </para>
          <para>That there should be an appropriate professional relationship between the designation and the size of Reserve organisations, and between rank and responsibility within them. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that the Millar report indicates very clearly the importance of the Reserve but at the same time it has to be recognised that the role of the Reserve has changed. In its report the Committee also alluded to that. It said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>But the world has changed in the nearly 30 years since the end of World War II, and the needs of defence have changed. Like so many other affairs in which we used to be amateurs- diplomacy, trade, some kinds of manufacturing, opera, tennis- we have had to become professionals, and we have developed a profession of arms. The place of the citizen soldier in the total context of this profession is different from what it was in the past, but it is still essential and honourable. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">As a result of recognising the fact that the Reserve had a different role to play in the sort of society and the sort of defence circumstances we have today, the Committee recommended a number of changes and made a number of recommendations to upgrade the organisation, administration and operating efficiency of the Reserve. It made some 29 recommendations. I am pleased to say that, due to the energy and dedication of the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> virtually all of those 29 recommendations made by the Millar Committee back in 1974 have either been implemented or are well on the way to being implemented. I think that it speaks highly of the way in which the present Minister for Defence has been performing his job in that portfolio that so much has been achieved in that period of time. It is a very commendable achievement. In that context one also has to recognise the important role played by the Government members foreign affairs and defence committee. </para>

            <para>- That is right. As I have said, most of those recommendations are on the way to being implemented, and the Minister is to be commended for that. In addition, I commend the initiative he has shown recently in setting up a new scheme to encourage employers to enlist their employees in the Reserve. He has established a committee to help to implement that program. The honourable member for Wills in speaking in this debate mentioned that there have been problems in recruitment for the Reserve- not so much recently in recruitment for the Regular Forces but there have been distinct problems in recruitment for the Reserve. It is to be hoped that the new initiative of the Minister to boost recruitment will bear fruit. I am sure that it will and I am sure that it will overcome some of the problems presently facing the Reserve. A lot of the steps that have been taken over the last couple of years have done a lot to boost the morale of the Reserve and it is now in a much better situation than it was a couple of years ago. However, a couple of areas still need to be looked at closely and acted on. For the sake of the Reserve and for the sake of the people in it, there has to be a very clear and detailed definition of the role of the Reserve because at the moment the only definition we have of the role of the Reserve is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>The purpose of the Army Reserve, as pan of the Australian Army, is to participate in the defence of Australia and its interests in times of war and defence emergency. </para>
          <para>The Reserve with the Regular Army is to provide the basis for expansion of the Australian Army. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>They are commendable words but they are very vague and rather general. For instance, one could well ask what the term 'expansion' means. Does it mean providing a nucleus of officers to be expanded in war time; or a nucleus of NCOs? Does it mean providing a nucleus of specialists or a nucleus of formed units which can be expanded in war time? I think that if we are to make further fains in the effective use of the Reserve, that area as to be much more clearly defined. The second area that must be defined more clearly is the way in which the five-year defence program will benefit the Reserve, particularly in those areas where the Reserve traditionally has been short of effective equipment such as the heavy equipment, artillery and armour areas. The extent to which that five-year defence program will benefit the Reserve specifically is not too clear at this stage. I am quite sure that once we have those two initiatives- a clear, precise and detailed statement of the role of the Reserve in the future and also a statement as to the way in which the five-year defence program will flow through the Reserve in the way of equipmentthe Reserve will be able to go on to further strengths and continue to play an integral part in the defence of this nation. </para>

            <para>- Apparently the Minister for Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> did not know anything about it. The sub-committee has been investigating the level of industrial back-up required from Australian industry for the Defence Force. As the honourable member for Wills said, evidently the Minister at the table did not know about it, although a report has been brought down in this Parliament. He should have read it, but evidently he did not. Evidently his own advisers did not even bother to let him know about it. The fact is that the interim report was brought down in this Parliament. It dealt with a number of scenarios which could happen in this country. The honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> will agree with that. The report works on the assumption contained in the defence White Paper, which is that Australia no longer can depend upon 'powerful friends' for protection. In fact, Australia is in the same position as the Minister's adopted country, South Africa. South Africa no longer can depend on powerful friends. </para>

        <para>I would like to deal with some aspects of the report. One section of the report dealing with the electronics industry still has to be presented to this Parliament. Naturally I will not disclose any specific references in that section, but I will speak about the electronics industry itself. First of all, I will deal with the shipbuilding industry. Quite frankly, to date the reception from the Government, particularly the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> has been anything but what was desired. The Committee's report- this is a report of the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence because the sub-committee's report has been adopted by the full Committee- has recommended the maintenance of two of the large shipbuilding yards in Australia, at Whyalla and Newcastle, based on their being economic propositions. </para>
        <para>The great problem for Australia, as far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned, is that there has been a world-wide recession in the large shipbuilding field and countries such as Korea and West Germany, which have been building large tankers, have gone into the production of smaller ships to keep their highly efficient yards going. They of course, are more efficient. Because there has been very little capital investment in the Australian shipbuilding industry for many years, countries such as Japan are able to produce ships more economically. What is required is what is happening todayin Malta- tiny little Malta with 300,000 people. It currently is establishing a new shipbuilding yard which will be able to build, if I remember correctly, ships of up to 1 10,000 tonnes. </para>

            <para>- It is a good achievement from 300,000 people. It will be a computerised and efficient industry. The future of this industry in this country rests purely on it being economic. We should not shore it up with false assistance. </para>

        <para>We should ensure, as is recommended by the Committee whose report has been tabled in this Parliament, that the industry is an efficient and economic industry, that the necessary capital investment is ploughed into it, that it becomes computerised in its activities and that in this way it can then compete on equal ground with overseas countries. It is anticipated that the recession in the large shipbuilding industry- the building of large tankers and so on- will end in the early 1980s. It is at that time that those countries that concentrate on smaller ships, particularly those up to 45,000 tonnes, will come into their own, subject to the industry being efficient and economically viable. For that reason I am concerned that the Prime Minister in his correspondence virtually wiped this matter off. I am deeply concerned that the reaction to date of the Minister for Defence has been virtually negative. For this reason I think the Government needs to have a very serious look at a very comprehensive report. Evidence was received in camera as well as publicly; as the honourable member for Wills mentioned, visits were made throughout the length and breadth of this country, to every shipbuilding yard; and opinions were received from throughout the country. The same applies in regard to the aircraft industry, and I have no doubt that if the honourable member for St George speaks in this debate he will have something to say about that. </para>
        <para>The report on the electronics industry has not been brought down as yet, but I would like to make some comments on the industry itself. Apparently it is now accepted by government, in accordance with the White Paper and in accordance with evidence received, that Australia no longer can depend necessarily on outside assistance. That is to say, we could be placed in a situation where some sort of conflagration arises and the United States, for example, may not wish to be involved. It may wish to be impartial. It may say: 'You are both friends. You are having a fight and we do not want to get involved '. If that is the case, we will find ourselves in a peculiarly difficult position because we are becoming less and less self-sufficient year by year so far as defence equipment is concerned. For example, it was stated by one company that Australia in 1939 had the capacity to produce 80 per cent of the electronics technology then available in the world. That is to say, in 1939 we had the technical ability to produce 80 per cent of the technology then available in the world. By 1973 - </para>

            <para>- We are not talking about tanks or motor cars. We are talking about electronic equipment. By 1973 that percentage had been reduced to 45 per cent. Today it is down to 25 per cent. That is a serious situation for a country which has always prided itself on its technical ability. The future of this country, with such a small population and such a vast area, lies in having great technological ability. That is the only future for Australia. For example, the job being done in the Weapons Research Establishment is magnificent. We should be making sure that the young scientists working there are given the same opportunities as the older scientists were given to go overseas and learn the technology of other countries, instead of having this ridiculous restriction which has been imposed upon travel. </para>

I am not a racing man, but I understand that Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Ltd built a computerised automatic totalisator for the Sydney racecourses, it was installed in May or June last year and it has broken down innumerable times. For two race meetings recently it could operate for only three of the races. That is an example of how our technical capacity in these fields has been reduced. The fact is that there is not an industry policy. We need to have a policy so that industry knows where it is going. We need a policy so that industry will be prepared to invest in the future. At present industry is not prepared to invest in the future because it does not know what its future is going to be. Governments of all colours must be prepared to bring down an industry policy so that those sections of industry in which we intend to intervene will be protected. </para>

          <para>-My purpose in joining the debate is perhaps to change its direction slightly. Much has been said about actual expenditure on defence items. In my opinion we have spent far too much time trying to relate defence to the expenditure of dollars and cents. I would like to spend a few minutes on what I believe to be the key weapon in war or in peace, that is, man- the serviceman or servicewoman, whether he be a Regular, a Reserve- Citizen Force- soldier or perhaps even the school cadet. In this regard I believe that this place has been remiss over many years in using the Services as no more than a political football. The serviceman has been seen as a vote rather than as the very key to the survival of this country in any future emergency. I believe that we have got to the point where we have denigrated the serviceman to the extent that he does not even appear on the streets of this country in uniform unless he is ordered to do so. That trend began, I believe, in the 1960s and it is quite obvious now. I believe honourable members have to go no further than across the waters of Lake Burley Griffin to the defence headquarters to see how few of the men are in uniform. It is up to this Parliament- both sides of this Parliament- to make moves to give back to the serviceman his position in society. After all, he serves in the noblest of professions. He is the one who when required will give the supreme sacrifice for his country. I think some of us have tended to forget that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Regulars unquestionably bear the brunt of the anti-Service feeling. Yet they have within their ranks the traditions which are valued by the total community. Some of those traditions, commencing with the uniform itself, should be displayed and should be seen. I think we should take steps to make certain that the very impressive Beating the Retreat ceremony is put on more often. It would cost nothing to have this ceremony performed and we would get great benefit from it. The only time I have seen servicemen of late has been in guards of honour for Her Majesty, a parade for Her Majesty and in some guards of honour for visiting dignitaries. On no other occasion have I seen them. Let us take the opportunity to get the serviceman out and give him the backing that he requires. Unless we do this the Defence Force itself will dwindle in importance and it will not be long before those responsible for expenditure on defence will start to question even whether we should put out any money at all for defence. That would be a very sad and sorry day. </para>
        <para>I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the Reserve Army- the citizen soldiers who are perhaps the most neglected part of our defence structure. They are neglected because they are seen as second best when in fact they are a vital part of our defence. I have heard trite words, alegedly of wisdom, come from a great variety of people talking about the one army we have in Australia. Unfortunately the truth is that we have neglected the Reserve Army- the citizen force. There is no explanation for this. There is no expenditure involved in giving a new set of priorities to the Regular forces. If we believe that there is no threat to this country in the short term, it is quite possible and feasible then that we should take the steps to say to the Regular Army that its priority now is to bring the Reserve up to its maximum efficiency. We should see that postings from the Regular Army to the Reserve are given priority. I believe that all officers should at some stage serve with the citizen force. There is too much of an elitest approach taken by the Regular services, but that approach will only be taken while we in this Parliament allow it to be taken. We have to lay down quite clear guidelines, in my opinion, to the Defence Force chiefs so that they know exactly what their role is in this regard so that they alter existing priorities. Up to this stage we have seen fit not to do so. I believe it is to the regret of all of us. Unless we do this the Reserve itself will not ever become an efficient force because it does not have the capacity from within to survive in a modern defence set-up. The expertise must come from the Regular Army. I press upon the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> that this cause is an urgent one and one we must face. The cadets are part of the expenditure under the Defence vote, but if honourable members were to watch the cadets today they would assume that we do not spend anything on them. </para>

            <para>-In speaking to the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department, may I say that it is sometimes alleged that laws fawn upon the rich and spurn the poor. As my very good friend, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Upper House, is wont to put it, for the administration of justice poverty is a crime and wealth is a virtue. To put it in another way, steal a loaf of bread, as the British were wont to say in the 19th century, and go to gaol. However, if you steal a railway you can be assured of a seat in the House of Lords. Regrettably, rarely, if ever, do rich men go to gaol. Gaols are full of people who have not got a cent. What greater proof of this is there than in our present laws relating to corporate crime and the treatment of what is termed white collar crime. </para>

              <para>-Let us look at that. The evidence to support this claim appears daily on the front pages of our newspapers. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> put it a brief period ago: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>Are all these, at worst, just a clutch of rotten apples- or is much of the business barrel rotten? The presumption is strong that these illegal practices are common. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is ironic to see the great hullabaloo raised in reaction to the current spate of bank holdups with some governments making all sorts of noises about getting tough with bandits. Yet they sit on their hands when confronted with what is at least as big a problem- corporate and white collar crime. Is it because those bandits wear white collars and may be the Government's political supporters? Of all the Medibank frauds involving doctors- amounts have totalled hundreds of thousands of dollars- to my knowledge only one doctor has been sent to gaol. Yet, a 21 -year-old cleaner from Darlinghurst was sentenced to 12 months gaol for defrauding the Department of Social Security of a little more than $1,100. This type of discrimination should not exist in our society. One wonders how true is the saying: 'You are guilty until proven rich'. Is the law at fault or is it that we take a different view of white collar criminals who fleece the public of millions of dollars each year with their only crime being to be caught? </para>
          <para>I remind the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> that corporate collapses over the last seven years have cost investors and lenders more than one billion dollars. Why is it that armed holdups can stimulate immediate action by governments while the thief with the pen rather than the pistol can continue his depredations? This question has important ramifications for the health of society. It breeds disrespect for law in general, and it emphasises social and economic divisions for white collar crooks to be seen to be getting away with fraudulent practices. The succession of acquittals of white collar crooks accused of wrongdoings completely negates any deterrent effect that the criminal provisions of our laws might have. In a recent case in Melbourne a married couple with a six-year old daughter were both sentenced to three months gaol for attempting to obtain a little over $31,000 from the tertiary education allowance scheme by making false claims. The magistrate said that he was embarrassed by the penalties that other magistrates had handed down to doctors on fraud charges. Cheating on Medibank, I suggest, is no less a crime than petty thieving or dole cheating. Surely doctors should have no special rights to exemption because of their social or professional status. </para>
          <para>The dismissal of charges against Alexander and Thomas Barton on 27 June this year for alleged breaches of the New South Wales Securities Industry Act and the Crimes Act vividly illustrates a problem which I have spoken about in this House on numerous occasions, namely, the problem of convicting corporate criminals. I raised that issue in 1973. The Bartons ought to have been indicted under the provisions of the taxation evasion legislation. I cannot get the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> to answer the question why proceedings have not been taken on those grounds. Again, it seems that corporate wrongdoers, with expensive lawyers as their hired guns, have been able to escape liability for their actions which have cost the ordinary investor millions of dollars. Defence lawyers usually ensure that cases of this nature are tried by jury. The jury more often than not is comprised of laymen and due to the complexity of the issues involved it is impossible for them to comprehend the legal technicalities. This is an anomaly, I suggest, in the law which must certainly be looked Unto if justice is to be carried out. </para>
          <para>In many cases, corporate criminals tend to be the most respectable and powerful men in the community. Many, of course, have titles, the right school tie and obviously the right connections. These people who should be setting an example of honesty for the rest of the community are instead often stealing the life savings of those less fortunate. I think we ought to appreciate, with all due respect to the honourable member for St George, the two special qualities applicable to corporate crime. Firstly, corporate criminals are sophisticated and deliberative businessmen who engage in crime only after carefully calculating the benefits and the costs. Secondly, as Professor of Law, Christopher Stone, has written in <inline font-style="italic">Where the Law Ends:</inline></para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. we have arranged things so that the people who call the shots do not have to bear the full risks; </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">If the likelihood of getting caught and the penalties for getting caught are sufficiently great,otential business law violators should be able to iterally calculate that crime does not pay. We fail in fact to do that. Looking at the question of inadequate laws, the previous Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> stressed that legislation envisaged would basically be the same as existing State legislation in the member States of the Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission. What does that mean? It means law by the lowest common denominator. By the time the six States get around to drafting laws, criminals will be about six steps ahead of them. Honourable members should look at the sympathetic attitude of conservative States. Consider the controversy in Victoria relating to the Victorian Government's Housing Commission land deals with Lensworth Finance. In less than a month $1.5m was taken from the public. One wonders whether the members of that Government collaborate with the crooks. I ask the honourable member for St George: Can he justify it? Can he apologise for it? Or would he be kind enough to explain it to me? Can we expect the usual dearth of convictions and the usual crop of knighthoods? That is what we can expect. </para>
          <para>I want to make these observations quickly. It is my belief that the current ramshackle company law system in Australia is structured to protect the criminal to the detriment of the honest. If the States had any semblance of political honesty they would retitle their Companies Acts and call them 'Company Directors Protection Acts'. How long will it be before this Government will grasp the nettle and introduce comprehensive national legislation to control public companies and the securities industry? It has a responsibility to the public as a whole to clean up this mess. This Government is very swift to bring in legislation to shackle the trade union movement, but it has a total reluctance to bring in legislation to straighten up corporate crime or white collar crime. I suppose it is because there are so many lawyers on the other side. It does not want a sense of nationality or rational and constructive legislation because this area represents a harvest for them. </para>
          <para>In terms of company and securities law, I believe that it is investment in the broad sense, both public and private, that has to be protected. Honourable members on the Government side believe that private investment is the life blood of prosperity in all countries. Until this Government sets down reasonable laws and regulations to control the stock exchange it will do nothing to induce investment in this area, which is so important. I conclude with one truism. My father was wont to say: 'You will find as you go through life, son, that there are plenty of sheriffs of Nottingham and few Robin Hoods. To the former you give knighthoods and the latter you hang'. </para>

            <para>- I would like to register, first of all, a protest at the fact that we are proceeding with the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department and not proceeding for much longer with the estimates for the Department of Defence. A number of issues are facing this country and in my view the most important is the security of the country from both internal and external threat. That we should have debated the estimates of the Department of Defence for so short a period is a serious indictment of the community's attitude, as reflected in this Parliament, towards the security of this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before I go on to deal with the topics that are relevant to these estimates I want to take this opportunity to say something about the legal aspects of one or two matters that are relevant to defence. I specifically confine myself to the estimates of the Attorney-General's Department. I want to refer, first of all, to the appropriation for the Law Reform Commission. In my view this Parliament should encourage the maximum amount of community comment upon the legal profession and upon its roles. The profession recently looked into two particular aspects of legislation or potential legislation that bears upon the defences of this country. Firstly, I refer to legislation that would enable the role of the Army Reserve in particular, and other reserve forces, to be determined clearly. There is a particular need for the Millar Committee report to be put into practical operation by means of legislation of this Commonwealth Parliament in order to ensure that the role of the Reserve is set out clearly, is determined and made specific in accordance with the recommendations of the Millar Committee. That requires legislation. I would expect that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> would be in the forefront in ensuring that a Bill is brought before this Parliament as soon as possible. </para>
          <para>The second matter I raise is the whole area of union activity as it relates to the Defence Force. I state quite clearly that I believe that the legislation in relation to defence emergencies that is presently on the statute book ought to be used in appropriate cases. I always have maintained that there is a right to strike and that that right should be maintained, but when essential defence requirements are perverted we should use the legislation instituted by a former Labor government, under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> to overcome problems that may be involved. </para>
          <para>Next, I believe that we should look at legislation that would introduce the equivalent of the American 'buy American' Act. This area requires legislation. It would be forward looking legislation. It would be almost revolutionary legislation in Australia. In my view it comes within the area of law reform. We should ask ourselves: How is the law to be best used in the furtherance of social objectives? One of our best social objectives is to encourage Australian industry. I believe that we must ensure that we achieve the strategic objectives necessary for Australia- that we are sufficient in food, that we are sufficient in energy, that we are sufficient in manufacturing resources. Legislation is necessary to ensure that we properly protect, in particular, our defence, scientific and research industries. An Act similar to the 'buy American' Act, albeit different in detail, is necessary in Australia. </para>
          <para>I now want to deal with specific matters raised by the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> and other honourable members. I shall go through the estimates in the very short time available to me. Turning to the estimates relating to family law, I commend the Attorney-General for his statement that there will be a parliamentary committee to investigate the operations of the Family Law Act. I have received literally hundreds of complaints about the practical application of the Act. I believe that, after two years of operation of legislation that produces dramatic social changes, the Parliament should review its operation and determine whether it should be amended, and if so in what way. I link that comment to the estimate provided for the Family Law Council. </para>
          <para>I now want to talk about Australian legal aid. I commend to the Committee, the provision of legal aid to those students at universities who are challenging the dictatorial provisions of rules of the Australian university councils and the Australian Union of Students which force students to direct their funds to the university councils and to the student councils within the universities. In my opinion, whether one pays funds for the purposes of the Australian Union of Students should be an entirely voluntary matter. Unfortunately the Australian Legal Aid Office has decided that because a case in Victoria was settled on the basis that there should be an opting out clause it will not give legal aid to a student who wishes to challenge the system in Sydney. Honourable members will know that each Act constituting an individual university requires specific interpretation. In my view, the Australian Legal Aid Office is acting in an unusually and obstructively legalistic way by refusing legal aid to students in Sydney who wish to challenge the particular interpretations of the Act with which they are faced. I ask the Committee to consider a broader classification of legal aid than is presently being given. </para>
          <para>Next I would commend some broad statements by the honourable member for Hawker but deny his specifics. In my opinion, the stock exchange should be used to channel the capital of this nation into productive enterprises. It should be used as a clearing house for capital to enable the development of industry, mining and other resources. It should not be abused. We should not have the speculation that we had some years ago when school boys were interested in making a few bob on the exchange. Even housewives were walking to the exchange in Sydney to speculate. The true role of the stock exchange is to enable capital to be concentrated and developed into productive enterprises. I agree that there should be a State and Commonwealth agreement on the development of a securities and exchange industry to produce this reform. For the honourable member to say that we are featherbedding company directors is ridiculous. In fact the people who are featherbedded are the union bosses who are not subject to control and who get away with murder in the unions, in many respects. Money disappears. </para>

              <para>- They are industrial gangsters. I would like to see trade unions incorporated fully, in the same way as registered clubs in New South Wales are incorporated fully, so that they will be subject to the various Acts to which company directors are subject. The fraud squad could look at what they are doing. It would clear out the unions in a very healthy way. </para>

            <para>- I want to raise a matter that was brought to my attention in my electorate last Saturday night. My wife and I attended the 21st birthday party of a friend of ours. This matter was raised with me by accident rather than by design when we were discussing the difficulties of obtaining employment in the Central Coast area. I knew that the position there was very bad. I did not realise that the unemployment rate in the area was the highest in the State. In Wyong 1 9.4 per cent of the work force is registered as unemployed. In Gosford the number is about 10.9 per cent. The figure is about the sixth highest in the State. </para>

              <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I return to my theme. The young lady concerned- it was her 21st birthday party- informed me that she had applied for a job recently at one of the major manufacturing companies in my electorate. I do not intend to mention its name because I do not want to embarrass it unnecessarily. I want to raise this matter with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street).</inline> She was asked a number of very embarrassing questions about her personal life. They were not embarrassing in the sense that there was anything wrong with them. She was asked for how long she had been married, whether she planned to have children and all these sorts of things. Perhaps they are legitimate questions. The crunch came when she said that she did not plan to have children for a few years. She was told that if she wanted the job she would have to take a pregnancy test. The job was in a factory. She would have been doing very unskilled work, I would think. It was not a highly professional technical position. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I was absolutely appalled. She did not come to me. We were just discussing the matter at her home at her 21st birthday party. I do not know whether this practice is a practice only of this company or of other companies in Australia, but I think this is the most disgraceful thing that any company could do. It is a very reputable company which, incidentally, employs more than 200 people in the Gosford area. </para><interjection>

              <para>- I have not spoken to the company yet. This woman is a personal friend. She was not complaining to me. She told me the story. I will check with the company; the honourable member can be sure of that. I want this on the record before the House rises for the election. I had asked the Minister to be present. I was wondering whether this is a practice in other places, whether this is common or whether International Labour Organisation conventions or some protection could be given to people so that they are not asked to have pregnancy tests. They may be asked whether they plan to have children. I think this is a most humiliating and degrading thing and something which, if this company or any other companies in Australia are doing it, ought to be wiped out immediately. </para>

            <para>- I spoke last night about the expulsion from the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Labor Party of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Watling</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Imlach</inline> and of the continuing power grab by the pro-communist Left in Tasmania which has already taken over the State Branch of the ALP and which is endeavouring to take over control of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. Tasmanians of course will react very strongly to the intrusion of mainland industrial gangsters such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pat</inline> Clancy, Mr George Crawford and others who flew into our State secretly last Thursday- officially and publicly to reunify the Tasmanian trade union movement. In fact they are seeking to split it asunder, to create industrial disruption and to create industrial sabotage which our State has suffered for far too long by far too many mainland industrial gangsters doing things which are designed in every conceivable way to use Tasmania as the example for punishment and the example for victimisation. We have been cut off as a result of air strikes, by air traffic controllers, tanker drivers, refuellers and the like. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to say something about the cowardice of the Tasmanian Government in the face of procommunist left wing victimisation of a young apprentice named Chris Symons who works for the tasmanian Railways at the Launceston railway workshops in the electorate of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman).</inline> This young man is an apprentice. It has been traditional- it has been a universally accepted principle in this country for years- that apprentices shall not be compelled to join trade unions and shall not be compelled to go on strike. People who have been unionists, such as myself, know that to be the fact. What happened to this young man? He was heavied by the pro-communist left operatives of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and told that he must join the AMWSU. He was told that if he did not join, all the equipment on which he worked would be declared black; he would be declared black; he would be victimised. Together with a number of his friends he appealed to the State Government for some direction. Dithering Doug, the  Deputy  Premier of Tasmania, has not been prepared to come forward and defend the right of this young apprentice not to join a union. He is cowering before the pro-communist Left. He will not stand up for the right; nor will the Government. </para>

        <para>Although the allocation of $50m to the States for 1977-78 represents a significant reduction compared with 1976-77, it should be noted that, under the new tax-sharing arrangements, the States are better off to the extent of $660m or 1 8 per cent in 1977-78. </para>

          <graphic href="107131197710261_66_11.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>Bed numbers are taken from lists of beds approved under the National Health Act (for August 1974) and Health Insurance Act (for February 1977). Lists for August 1974 have been re-categorised from former Public/Voluntary/ Private classification to currently used Public/Private classification, to allow comparability. (Repatriation beds not included). Bed approval lists are updated each August and February. The August 1974 list was chosen as the nearest to the commencement of the Program in June 1974; the February 1977 list as the latest available. </para>
        <para>It should be noted that under the Program considerable emphasis has been placed on the upgrading and refurbishing of existing sub-standard facilities. This very necessary work is not reflected in changes in bed numbers. </para>
        <para>In Queensland and Tasmania the ratio of beds to population has actually fallen as a result of planned rationalisation made possible by Hospitals Development Program funds. For instance the Commonwealth Government has agreed to fund 50 per cent of the redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital, which involves the replacement of existing sub-standard wards and support services, but only 23 additional beds. </para>
        <para>It should also be noted that existing high bed/population ratios in the States, as indicated in the table, disguise the fact that beds are poorly distributed. High concentrations exist in and around the Central Business Districts of major cities while there is a dearth of facilities in outer areas with poor access to hospital and other health services. The Hospitals Development Program has enabled several projects in outer suburban areas to be brought forward for earlier completion than would otherwise have been possible, e.g. Westmead and Campbelltown. </para>
        <para>Only when services are adequate in existing areas of need will it be possible to give consideration to phasing out obsolescent and redundant beds. </para>
        <para>Due to the lengthy planning and construction time involved in major projects, and this applies particularly to new hospitals in areas of need for which planning commenced since 1974, many planned new beds are not yet operational. It is at this stage, very difficult to estimate the number of beds which will ultimately be provided in these projects, as planning is continually subject to review. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>No precise timing for achieving such a balance can be indicated as any projections of future trends would be little more than educated guesses. Trade projections for even 12-18 months ahead are hazardous, given the many variables of supply, demand, price and sourcing strategies involved. Australia's exports to ASEAN include bulk foodstuffs and raw materials which have been and may be subject to wide price fluctuations in international markets. </para>
          <para>Australia in recent years has had a surplus on its trade account with ASEAN, as shown by the answer to Question No. 1237 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 13S9), but on the other hand, it has experienced a growing deficit on invisibles items such as transportation, travel, property income, etc. </para>
          <para>Although the Australian current account surplus increased slightly over the five years to 1975-76, existing trends indicate that this surplus could decline. Between 1971-72 and 1975-76, exports to ASEAN countries grew by 132 per cent, while imports from ASEAN countries grew almost twice as fast at 260 per cent. Over the same period, our net deficit on invisibles with ASEAN countries rose by 240 per cent. </para>
          <para>If recent years' experience were repeated, net identified capital flows (which averaged an annual net outflow of $2m in the 5-year period 197 1-72 to 1975-76) would not contribute significantly to net monetary movements between Australia and ASEAN. </para>

The library does not lend directly to private individuals. People from outside the government may visit and use the library by appointment. The forthcoming relocation of the library could make its facilities more readily available to the public if required. About one tenth of total loans are to users outside the Department. </para>

        <para>The libraries in London and Washington both are open to the public. They are used by staff at the posts, government departments, business firms, students and research workers and private individuals. The library in London is primarily a reference library. The Washington library loans items, and also provides an information referral services. </para>
        <para>The Australian Mission to the United Nations in New York provides a specialist service to staff, other missions and the public, based mainly on its collection of UN documents and publications. Some posts actively promote their libraries. For example Jakarta has more than 1000 registered borrowers and an average of 250 users per month. The libraries of many other posts are also used by the public and by students. </para>

              <para>Press reports have been drawn to my attention but I emphasize that they misrepresent the true position. The Bureau of Customs is not changing the method of valuing goods. From time to time, an import transaction comes to notice which requires a decision to be made on how the valuation legislation would apply to such a transaction. In some cases the Department's ruling differs from the valuation computed by the importer of the goods. This does not imply that any change has been made to the method of valuation. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>and (2) The Minister for Science announced on 17 August the Government's intention to establish, at a cost of $4.2m, facilities in Australia to receive and process data from the United States earth resources technology satellites known as Landsat. The facilities are expected to be operational by the end of 1979. The Government's decision was based on its recognition of the important contribution which Landsat technology could make to the task of monitoring and managing our natural resources. In the area of agriculture, Landsat will be of considerable value in assessing the potential yield and health of growing crops, and for monitoring the state of pastures particularly in the semi-arid areas of the country. Other applications include delineating drought areas and locating potential breeding sites for plague locust. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Intending users such as State Departments of Agriculture will be able to purchase Landsat data products directly from the data processing facility in the form of photographic images and computer compatible tapes for detailed analysis by experts in the particular field of application. Charges for the product will be determined on the principle of recovery of operating costs once the facilities are fully established. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Landsat satellites have the capability to detect a wide range of visible features on the earth's surface by recording reflected light. The amount of light reflected varies according to the properties of the surface features. Thus each feature has its own particular 'signature'. Once the signature of a feature is known it is possible to train a computer to recognise this particular signature from amongst others. By using this technique crops ranging from cereals such as wheat, oats and barley to vegetables such as tomatoes and onions have been identified using Landsat. In North America remote sensing techniques using a combination of satellites and aircraft are used for detecting illicit crops such as marihuana and opium for law enforcement purposes. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) The Trade Practices Act makes no specific provision in relation to small and uneconomic orders. A dealer is free to decide whether he will or will not deal with a particular customer except where his refusal to supply is taken for reasons related to resale price maintenance, exclusive dealing or monopolisation or is taken in agreement with his competitors. The Act however, gives special treatment to small businesses in relation to collective acquisition and joint advertising schemes with the purpose of allowing them to improve their buying position it they wish to. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>to (5) As far as I am aware, no recent quantitative information is available. The 1971 Census, which provides the latest figures available, showed that there were 5,099 computer programmers and 2,277 data system analysts in the labour force. Separate figures are not available for other computer personnel. My Department compiles regular qualitative assessments of the labour demand and supply situation for computer operating personnel in Australia. At present labour demand for experienced operators, although small, exceeds supply. The rate of computer installation is expected to increase over the next 2-3 years and there will be more demand for experienced personnel. There are not many positions advertised for trainees and competition at this level is very keen. Most employers prefer to train thenown operators and priority is usually given to people already within their organisations. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>As to the demand for computer programmers and systems analysts, there is an acute shortage of experienced personnel particularly in New South Wales and Victoria and this is likely to persist into the 1980s. There is an oversupply of inexperienced newly qualified computer programmers and this is unlikely to ease over the next 2 or 3 years. </para>
          <para>Without equating arrivals in Australia with recruitment from overseas, I can also say that between late 1975 and June 1977, 180 computer programmers and 171 systems analysts arrived in Australia. In these work categories, a minimum of 3 years' practical experience together with appropriate academic qualifications is required for immigration purposes. </para>
