          <para>That this House records its sincere regret at the death of His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios III, President of the Republic of Cyprus, and expresses its profound sympathy to the people of Cyprus. </para>
        </motion>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>following the news of the death of  President  Makarios, the Governor-General and I sent messages of condolence to the Acting  President  of the Republic of Cyprus and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic. The Australian Government was represented at the President&#39;s funeral by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar).</inline> The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> and our High Commissioner to the Republic of Cyprus were also present. </para>
        <para>The late President was the inspiration of the modern state of Cyprus and represented it in the world community with wisdom and distinction. </para>
        <para class="block">He was ordained deacon and priest in 1938. He graduated from the School of Theology of Athens University and he continued his theological studies at Boston University on a World Council of Churches scholarship. On his return to Cyprus in 1948 he was consecrated bishop and began intensive religious, social and national work in his see. At that time he began his vigorous campaign for nationhood for Cyprus. In 1950 he was elected as both archbishop and ethnarch national leader of the Greek people of Cyprus. It is a tribute to his qualities that he was elected as both the spiritual and the political leader of his country. </para>
        <para>In 1952 he began his campaign at the United Nations General Assembly for international recognition of Cyprus. During the following years of the decade he fought courageously to achieve his goal, enduring even exile from his country. Following the London agreement in 1959 that Cyprus would become an independent republic, he returned to Cyprus and was elected its first  President. President  Makarios played a unique and distinguished role in his country&#39;s national and international affairs. He visited many countries in his quest for a solution to the problems of Cyprus. He tirelessly represented his country at many international conferences as well as at the United Nations and at meetings of Commonwealth Heads of Government.  His  remarkable personal qualtities earned him an eminent place amongst world statesmen.  His  counsels will be particularly missed at Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings, in which he had actively participated for many years. I had the honour of meeting with him privately during the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London. At that time we discussed his forthcoming state visit to Australia in November this year. This visit would have been a fitting symbol of the development of long-standing and excellent relations between our two countries. I am sure that not only the Australian Government but all the Australian people were looking forward to that visit. I am sure that not only those Australians whose country of origin is Cyprus but all others will share my regret that it cannot now take place. </para>
        <para>We therefore wish to record in the Parliament our deep sympathy to the people of Cyprus. They have lost a statesman of great eminence who had long personified his people&#39;s quest for identity and independence. We also hope that the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the problems in Cyprus, to which the late  President  had devoted so much of his life, will be pursued with determination despite his untimely death. </para>

          <para>-Seventeen years ago today the Republic of Cyprus came into being. The Archbishop and Ethnarch of Cyprus became the founding President. He was the first head of an independent Cyprus since the Lusignan kingdom passed to Venice nearly five centuries ago. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>By April 1975, when the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Jamaica, the  President  had become their doyen. Thus it was that when we assembled on HMY <inline font-style="italic">Britannia,</inline> Makarios III sat at the right hand of Elizabeth II, whose British Government 20 years earlier had relegated him to the Seychelles. None who witnessed that tableau could fail to reflect on its personal and historical significance and symbolism. It said much about this remarkable man and much about the Commonwealth itself. Through strength of will and courage he attained and maintained his eminence in the Commonwealth and in the ranks of world statesmanship; and, not for the only time in the history of the Commonwealth, exile or imprisonment confirmed its victim&#39;s claims to the leadership of an independent nation. </para>
        <para>President Makarios supported the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth supported </para>
        <para class="block">Cyprus. I was happy to play some part in drafting the Commonwealth&#39;s expression of support for the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions calling for the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces, and in the Commonwealth&#39;s establishment of a committee, which included Australia, to follow developments in Cyprus and to assist in every possible way towards the early implementation of the United Nations resolutions. </para>
        <para>Six years ago in Nicosia the  President  told me of his interest in the tens of thousands of Cypriots who had settled in Australia and his appreciation of the work of the Australian police, then drawn from both Federal and State forces, who were part of the United Nations peace-keeping force. In Jamaica he expressed warm gratitude for the Australian Government&#39;s response to the human disaster and material devastation caused by the Turkish invasion. He promptly responded to my invitation that he should visit Australia. In London last June I found that he was still greatly looking forward to the visit. </para>
        <para>For 3000 years of recorded history Cyprus has been at the strategic and commercial crossroads of the Eastern Mediterranean.  President  Makarios represented the new political independence of Cyprus; but he also embodied its ancient spiritual independence, for when Michael Mouskos, son of a peasant, became Archbishop and thus Ethnarch in 1950, at the age of 37, he assumed the imperial prerogatives which were accorded the head of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus when it was made autocephalous just 1 500 years ago. He was indeed the first Christian prelate to hold great political office under the English Crown since Cardinal Wolsey No reckoning of Archbishop Makarios &#39;s career, and his hold on the loyalties of the people of his nation and his faith, can be complete without recognition of his dual role- head of his nation, head of his church. The depth of his people&#39;s devotion had to be witnessed to be believed in the stricken capital and all along the long roads to his grave on the mountain top above the monastery where he was trained for his mission in life. There can be no doubt of the veneration and affection in which he has been long held and will continue to be held by hundreds of thousands of Greek speaking residents of Australia herself. </para>
        <para>Among all his personal qualities he possessed physical and political courage of the highest order. There were at least a dozen attempts on his life. The most heinous was on 15 July 1974 when the Greek military government promoted the <inline font-style="italic">xpa&#163;ix@icriiia</inline> against him. On 20 July, Turkey invaded. On 23 July the Greek dictatorship fell. We might wish, sic semper tyrannis. Greece herself is now rapidly recovering from the policies of the tyrants; the people of Cyprus however, Greek and Turkish alike, still suffer from them. The intervention of the colonels raised fears among Turks in both Cyprus and Turkey. It caused, but did not justify, the occupation which still continues. </para>
        <para>It is a tragedy of the highest order that Cyprus should lose her chief at this time of continuing difficulty and danger. The ranks of world statesmanship are diminished by his early death; so are the ranks of the Commonwealth. But the greatest loss, seemingly irreparable, is the loss to the people of Cyprus of the man who founded and preserved their state and symbolised the church, the nation and the state of Cyprus throughout the world. </para>

          <para>-I wish to speak on behalf of the many electors in the Melbourne area and elsewhere who were born in Cyprus. Because in 1952 I lived in Lapithos which is now under Turkish control in Cyprus and because of my association with the foundation of the early Committee of Conciliation headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Atlee,</inline> Compton McKenzie, Robert Boothby and others who were involved in the earliest days looking for a peace between Turkey, Great Britain and Greece, I feel it would be wrong if I did not today, having known and having worked with Archbishop Makarios, Francis Noel Baker and others, say a few words in this honourable House on this motion. There is absolutely no doubt about the complete and amazing bravery of Archbishop Makarios. At all times, his stand was firm, correct and even humble. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Last year I visited the Commonwealth Police unit in Cyprus. This unit is doing a wonderful job for our nation. These police officers wander around unarmed. They travel in landrovers. They wander between the two sides. They are most respected and understood in Cyrpus. The unit has brought a great deal of skill to the problem of the preservation of peace in Cyprus. I would not like to let this moment pass without saying to the nation that the Australian Commonwealth Police unit in Cyprus has rendered invaluable service to the cause of world peace. This fact has been recognised by every person who works in or is concerned with international affairs or the United Nations. </para>
        <para>To his people, the passing of Archbishop Makarios is the most terrible tragedy as it has occurred at a time when one third of their island is at present occupied and is considered to be part of a Turkish province. Last year, for the first time, the government car carrying the Australian High Commissioner in Cyprus was not permitted to enter into the area where a conference between Greek and Turkish Cypriot people and their rulers was being held. That was a sad event. If Cyprus is to have any hope of peace or any hope of a future there must be communications between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots. </para>
        <para>In all his dealings with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Denktash, Mr Orekx,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kutchuk,</inline> the former Vice-President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios always maintained a firm and humble way in his negotiations. That Cyprus, the Middle East, the Commonwealth and the world have lost a statesman of this standing is a matter of the most important regret. On behalf of those who have been involved throughout their lives in negotiations with Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots and with their governments, and also on behalf of all Cypriots living in Australia. I acknowledge, having lived in Cyprus, that Archbishop Makarios was one of the world&#39;s greatest leaders. He was, at a difficult time, the most patient statesman. I am sorry that, before he was able to visit this country, his life on this earth ended. I only hope that there will arise in Cyprus a leader of equal competence, equal brilliance and equal good sense to hold together a community of church and state. For that reason I associate myself and all Cypriots whom I know in Australia, New York and elsewhere with the motion moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G.

          <para>-I rise to add my condolences on the passing of  President  Makarios, a great world figure. Cyprus, to many of us, is a far away country but we must remember that it has played a part in English history and, more importantly, it has given a strand to the Australian character. The contributions of Cypriots need no mention on an occasion such as this. They, like me, regret the passing of such a great man. The British had two contacts with Cyprus. In 1191 Richard the Lionheart conquered Cyprus for 80 days. The second British occupation began in 1878 and lasted for 80 years. The first contact put an end to an independent Cyprus; the second came to an end by an agreement which established an independent Cyprus. Credit for that goes to the man we mourn today. Whatever his detractors may say, the Archbishop proved himself a consummate politician. He presided over the full spectrum of political life, stretching from the <inline font-style="italic">extreme</inline> Right to the extreme Left. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He refused to repress any political orientation and, for a short time, he paid for his generosity. The main theme of his life was collaboration for the common good. The Christian faith moulded his character and gave him the character we so admired. He was a man of the people; a broadminded, modern man whose experience of life was varied. He always stressed that he was firstly an archbishop and secondly a head of state. That broadmindedness was founded on the cornerstone of what he described as his Christianity. He was born in 1913, the son of a part farmer, part shepherd in the Troodos Mountains. He grew up helping his father in the fields. But he grew up in the shadow of the Orthodox church because near his village he could see the clock tower of Kykko a famous monastery. His uncle was a priest. He helped his uncle prepare the mass and in painting the church. Finally, he became a monk. He was sent to complete his studies at the most famous school in Cyprus, namely, the Pansprian Gymnasium in Nicosia. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>Beatitude, the  President,  did not spare himself in the struggle to free the Cypriot people from the yoke of oppression. He was tireless in demanding that the United Nations&#39; decisions on Cyprus be implemented and that the principle contained in those decisions be made the basis of a negotiated settlement. He worked for a formula which would safeguard the independent sovereignty, territorial integrity and nonalignment of the Republic of Cyprus. It was my pleasure to be received by the late  President  on two occasions.  His  strength of character, sharpness of mind and dedication to the cause of a united Cyprus came through in a way which stamped him as a great patriot. I am sure that every Australian and particularly the members of this Parliament will join with me in expressing the view that the cause for which  His  Beatitude lived and for which he gave his life- a just and lasting peace for a united Cyprus based on the resolutions of the United Nations- will be achieved and will be a lasting tribute to his memory. I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline></para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Prime Minister. In the first question time in this Parliament I asked him whether the Government intends to proceed to implement the unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament, whose members were drawn from both sides of both Houses in the last Parliament and whose report had been presented to both Houses on 30 September 1975. In particular I asked whether he had requested his Ministers to make declarations of interest which that Committee recommended they should make. He may remember that he replied that all Ministers had been asked to make declarations to him and that the recommendations of the Committee were taken into account in formulating that requirement. I now ask him whether the Minister for Primary Industry informed him of the full nature of his financial interests and responsibilities which have now been discussed in the media and how long ago that Minister first informed him of the changes in shareholdings and directorships flowing from changed family responsibilities? May I also ask him again whether the Government intends to implement the recommendations in the report? </para>

          <para class="block">Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations and at the parliamentary Committee&#39;s recommendations to see to what extent they are compatible with each other so that the Government may be in a position to make a decision on the overall question of pecuniary interests in relation not only to parliamentarians but also to public servants. The honourable gentleman will be aware that it is not uncommon practice in a number of countries for public servants to be in a position of making statements concerning their pecuniary interests. It seemed to the Government that it would be sensible to proceed in parallel in the two areas- politicians and public servantsbecause obviously decisions relating to one would have significant implications on decisions relating to the other. In case the letter itself has not been tabled in the Parliament- my recollection is that it may have been- I am perfectly happy to table a copy of a letter that I wrote to all Ministers and to all later appointed Ministers to indicate the nature of the statement that is required of them. I will also table the covering letter to the Minister for Administrative Services who has the responsibility of seeing that ministerial staffs fulfil this same kind of commitment. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry has made declarations, as have other Ministers, and I have obviously, in view of the circumstances of the past day or two, spoken to the Minister concerning these particular matters. I am not aware of anything that has arisen in recent days which would indicate that any elements of the declarations made to me were inaccurate. The companies with which I am advised the Minister is involved are private companies. They involve two or three families at most. </para>

              <para>- They are proprietary companies. The Minister&#39;s involvement with the Alan Walsh company was as executor to his father&#39;s estate. I do not believe that matters relating to pecuniary interest should be pursued to such an extent that any member of this Parliament would be precluded from being an executor to his father&#39;s estate and from carrying out the responsibilities that are thereby involved. I think that is a perfectly proper matter for any member of parliament or Minister to pursue. It needs to be noted also that to my knowledge this is the first government that has sought from Ministers a record of their pecuniary interests in a quite detailed manner and it is the first government - </para>

That advertisement omitted a number of factors, one or two of which are perhaps not directly related but which I think entitle this House to ask who the shadow Minister for economic affairs is. The honourable member for Adelaide seems to have been left in the shadows in recent times. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad that the honourable gentleman can look after himself because he might be more acceptable than some others. What was said in that advertisement in relation to inflation was quite inaccurate. For example, inflation was running in the last half of 1975 at 16.8 per cent; in the last half of 1974 at 19.3 per cent, as a direct result of the Opposition&#39;s policies when it was in government; and in the first half of this year, at 10.4 per cent. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> agrees that inflation is running at 10 per cent; there are public statements to that effect. That shows again how wrong the honourable member for Oxley was when he predicted, I think as late as 3 May, that inflation would be running at 15 per cent. In addition to that, profits have improved significantly by about 27 per cent during the past year, which would seem to indicate that the business situation is certainly improving. The profit share has increased. Private investment in plant and equipment has improved in real terms by something approaching 7 per cent. There was one true statement in the advertisement. I must pay credit to the authors of the advertisement for the correctness of the statement that if the Bill Hayden Budget had been followed up in 1976 Australia would not be in the state it is in today. It would certainly be far worse off. Inflation would be far worse and business in those circumstances would, indeed, be in a terrible state. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Treasurer whether his attention has been drawn to a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Recovery With Inflation</inline> prepared by the United States Congress? Is he aware that this report showed that to take one percentage point off inflation over 3 years it would be necessary to add 1.2 percentage points to the unemployed? Applied to the Australian economy, would this mean that another 75 000 people would have to be thrown out of work to reduce inflation by one percentage point? Does this analysis show that the Government will only increase unemployment and deepen the recession if it continues with its misguided efforts to beat inflation the quick way by contracting the economy. </para>

            <para>- I find the honourable gentleman on this occasion more than usually tedious. I hope that he will curb his impatience until I am in a position to deal with matters of this type in a more definitive form later this evening. I suggest that, if he is able to curb his impatience, he may be better edified at that stage. I have not seen the report of the United States Congress. But these simplistic analogies that the honourable gentleman draws are certainly rejected by me and the members of this Government. I say to the honourable gentleman in the lowest possible profile that, if he is concerned about inflation and unemployment, he must have a gigantic concern for the new three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten point plan released by the honourable member for Oxley and the Leader of the Opposition recently to fix the problems which we inherited. I suggest to the honourable gentleman, who no doubt was not consulted at that time- and I underline the word &#39;not&#39;- that, if he looks at that package, he will see, as the Prime Minister, myself and other senior Ministers have made perfectly clear, that what the Australian Labor Party is now asserting is not a panacea, but is a recipe for more inflation, more unemployment, and the sort of recession which it caused in this country during the period it was in office. </para>

            <para>-The short answer is that I am maintaining a close concern in the matter. Representations have been made since the date mentioned by the honourable member in his question. It will be recalled that Monsignor Thuan has reportedly been held in detention by the Vietnamese authorities since 1975 without charges being brought against him. The Australian Government raised the matter in Hanoi in July 1976. Since that time we have continued to make inquiries about his welfare, not only in Hanoi but also with the Vatican. These inquiries suggested that he was in good health and receiving civilised treatment although recent newspaper reports have suggested that his state of health is now very poor. Australia&#39;s embassy to the Holy See recently sought further information from the Vatican about the welfare of Monsignor Thuan. The Vatican was unable to add much to the recent Press reports that we have gathered other than that he was still alive and still in detention. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Last month my Department drew this matter to the attention of the Vietnamese Embassy in Canberra. The Australian Government recognises that the detention of Vietnamese citizens in Vietnam would be considered by the Vietnamese to be essentially a domestic matter for their own Government. However, because of the depth of concern expressed by many Australians about Monsignor Thuan. a concern shared by the Government, I have written in my ministerial capacity to the Vietnamese Charged &#39;Affaires in Canberra about the welfare of persons under detention in Vietnam and of Monsignor Thuan in particular. That letter has been delivered to the Charge. </para>

            <para>-The Foreign Investment Review Board and the whole of the foreign investment review legislation are certainly not to be treated by anyone in this House as a matter of tokenism. The legislation, the policy behind it and the detailed operation of the Foreign Investment Review Board are working very effectively, a fact to which the case histories dealt with by the Board and myself bear evidence. With regard to the case referred to by the honourable gentleman, I have said in this House earlier- I reaffirm it- that I do not believe it to be in the interests of the processes of the Foreign Investment Review Board or of the policy itself that matters concerning the various parties who may from time to time be before the Foreign Investment Review Board should be the subject of quick question and answer in this House because of the confidential nature of the proceedings in question. Should that confidentiality be breached I suggest to the honourable gentleman that it would cut right across the whole thrust of the Government&#39;s policy in relation to foreign investment and would be a marked disadvantage to foreign investors seeking to process applications through the Board. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Government examined new economic proposals designed to lift government spending by $800m and to lift the government deficit to $3.5 billion? If such proposals have been looked at, is the Treasurer able to comment on them before the introduction of the Budget tonight? </para>

            <para>-There are not many matters on which I really welcome questions before the Budget is delivered, but I make an exception in the case of this question from the honourable member for Demson. The attention of myself and other Ministers certainly has been drawn to the document issued by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Oxley. Let there be no doubt whatever that should those proposals be implemented they would be highly inflationary. They would put the economy back into the situation it was in during the depression years of 1974 and 1975. Most certainly they would put upward pressure upon interest rates. After all, they are no different from the earlier proposals which the honourable member for Adelaide said would lead to the prolonging of inflation in this country. The House will be aware that, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, the honourable member for Adelaide was not involved, we understand, in the release of the new proposals even though he purports to hold the title of shadow Treasurer. It is not clear whether he stood out of the process because he was overseas or because he shared a very real sense of concern about the inflationary implications of those proposals. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The last time the honourable member for Oxley came forward with his $800m spending program he claimed that it would cost a net $200m. This time he claims that the net cost would be $500m. I can say that having an extra 50 000 people in work would generate savings in unemployment benefits of around $75m and a net addition to personal tax receipts of little more than $50m. I point out to the honourable member for Oxley that not only is his costing completely wrong once again but there would be no prospect of providing 50 000 jobs. That point should not be lost on the honourable gentleman, in particular, because after all he was the Minister who abolished the Regional Employment Development scheme. No doubt the additional $800m spending program of the honourable member for Oxley would be financed by implementing the suggestion made recently by the honourable member for Adelaide, that under a Labor government all people with incomes above $15,000 per annum would have to pay more income tax. I will close on this point: Perhaps the best way to summarise the new package put forward by the Labor Party is to refer, as I not infrequently do, to a recent editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> which said quite simply and rather cogently, I thought at the time: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr Hayden</inline> blots his copybook&#39;. </para>

            <para>- My question, which also is addressed to the Treasurer, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Blaxland. I will deal with the other matter just referred to by the Treasurer at some other stage. If the Conzinc-Rio Tinto of Australia Ltd takeover of Coal and Allied Industries Ltd is now before the Foreign Investment Review Board as the Treasurer states, can he say whether the Board was properly notified prior to the purchase of shares? Is it not a fact that under section 26 of the Foreign Take-overs Act the Board is supposed to give approval prior to any shares being purchased by such a foreign company as CRA? Is that not a prima facie case of CRA being in breach of the Act if that approval was not first given? At what stage did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Pettingell disqualify himself from this case as he must have known, as a director of Howard Smith Ltd in addition to being a director of Coal and Allied Industries Ltd- Howard Smith Ltd being a partner of CRA in this deal- of the intended purchase of shares? </para>

            <para>- The sorts of innuendoes made by the honourable gentleman, which are quite consistent with the innuendoes made by his colleague the honourable member for Blaxland, are rejected by this Government. I thought I had made that perfectly clear. What those innuendoes do, and do in a very clear way, is give some indication of the sorts of policies that would be pursued by honourable gentlemen opposite if at some stage in the future, which is hard to predict, they were to resume occupancy of the government benches. As I have mentioned before, all the innuendoes behind what the honourable gentlemen have said in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Pettingell, as I recall the information provided to me, are utterly unfounded, but I will ascertain to what extent the further information sought by the honourable gentleman on that score can be made available to him. As to the balance of the question, I thought I had made it perfectly clear that these matters are before the Foreign Investment Review Board at the present time. As Treasurer I do not intend- through you, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker-</inline> to have a parliamentary debate or a question and answer exchange across the table with the honourable gentleman or any other honourable gentleman about a matter that is currently before the Board. I said to the honourable member for Blaxland that as and when I can provide further information to him I will certainly do so. In this case I will do the same for the honourable member for Adelaide. </para>

            <para>-I well understand the honourable member&#39;s extensive interest in this matter. He will recall that prior to the Sixth Session of the Law of the Sea Conference the Government made it perfectly clear that it was hoping for a widely supported multilateral convention which included, among other things, the provision of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The Sixth Session&#39;s deliberations concluded in July of this year. In the light of the fact that a growing number of countries are making or in the process of making unilateral declarations of extended maritime jurisdiction, and bearing in mind the need to protect our own valuable fishing stocks from the increasing number of foreign vessels fishing in our area, the Government stated that it would re-examine the need for legislative action after the Sixth Session had concluded. Of course, that now has been done, with the Sixth Session finishing in July of this year, as I have indicated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have decided that legislation should be drafted to enable the proclamation of a 200 nautical mile Australian fishery zone. Such a move should be seen as the first stage in exercising, in accordance with international law, Australia&#39;s 200-mile zone rights around Australia and the Territories. In regard to the further questions asked by the honourable member I say that legislation is therefore now being drafted. No decision has yet been made regarding the timing of its introduction or when it will come into force. Those and other details will, of course, need to be discussed with other countries and in particular, pursuant to the undertakings we gave to the member countries of the South Pacific Forum, with those countries at the Forum&#39;s forthcoming meeting towards the end of this month. </para>

Is he also aware of the Travel Agents Bill 1975 that was introduced in this House in March 1975 by the then Minister for Tourism and Recreation, the Honourable Frank Stewart, and passed by this House and then introduced in the Senate and on the Notice Paper of that House when the events of 11 November 1975 caught up with the Parliament? If this Bill had been proceeded with by this Government, would it not have protected all the people who may lose money or be inconvenienced by the collapse of these agencies or of others that it is suggested may collapse in the very near future? What does the Government propose to do to compensate or to assist those people who may lose their money? When can we expect legislation to protect travellers who in good faith pay money in advance for travel? </para>

          <para>The Government is very much concerned about some aspects of the present situation. Only this morning I have been in discussion with the Victorian Government about these matters. AUS Travel, for example, is registered under Victorian legislation and an examination to see what went wrong would, of necessity, be conducted under Victorian law. At the same time both governments are exploring the possibility of a joint examination of these aspects. The Commonwealth has responsibilities for students throughout the whole of Australia. It is concerned to see that the arrangements that they might want to make in this area are appropriate and that student interests are properly safeguarded. Any examination that the Commonwealth would be involved in would be directed to that purpose. I hope it might be possible for a joint announcement to be made quite shortly by the Victorian Government and the Commonwealth Government, because these are serious matters. </para>

            <para>-I would have to say that the information we possess is limited. Nevertheless, it is clear from a number of unconfirmed reports that have emerged that extensive repression, including executions, has taken place in Kampuchea since the Khmer Rouge came to power. In fact in recent testimony on human rights in Kampuchea the conclusion of a United States State Department official as to the estimate of the number of people who were thought to have perished in Kampuchea was that, while there was no way to confirm a precise figure, the number of deaths appeared to be in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Turning to recent incidents that have been verified by independent observers and covered by reputable news media, there is no question but that Kampuchea troops have killed villagers, including women and children, living in the border areas between Thailand and Kampuchea. We realise, of course, that these border areas are in dispute as are, according to recent reports, parts of the frontier between Kam. puchea and Vietnam. But the slaughter of villagers can only lend credibility to the horror stories that have come from inside Kampuchea. We condemn in the strongest possible terms such cruel and unnecessary actions wherever they may occur and appeal to the Government of Kampuchea to respect international human rights principles. No government could possibly condone such slaughter, pillage and destruction. </para>

            <para>- I have information in broad categories as to the disputes currently going on in Victoria, although I do not claim that the information is necessarily comprehensive or exact in all details. To the best of my knowledge currently in Victoria one dispute affects the shipping industry, 11 involve the building and construction industry, two involve engineering and metals, one the food, drink and tobacco industries and five are taking place in other industries. Again, I do not have comprehensive information as to the precise number of people involved in these strikes. I have no doubt that it is very significant. For example, one dispute involves 2200 members of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and another dispute affects 530 people involved in the construction of the Westgate Bridge. This sort of industrial action is being pursued by a small minority whose motto, apparently, is: &#39;Might is right&#39;. These people are heedless of the interests of their fellow unionists, those who are looking for work and of the community generally. They seem hell bent on destroying any system of orderly wage fixation in this country and of destroying prospects for creating new job opportunities. </para>

Can he explain why he failed to press for the reintroduction of the Travel Agents Bill 1975 which lapsed following the peculiar happenings, to say the least, of 1 1 November 1975 when that legislation was a consumer protective measure and when he was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and also the Minister in this House representing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> whose portfolio covered tourism and travel agents? Is he also aware that the adoption by the Parliament of uniform legislation for the registration and control of travel agents could have prevented the collapse of these agencies or, at least, ensured that the consumers using those agencies would not suffer financial loss? As a matter of urgency, will the Minister now press for the introduction of uniform legislation to register and control travel agents throughout Australia? </para>

            <para>- There is no need for me to react to the honourable member&#39;s question because I have already taken steps to see that both commissions discharge their responsibilities in the manner for which they were set up. One of the responsibilities is not to be a retailer of stationery. Some so-called market surveys have been carried out. It has been traditional in the Post Office, of course, to sell some equipment or goods which are involved with the business of postage of articles. Some consideration was given to extending this activity. Some weeks ago I reminded the Commission that I thought that that went beyond its charter. The Commission found it agreeable to accept my comments. I am certain that retailers and business people generally will not and ought not to have the problem of competition from these commissions. </para>

Obviously, within the Australian trade union movement there are a number of acknowledged communists and a number of radical left wing union activists who have contributed significantly to non-industrial action which prejudices the recovery of the Australian economy. In addition, there have been identified in a number of areas and in a number of industries others of different categories. In one group there were a few of those who are British shop stewards and a few of those who are British trade union leaders. Obviously, not all British trade union leaders are in the category to which I referred. Unfortunately, those few have significantly prejudiced economic recovery in a number of industries, and it was to them and against them that my remarks were directed. </para>

            <para>-I am aware that there are a number of applications for citizenship, not only in Victoria but in all States of Australia, and that has been the case for a very long time. The delay is less at the moment than it was during the honourable member&#39;s time in government. I should like to lay this furphy to rest. There is no campaign to delay the processing of applications. This Government regards Australian citizenship very highly indeed. We regard the granting of Australian citizenship as a most serious matter. I think it is cause for some concern that various political parties, but particularly the Labor Party, have reduced the concept almost to a market one. Tables are being set up in the markets in Melbourne where people can get their application forms. Application for Australian citizenship should be such that a person has the opportunity to think clearly about his application. He should be encouraged to apply if he really wishes to take Australian citizenship. Citizenship should not be given away as a matter of no consequence. To finalise the answer, I make it quite clear that there is no overt delay in the processing of applications. We try to make such processing as quick as possible. </para>

            <para>-I am delighted to tell the honourable member for Macarthur and the House that this matter has received the active consideration of the Government. Indeed, it is not overstating the position to indicate that the Government has been extremely concerned about the sweetheart agreements entered into by some companies at a cost to the community in two ways: Firstly, the direct cost suffered by consumers; and, secondly, the effect of sweetheart agreements on inflation, which affects everybody in the community. This Government inherited from its predecessor a very high rate of inflation- something like 16 per cent- and tremendous progress has been made in getting the inflation rate down. The Prime Minister this afternoon referred to the inflation rate being in the vicinity of 10 per cent. The point I want to make very clear is that the Government will not stand by and see its wages policy affected in this way without taking some positive action. </para>

I also take the opportunity to make it clear that those companies which grant increases outside the guidelines to which I have referred will be referred to the Prices Justification Tribunal for inquiry into their price structure. The Government is insistent in this matter. It regards the sweetheart agreements to which I have referred as being a direct attack on its wages policy and on its continuing efforts to bring this country&#39;s inflation rate down to an acceptable level. </para>

            <para>- Honourable members will recall that on 4 December 1976 a fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, burnt down a hangar and destroyed or damaged 10 Grumman S2E Tracker aircraft and associated equipment. The Board of Inquiry was convened by the Flag Officer Commanding East Australia Area under the authority of the Naval Defence Act and was directed to examine the security arrangements and fire prevention measures which existed before the fire, how the fire was fought and action taken to minimise loss after the fire started, and to make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. They were advised that their report should state whether the fire and subsequent damage and destruction were attributable to acts or omissions on the part of any person or persons. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>The Board&#39;s inquiry was conducted concurrently with an extensive investigation undertaken by the New South Wales Police Force, assisted by Naval Police and the Commonwealth Police Force. The police investigations continued altogether for over 12 weeks. Approximately 2000 people were interviewed. The Board of Inquiry enjoyed exceptionally close co-operation and integration of effort with the police. The Board of Inquiry was assisted by a specialist in fire services and security from the Royal Australian Air Force and by experts drawn from a broad spectrum of specialised agencies of Commonwealth, State and local governments. I take this opportunity to record the appreciation of the Government for the valuable assistance provided by all authorities and persons to the Board of Inquiry. The Board of Inquiry established that the fire in H hangar was caused by deliberate action. Aviation gasoline was drained to the hangar floor from the tanks of at least two aircraft, the sprinkler system shut-off valve was closed and the gasoline was lit. The person solely responsible for these actions was Able Seaman Graham John Trent. </para>
          <para>The conclusions I have tabled are taken verbatim from the Board of Inquiry report, except for names of individuals which have been removed in accordance with the practice that documents tabled in the House should not contain the names of individuals who are the subject of criticism. </para>
          <para>The major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that the material aspects of security of aircraft within the hangar and of the hangar itself were less than adequate; various procedures relating to security of aircraft and hangars at the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory; certain persons did not carry out their security duties in accordance with orders; various proposals to enhance the security of the Naval Air Station had not been put into effect; the standards of construction of H hangar were below those considered appropriate today for the safe stowage of aircraft; and the response to the alarm was good, the fire could not have been extinguished sooner or more closely confined, the actions taken to fight the fire were sound and many men showed great courage and determination in fighting the fire and removing aircraft to safety. </para>
          <para>As honourable members will see from the paper I have tabled, the Board also drew conclusions on other matters of lesser importance dealing with inadequacies or deficiencies in the administration of security and fire protection at the Station. In April this year Able Seaman Trent was tried by court-martial on 13 charges of wilfully damaging a hangar and wilfully destroying or damaging a number of aircraft. The court martial found that Trent did the acts charged but was insane at the time when the acts were done so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions. The court-martial ordered that Trent be kept in custody until the pleasure of the Governor-General is known. Ten officers have been dealt with for their failure to ensure adequate security of the Air Station and its valuable assets and for not exercising proper supervision of duty security personnel on the night of the fire. The officers have been censured or admonished, including two severely censured at the highest level. </para>
          <para>Short of trial and conviction by court-martial a censure is the most severe action that may be taken against an officer in peacetime. Consideration was given to the trial by court-martial of some of the officers concerned for negligence. Before an officer can be convicted by court martial in relation to negligence, it must be established beyond reasonable doubt that his conduct amounts to neglect in the manner charged. If so, it must further be established that the neglect is blameworthy or culpable in the circumstances. After receiving legal advice it was decided not to proceed by court-martial. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a number of officers had fallen short of the standards expected of them to such a degree that censure or admonition was warranted. In addition, charges were laid against 10 sailors in summary proceedings. The offences alleged involved breaches of discipline committed whilst on duty. One sailor was found not guilty. In the other nine cases convictions resulted and fines were imposed. </para>
          <para>Immediate steps were taken to improve the security protection of naval aircraft and the base complex. The following specific actions have been taken: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha-dotted">
            <item label="a.">
              <para>Security of aircraft has been considerably improved by employing sentries in hangars, by more effective mobile patrols equipped with two-way radios, by more frequent random checks by senior Station officers and duty officers, and by the introduction of guard dog teams.

              <para>Fire prevention and fire fighting measures have been improved by a number of steps including the dispersal of aircraft, the locking of sprinkler control rooms, the improved readiness of fire fighting equipment and agents, clarification of orders on the carriage of cigarette lighters and matches, and the removal of flammable liquids and combustible material from hangars on completion of work each day. Action also has been taken to improve the training and exercising of personnel in the fighting of all types of fires that might be encountered on the Station, and to improve procedures to contact duty personnel and the local fire brigade. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Some $43,000 has been expended or committed on works to improve security since the fire. In addition, items have been included in the works program for this financial year to provide for improved security to a number of areas in the Station, principally to extend the facilities for the introduction of two new fire tenders, to improve the perimeter road, to provide a flammable stowage for one hangar, and to improve security and fire protection in a number of other buildings. These items are being progressed as rapidly as practicable. Consideration is being given to a number of further measures including provision of additional security fencing, illumination and security alarms for other sensitive areas, illumination of the aircraft hardstanding adjacent to the hangars, and renewal of lighting in some hangars using flame-proof fitments. Action is proceeding for the early installation of intruder alarm systems to the appropriate hangars at the Air Station. A full periodic inspection of the Naval Air Station has recently been completed. Considerable improvement in the Station&#39;s security awareness has been reported. </para>
          <para>There can be no doubt that the fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, was a severe blow to our defence capabilities at the time. The Government was able quickly to replace the aircraft. I wish to acknowledge that this action would not have been possible without the prompt and most generous assistance of the United States Government and the United States Navy. In all, the estimated value of the hangar, aircraft and equipment lost amounted to nearly $9m. The cost to replace the aircraft and equipment, which has already been announced, is estimated at nearly $7m. It is pertinent to remind honourable members that the Naval Air Station at Nowra is an extensive and complex facility. Its primary functions are to provide a base for the operational squadrons for HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> when disembarked, for training squadrons and for Fleet requirements; to provide organisational and intermediate level maintenance and support for naval aircraft; and to provide operational training for air crew and to provide ground training for maintenance personnel. In addition to normal naval operational and training flying, the Naval Air Station meets demands for search and rescue and aid to the civil community. The Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Station is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Jervis Bay airfield and the missile range. In all he commands nearly 2000 people and at the time of the fire there were 61 aircraft at his Station. The Naval Air Station and the Jervis Bay target services group have consistently maintained high standards in meeting their flying, maintenance and training commitments. </para>
          <para>It could be argued that fault lay in the system where physical improvements to security that had been requested were not provided. I do not share this view entirely as it was within local authority to make alternative arrangements pending the introduction of improvements. In any case, it will always remain extremely difficult to prevent the irrational action of a person from within one&#39;s own organisation. These points do not excuse the unsatisfactory state of security which existed at the Naval Air Station at the time of the fire and I do not condone or underestimate the faults and inadequacies that this inquiry has exposed. In the face of the fire itself, the performance of that Station&#39;s personnel stands very much to their credit. To enter the hangar and to approach the heat of the fiercely burning fire demanded great courage, a courage shown by many that night. A number of young and inexperienced sailors fought the fire to the point of collapse and after revival continued to volunteer for further duty. Others, well aware of the dangers of the operation, hazarded their lives to remove aircraft from the hangar even to the point of re-entering the burning building after being ordered to leave as the roof might further collapse. Personally, I commend them and believe that honourable members would join me in this. As a result of their actions 16 personnel are being considered for appropriate awards. </para>
          <para>The most significant lesson from this unfortunate affair is that the security of valuable defence assets rests primarily in the hands of the users. Commanding officers must guard their assets as thoroughly as they have been trained to use them. But it is the personal and continual watchfulness of every officer and man that is our foremost defence for the security of our assets. The Chiefs of the three Services share my views in this regard whole-heartedly, and immediately following the fire they took steps to improve security awareness and training on the part of all members of the defence force. While the conclusions indicated that there was much that could be done to improve security by way of modern protection devices, firefighting equipment and provision of security personnel, all these must be weighed against competing demands for limited defence resources of money and manpower. It is a delicate matter of judgment to determine just what proportion of our resources should be devoted to what might be regarded as an insurance premium. </para>
          <para>The fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, has caused me deep concern. I say that with all bluntness. That such valuable equipment should have been destroyed in such a manner is deplorable. That security procedures were not properly observed, and in some respects were inadequate, cannot be excused. They will not be excused. As the Minister responsible I acknowledge to the Parliament the clear and ultimate responsibility I hold in this most unhappy sequence of events. The Nowra fire experience has not been dealt with in isolation. Misfortune can be a harsh tutor. The report of the Board has been closely studied. Where appropriate, the lessons of the Nowra fire will be sternly followed. </para>

            <para>-by leave-I join with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> in commending publicly the courage of those members of the armed Services who displayed great courage and dedication on the night of the fire at the Nowra air base. It is clear from what the Minister has said and from reports in the media that many men extended themselves beyond what would normally be regarded as a reasonable level of endurance and exposed themselves to considerable danger in this display of courage. Those men deserve commendation. I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to note publicly for the record that appropriate action will be taken to acknowledge properly that display of courage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For all that, the report is a most distressing and disturbing document. It is the report of a $9m outrage. It is a farrago of grave errors, breathtaking blunders, crass inefficiency and sheer incompetence. It is the record of massive neglect of duty on the part of numerous members of the armed Services. The most significant part of the document that the Minister has presented to the Parliament and of his statement is that the inferences, especially from the document, make it clear that only the edges of that major scandal have been touched upon. Ten sailors have been charged in summary proceedings and nine have been convicted and fined. Ten officers were censured or admonished but apparently not charged. That is remarkable. The captain runs his ship aground and gets a rap over the knuckles; the gunner&#39;s mate and his offsider are hauled before the drumhead court and are convicted. </para>
          <para>There is another aspect of the Minister&#39;s presentation to the Parliament which leaves me more than a little curious, that is, his display of tenderness about the disclosure of names. He suggests that this is consistent with the practice of the House. As far as I am able to establish through checking with most eminent authorities in this House, it is not a practice established by precedent but rather something that has been done by a Minister on some occasions. As far is I can establish, no consistent pattern of practice is followed in such matters in the terms in which the Minister suggests. I understand that on occasions on which the practice pursued by the Minister on this occasion has been adopted it has been usual to indicate why the practice has been adopted. Usually there are powerfully important reasons, associated with the public interest, to justify the non-disclosure of names in such a situation. </para>
          <para>Let us remember, this is a $9m outrage- a public scandal for which the community has to pay. I shall outline some of the evidence of the scandalous circumstances associated with this incident. A far less serious offence in a civil court would result in full disclosure in the media. In the circumstances at the very least the Parliament of the nation, as the responsible authority husbanding the taxpayers&#39; cash and administering the responsible public offices of government, has a right to know exactly who was charged and with what, who was admonished or censured, or whatever the action was. This is, as far as I can establish, a most unusual procedure for the Minister to have adopted on this occasion. It displays a tenderness for the personal feelings of some people, which is in marked contrast to the total absence of tenderness for other groups in the community who are berated, assaulted and attacked by Government spokesmen from time to time for much less serious matters. </para>
          <para>I say that there are scandalous circumstances associated with this matter. The Minister glossed over the scandalous circumstances rather superficially. In his statement he said, among other things: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The major conclusions of the Board of Inquiry were that various procedures relating to security of aircraft and hangars at the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us look at the unsatisfactory nature of some of these matters to which he referred. At page 3 of the report of conclusions- it is no more detailed than that; it is a bare skeleton from the Board of Inquiry- paragraph 393 (a) states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The aircraft in the hangar could not be securely <inline font-style="italic">locked as</inline> they were not fitted with approved security locks; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a most peculiar set of circumstances. Surely our armed Services are not reduced to using sticking plaster to lock the doors of expensive and highly secret equipment. Paragraph 393 (b) states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The hangar could not be securely locked as some door locking pins could not be engaged, others could be manipulated- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a delicate word to use, but I shall come back to that -  from outside the hangar, and the locks on the doors were not of an approved security type; </para>
          <para class="block">As I understand newspaper reports, the manipulation he referred to consisted of using a broom handle to toss the lock open. This is a most curious set of security arrangements for one of the key defence establishments in this country. The whole thing could be blown open with a broom handle. Such is the complex nature of the security. </para>
          <para>The Minister is a man who makes a profession so often of being a stern patriot in defence of the security of this country. He will not have a word of criticism levelled against the defence Services, more especially against the Department of Defence. He is quick to take defence in their defence. Yet here is more than ample justification for the most stern criticism to be levelled against the Department of Defence, against a section of the defence forces and against the political administration, however far back it goes and whatever area of the Navy it covers. Paragraph 393 (c) states: the offices and stores within the hanger were not secure as they were not fitted with approved security locks, nor were their keys returned on a secure keyboard; </para>
          <para class="block">Apparently we are now going to run our armed Services on some sort of honour system. This is in spite of an acknowledgment in this report that there have been earlier thefts of property from the Nowra base. Paragraph 393 (e) states: the hangar should have been protected by security alarms. Although installation had been proposed in December 1973 and the need agreed, it had not been effected by the time of the fire; </para>
          <para class="block">Who is responsible? We do not know. Somewhere along the pipeline of decision making there has been a breakdown. Perhaps someone in some senior position who is fonder of the more impressive displays that go with new capital equipment has decided that many of the things implicit in this particular section- I shall refer explicitly to those in a few seconds- become much lower priorities when compared with the need for grand displays. As I said, this is a most unhappy set of circumstances. </para>
          <para>On page 4 of the conclusions of the Board of Inquiry paragraph 394 (a) states: the aircraft were not locked in the hangar with full time guards to control access as they were required to be; </para>
          <para class="block">Apparently we are training our armed Services for a part-time war. Paragraph 394 (b) states: although the hangars were classified areas by virtue of the equipment they contained they were not so designated and this was a factor contributing to their inadequate protection; </para>
          <para class="block">Someone simply forgot to put the armaments on the aircraft, to put the shells on the ship, and sent the aircraft to war. What nonsense! How does such an unsatisfactory set of circumstances ever develop in one of the key defence establishments of the armed services of this country? </para>
          <para>Paragraph 394 further states: the arrangements for control of access to the hangar were unsatisfactory in that the lists of those who could draw and return keys was incomplete and not correctly authorised, and there were no procedures in force to determine that these personnel drawing and returning keys were authorised to do so. </para>
          <para>Presumably the tea lady knew more about the functioning of the Nowra base than did the people supposed to be in charge of the administration and operation of security arrangements there. Paragraph 394 also states: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(e)">
              <para>the procedures relating to security patrols were unsatisfactory in that the actual arrangements were not the arrangements ordered, and that the more experienced patrolmen did not carry out rounds of the required frequency or duration, and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(f)">
              <para>the procedures relating to the supervision of the duty watch as a whole were unsatisfactory in that the standard of compliance of the orders was below that desirable, and there were no adequate checks on performance. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That is sheer neglect and laziness not just on the part of the people who neglected to perform those duties but also on the part of the people in senior positions at that base who were supposed to ensure that those duties were carried out. It seems to me that, as a simple principle, the Defence Services would apply some unexpected random checking procedure so that from time to time unexpected checks could be made of the standard of security at armed services bases throughout this country. One shudders with great sense of fear that perhaps what has been exposed here is merely a symptom of a general problem that has been allowed to develop through a deterioration of standards one way or another in the armed services. I turn to page 5 of the report where, under &#39;Conclusions&#39;, paragraph 396 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the various proposals to enhance the security of the Air Station were not put into effect, we attribute to a combination of several causes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Paragraph 396c then indicates that one of the causes was a lack of clarity as to who was responsible for action. So it seems that we are going to have plenty of admirals in the Navy and not enough sailors. It is almost a Gilbert and Sullivan farce. This is an incredible situation and the Minister seemed to brush it aside rather superficially today dealing in no way at all with the details of this $9m outrage which has occurred in Australia. </para>

The Minister is the person responsible for this section of the Department of Defence. How did this situation arise?

          <para>This document discloses a record of laxity and bungling. Paragraph 396e reveals that &#39;in several instances, oversight or procrastination by those responsible for action&#39; was one of the causes of the problems identified by the inquiry. Why have we not had some hard firm tough exposition from the Minister about this matter? Why has there not been the sort of toughness which he likes to display in the words he uses from time to time in the House when dealing with largely irrelevant matters? Why have we not had some tough exposition from him on this oversight and procrastination by those responsible? But in a situation where there is an absence of clarity as to who is responsible for action and when such a damning indictment is tabled in the Parliament with such a short and superficial comment being made by the Minister about it, how can we have any confidence in the defence Services?

              <para>- This represents one of the most scandalous set of circumstances that has been presented to this country. It reveals an absence of security and shows that people are able to jig open with a broom handle the door of the main hangar containing these aircraft comprising a large section of the Fleet Air Arm preparedness. In spite of the acknowledged fact that there have been thefts of gasoline at the base it was still possible to open the door with a broom handle. The Navy was brought to its knees with the jiggle of a broomstick. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The hard fact is that, if procedures had been sound and had been properly followed, this event would not have happened. There has been neglect in the failure to install fire protection equipment and where it has been installed it has been inadequately set up. On that score alone it seems to me that there should be a follow up inquiry to find out who is responsible for that and what sort of decisions took priority over decisions about fire protection at the base and to determine whether this sort of thing occurs in other Australian defence establishments. </para>
          <para>I remind honourable members that this is not the first fire to occur at the Nowra air base. In the course of questioning in this Parliament over some years the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> established that in 1967 there was a fire, on Christmas Eve, at the Nowra air base and the Commonwealth Fire Board, which is supposed to have reported to it all fires, received a report of a fire to a hut involving damage to the value of $8,000. Persistent questioning by the Leader of the Opposition established that there was also the destruction of a trailer containing expensive equipment to the value of $ 1.6m. That was not brought to the notice of the Commonwealth Fire Board. It was not acknowledged in this House when the Leader of the Opposition first started questioning on this matter in the late 1 960s. It seems that there may well be a long history of laxity on the part of the naval authorities, whoever they may have been from time to time, at Nowra in first of all not fully acknowledging their responsibilities by making full disclosure of matters such as this and ensuring that the administration of the air base and of the equipment thereon and of the property which is part of the base was attended to properly. </para>
          <para>What I do find terribly distressing is paragraph 405e which states:  that there are drawbacks in the use of dissimilar couplings on hydrants and on vehicles. </para>
          <para class="block">Fourteen years ago in Townsville there was a fire at a sugar terminal and the local fire brigade was unable to quell the fire and called for assistance on other authorities, such as the Department of Civil Aviation and the Department of Defence, including the Royal Australian Air Force Base at </para>
          <para class="block">Townsville. It was discovered that none of the various fire fighting authorities called upon had common coupling equipment. As a result of that the present Leader of the Opposition proposed then that a common standard ought to be adopted. In government he applied as much pressure as he could to have that objective achieved. This would seem a trivial matter in a situation where there was no fire and no one was expecting one, but we do not anticipate fires. They just happen and they can be quite damaging and extemely expensive holocausts. Fourteen years later the common coupling standard has still not been established. More significantly, within one military establishment there were dissimilar couplings on hydrants and vehicles. Clearly, that must have acted as a serious impediment in the fighting of a fire. </para>
          <para>There is one other aspect I wish to take up before I conclude. It is apparent to me from the report of the Board of Inquiry that it clearly inferred that there are other authorities who bear considerable responsibility in this matter who remained indifferent to submissions about the need for adequate fire-fighting equipment and who established higher priorities than giving adequate attention to the needs of the security of the Nowra naval base. Let us not be under any misapprehension as to the lack of security at the Nowra naval base. A day or two after the fire a reporter from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper was able to enter the base by glibly presenting himself to the guard at the gate. I seem to recollect that he had a meal, played snooker or indulged in some casual pastime without being challenged in any serious way. I found then and I find even more now that the Minister&#39;s comments of that time were totally unconvincing. This document confirms the slackness we have seen. </para>
          <para>Who are the people responsible for the decisions which have allowed these gaps and defects to have arisen in the arrangements at the Nowra naval base? Are they the top brass in the Navy who wanted more and better presentable capital equipment and were prepared to make that their priority at the expense of adequate firefighting and security equipment at the Nowra base? Are the men at the top of the Public Service who have been passing advice to the political administrator at fault? Is it some political administrator? I believe these things need to be sorted out. I repeat that we have a $9m scandal before us. Ten sailors and officers alone should not be receiving the kick in the pants for what has happened. Who are the culprits? We deserve to know. What about the position of the Minister and the head of his Department or, perhaps, both? Is the situation serious enough to represent itself as serious neglect on the part of one or both? The whole thing is bristling with challenging questions which have not been attended to. The sort of patriotism that the Minister likes to throw about so easily on issues of defence is not a sufficient substitute for the information we require now. </para>

              <para>- We intend to give much more detailed consideration to this matter. We are concerned about standards in the Department of Defence as well as in the defence services. We are not fobbed off with some sort of fustian response to the <inline font-style="italic">National Times,</inline> picking semantically on one minor issue, to attack a female journalist who wrote a most telling series of articles about the Department and the Minister. We want to know more. Miss Summers has set in motion a most important public demand for inquiry. We intend to take that up.

But we are gravely concerned that what has been exposed in this instance may be more general than we realise. This country cannot afford another $9m scandal. The taxpayers do not want to see their money frittered away in that manner. The security of this country cannot stand that sort of savage blow against its preparedness.

            <para>- I second the motion. I address myself to the last paragraph of the motion, &#39;Other relevant matters&#39;. What worries me is that an insane person was in the Navy and had a grudge against it without the Navy being aware of it, or being aware of it and not taking appropriate action. This worries me all the more as I have on a number of occasions made representations on behalf of servicemen, including Navy personnel, who, to put it at its lowest, appear to be psychologically unsuited for the Services and yet cannot get a discharge. I realise that a definitive diagnosis of psychosis is not easy and that there may be servicemen who would try to take advantage of a softer policy to obtain an early discharge. I put it to the Minister: Is it really worthwhile for the Services to keep such persons if there is any doubt? </para>

          <para>I have not yet had a chance to read the report of the Board of Inquiry. As far as I know, the Board of Inquiry did not deal with this particular aspect. I assume it met before the trial. It was only at the trial that the question of insanity was raised. I urge the Minister that when the matter is discussed by the committee we are proposing the question of the suitability of Service personnel in general be considered. If Service personnel feel strongly against and obviously seem to have a grudge against the Service some attempt should be made to discharge them at the earliest possible opportunity. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I seek leave of the House to move motions relating to Sessional Orders for the routine of business of the House, the power to add a protest or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum, the Speaker&#39;s discretion relating to the adjournment of the House when a quorum is not present, and the ringing of division bells in successive divisions. If I may, I would like to give a brief explanation of my request for leave. On 10 March the House agreed to seven Sessional Orders relating to the proceedings of the House. Of the Sessional Orders, those relating to the hours of meeting and the adjournment of sittings and time limits for the adjournment debate have effect, unless otherwise ordered, for the remainder of the session. Those relating to the routine of business, the power to add a protest or dissent to a select committee report, the counting of members in a quorum and the Speaker&#39;s discretion as to adjourning the House, and the time forringing division bells on successive divisions operated for the remainder of the autumn period of sittings and ceased to have effect when the House rose for the winter adjournment. There would appear to be no reason against the reinstatement of those Sessional Orders which lapsed when the House last rose. The House will thus have an opportunity to evaluate further the operation of those Sessional Orders. I believe that it is preferable to act in this manner than for a motion now to be introduced for their adoption in the Standing Orders as there are a number of other matters in abeyance which I trust will be resolved and which similarly may be introduced in the form of Sessional Orders and in that way be tried within the Parliament before they are finally adopted in the Standing Orders themselves. For that reason I seek leave to move a number of related motions. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not object to the motions as circulated. We agreed to the matters contained in them during the previous session. I would point out, however, that I think that there is a limit to how long Sessional Orders can be used as a substitute for Standing Orders. I think that the practice of using this method commenced when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> was Leader of the House. I see advantages in it but I do not see it as being a substitute for considering the actual Standing Orders and the changes to those Standing Orders which should be made on a permanent basis. Under these circumstances the House can agree to Sessional Orders and they can be subsequently allowed to lapse by a government without any consideration being given to them by the House- merely by the effluxion of time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Another matter that I wish to raise with the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> at this stage is the question of the consideration of the report of the Committee on Committees and the broader recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee, which should be brought before this House during this session at least. Subject to the Parliament still continuing at that time, I hope that prior to the autumn session the Leader of the House will bring forward the necessary amendments to the Standing Orders to bring about the alterations which are acceptable to the House and which should be made. The Opposition does not object to these Sessional Orders being introduced at this time but considers that the trial period should not be too protracted. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition has raised this matter for discussion today because it believes that this Parliament should consider at the earliest opportunity the appalling display of xenophobia exhibited by a senior Minister over the past week and a half. In a series of speeches, television and radio appearances and newspaper articles the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has vented his prejudice against British migrants who engage in trade union affairs by blaming them for the dire economic straits into which this country is steadily sinking. In making these sinister accusations he has been undeterred by the complete lack of evidence to support his charges and apparently is in no way bothered by the thought that he may be fanning the flames of racial discord and intolerance, which could have devastating implications for a multi-racial society such as Australia is today. However, the Minister has not simply identified the problem as he sees it. He has, in his typically constructive and thoughtful way, proposed solutions to it. He strongly implied that Australian citizens of British origin who get themselves mixed up in strikes should be deported. He said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Their interests are not Australian, their origins are not Australian, and one wonders whether action should not be taken against them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The clear implication there is that he thought deportation should be applied. One of his more Neanderthal back benchers has since suggested that such deportations should be to the Soviet Union. On further consideration the Minister has recently proposed another solution, that migrants not be allowed to stand for trade union office until they have lived in this country for a number of years. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is disgusted and alarmed that a senior Minister should be allowed to parade his fascist fantasies with the apparent approval of the Government he represents. Furthermore, his claim that he has had amazing support from his parliamentary colleagues for what he has been saying elevates this matter beyond the rankings of an individual Minister to the collective view of the Government parties. That is an extremely serious development in this country, but not altogether surprising. Indeed, it can be seen as the logical development of a campaign of scapegoating that his Government has been pursuing with increasing vigour as the economy collapses around it. As unemployment escalates to increasingly record levels, as inflation continues at double figure rates, as economic growth ceases, as farm income declines alarmingly, as our international reserves run down and as the value of the dollar is greatly depreciated, this Government is becoming increasingly desperate and in its desperation is increasingly anxious to pin the blame for its abysmal failures on the trade union movement. </para>
          <para>Minister after Minister is reported in the Press as blaming the unions for the plight of the nation. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in particular fulminates periodically about the need for more legislation to control them. In conducting this vigorous and energetic campaign of buck passing the Government has been entirely undeterred by the fact that the official evidence of strike activity was showing, and continues to show, a very substantial decline in the level of strike action. The first statement by a Government spokesman in recognition of this fact came from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> when he was not in Australia but in Japan. In addressing the JapanAustralia Society in June he was unable to resist the temptation to boast about the extent to which his Government had reduced industrial disputation in this country. He said that, if the rare event of the Medibank national stoppage was excluded, the time lost due to industrial stoppages in 1976 was the lowest since 1968 and that in the March quarter of this year the time lost was the lowest in a March quarter for 5 years and the number of employees involved was the lowest in 10 years, all of which, of course, is true. He was also unable to resist assuring the Japanese audience that the amount of time lost in industrial disputes in Australia was generally less than that due to industrial accidents. That also was true but had not been said by any Minister in Australia up until that time. But it was being said at that time in Japan, not here. </para>
          <para>As all this seemed to be running rather counter to the Government&#39;s developing union bash campaign we on this side of the House were interested to see which view would predominatewould the Government ignore these figures except when placating foreigners whom it wanted to invest here and pursue its union denigration campaign or would it change course, stop blaming the unions and emphasise its record in reducing industrial disputation? But the Government has had no trouble in coping with this quandary. It simply incorporated the decline in industrial stoppages into its extremely short list of achievements but continued full bore with its union bashing campaign. </para>
          <para>Thus the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has twice in the last 2 weeks managed to accuse the unions of wrecking the chances of economic recovery and in the course of the same speech to boast about the substantial diminution in the level of industrial disputation. This absolutely blatant attempt to score both ways on the industrial relations issue vividly exposes the paucity of this Government &#39;s response to the abysmal economic mess it has created. Unable to abandon the ideologically appealing approach to blaming the unions it simply continues that line whilst also emphasising a totally contrary argument. Admittedly it is only the Prime Minister who has perfected this technique. Other Ministers are either totally disregarding the decline in industrial disputation, as is the case with the Minister for Primary Industry, and bashing unions with increasing vigour or, in the case of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a heavy emphasis is being placed on the figures to show what a good job he is doing. </para>
          <para>The spate of attacks on British migrants by the Minister for Primary Industry last week cannot, therefore, be viewed in isolation. They must be seen as a crass extension of the general union bash campaign to a particular section of the trade union movement. But why has the Minister sought to extend the Government&#39;s campaign in this way and to do it with such unbridled vigour? In our view it is not simply a matter of him being an enthusiastic supporter of the Government&#39;s anti-union campaign. </para>
          <para>There is another factor involved, and that is his own gross failure as a Minister in the eyes of the people he supposedly represents- the rural community. The fact is that the farming community is increasingly impatient with his Government&#39;s failure to improve its lot, and well it may be. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has forecast that in 1977-78 real farm income will decline by 14 per cent from its already low level. Whole sections of rural industry are being increasingly vocal in regard to their dissatisfaction with this Government&#39;s performance. Just over a week ago at the time the Minister for Primary Industry launched his attack on British migrants <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barry</inline> Cassell, the Federal Director of the National Country Party, announced he was leaving that job to become National Director of the Cattlemen&#39;s Union of Australia, an organisation that has been trenchantly critical of the Government. The statements <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> made on leaving the National Country Party showed that he was far from satisfied with its performance in government. An article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age of</inline> 8 August 1977 stated: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline>said the NCP had given too much attention to the mining industry at the expense of beef producers. &#39;Australia&#39;s cattlemen have had a gutful &#39;, he said. &#39;The party has forgotten its basic ideology and needs to be reminded of the plight of the cattle industry&#39;. </para>
          <para class="block">The fact that the ex-Federal Director of the National Country Party is disenchanted with the Government regarding its rural policy and regards it as being too concerned with the mining industry at the expense of its traditional supporters gives some idea of the extent of dissatisfaction that exists in the rural community with the Government and in particular with the Minister who is responsible for policy in that areathe Minister for Primary Industry, the man who has been so vocal lately. </para>
          <para>It is surely no coincidence that that Minister&#39;s sudden insight into the cause of our economic problems and his frenzied attempts to spread the message over the last week or so occurred concurrently with the revelation of major dissatisfaction with his performance within his own Party. Nor did his rantings about the British disease cut any ice with those who understand rural problems and are concerned to see policy initiatives undertaken to solve them. I quote from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Age of 1 5 August. It stated: </para>

          <para class="block">So there we have the ex-Federal Director of the National Country Party just over a week ago publicly saying that this campaign of denigration of the trade union movement and the British should stop. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> &#39;s comments demonstrate the patheticness of the Minister&#39;s campaign against British migrants.  His  comments were clearly motivated by the desire to be seen to be doing something to help the farmers. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> said, it is totally negative and totally lacking in positive policy measures to assist the rural industries. </para>
          <para>But it is not just a matter of buck passing and negativism. These comments may well have a decidedly harmful effect on community relations in this country. My colleague the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> will elaborate on this point. But I make the point now that we on this side of the House are greatly concerned that for narrow political purposes a Minister is prepared to make comments that promote racism in this country. The cheapest political response to any problem is to blame some section of the community. But when that section is narrowed to a racial group and totally unsubstantiated sweeping allegations are made in regard to them, one is playing with fire, particularly in a multi-racial society such as ours. Such simplistic notions can be attractive to people who are desperate to find solutions to our problems and eager to believe that those problems are all due to some group. If that becomes a widespread belief then the basis for racialism, discrimination and perhaps worse is established. Furthermore, by calling for deportation or discriminatory treatment for British migrants because of their participation in trade union affairs, the Minister not only offends the British born but all the nonBritish migrants who are made to realise that they are still regarded as different from Australian-born citizens by some people in power and therefore liable to be denounced or discriminated against. I remind the House that there are three million migrants in Australia and one million children of migrants. That is a large section of our community. All of them must have been deeply disturbed by the events of last week. For some it would have been an uncomfortable reminder of what unscrupulous politicians in Europe were saying 40 years ago. </para>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s statement also demonstrates colossal ignorance of industrial relations. He assumes, as do all his colleagues judging from their public statements, that strikes occur because evil-minded union officials or shop stewards are trying to disrupt industry simply for political purposes. The Minister and his colleagues never stop to think-if they do they never acknowledgethat two sides are involved in industrial relations and that a high level of strikes indicates bad industrial relations but says nothing about the cause. As we have been talking about the British disease, so described by the Minister for Primary Industry, I refer to an article which appeared in a German magazine <inline font-style="italic">Der Spiegel</inline> on 1 August. The article assessed the view of German managers of German companies operating in Britain of the situation in England. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>German managers representing their firms in England have a quite different picture of the &#39;English Disease&#39;. They put major blame on their English manager colleagues. In the opinion of the German managers, if the English worker is correctly approached he is willing to work. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I stress those comments. The German managers stressed that in their opinion it is their English manager colleagues who are to blame for the industrial relations problems in that country. The article goes on to make the point that the German manager in Britain sees poor management, inadequate investment and insensitive industrial relations as the cause of the so-called British disease; not the British workers or their unions. So for God&#39;s sake let us realise that there are two sides to industrial relations. I think the Government&#39;s campaign of denigrating unions because of strikes totally misses the point. Of course, the Government is not interested in discussing the point that there are two sides and that if one simply union bashes this may have extraordinary negative reactions and adverse effects on the community. This point has been picked up by <inline font-style="italic">Rydge&#39;s</inline> magazine which recently reported a study of industrial relations in the Pilbara region by a woman who turned out to be the daughterinlaw of the Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court. This woman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Court,</inline> found that the major reason for bad industrial relations in the Pilbara was not that there were evilminded trade union officials operating there but that management was largely the cause. <inline font-style="italic">Rydge&#39;s</inline> magazine went on in that article to state: </para>

            <para>- It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> in pursuing his epithets and cliches and in trying in some way to answer a cause which he knows is lost, has really not identified and accepted the consequences and the implications of the narrow application of the statement which I made in five sentences at page 5 of a fairly complex speech relating to some of the problems of primary industry. The speech was made in a small country town; in a very rich agricultural region it is true. It was made following the presentation of a publication by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics concerning June trends. In that article the Bureau estimated that the real income per farm was expected to fall by as much as 14 per cent during the next 12-month period. From that I went to analyse some of the factors which were contributing to low incomes for farmers. Among those factors- it was not the only one- I identified a spread of industrial disputes. At the conclusion of my remarks I shall table this document which sets out industrial disputes as they affected primary industry from 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1977. It is an appalling list of incidents where, not as a result of industrial disputes but, in many instances, peculiarly politically based attacks, there has been a disruption of income which should be flowing back to primary producers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As if that were not enough, only today I have had a report that in the rice industry there is a dispute between the Federated Storemen and Packers Union and the Federated Millers and Mill Employees Association, as a result of which it seems that 1 100 tons of bagged rice destined for Papua New Guinea and a cargo of 20 000 tons due to be loaded at Portland will not be loaded. It seems that the bans will cause significant unemployment in Echuca and Deniliquin. It is not only the rice growers who will suffer but also the very men whom honourable members on the other side purport to represent-the very men whom trade union leaders are supposed to represent. They are the ones who are suffering. That, of course, was the meat in my message. Let me state again what I said. There are a number of factors which prejudice the recovery of the Australian economy. As far as the rural sector is concerned, there are a number of consequences of industrial disputes, among other factors, which are prejudicing the level of income for those who are at the moment unfortunately amongst the lowest in expectation generally in average weekly earnings. </para>
          <para>It is in those circumstances that nobody wants to deny that there are factors which we need to do something to correct. I have not peculiarly identified one sector. I shall come back to the British disease in a moment. What I have done is say that there are communist Australian trade union leaders. I have referred to radical left wing trade union leaders. Many of them are supported and fostered by members of the Australian Labor Party in this House and elsewhere in Australia. These people are intent not just on pursuing industrial action but on pursuing political action which, for example, has led to a complete embargo on the shipment of wheat to Chile. I am told that today Chile is one of the principal markets of East Germany. So apparently communists on the other side of the world are able to take advantage of the market but not the Australian wheat growers. The end product is not that Australian labour in any way receives a benefit, but that the individuals who are being led by the nose find that they have fewer job opportunities. That is really the background behind the statement I made. </para>
          <para>It also needs to be said that there are a number of factors within the trade union movement about which we need to be concerned. Of course it is not peculiar that I have referred to the British disease. That is not something original. It has been referred to by many august authorities around Australia and around the world. I point out to those on the other side of the chamber who pretend that I am saying something racist and pursuing a vendetta against all British migrants, that that is arrant nonsense. In fact, many British migrants left Britain to come here to escape the same shop stewards who they find, to their regret, have followed them here. In fact, most British migrants have contributed enormously to the wellbeing of this country. They have been the lifeblood of this country. The honourable member for Gellibrand suggests that I have said &#39;Deport them &#39;. I did not say that. He read that into a speech. I did not say that. At no stage have I said that they should be deported. What I have said is that there are a few things that can be done within the trade union movement. </para>

              <para>-Even though the honourable member who is now interjecting does not agree, he realises that the fractionalising of the Australian trade union movement which has taken place as a result of the intervention of British shop stewards, has been rejected by many of those who are significant Australian trade union leaders. Let me quote from <inline font-style="italic">The British Disease</inline> by Professor G. C. Allen, Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of London. Amongst other things, he stated: </para>

          <para class="block">He was referring to Britain, and he said a good deal more; but the problem is not peculiar to Britain. I could refer to a good many more authorities. It is interesting, for example, to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fred</inline> Nicol, the Federal  President  of the Storemen and Packers Union. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> on 3 September 1976 he blasted some </para>

          <para class="block">So, this is not something that has been said peculiarly by me. Indeed, many British migrants nave written to me, communicated with me, and said that they too are concerned. It is true that the British disease does not exist only in the trade union movement, but it is important that we register its effect in the trade union movement. One letter I received from a gentleman in Victoria stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I work in an industry, which, in Victoria, employs approximately 5000 people, and at least 90 per cent of all shop delegates are of British origin. Only a handful are Australian or Maltese. </para>
            <para>In our industry &#39;pommie&#39; shop stewards have been and still are the biggest thorn in the backside of management. They are the most militant, most uncompromising, and most meddlesome pack of people we have ever known. </para>
            <para>The extent of our problem has been so bad that at one stage we had a complete embargo on the hiring of anyone of British origin. </para>

          <para class="block">I am endeavouring to point out to the honourable member for Gellibrand that these remarks are not racist in origin; they are not union bashing, much as he likes to use that phrase. Rather, they are intended to identify some of the problems within the Australian community which need to be corrected if we are again to establish Australia as the sort of country it was pre- 1972, before he and his friends and colleagues made a mess of it. If the honourable member thinks that the remarks I made are without support, I suggest that he look at a poll that was conducted by Channel 7, Melbourne, last Thursday and Friday, when 26 32 1 people voted in support of my remarks and 1 1 305 voted against them. </para>
          <para>Even within the hierarchy of the trade union movement there are people who very strongly support the remarks I made. It is important that we realise that the remarks were made in a narrow but very pertinent context. In &#39;An Overview of the Problems of Migrants Workers&#39;- a paper delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr June</inline> M. Hearn in an industrial relations program at the University of Melbourne in July 1976- she mentioned the Ford workers strike in Victoria in 1973 as a graphic illustration of union leaders being completely out of touch with their rank and file, who were mainly southern European. She referred to union shop stewards: . . . being forced to admit publicly their ignorance of migrant workers&#39; needs that went far beyond claims for increased wages. </para>
          <para>She also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Similarly, in the same industry in South Australia in the early 1970s, migrant (predominantly British) workers were involved in repeated unofficial stoppages and alleged acts of industrial sabotage. The pommie shop-steward stirrer&#39; stereotype - these are not my words; these are <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hearn&#39;s</inline> words- has been grossly exaggerated but, in some industries, particularly the metal trades, the incidence of Britishers as job delegates is quite marked, especially in regions of heavy migrant concentration, for example, the La Trobe Valley in Victoria. Many British migrant unionists, unencumbered by a language barrier, familiar with similar trade union institutions and practices in Britain and often schooled in a union system that relies heavily on strong shop-committee organisation, have been responsible for a substantial militant input into the Australian trade union scene. </para>

            <para>The tragic truth is that British socialism has had a devastating case to make out against postwar union leadership. Men ought to be judged by their record, and their record is contemptible, smug and self-assured, oblivious of any criticism. They have encouraged British industrial workers in habits and attitudes, in rules and procedures, in illusions and fantasies, which have turned the British working class into the coolies of the Western world and Britain into a stinking bankrupt industrial slum. </para>

            <para>The direct total social gain from industrial action was not merely negligible, it might well have been negative. Neither in this country nor anywhere else - he was speaking of Britain- have trade unions been able to increase the share of wages and total national income. The increase in money wages has been frustrated by rising money prices. These rob the wage earner or his wife of the expected gain. Frustration and anger are the result. The indirect loss due to the resultant worsening of the balance of payments and the enforced slow-down of expansion was on the contrary immense. The crocodile tears shed by some about the fate of the low paid workers, the unemployed, the sick and the old is surely disingenuous. It is trade union action which through wage induced price movements has created the basic problem. </para>

          <para class="block">Tragically, there is a British disease. The British disease does not affect everybody. The British disease, as I have spoken of it, affects a few. It affects a few employees and a few in management. It is one of those elements which unfortunately have contributed to the rundown of the British economy. I hope that the British economy is on the mend and that the optimistic forecasts of the British High Commission will be realised. But my concern is not with Britain; it is with Australia. My concern is with the effect that industrial lawlessness has had on the incomes of the Australian community, on the maintenance of industrial harmony and on re-employment in this country. The former Labor Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> shortly after his appointment as Treasurer remarked that one man&#39;s pay increase can well be another man&#39;s job, and how pertinent that is. </para>
          <para>The whole reason for the campaign that I have been conducting is not to damn any one individual but to talk about those factors which have prejudiced economic recovery and are delaying re-employment in this country. If Australia is to recover we need to generate new employment opportunities. We need to minimise industrial lawlessness. We need to ensure that both management and trade union members coordinate and co-operate to regenerate this country so that those who are at the end of the line, such as the farmers I represent, are not totally disadvantaged. There is no doubt that the few words I spoke in five sentences at Tanunda nearly a fortnight ago have echoed around every town, village and community in Australia. They have won enormous support, and they have won support because they identified a basic problem. It is only the few; but, if we can correct the problems that those few have generated, I believe that our whole economy will be regenerated in a way which will contribute towards the realisation of what the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> will put forward in his Budget Speech tonight. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis).</inline> It is obvious that the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is unrepentant about the deliberate, outrageous, vile, detestable attack he made on workers in this country, in particular migrant workers. The Minister has claimed that the speech was made to a small group of people in a country town, but in fact copies of the speech were put into the Press boxes in the Press Gallery in Parliament House and therefore it was meant to get the publicity it did. Further, the Minister quoted a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hearn</inline> as supporting his stand. In the Melbourne . <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> on 1 1 August an article appeared under the  headline &#39;Sinclair gets a blast. Produce facts- expert&#39;. The Minister has not produced any facts today.  His  claims have been biased and unsubstantiated. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hearn</inline> is quoted as saying, amongst other things: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>All Australians would do themselves a lot more credit if they examined the causes of conflict rather than blame British migrants. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hearn</inline> thinks about the Minister&#39;s remarks. I will have a few words to say about all these people the Minister has won to his side in a few moments. This is the action of a desperate individual whose long history of vicious union bashing is well known. The depths of degradation to which he and his colleagues will sink in order to take the heat off the Government for its abysmal failure to add up as a government are hard to imagine. Having weakened the economy- deliberately wrecked it- and deliberately created record unemployment levels, they are now callously and deliberately imposing the burden of their inadequacies on the backs of workers- in particular, migrant workers in this country. This phoney attempt to shift the blame from the Government is being exposed day after day by people in the community who are demanding that the Government get on with the job. The outburst by the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party has brought to the light of day the evil and vicious intent underlying the Government&#39;s tactics in this matter. He talks in terms of having the support of individuals in country organisations. But my friend, the honourable member for Gellibrand, referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> who was, until a few days ago, an official of the National Country Party. He made certain remarks in the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Stock and Land.</inline> I wonder how much support the Government and in particular the Minister is getting from the Cattlemen&#39;s Union of Australia which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> now heads. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The union has been militant, favouring direct action. ... <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> has said that his union represents &#39;desperate men&#39; who regard militancy as the best weapon to force government action. </para>
            <para>He said: &#39;If things are not going well and we do not get a reasonable response to our pleas, we will be forced to be far more aggressive. </para>
            <para>That could mean withholding stock from the market and other forms of direct action*. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I wonder what category <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> would come into? If he happened to be a British migrant, would he be sought out for special attention? I wonder whether he would be deported. </para>
          <para>To ensure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> &#39;s statement is regarded as taking the Minister to task about his union bashing, let me quote from a Press release- it is not a comment- signed by Barry Cassell and dated Sunday, 14 August 1977. He talks about Tuesday night&#39;s Budget as an opportunity for the Federal Government to reduce the burden on country Australia. He said that to do this, 3 key elements are necessary, including redistribution away from country people of some of the unfair costs of controlling inflation. The third point he makes is that there should be positive policy initiatives to replace negative British and union bashing. What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> thinks about the actions and the ravings of the Minister is well defined in his statement. The Minister&#39;s tactics are a desperate attempt to hoodwink the Australian people; to take the minds of people off the further attack that undoubtedly will be made on the living standards of Australian workers in the Budget to be delivered this evening by the prince of posers, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> The tactics are doomed to failure, however, because the people of this country have had enough of this Government&#39;s incompetence and dishonesty. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has not proved his allegations that the British disease, whatever that is, has been imported into Australia, nor has he said who imported it. On the contrary, the figures show the real position. Let me state the position in respect to the working days lost and show how the position deteriorated in 1977. The number of working days lost in 1976 due to industrial action represented 70 per cent of the total figure. In 1975 it was 45 per cent and in 1974 it was 40 per cent. It is interesting to note that this represents less than 1 hour, 57 minutes and 12 seconds, to be precise, for each member of the work force. More working days are lost in Australia due to the common cold. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has not proved his argument because he cannot prove, any more than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> or any of his Ministers can, that there has been an inordinate amount of industrial unrest in Australia. The Prime Minister cannot prove it because the facts tell a different story, as I have indicated. But it suited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> to pick out some phrases that he found temporarily appealing and to voice it about the countryside. It is an old technique of taking a lie or a half truth and repeating it ad nauseam in the hope that some people might find it convenient to believe it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has certainly managed to flush out the fascists in our society. </para>

              <para>- It is the old technique of taking a lie or a half truth and repeating it. This has been done by the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party. He thought that the deportation of a few British unionists would solve the problem. But this was not enough for some of his followers. He gathered around him all these elements in the community. One of these followers was interviewed on the television program <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> last week. She thought that deportation was not good enough. This wealthy Sydney dowager, Lady Braddon, thought that the penalty should be something more final. She did not want to say what she meant by that, but plainly she was implying something along the lines of shooting being too good for them. That is the sort of situation that is created by the irresponsible statements of the Minister. </para>

          <para>Migrant workers, in particular British migrant workers, are being sought out for special treatment. They will have the threat of deportation hanging over their heads like the sword of Damocles. This is what is happening. It is designed to create tame cat unions so that they are easy prey for the people who support this Government. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> who will follow me in the debate must dissociate himself from the remarks of the Minister for Primary Industry. On the issue of deportation, he has to guarantee migrants in this country that the threat of deportation will not be used as a weapon against individuals. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs shakes his head. He has an obligation to do as I suggest. </para>

              <para>-It is not a matter of getting excited. The patronising way in which the Minister answered a question I asked him this afternoon about citizenship is indicative of his attitude. For instance, I nope that the deportation sections of the Immigration Act are not implemented in accordance with the wishes of the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party. I hope that the Minister will not exercise his discretion in the way he did when dealing with the representations of an Italian worker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi</inline> who is still under threat of deportation, notwithstanding that three High Court judges indicated that there had been a denial of natural justice and that the other three High Court judges were of the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi</inline> had been treated unfairly and that the concept of natural justice did not apply in the administration of the Minister&#39;s decision under the Immigration Act. The Minister must stand up and be counted. He has to say that justice will apply. In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi.</inline> I wonder whether the Minister can guarantee a reference under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act which has been passed but which still has not been proclaimed? I believe it has not been proclaimed because Ministers like the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs want to write into the legislation sections which would not preclude the operation of section 14, of the migration section. I also want a guarantee that this will not happen. The Minister must also stand up and assure migrant workers in this country that this legislation will not be used as a bludgeon to batter them into submission and make them pawns in the game of chess played by the employer organisations represented by honourable members on the government benches. </para>

              <para>- As the honourable member for Bowman says, it was not much good. He characterised his speech by the use of emotional and high-flown phrases. Let me remind the House of a few of them. He claimed there had been an attack on migrant workers- there has been no such thing; union bashing- there has been no such thing; evil and vicious intent- there has been no such thing; and ravings. The only ravings I heard this afternoon came from the Opposition members when they talked about what the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> meant by his statement in a speech he made recently in South Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I want to deal with one thing right at the start. Both the speakers for the Opposition have reiterated the untruth that the Minister for Primary Industry talked about the deportation of migrants who have taken part in union activities. The Minister clearly refuted that statement, but that did not deter the honourable member for Melbourne one iota. He spent half his speech talking about the deportation that he claimed the Minister for Primary Industry had talked about. The fact of the matter is that the Minister for Primary Industry never talked about deportation. I should like to make one thing perfectly clear to the Opposition, to listeners to the broadcast of these proceedings, to migrants in this country and to the House: The Migration Act 1958 confers power for the deportation of persons who have not become Australian citizens in certain defined circumstances. In summary, those powers can be invoked only when a person granted permanent entry, not having become a constituent member of the Australian community, has been convicted for crime, or subject to the right of appeal to a commissioner, on grounds of unsatisfactory conduct generally. There is no intention to change that situation. Obviously, all this talk about the deportation of people taking part in union activities is a figment of the imagination of the Opposition. It is deliberately trying to frighten migrants by this talk of deportation. I have just read out the Migration Act 1 958 and how it is administered. </para>

              <para>-I am denying it right now. I should like to move to the subject of migration because that is my area of responsibility. I think it is appropriate that I should talk about the matter of public importance as it affects migrants, particularly British migrants. It is a simple matter of fact that people from the United Kingdom and Eire have formed the backbone of the immigration program for many years. More than one and a half million British migrants have come to Australia since 1947 and have made a magnificent contribution to the development of Australia. That has been acknowledged by this Government and by the Minister for Primary Industry. As with many migrants, British migrants have played a big part in Australia&#39;s postwar progress and in our economic, social, political and cultural development. As the largest migrant group, it is not surprising that British migrants have risen in prominence m many areas of Australian activity- in the professions, industry and commerce, politics, the academic world, the arts, sport, employer organisations, trade unions and the Public Service. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>We have a policy, which has been pursued by successive governments, of saying that when people come to make their homes in Australia they should bring to Australia the good things of their country of origin and leave behind the negative aspects. This has been brought up by the Minister for Primary Industry in a number of statements over the past few weeks. It must be obvious to everybody that with an influx of over three million people since the end of the Second World War some of the migrants from various countries- not one particular country- will not fit into the Australian scene as well as the majority. The vast majority of migrants from all countries have adapted to the distinctive Australian industrial relations and the political and cultural scenes and have helped in their evolution. I should like to pay tribute to the migrants from over one hundred different source countries throughout the world for the contribution they have made, are making and will continue to make. Their impact on the work force has been considerable and critical to the success of many industries. </para>
          <para>The latest detailed occupational figures I have come from the 1 97 1 census. At that time the total number of persons employed was 5.24 million, of which 541,000, or 10.3 per cent, were born in the United Kingdom and Eire. The emphasis on the role of the overseas born in industry tends to obscure the fact that the overseas born in general and the United Kingdom born in particular have enriched our level of skills in all occupations. For example, at the time of the 1971 census over 10 per cent of the United Kingdom and Eire born males in the work force were in professional, technical and related occupations, compared with 8.7 per cent of the Australian born male work force. At that time 2.5 per cent of the United Kingdom and Eire born males were engaged as skilled metal and electrical tradesmen, compared with 1.7 per cent of Australian born males. This trend is evident also in other skilled areas. At that time 2.4 per cent of the United Kingdom and Ireland born males were engaged in carpentry and woodwork, compared with 1.7 per cent of Australian born males; 2.1 per cent of United Kingdom and Ireland born males were engaged as bricklayers, compared with 1.1 per cent of Australian born males; and 1.3 per cent of United Kingdom and Ireland born males were engaged as trademen and painters, compared with 0.6 per cent of Australian born males. These statistics overwhelmingly confirm the significant role that British migrants have played in the Australian work force. It is a continuing role which this Government and, I am sure, the people of Australia recognise and appreciate. </para>
          <para>A more recent survey of the work force which was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in November 1974 examined the educational status of the civilian labour force. Of all the United Kingdom and Ireland born males 43.7 per cent had post-school qualifications, that is, a degree, diploma, trade certificate, et cetera, compared with 28.8 per cent of all overseas born, 32.6 per cent of the Australian born males and 34.4 per cent of the total male work force. It is absolutely hypocritical for this Opposition to say in this House that it supports migrants. It is a fact that under its administration the numbers of British migrants coming to this country were overwhelmingly reduced. One of the first actions I took as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was the first visit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words- have an antipathy towards the British migrants but that in fact we welcomed them. I repeat that it is hypocritical of the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> and members of the Opposition generally to claim here, with their hearts on their sleeves, that they are defending the British migrants. That is absolute nonsense. By their actions they shall be known. Their actions were significantly against British migrants coming to Australia during the time of their administration. </para>
          <para>Obviously an attempt is being made to paint the Fraser Government as anti-migrant. It is not anti-migrant; in fact, it is pro-migrant. This can be demonstrated quite easily and conclusively. It was the Labor Government which disbanded the Department of Immigration and incorporated it in die Department of Labour and Immigration. It was the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government which set up the new Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We have increased the number of migrants coming to Australia. During the Labor Administration the lowest number of migrants since 1947 came to Australia. What a record to be proud of that is. Yet here we hear the Opposition pretending to be concerned about migrants. It is anti-migrant; it has always been anti-migrant. </para>
          <para>A number of additional measures have been brought in by this Government. The family reunion conditions have been broadened. Additional to occupational categories entrepreneurs and smaller entrepreneurs have been brought in. We have had special Indo-Chinese refugees projects, special arrangements for the migration of Lebanese, amnesty for illegal migrants, the abolition of re-entry visas, the establishment of an ethnic affairs branch, the establishment of the national accreditation authority for interpreters and translators, migrant resource centres, the establishment of the Australian Population and Immigration Council, the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council and the establishment of a permanent broadcasting authority which provides a special broadcasting service to cater for the rights of ethnic radio. There is the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council, and I could go on. </para>

As the purposes of the Bills and the funding were outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> in his second reading speeches, I do not propose to go over the purposes of the two funds or to extol the virtues at least of the International Development Association&#39;s programs or to speculate very far about the International Fund for Agricultural Development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have noted in reading, from overseas sources, related to this matter that there seems to be a fairly strong suspicion that the International Fund for Agricultural Development was established as a concession to pressure from developing countries especially for the initiation of a common fund as part of a new international economic order. It is suggested by leaders of some developing countries, perhaps displaying a similar bent of mind and a cynicism which is no doubt the product of so many frustrations and disappointed hopes at the hands of promises scarcely fulfilled by developed countries, that the concession was originally initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kissinger</inline> to buy off pressure from the spokesmen for the developing countries. In any event, it does seem that there is a considerable degree of scepticism among many of the developing countries over just how helpful the International Fund for Agricultural Development is to be in terms of the massive problems which confront developing countries today. </para>
          <para>There has been a great deal of disillusionment in the world about aid for developing countries and what is going to be achieved. I must confess to some disenchantment myself. I remember when I came into this Parliament some 16 years ago that there was then so much hope as to what could be achieved if only the rich countries would make the appropriate sacrifices to allow redistribution of command over resources to benefit the developing countries. All sorts of optimistic speculations were put forward about what could be achieved and how the poor countries could be released from their imprisonment within poverty. It was common then to talk about the one per cent decade of development. At the end of that period, one per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries was to be contributed to the developing countries for their needs. Some 16 years later the most we can achieve according to the official statistics on development aid from developed countries is an average of 0.36 per cent of one per cent of the gross national products of those developed countries. Of course, there is quite a range of contributions from various countries providing aid but it is disappointing to note that two particularly strong economies, Japan and the United States of America, are contributing respectively 0.24 per cent and 0.27 per cent of gross national product in the form of official development assistance to developing countries. </para>

              <para>-The Minister interjects that they have now undertaken to contribute more but they could contribute a lot more and still not be impressive when their contributions are compared with what is contributed by other countries. By and large our own record, although still short of what we desire to achieve, is not bad compared with many other countries and is a long way ahead of those much larger and considerably wealthier countries in terms of the size of their economies. The elusive one per cent contribution for the development of the underdeveloped countries is as elusive now as it ever was, if not even more elusive. The poorest countries are staying that way while the wealthiest are getting much wealthier. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Between 1965 and 1975 the immense disparity in per capita income between the poorest nations and the developed nations worsened. Theoorest nations, that is countries with less than 200 per capita have 43 per cent of the world&#39;s population. The developed nations have 25 per cent. In 1965 the poorest nations had a per capita income of only 3 per cent of the $4,200 per capita income of the developed nations. By 1975 the per capita income of the poorest nations had fallen to 2.7 per cent of the per capita income of the developed nations of $5,500. The gap is widening. The increase in income for the poorest nations in that period was 15 percent against the increase for the wealthiest nations of 3 1 per cent. This is another means of dramatically illustrating the way in which resources in the world are being redistributed and allocated to the benefit of the wealthiest countries. The poorest stay poor while the wealthiest get much wealthier. </para>
          <para>Projections for 1985 show that the increase in incomes for the poorest countries will be about 20 per cent to approximately $180 per capita. </para>
          <para class="block">For the wealthiest developed nations the increase will be 47 per cent to $8,100. In other words, by 1985 the poorest countries will have a per capita income only 2.2 per cent of the per capita income of the developed countries. One can see that it is a losing race for the developing countries. The gulf is widening to their disadvantage in terms of the level of resources they are able to command from those additional resources being made available in the world each year. What it means is that at the most the annual increase in the per capita income for the poorest countries will be between $ 1 and $2. It all sums up to a most depressing picture. </para>
          <para>There has been much talk, not a little posturing, a great deal of moralising and, frankly, very little achievement in terms of settling for the goals and solid results which have been set for the future and spoken about so much. The poorest countries are still bedevilled with the most depressing social and economic conditions. Compared with the developed countries the infant mortality rate is 8 times higher. The life expectancy rate is one-third less than for the developed countries. The adult literacy rate is 60 per cent less. The nutritional level for one person in two is below the acceptable standards of developed countries. Millions of infants have less protein than is required to allow the optimum development of the brain. </para>
          <para>It is this sort of aid to poor countries which the Premier of Queensland, steeped in ignorance and indelibly dyed in bigotry rails against. He does it in the most poorly informed way. He is demanding that the sort of aid Australia provides for developing countries should be made available within the country. I am disappointed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has firmly rebuked him, perhaps with some subtlety, but nonetheless he has firmly rejected the sorts of comments he is making which I suspect are gaining some public currency at least in Queensland. What the Premier of Queensland has to realise is the extent to which aid programs are funded from our overseas reserves. They have no impact on the domestic economy. Therefore, it is irrelevant for him to talk in the terms in which he has been talking. We are not denying people within this country resources which would otherwise be available. </para>
          <para>To the extent that aid programs take the form of various goods fabricated in this country, to cut back on those programs would mean simply that people currently in employment producing them would become unemployed. If it is the Premier&#39;s argument that the moneys should be spent domestically all it means is that there would be a transfer of resources from one industry in which people are employed fabricating various goods for aid programs to another industry. All he is doing is transferring unemployment within the community. He is making no contribution towards the common welfare of the community. In fact, at a time of slack economic activity like the present a most powerful argument can be mobilised in support of the fabrication of more goods in this country as part of an aid program. In that way apart from the humanitarian commitment in this support of aid more opportunity would be provided domestically. </para>
          <para>It is incontestable that programs like those before us are helpful but they are limited in their help. I have already indicated that for all the years in which we have been talking about the breakthrough in our determination to lift the poor countries out of poverty, as members of the wealthy club of countries in the world we do not seem to have achieved much. In fact, it would seem on analysis of what has been achieved that what we have been doing has, in effect, been very much like ploughing the sea. As I mentioned, we have achieved a situation in which development assistance aid from the developed countries is still only 0.36 per cent of gross national products. The most advanced countries in the Western part of the world, the United States and Japan, have consistently deplorably poor records. One would have thought that out of enlightened self-interest they would have much to gain from a more generous commitment to aid. Those 2 countries have deplorably poor records of commitment in development aid programs. It is clear the more one analyses the available material that the rich countries are determined to stay that way. </para>
          <para>I happen to think that the countries within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which were responsible for the substantial increase in the price of oil were responding to a set of perfectly understandable circumstances. There was an opportunity for them to seek to redistribute in their favour some of the resources of the world from the wealthier countries. I know the argument that the less developed countries have suffered as a result of this action. I shall come back to that later. It is not as black and white as the critics of the action of the OPEC countries would like to make out. I am sceptical about the genuineness of the claims of the people who make this assertion. By and large they do not have a powerful record of assistance to poor non-oil-producing underdeveloped countries in the past. It seems more that they are using a convenient symbol to protest their concern at the treatment which has affected them as rich countries. In any case, the rich countries were to suffer some sort of redistribution of resources to the OPEC countries as a result of that action. It is clear that the rich countries have taken a number of measures which have over a relatively short time effectively reduced the real benefits of that redistributional exercise by the OPEC countries. I harbour the strong suspicion that one of the reasons America is prepared to bear with a substantial balance of payments deficit is to make some effort to inflate its way out of real cost of its oil bill. </para>
          <para>The problem with the development of the underdeveloped countries as I see it is that providing aid of this sort is merely a little superficial dressing aimed to cover over some deeply seated problems in the world economic order. It means relatively little- the fact that relatively little has been achieved by programs so far is evidence of that- in terms of the nature and depth of the problem. I should be much more impressed if I could see determined action by the developed countries to accept more of the manufactured finished products of the developing countries. I find something repugnant about the symbiotic relationship that so many of the rich countries like to postulate as the proper relationship between themselves and poor countries whereby they accept the primary products and raw materials of the poor countries and the poor countries accept their finished products. </para>
          <para>It is clear that the greatest advantages lie with those countries which are industrially advanced and continuing to develop, the countries with the technological knowhow and the industrial resources behind them. That is where the greatest proportion of value added in the economic order is derived. At the level of primary production and the production of raw materials the worth of value added in the production system is much lower. Until the developed countries are prepared to accept more of the finished manufactured products of developing countries, I am afraid we will continue to hold the poor countries as hostages to poverty. The current problems which this country is facing as a result of our trade relationship with the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations- we sell twice as much to them as we buy from them- are evidence of the sort of prickly political problems that will confront us in the future. In the longer term we could easily find that because of the tough and uncouth attitudes expressed by Australian Government spokesmen we will become increasingly irrelevant to the needs of those near neighbours as they develop more industrially. </para>
          <para>The problem with this Government is that, as one interprets its behaviour towards ASEAN countries, it is a disciple of the economic principle of unequal development- a euphemism for keeping all we have and trying to force a few sales on to those who are less well off. It is a remarkable principle of economic development for the needy that this country postulates quite firmly and quite inflexibly that aid by trade will go from the less developed to the developed- for instance, from the ASEAN countries to Australia. I do not underrate in any way at all the very great political problems in this country at the present time in attending to this issue, or the very difficult economic considerations which have to be weighed up; but that is no justification for the rather crude way in which our representative at the recent ASEAN discussions put down the representatives of those countries like an Australian Bjelke-Petersen with an imported nasally Oxford accent. He spoke well even if he thinks poorly. </para>
          <para>There is not so much a need for a proliferation of gimmickry and new organisations; so I have some reservations about the development of a new one, the International Fund for Agricultural Development. As I read the Bill, it seems that what is proposed there can be well done by established agencies. In fact, the Fund will be calling on the services of established agencies. In other words, we need more, and more effective, aid through existing agencies. We need a freeing of the trade barriers which hold down the level of economic growth and the standard of living which can be provided in the developing countries. The wealthy countries collectively should commit themselves to providing grant assistance and much less assistance by way of loans. We have a good record in that respect at least. The developed countries should accept a moratorium on the debts of the underdeveloped countries incurred in previous loan commitments. We ought to play as influential role as we can, in the appropriate international agencies, to that end. We have to recognise that the paradigm of Western capital intensive development is not the best for the poorest countries. I acknowledge in this respect the important influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Papua New Guinea in encouraging the Papuans and New Guineans and the Australian Government, which was the colonial administrator of the then Territory, to change the emphasis from an almost exclusive preoccupation with capital intensive development to one which tended to develop towards equal emphasis for labour intensive activity within the economy aimed at mobilising more traditional forms of economic activity. </para>
          <para>The evidence from the developing countries, especially of Africa, is clearly that, whilst on paper one country can look extremely impressive in terms of the economic growth rate it is achieving and the per capita income that is achieved in this way, when an analysis is made, in some rigorous depth, of how that income is distributed the country is found to be quite poorly off. It is poorly off in the sense that some elites, some working class and middle class elites, are established, who are able to earmark for their own benefit the largest proportion of the benefits coming from that development, whilst on the other hand there is a very large dispossessed group of people who are coming from traditional village life into the cities and the large urban centres and are unable to obtain employment, and they become alienated and present all sorts of social problems and stresses for that sort of area. </para>
          <para>As against that, one can look at another country. I confess freely that I have been enormously impressed with the achievements of Tanzania in this respect. On paper it has not had spectacular economic growth rates and certainly it does not have terribly impressive per capita levels of income, but in terms of mobilising all the people into the work force and providing an opportunity for them-providing a place under the sun, as it were, for all the people- it has been enormously successful. Perhaps it displays some rather disciplinarian, if not authoritarian, methods which are unacceptable to us, but I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nyerere</inline> pointing out clearly to this country, at a luncheon in this building, that the principles for social and economic development in a country that is relatively poorly endowed with economic resources, as Tanzania is, are quite different from those of wealthy countries such as this one. Australia, for instance, can afford the massive blunder of an F 1 1 1 aircraft on the part of a government, involving some millions of dollars- in fact, hundreds of millions of dollars- and can absorb that sort of problem without significant economic disruption and dislocation. A poor country cannot afford that expensive margin of error. </para>
          <para>The wealthy countries have to dedicate themselves to stable prices for commodities and, again, to a better revenue deal for the developing countries. The two things do not necessarily go together. The common fund is the sort of concept I have in mind, with all the problems it has- and it certainly bristles with problems-in terms of a stable price system for the commondities of the developing countries. I am highly suspicious of the newfound interest of the Americans. I am concerned that perhaps the Americans are considering that there are clear benefits for America in terms of stable prices for some of the mineral resources that she would wish to import. That is fair enough as long as the commitment does not stop there; as long as it goes further and is a genuinely altruistic commitment for the common good of mankind and is designed to establish a common fund program for other commodities. I repeat that I acknowledge freely the enormous problems with which this concept bristles, but the fact that a concept or a proposition bristles with problems is not sufficient justification for being caught flat-footed as the Australian Government was recently in international discussions on this subject, leaving the clear impression that we were not terribly interested in the concept at all. </para>
          <para>I mentioned the need for a better revenue deal for the developing countries. Only 10 per cent of the total value added for their products, as they go through the various processes to end up as finished products in some sort of manufactured or processed form on world markets, goes to the poor countries. That happens because the marketing and the processing of these products is in the hands of the wealthy countries. Again I acknowledge the problems of overcoming this situation. I am not so much concerned about the conspiracy interpretation of the transnational!, as they now seem to be called, but rather the enormous problems of developing the technology, the marketing skills, the techniques, the outlets and so on which are necessary to overcome die sort of problem I have identified. The fact that there are such problems is not sufficient justification for not trying to do something. The developing countries ought to be encouraged to move in this direction through support from established international agencies. The fact that such a small proportion of total value added goes to the poor countries means that their opportunity for capital accumulation is extremely limited, and that in turn means that their opportunity for industrial development and economic growth is seriously constrained. </para>
          <para>A further point that we have to consider is ways in which developing countries can be facilitated to reinvest the profits which are generated in their countries. It is a matter of the most notorious comment that some large, wealthy international organisations are responsible for intensive capital investment in certain development projects in some developing countries that provide limited employment opportunities but quite massive profit returns and that a very large proportion of those profits is drained out of the country to the benefit of the parent company or the international concern. There has to be a determined bid, as a matter of commonsense morality, to allow a substantial proportion of the profits generated in such countries to be reinvested by those countries in their own economic growth and development. </para>
          <para>I shall have to condense some final points that I want to make on these matters because time is running out. Why I find a sense of urgency about these things is obvious. I mentioned a few minutes ago that, as much as wealthy countries like to vaunt what has been done in terms of aid in recent decades, the evidence is that the gap in terms of living standards between the wealthy advanced countries and the poor countries is in fact widening. I admit that the income per capita is improving in the poor countries, but it is improving most moderately and extremely unimpressively compared with the rate of increase in the living standards of the developed countries. </para>
          <para>I noted quite recently a United Nations report that pointed out that the foreign direct investment in 43 developing countries in 1970 was $ 1 ,6 1 0m and that in the same year the outflow of income as repayment on accumulated past investment was $5,340m. Those are the sorts of disabilities under which the developing countries are staggering. The terms of trade move so often to punish the developing countries. In 1960, according to a report I read recently, a selection of developing countries indicated that they could import 6 tractors for the return from 25 tons of exported rubber. In 1965 they could import only 3w tractors for the return from 25 tons of exported rubber. So the terms of trade do tend to move against these countries. There are periods . when they move in their favour, but it seems that the long term trend certainly is not in their favour and certainly bears poor contrast with what happens to the developing countries. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the sort of debt burden that is crippling them. In 1967 it was $50.7 billion for 86 developing countries. In 1975 it was $150 billion. The debt servicing in 1975 on that debt burden was $11.5 billion. The official development assistance aid from the developed countries was only $9.4 billion. So with an allowance for all the aid provided for them they were still more than $2 billion in deficit. That is an example of the ever expanding problem of financing their way in their striving to achieve a better standard of living, to achieve economic development and to try to close the gap between the developed countries and themselves. It is a striving that continues to fail and it will continue to fail while the wealthy countries of the world are so determined not only to hang on to what they have but also to redistribute as much as they can from the increase in the level of resources provided in the world each year to their own benefit. </para>
          <para>I do not believe that our record in recent discussions has left the developing countries of the world with any sense of enthusiasm that they can any longer rely on Australia as a friendly, sympathetic and understanding nation where the aspirations of the developing countries are concerned. Our attitude to the common fund and the new international economic order was one of total unenlightenment. I sincerely trust that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who in so many other ways displays a quite encouraging liberal enlightenment in these sorts of things and a great sense of moral and humanitarian responsibility, will assert himself in relation to this issue and demand that the proper role of Australia is one of sympathetic understanding, of support and of a constructive approach to the problems which I have acknowledged several times already are there in trying to develop a common fund and underwrite a new international economic order. But unless something like that is done and a complete recasting of our approach to development and the needs of developing countries is accepted, I am afraid that we are going to continue to languish in the situation where what we do is very much, as I have said, trying to dam a water flow with a fork. It is ineffective and quite inadequate for the task ahead. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </motion>
          <para>In doing so, I present the Budget for1977-78. </para>
          <para>At the outset tonight I re-affirm the Government&#39;s basic objectives. </para>
          <para>Our first goal is to maintain the underlying trend to lower inflation. </para>
          <para>Our second goal, which is dependent upon the achievement of the first, is to promote moderate and non-inflationary growthin order to create jobs and reduce unemployment. </para>
          <para>This Budget will move Australia further towards achieving those goals and, in so doing, it will build on the foundations laid by last year&#39;s Budget. </para>
          <para>Over the next twelve months the depths of Labor&#39;s recession, and all of the community hardship that went with it, will be put further behind us. </para>
          <para>This Budget is designed to give a lead to the community by addressing itself directly and realistically to our remaining problems. </para>
          <para>One way in which it does so, in a decisive and unprecedented manner, is by lifting the yoke of taxation that has sapped the spirit and initiative of the community over recent years. </para>
          <para>Unlike our predecessors we believe that taxes have taken too much from the community and that people now want greater charge of their own affairs. </para>
          <para>The new tax system which I shall announce in this Budget has been made possible because of the efficiency and economy that we have brought to management of Government expenditures. </para>
          <para>The way is now open to get Australia on the move. </para>
          <para>This Budget charts a course towards lower taxation, towards conservation of the nation&#39;s great energy resources and towards care for those most in need within the community. </para>
          <para>It maintains the thrust towards economic stability without sacrificing any of the major social reforms of our first Budget such as thefamily allowance system. </para>
          <para>Australia&#39;s destiny is a shared responsibility, not something that lies in the hands of governments alone. </para>
          <para>Responsibility also lies with business leaders: it is the private sector that employs most of our workers, makes most of the investment decisions and develops the technologies that can underpin increasing living standards. </para>
          <para>Union leadership bears an equal responsibility: it is the trade union leaders who have to consider the unemployment consequences of their demands for higher pay for those presently in jobs. </para>
          <para>All sections of the community must work together to harness our abundant natural and human resources, if we are to restore vigour and purpose to our national development. </para>
          <para>This Budget sets the nation first; it recognises that there must be a fair sharing of the burdens and responsibilities, and a fair sharing of the rewards. </para>
		  <para>THE RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT</para>
		<para>I turn now to the record of achievement last year. </para>
		<para>The Government&#39;s first Budget was a key element in putting the overall economic strategy in place and, therefore, in the improved economic performance of1976-77. </para>
		<para>We budgeted for outlays to grow in1976-77 at half the rate of1975-76, and for a Budget deficit nearly one billion dollars lower despite the costs of full personal tax indexation from 1 July 1976 and significant business tax incentives. </para>
		<para>An increase of 10-12 per cent in the broadly defined volume of money,M3, was then foreseen as appropriate over1976-77. </para>
		<para>A year later, the Government takes some satisfaction from the record. </para>
		<para>Budget outlays, projected to rise by11.3 per cent, were held to only10.4 per cent, and for the second successive year outlays were contained within the original Budget estimate. </para>
		<para>The deficit, originally put at$2,608m, emerged because of some shortfall in receipts as $2,740m, but nevertheless very much in line with the original estimate. </para>
		<para>M3 increased by 10.6 per cent- well within the range projected. </para>
		<para>The anti-inflationary role of external policy was, in the event, less than had been hoped. </para>
		<para>The burden of Labor&#39;s policy failures on the export and import-competing sectors made devaluation inevitable. </para>
		<para>But, because of determined action by the Government, overall policy was <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> blown off course and the basic strategy was maintained. </para>
		<para>Naturally, the economy is still adjusting to devaluation. </para>
		<para>Indeed, understanding of that adjustment process is essential to any appraisal of where the economy now is and where it is heading. </para>
		<para>The wages area also failed to contribute as much to recovery as it should have done. </para>
		<para>This outcome, beyond the Government&#39;s control, had serious consequences for the speed of recovery and the creation of new jobs. </para>
		<para>The economy has still not fully attained the pre-conditions for sustained growth. </para>
		<para>Solid progress has been made, but furthering it still hinges crucially on the prospects for inflation and income shares. </para>
		<para>On that, I said last yean &#39;Provided there is significantly less than full flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage points in price performance, and a possibly somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can be had in 1 976-77 as a whole. &#39; </para>
		<para>Prices, and to some extent incomes, did largely develop in that way. </para>
		<para>Excluding health and medical services- prices of which have been sharply influenced by changes in health insurance arrangements having nothing to do with inflation as such- the Consumer Price Index rose by 10.2 per cent over the course of 1976-77 compared with 15.4 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>More broadly-based price indicators rose in 1976-77 by some 4 to 6 percentage points less than in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Productivity increased by 3.6 per cent in 1976-77; the profit share rose to 14.4 per cent from 13.5 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
		<para>Company profits increased by 23.5 per cent. </para>
		<para>Although the pattern within-year was not as foreseen, activity for the year as a whole was much as foreshadowed. </para>
		<para>Real gross non-farm product rose for the year as a whole, with growth concentrated in the private sector. </para>
		<para>Consumers spent more, and saved less, out of disposable incomes. </para>
		<para>Business investment, although patchy, strengthened in total; plant and equipment spending, in particular, rose by 6 per cent in real terms. </para>
		<para>Dwelling investment rose strongly for the year as a whole despite some slackness- now being taken up- in the later months. </para>
		<para>Exports were also significantly higher for the year as a whole. </para>
		<para>As presently recorded, economic growth was concentrated in the first half of the financial year. </para>
		<para>Among the reasons for that pattern, which are fully discussed in Statement No. 2 attached, was the effect of devaluation- actual and anticipated -on the timing of expenditures. </para>
		<para>The key point now is that the factors depressing demand and production early in 1977 were temporary ones. </para>
		<para>The forward momentum of private activity is now beginning to re-assert itself. </para>
		<para>Inflation over the year as a whole fell much as expected a year ago. </para>
		<para>Wages costs also grew less fast in 1976-77 than in 1975-76, but the slow-down was less than had been hoped. </para>
		<para>That is closely linked with the major disappointment of 1976-77- the continuation of high unemployment. </para>
		<para>This is a matter of grave concern to the Government. </para>
		<para>Unemployment is a human problem- it is not just a question of statistics. </para>
		<para>It is precisely because of the social and family tragedies that go with unemployment that we have pressed, to the fullest extent, for wage and salary restraint in hearings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
		<para>The grave imbalance between real wages and productivity resulting from the 1974 wage explosion still remains Australia&#39;s major economic problem. </para>
		<para>That problem can only be solved by winding down real wages relative to productivity; while it persists, it makes all talk of <inline font-style="italic">quickly</inline> reducing unemployment merely hollow rhetoric. </para>
		<para>Statement No. 2 presents some material on the extent of this imbalance. </para>
		<para>In the most recent National Wage Case hearing the Commonwealth has presented related evidence. </para>
		<para>The Commission must be prepared to face, with a greater degree of reality, the employment consequences of its decisions. </para>
		<para>The basic point is this; if unemployment in Australia is to be tackled effectively, the real wage distortion in our economy will have to be corrected. </para>
		<para>High labour costs have been deterring employers from taking on new workers. </para>
		<para>All too often, the sums favour the alternativesreplacing men by machines or switching to foreign suppliers. </para>
		<para>Partly for the former reason there was an appreciable lift in measured productivity in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>A 3.5 per cent increase in product saw only a slight employment increase; and, with a growing labour force, unemployment therefore increased. </para>
		<para>There can be no doubt that, had the wage determination processes permitted real wages to decline in 1976-77, recovery would have been stronger and unemployment less. </para>
		<para>Instead, so far from having declined, as has been repeatedly asserted by our political opponents, real wages were actually higher at June 1977 than a year earlier. </para>
		<para>Those fortunate enough still to have jobs had their real incomes improved, but at the cost of throwing others out of work. </para>
		<para>Those trade union leaders and others clamouring for &#39;full indexation&#39; might reflect on that result of their actions. </para>
		<para>So might our arbitral tribunals. </para>
		<para>THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR 1977-78</para>
		<para>This Budget is dominated by two fundamentals. </para>
		<para>First, despite the achievements to date, we still have some way to go in restoring the preconditions for lasting economic growth. 1977-78 must see a further advance. </para>
		<para>Secondly, our policy strategy established last year and since maintained has been the right one. </para>
		<para>That strategy must be held in place. </para>
		<para>Our Budget decisions will give effect to the objective, stated last January, of further reducing the deficit. </para>
		<para>This will permit an expansion in a broadly defined money supply to take place in 1977-78 at a rate a notch or so lower than in the previous year. </para>
		<para>Our Budget decisions will also give effect to our other budgetary objective stated last January- to keep Budget outlays in 1977-78 to within zero real growth. </para>
		<para>We have been mindful, however, of the short term dislocations that might have followed any appreciable reduction of real outlays at this time. </para>
		<para>It is a measure of the painstaking preparation undertaken this year that we have been able to shape the Budget firmly within the parameters of our economic strategy, while accommodating the cost of both last year&#39;s and this year&#39;s major tax reductions. </para>
		<para>Fiscal and monetary policies must be fully supported by the other arms of policy. </para>
		<para>Wage restraint is crucial. </para>
		<para>Externally, Australia&#39;s now clearly strengthening trade account provides an encouraging basis for the current role of external policy. </para>
		<para>There is a mutual dependence between the domestic and external arms of policy which should be explicitly noted. </para>
		<para>In shaping its fiscal and monetary stance for 1977-78 the Government has had this well in mind. Fiscal and monetary laxness such as the benches opposite have urged upon us would undermine our international competitiveness </para>
		<para>This Budget rejects that pitfall. </para>
		<para>It will thereby contribute to a more positive outlook for the major development projects now under way and in the offing and their associated investment inflows. </para>
		<para>In short, it will help to ensure that the favourable effects of last year&#39;s devaluation, now increasingly appearing, will be preserved and not just frittered away. </para>
		<para>Against that background let me say something about the role of the private sector in our economy. </para>
		<para>It is now up to the private sector to respond to the brighter outlook which is in prospect. </para>
		<para>As we have emphasized, a re-vitalized private sector is essential to increased productivity and more jobs </para>
		<para>Governments can only do so much; this Government has consistently pursued the course of making way for expansion of the private sector. </para>
		<para>It is now up to the private sector to play its part in furthering the progress we have made towards establishing, and building upon, the preconditions for economic recovery. </para>
		<para>OUTLAYS</para>
		<para class="block">I turn now to outlays. </para>
		<para>In 1977-7S total expenditures are estimated at $26,656m, an increase of 10.5 per cent or virtually the same increase as in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>I mention <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> of the larger provisions in the Budget; details of these and other provisions are set out in Statement No. 3 and other accompanying Budget documents and in Ministerial statements. </para>
		<para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
		<para>Outlays for social security and welfare purposes are estimated to total about $7,250m in 1977-78, an increase of about 13 per cent on last year. </para>
		<para>These outlays now account for 27 cents in every $1 spent from the Budget, or 56 cents in every $ 1 raised in personal income tax. </para>
		<para>Pensions</para>
        <para>Social service pensions and benefits are adjusted six-monthly in line with movements in the Consumer Prime Index. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, the standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.20 to $49.30 a week from the first payday in November. </para>
        <para>The combined married rate will rise by $3.70 to $82.20 per week. </para>
        <para>There will be a further increase from the first payday in May 1978 in line with the movement in the Consumer Price Index in the second half of 1977. </para>
        <para>These increases are estimated to cost $ 1 82m in 1977-78 and $490m in a full year. </para>
		<para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>Repatriation disability and service pensions also will be increased in November 1977 and May 1978 in line with increases in the Consumer Prime Index. </para>
        <para>These increases are estimated to cost $25. 3m in 1977-78 and $6 1.5m in a full year. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to discontinue the Sustenance Allowance and replace it by a Loss of Earnings Allowance, and to modify existing arrangements concerning pensions related to pulmonary tuberculosis. </para>
		<para>Assistance to Handicapped People</para>
        <para>Special assistance for handicapped people in 1977-78 is estimated at $93m, an increase of 33 per cent on last year. </para>
        <para>This is one of the fastest growing programs in the Budget; it demonstrates that, the need for expenditure restraint notwithstanding, this Government is concerned to assist the underprivileged members of our community. </para>
        <para>At present an allowance of $15 a week is payable for a severely handicapped child. </para>
        <para>We are extending eligibility for similar grants of up to $15 a week to parents or guardians on low incomes who are experiencing financial hardship in caring for a substantially handicapped child. </para>
		<para>Aged Persons&#39; Accommodation</para>
        <para>An amount of $50m is provided for expenditure on aged persons&#39; homes and hostels in 1977-78, $7.6m more than last year. </para>
		<para>Children &#39;s Services</para>
        <para>This year we are providing $73m for children&#39;s services, an increase of $6m on last year. </para>
		<para>Unemployment Benefits</para>
        <para>The estimates include $787m for unemployment and sickness benefit payments this year. </para>
        <para>It is the Government&#39;s aim to see that these funds go to the genuinely unemployed. </para>
        <para>It has become evident that the present arrangement of paying two weeks&#39; unemployment benefit in advance is resulting in persons who have secured employment being paid unemployment benefits as well, producing a very substantial overpayment in aggregate. </para>
        <para>After considering the recommendations in the Myers Report, the Government has decided that in future unemployment benefits will be paid fortnightly in arrears. </para>
		<para>Review of Social Security Systems</para>
        <para>As already announced, an overall review of the operations of the Department of Social Security is being carried out with a view to implementing improvements in the Department&#39;s present systems and procedures. </para>
        <para>The Department&#39;s programs now involve expenditures of the order of $6 billion annually and significant savings are expected to result from the review in 1977-78. </para>
		<para>Assistance to Aboriginals</para>
        <para>Although Aboriginals have access to normal Commonwealth financed services and benefits the Government strongly supports special programs of assistance for Aboriginals. </para>
        <para>In the Budget we are providing $110m for expenditure on non-administrative activities of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>
        <para>Overall expenditure on programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals in 1977-78 is estimated to be about $176m, compared with $161m in </para>
        <para class="block">1976- 77. </para>
		<para>EDUCATION</para>
		<para>The Budget provides for Commonwealth expenditure of $2,37 lm on education in 1977- 78, $21 lm or 10 per cent more than last year. </para>
		<para>Late last year substantial general increases were announced in student allowances and benefits; these increases were effective from the beginning of 1977. </para>
		<para>Some living and boarding allowances will be further increased from the beginning of 1978. </para>
		<para>HEALTH</para>
		<para>At $2,8 14m, expenditure on health care in 1977-78 will again pre-empt a large slice of Budget outlays. </para>
		<para>Payments of Medibank benefits in 1977-78 are estimated at $ 1 ,494m. </para>
		<para>The estimate of $942m in payments to the States under the hospital cost-sharing agreements during 1977-78 reflects an expectation of firm cost containment in public hospitals. </para>
		<para>Under the Community Health Program the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance for some 700 community health projects. </para>
		<para>In 1976-77 $7Om was provided under this Program; this year, based on the Commonwealth contributing SO per cent of capital costs and 75 per cent of recurrent costs, expenditure is estimated to exceed $79m. </para>
		<para>The Commonwealth will be suggesting to the States that, within this increased allocation, a higher priority be given to the funding of women&#39;s refuges. </para>
		<para>As recently announced, new nursing home arrangements will take effect from 1 October. </para>
		<para>Rates of benefit payable by the Commonwealth and the Hospital Funds will be set at higher rates in each State from that date. </para>
		<para>The effect will be that the benefits, when combined with the statutory patient contribution, will cover fees payable in respect of 70 per cent of patients in non-government National Health </para>
		<para class="block">Act nursing homes compared with 30 per cent at present. </para>
		<para>DEFENCE</para>
		<para>The Government is determined to improve Australia &#39;s defence capability. </para>
		<para>Total outlays for defence activities in 1977-78 are estimated at $2, 343m, and imply an increase of about 1 per cent in real terms. </para>
		<para>In a Budget in which total outlays are estimated to decrease slightly in real terms, this increase is evidence of the continuing high priority which this Government attaches to defence. </para>
		<para>In particular, further progress is to be made towards achieving the important objectives for capital equipment and facilities outlined in the Defence White Paper presented to Parliament by the Minister for Defence last year. </para>
		<para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
		<para>Expenditure on Australia&#39;s overseas aid programs is estimated to increase by 12 per cent, from $38Om in 1976-77 to $426m in 1977-78. </para>
		<para>HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</para>
		<para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>In 1977-78 $390m will be made available to the States for welfare housing, $15m more than last year. </para>
        <para>I shall refer later to the associated question of finance for private housing. </para>
		<para>Defence Service Homes</para>
        <para>Some $22m will be provided for the Defence Service Homes Scheme; repayments of earlier loans and proceeds from property sales are estimated at $72.6m, making a total of about $94.6m available for the Scheme in 1977-78. </para>
        <para>In 1977-78 an application fee of $75 for an initial Defence Service Home loan will be introduced; an application fee of $50 will be charged for an additional loan. </para>
          <para>Housing Allowance Voucher Experiment</para>
        <para>Last year, I announced our decision in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher experiment. </para>
        <para>Field activity to implement the experiment is expected to get under way at the first siteMelbourne late in 1977-78. </para>
        <para>About $ 1 m is provided for this purpose. </para>
          <para>Growth Centres and Decentralisation</para>
        <para>The Budget provides $15m for decentralisation purposes, including growth centres, in 1977-78, comprising $5m for Albury-Wodonga, $3m for the Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur growth centres, and approximately $6m for a new program of support for general decentralisation initiatives. </para>
        <para>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</para>
          <para>Postal and Telecommunications Services</para>
        <para>The Australian Telecommunications Commission&#39;s capital program, although larger than in 1976-77, will be funded mainly from the Commission&#39;s own internal resources and from local borrowings; drawings from the Budget are estimated at $65m in 1977-78 compared with $2 15m in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>It is expected that the Commissions will be able to hold basic postage and telephone charges in 1977-78, for the second year running. </para>
        <para>Nor is the Government proposing, as is sometimes suggested, to re-introduce broadcasting and TV receiver licences. </para>
        <para>Some more minor licence fees are, however, to be increased: <inline font-style="italic">radiocommunications</inline> licences will be increased, for some classes of users, from $20 a year to $25 a year, effective from 1 October 1977, and the fees payable by some licensees of commercial radio and television stations are also to be increased. </para>
          <para>Transport</para>
        <para>As already announced, $475m will be provided to the States for road works in 1977-78. </para>
        <para>Other large expenditures in the transport area include: $55m to meet expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission; a further $33m towards financing the Commission&#39;s capital program, including continued construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs; $5 lm in assistance to the States for urban public transport projects, including $5m for new projects- the first since 1974; $8m for land transport planning and research; and $23m for Tasmanian Freight Equalization. </para>
        <para>Light dues levied on shipping to recover the cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 35 cents per net registered ton per quarter to 41 cents from 1 October 1977. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided not to increase the level of air navigation charges this year. </para>
        <para>ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY</para>
      <para>In recognition of the depressed outlook for the farm sector the Budget continues to provide for a wide range of rural industry support activities. </para>
      <para>Details are set out in Statements attached to the Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>Here I mention some of the larger provisions: $53m to facilitate rural industries&#39; adjustment to changing circumstances; $3 1 .4m for wool research and promotion; $ 15.1m for the continuation of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign; $40m for continuation of the superphosphate subsidy; and $I2m for continuation of the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy at its present level, the proposed review of that level from 1 January 1978 being postponed. </para>
          <para>Rural Bank</para>
        <para>We have now approved in principle the establishment of a national rural bank, preferably taking the form of a refinance institution. </para>
        <para>We see the new bank complementing existing credit facilities and we intend to hold discussions in the near future with major lending institutions concerning appropriate structural and funding arrangements. </para>
        <para>We shall press forward with these dicussions without delay. </para>
        <para>SUPPORT FOR EXPORTS AND RESEARCH</para>
          <para>Export Development Grants</para>
        <para>The Government is concerned to assist all exporters, particularly through further reductions in the rate of inflation, thereby improving the international competitiveness of Australian goods and services. </para>
        <para>As well, direct assistance of $30m- an increase of $5.9m- is included in the Budget for export market development grants to encourage firms to seek and develop overseas markets. </para>
        <para>The whole question of financial incentives to exporters has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for examination; meanwhile the Government is not proceeding with the legislation foreshadowed in 1976 to reduce benefits and payments under the Scheme. </para>
          <para>Industrial Research and Development Grants</para>
        <para>The Budget provides $14m for payments of industrial research and development grants in 1977-78. </para>
          <para>Coal Research</para>
        <para>To finance increased coal research the Government will levy 5 cents a tonne on coal produced in Australia in the next three years; the levy will have effect from midnight tonight and is estimated to provide $3.4m this year. </para>
        <para>TRAINING PROGRAMS</para>
      <para>The Government acknowledges the seriousness of the present unemployment, especially among young people. </para>
      <para>As well as the personal pressures on those unable to find work, there is also a tragic waste of the nation&#39;s resources. </para>
      <para>For these reasons the Government attaches special importance to its labour market training programs. </para>
      <para>In addition to the general training assistance available the Government is making increased </para>
      <para class="block">E revision this year for programs aimed at enancing employment prospects for young people. </para>
      <para>These include the recently introduced Community Youth Support Scheme, the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the Special Youth Employment Training Program, all of which are now proving their worth. </para>
      <para>The Government is broadening this assistance by extending the Special Youth Employment Training Program to young people under 25 years, to take effect immediately. </para>
      <para>All told, the Budget provides $ 102.7m for employment training programs this year, an increase of 33 per cent over last year. </para>
      <para>Even that very large increase will be surpassed if it is necessary to do so: we will not allow the budgetary situation to inhibit our training programs or our capacity to offer training to people who meet the necessary labour market criteria. </para>
      <para>We intend also to approach the States to seek an early Commonwealth-State conference on the need to upgrade work skills in the community and to consider the adequacy and utilization of existing resources for training. </para>
        <para>IMMIGRATION PROGRAM</para>
      <para>The Government has decided not to set a specific immigration program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of eligible applicants. </para>
      <para>Assisted passages will be available for some 16 000 people, about the same number as in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
      <para>An amount of $137.3m is to be appropriated for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>As already announced, the Government has decided to establish an independent authority to provide ethnic broadcasting services and, at a later date, possibly other specialized services. </para>
      <para>The proposed appropriation for the provision of the ethnic broadcasting service in 1977-78 is $1.9m. </para>
      <para>Spending on Australia Council programs is estimated at $24.4m in 1977-78, an increase of 10 per cent over spending on comparable programs last year. </para>
      <para>Following a review of Commonwealth involvement in sport, we are providing $lm in 1977-78 for expenditure on national sports development and assistance; we are also establishing a Sports Advisory Council. </para>
        <para>LEGAL AID</para>
      <para>An amount of $ 19.6m is included in the Budget to maintain legal aid services in 1977-78 at their present levels; an additional $3.8m is being provided for Aboriginal Legal Aid Services. </para>
        <para>PAYMENTS TO STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES</para>
      <para>Despite the need this year for overall budgetary restraint, the Commonwealth has maintained its policy of relative generosity to State and local governments. </para>
      <para>In line with the offer made by the Prime Minister at the Premiers &#39; Conference in July, provision has been made for the States to receive $4336. lm under the tax sharing arrangements in respect of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>I note that this is over $90m more than the estimate of what the States would have been entitled to under the tax sharing legislation. </para>
      <para>The generosity of that increase should certainly enable the State governments to frame constructive Budgets which avoid putting up their indirect taxes and charges. </para>
      <para>As part of this offer State tax sharing entitlements in future years are to be determined as a proportion of the preceding year&#39;s personal income tax collections, excluding special surcharges or rebates. </para>
      <para>The precise percentage to be applied in later years has still to be settled but with this change much firmer estimates of tax sharing entitlements for the year ahead will be known when Commonwealth and States&#39; Budgets are being prepared. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s offer represents a net increase of $621 m, or 16.8 per cent, in States&#39; tax sharing payments in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>With Loan Council programs and the special grant to Queensland recommended by the Grants Commission, total general purpose payments to the States are estimated to increase by $685. lm, or 14.0 percent, in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Local government authorities&#39; share of personal income tax collections will be $165.3m in 1 977-78, 1 8. 1 per cent more than last year. </para>
      <para class="block">Total general purpose and specific purpose payments by the Commonwealth to States and local authorities this year will amount to about $10 billion net. </para>
        <para>GENERAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES</para>
      <para>The Commonwealth is continuing to exercise firm restraint in general government expenditures. </para>
          <para>Staff Ceilings</para>
        <para>Since 30 June 1975 the number of public servants in employment areas covered by staff ceilings has fallen by about 12 500. </para>
        <para>The staff ceilings now set for 30 June 1978 imply a further reduction of over 3000- or about 1 percent-during 1977-78. </para>
          <para>Civil Works</para>
        <para>A total of $375m is provided in the Budget for expenditure on new and existing civil works projects in 1977-78- leaving aside Darwin, where the rebuilding program is nearing completion, expenditure is estimated to increase by $ 14m. </para>
        <para>The Darwin Reconstruction Commission is to be wound up on 3 1 December and the Department of Construction will take over responsibility for outstanding works. </para>
        <para>The National Capital Development Commission will have a cash allocation of about $197m for civil works expenditures in Canberra this year, $6m less than last year. </para>
          <para>Territories</para>
        <para>With the move towards self-government in the Northern Territory, a global allocation of $50m has been included in the Budget for expenditure on those functions transferred on 1 January 1977 to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. </para>
        <para>Provision is made in the Budget estimates for increased revenue from Northern Territory charges; the details are to be determined in consultation with the incoming Legislative Assembly. </para>
        <para>Provision is also made in the estimates for increases in rates and charges in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
        <para>MAINTENANCE OF EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT</para>
      <para>In each of the past two years we have succeeded in keeping actual outlays below the original Budget estimates. </para>
      <para>We aim to repeat that performance again in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>In so doing we shall again demonstrate that we meant what we said about restoring fiscal responsibility and restraining the previous runaway growth in government spending. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para>I come now to receipts. </para>
      <para>Our revenue measures embody two principal considerations. </para>
      <para>First, we see an over-riding need to reduce the burden of income tax so as to restore incentive for personal effort. </para>
      <para>Secondly, we have focused upon the pressing need to conserve and develop our crude oil and other energy resources. </para>
      <para>Again, as in 1976-77, there are no proposals in this Budget to increase duties on beer, or on spirits, or on cigarettes and tobacco. </para>
          <para>Personal Income Tax</para>
        <para>As I said at the outset, this Government is unremitting in its determination to rein back the growth in the public sector for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its fundamental belief that Australians should be able to determine to a greater extent how they spend thenincomes. </para>
        <para>The more successful governments are in the exercise of economy in their expenditures, the more scope they have for reducing the burden of taxation on their citizens. </para>
        <para>Our success since taking office in reducing the rate of growth in expenditure by the Government has made it possible for us to reduce the excessive level of personal taxation. </para>
        <para>Our first step towards reform of the personal income tax system was to introduce last year full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation. </para>
        <para>We thus accomplished, in our first year of office, a reform that was initially set down for introduction over a three year period. </para>
        <para>As a result of tax indexation the Government has forgone revenues in 1977-78 of about $965m on top of the $990m forgone last year. </para>
        <para>But the inescapable fact is that, irrespective of the positive benefits of tax indexation, present rates of personal income tax are too high. </para>
        <para>The present tax scale is not only inequitable, it is having devastating effects on incentive and on the will to work. </para>
        <para>Given our conviction that decisive measures are required, we now intend to give effect to our own tax philosophy and, once and for all, to repudiate the high tax policies pursued by our political opponents. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, we are introducing a much improved and simplified tax system that will provide very substantial benefits to taxpayers at all income levels. </para>
        <para>The new measures represent the most revolutionary change yet made to Australia&#39;s system of income tax. </para>
        <para>The essence of the new system lies in the establishment of one tax rate as the basic rate of taxation for the vast majority of taxpayers. </para>
        <para>The essential points of the new tax system are: </para>
        <para>The so-called &#39;general concessional rebate&#39;which gave the misleading impression that taxpayers were receiving a benefit which did not in reality exist- will have no further relevance in the new system. </para>
        <para>The tax threshold will be raised to $3,751 (from the rebate equivalent of $3,154) and no individual with an income below that level will pay tax. </para>
        <para>Dependant rebates are, however, being retained, so that the effective tax threshold for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse will be $5,485. </para>
        <para>A standard flat rate of tax of 32 per cent will be established on all taxable incomes over $3,750; this rate becomes the basic tax rate of the system. </para>
        <para>A surcharge of 14 per cent will be imposed on that part of taxable income between $16,000 and $32,000. </para>
        <para>A surcharge of 28 per cent will be imposed on that part of taxable income above $32,000. </para>
        <para>Instead of the present seven-step scale this will establish a three-step scale incorporating effective marginal rates of 32, 46 and 60 per cent. </para>
        <para>Let me briefly summarise some of the main benefits of this new and vastly simplified tax system. </para>
        <para>The most important benefit is that there are tax reductions at all levels of taxable income. </para>
        <para>Furthermore, the biggest proportional gainers are those on lower incomes at the bottom of the tax scale. </para>
        <para>In fact, the incomes of about 225 000 taxpayers, including many pensioners with small private incomes, will be made non-taxable. </para>
        <para>Some 90 per cent of taxpayers will pay tax at no more than the standard marginal rate of 32 percent. </para>
        <para>As a result, the new system goes a long way to restoring the monetary incentive for individuals to work and to work harder, to take on added responsibility, to work overtime, and so on. </para>
        <para>I now give some examples of how this system will affect selected income groups: a taxpayer on a taxable income of $4,000 per annum or $77 per week with no dependent spouse will have his tax liability reduced by $2.86 per week, nearly two-thirds of his present tax liability; a taxpayer on $ 10,000 per annum or $ 1 92 per week, about average earnings, will save $2.83 per week, and his marginal rate of tax will be reduced from 35c to 32c in the dollar; a taxpayer on $ 15,000 per annum or $288 per week will save $ 1 0.46 per week and his marginal rate will drop sharply from 45c to 32c in the dollar. </para>
        <para>These reductions will be in addition to those already effected from 1 July last through the tax indexation mechanism. </para>
        <para>The new system will apply from 1 February 1978 for both pay-as-you-earn and, notionally, for assessment purposes. </para>
        <para>As from 1 February next, therefore, the total savings in tax from the new scale and the tax indexation mechanism combined will amount, in the three examples I have just quoted, to $4.46 per week, $5.38 per week and $15.38 per week, respectively. </para>
        <para>These examples- which could of course be multiplied- indicate the substantial benefits flowing to all taxpayers from our program of tax reform and tax reduction to date. </para>
        <para>I now briefly touch on some further aspects of the new system. </para>
        <para>The general rebate of $676 previously allowable to all taxpayers regardless of their expenditures on concessional items would have meant in 1977-78, effectively, a rebate of 40 per cent for any such expenditures over $ 1,690. </para>
        <para>With a 32 per cent standard rate being introduced, it has been decided that eligible expenditure above the ceiling will attract a rebate at that rate; the resultant revenue saving will be applied to reduce the ceiling from $1,690 to $1,590, thus making such rebates available to more taxpayers. </para>
        <para>Several consequential amendments in respect of such matters as trust income and the threshold of the health insurance levy will be necessary; details are given in Statement No. 4 attached. </para>
        <para>PA YE deductions from salaries and wages will be reduced as from 1 February 1978, based on the new scale. </para>
        <para>The rate scale and other features applicable for the final assessment of tax liabilities on 1977-78 incomes will in practice be a composite, equivalent to seven-twelfths of the present system and five-twelfths of the new one. </para>
        <para>Again, details are spelled out in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>As basic provisional tax for 1977-78 is assessed on 1976-77 income, 1976-77 rates of tax will be applied in calculation thereof. </para>
        <para>The substantial benefits of the new scales will add, from early 1978, to the benefits flowing from the latest round of indexation on 1 July 1977. </para>
        <para>These new benefits will begin flowing to taxpayers five months before the next indexation adjustment. </para>
        <para>Full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation will be maintained in respect of the new system in future years. </para>
        <para>However, transitional arrangements will apply with respect to the indexation adjustment due on 1 July 1978. </para>
        <para>Dependant rebates which will have operated unchanged throughout the year, will be indexed at that time by the full factor given by the annual indexation rules. </para>
        <para>The new rate scale, which will have been operating only during the second half of the financial year, will be indexed at that time by half the factor given by the annual indexation rules. </para>
        <para>The cost of the measure on this basis is estimated at $406m in 1977-78 and $973m in 1978-79. </para>
        <para class="block">Incentives for the Arts </para>
        <para>Continuing its active support for the arts and as a way of eliciting greater co-operation from the private <inline font-style="italic">sector, the</inline> Government will liberalise the conditions under which income tax deductions are allowable for gifts of works of art and comparable property to public art galleries, museums and libraries. </para>
        <para>Details are contained in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>The cost to revenue is estimated to approach $lm in 1977-78 and $2.5m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Company Tax</para>
        <para>As I mentioned earlier, there is a clear need this year to finance the essential personal tax reform I have just announced. </para>
        <para>That has meant, for one thing, the most rigid control of the Commonwealth&#39;s own expenditures. </para>
        <para>Beyond that, however, we have also had to look elsewhere for increased sources of revenue. </para>
        <para>Since coming to office the Government has eased the burden of tax on business income in several ways, notably by the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
        <para>These measures will produce a very substantial saving in the tax payable by corporate business in 1977-78, of the order of $600m at current tax rates. </para>
        <para>As I said early on in my speech tonight there is a need for fair snaring of the burdens. </para>
        <para>Against the background of the very substantial concessions given to companies last year, and of the recent and prospective increases in corporate profitability, it has been decided to increase the rates of company tax to apply in respect of 1976- 77 income. </para>
        <para>The increase will be 31*4 per cent bringing the general rate to 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>The same 3 1/2 per cent increase in rate will also apply to 1977-78 income of superannuation funds which do not observe the 30/20 rule, bringing their rate to 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>This rate increase is estimated to yield $203m in 1977-78 and $224m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Even so, company tax in total is estimated to increase by only $174m, or 6 per cent, in 1977- 78, compared with $302m, or 12 per cent, in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>Small Business Taxation</para>
        <para>The Government attaches particular importance to the fundamental role of small business in our free enterprise system. </para>
        <para>Because of the benefits this year flowing from last year&#39;s alterations to Division 7 tax, introduction of an investment allowance and a trading stock valuation adjustment, the effective rate of tax for the majority of small firms has been reduced by between 8 and 10 percentage points. </para>
        <para>This year&#39;s changes to personal income tax will be of particular benefit to the owneroperators of small companies and unincorporated enterprises, whose incomes are more subject to fluctuations than those of the majority of taxpayers. </para>
        <para>There are of course many matters which affect small businesses but which are within the province of State governments- pay-roll tax, workers &#39; compensation and the like. </para>
        <para>As I have said, the small business sector will be greatly assisted by the Budget- the Commonwealth hopes that State governments will have similar regard to the special needs of this sector. </para>
          <para>Film Royalties Paid Abroad</para>
        <para>Most film royalties paid from Australia are at present taxed, on an arbitrary basis, as if the foreign recipient&#39;s profit rate were 10 per cent. </para>
        <para>The Government considers that this produces an unreasonably low effective rate of tax. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, the rate of tax to apply in respect of film royalties paid out of Australia after tonight will be 10 per cent of the gross royalties, which represents our standard tax treaty rate. </para>
          <para>Gold-Mining Taxation</para>
        <para>In April 1977 the Industries Assistance Commission submitted a report on the production of gold. </para>
        <para>The Government has considered the report but has decided, because of continuing difficulties faced by the industry, to maintain the present basis of taxation and not to eliminate the concessions involved at this time. I pay particular credit to the local member of the area. That, of course, is the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter).</inline></para>
          <para>Tax Avoidance</para>
        <para>The Government is well aware of the activities in recent years of tax planners who, increasingly, are promoting tax avoidance schemes and arrangements throughout the business and professional community. </para>
        <para>We propose to crack down hard on such practices. </para>
        <para>Many of the arrangements that taxpayers are being induced to enter into are highly artificial and contrived, but they are causing substantial amounts of revenue to be either lost altogether or deferred for considerable periods of time. </para>
        <para>The Government takes a serious view of these developments and proposes, in these Budget sittings, to bring forward amendments to combat these abuses of the provisions of the taxation laws. </para>
          <para>Coal Export Duty</para>
        <para>The Government will make a further reduction this year in the coal export levy. </para>
        <para>The higher rate of duty will be reduced by $ 1.00 to $3.50 per tonne and the lower rate by 50 cents to $ 1.00 per tonne. </para>
        <para>Should State governments seek to take advantage of this to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. </para>
        <para>I re-affirm the Government&#39;s intention to remove the remaining duty next year in accordance with its previous undertaking. </para>

        <para>CRUDE OIL POLICY</para>
      <para>The world price of crude oil has risen dramatically in recent years but only very minor adjustments have been made to the price of crude from Australian wells. </para>
      <para>Australian crude is now very substantially underpriced </para>
      <para>Without significant new discoveries in the next few years, indigenous crude oil would fall from meeting about 70 per cent of total Australian demand to about 30 per cent by 1985. </para>
      <para>We cannot afford a pricing policy that flies in the face of all energy conservation principles by condoning excessive consumption of our scarce presently known supplies of crude. </para>
      <para>We are moving to produce appropriate energy pricing structure. </para>
      <para>The National Energy Advisory Committee has the whole question of national energy policy under urgent study and is reporting progressively to the Government on it. </para>
      <para>We also need a pricing policy that encourages new exploration and ensures full economic recovery of known deposits. </para>
      <para>In partial recognition of these truths, the previous Government announced, and we nave maintained, a policy applying import parity prices to oil discovered after 14 September 1975. </para>
      <para>But the previous Government did nothing to conserve the usage from existing fields, to increase the extent of recovery from them, or to develop new fields based on discoveries already made. </para>
      <para>An estimated 400 million barrels of oil could be recovered in Australia at import parity prices that would not be recovered at existing prices. </para>
      <para>This would add about 20 per cent, or about two years&#39; present requirements, to the reserves which would be economically recoverable at present prices. </para>
      <para>Following a Government reference in May 1976, the Industries Assistance Commission has made recommendations directed to an orderly transition towards import parity prices for all local oil </para>
      <para>The Government endorses this objective and has adopted an approach based essentially on the Commission&#39;s recommendations. </para>
      <para>An annually increasing proportion, or six million barrels per annum, whichever is the greater, of crude oil from each field or new development within fields discovered before 14 September 1975, will be sold at import parity prices, with the remainder sold at the present fixed prices for each field. </para>
      <para>For the first year, commencing tonight, the proportion of oil per field to be sold at import parity prices will be 1 0 per cent of production. </para>
      <para>In the three subsequent years, the corresponding proportions will be 20, 35 and 50 per cent. </para>
      <para>Beyond this, it is the Government&#39;s intention to move to full import parity as soon as possible thereafter; accordingly it will, prior to the end of the period, review the matter. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that not all the additional profits resulting from these decisions should remain with the producers, and that the community should obtain a return from the exploitation of these resources which adequately reflects their value. </para>
      <para>The fact that the recently increased value of crude oil stems essentially from action by a cartel of foreign oil producers makes the community interest in that enhanced value all the more obvious. </para>
      <para>In view of this, the Government has decided to increase the production levy on crude oil from $2 to $3 per barrel. </para>
      <para>The Government is, meanwhile, examining whether the levy should be replaced by a resources tax. </para>
      <para>The levy will not apply to condensate marketed separately from a crude oil stream; such condensate may now be sold at commercially negotiated prices. </para>
      <para>Nor will the levy apply to liquefied petroleum gas from fields not yet in production. </para>
      <para>This will assist the marketing of LPG and condensate from fields already discovered but not yet developed in the North West Shelf and the Cooper Basin. </para>
      <para>Condensate sold comingled in a crude oil stream will continue to be treated as crude oil for pricing and levy purposes. </para>
      <para>The levy on liquefied petroleum gas from currently producing fields will remain at $2 per barrel. </para>
      <para class="block">Duty on Petroleum Products </para>
      <para>In association with its review of energy pricing and conservation policies, the Government has also reviewed the duty on petroleum products and has decided to increase it by one-quarter cent per litre. </para>
      <para>These decisions taken together will result in additional revenues totalling $180m this financial year, and $2 12m in a full year. The pricing and duty decisions combined are estimated to result in an ultimate increase in retail petrol prices of about <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> cents per litre, or about 1 1 cents per gallon, in 1 977-78; because of the lags involved, these final price effects are likely to come through rather gradually. </para>
      <para>Petrol will remain appreciably cheaper in Australia than in most other comparable countries. </para>
      <para>The Government regrets the need for any action that adds to consumer prices. </para>
      <para>However, it also realises that the steadily diminishing proportion of our crude oil needs which will be supplied from domestic wells means that increased petrol prices are inevitable in any case; the sooner they are effected, die sooner will excessive use be curtailed, presently uneconomic fields be developed and exploration for new fields stepped up. </para>
      <para>A further statement on the new oil pricing and levy arrangements will be made by the Minister for National Resources. </para>
        <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
      <para>Total outlays in 1977-78 are estimated to increase by 10.5 per cent to $26,656m. </para>
      <para>Total receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 per cent to $24,439m. </para>
      <para>The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,217m, a reduction of $523m in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $ 1,347m in 1977-78, almost $650m less than in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para>The outcome I have just announced is consistent with our fiscal stance since taking office. </para>
      <para>In 1 977-78 fiscal policy will again reinforce the other arms of policy. </para>
      <para>In particular, the further reduction in the Budget deficit will lighten the burden on monetary policy. </para>
      <para>We are thus a step closer to our objectives of sustainably lowering interest rates and beginning to ease the restrictions on bank lending during the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>As that can be responsibly achieved, there will be obvious benefits for the economy. </para>
      <para>I can mention tonight one step in that direction. </para>
      <para>The Government has been concerned, in reviewing the overall housing scene, to ensure that availability of finance is not a barrier to steady and sustainable growth in home building activity, including additions and renovations. </para>
      <para>If borrowers are credit worthy, we would not want them to be denied housing finance because of official restraints. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, the Government has advised the Reserve Bank that it wants to see banks and other financial institutions encouraged to increase their lending for private home building, particularly in those States and areas where the capacity of the building industry is underutilised. </para>
      <para>It is of course being left to individual lenders to determine their levels of lending, taking into account their particular balance sheet positions and their assessments of the housing situation in their areas of operations. </para>
      <para>Despite the many hazards in such projections, the present outlook indicates future growth in the broadly defined measure of the volume of money, M3, in the range of 8- 10 per cent over the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>That range may change as circumstances unfold. </para>
      <para>It may also be necessary, as in 1976-77, to adjust policy in response to changing circumstances. </para>
      <para>With those qualifications, I indicate the Government&#39;s present expectation that it will be appropriate for monetary growth in 1977-78 to be somewhat less than in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>This would maintain the Government&#39;s policy of providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that these broad monetary expectations will provide the community with a continuing degree of certainty as to the outlook. </para>
      <para>Overall, these fiscal and monetary policy settings provide ground for cautious optimism about the unfolding of economic conditions through 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Again, however, I stress that restoring the Australian economy from its previously shattered state is no simple task. </para>
      <para>The course of inflation during the first half of 1977-78 will be influenced by several transitory factors. </para>
      <para>These will include the continuing lagged effects of last year &#39;s devaluation, some &#39; catch-up &#39; effects from the recent prices &#39;pause&#39; and the direct and indirect effects of the pricing-cum-duty decisions on petroleum products which I have just announced. </para>
      <para>But, more importantly, the basic thrust of policy is such as to further reduce the underlying rate of inflation. </para>
      <para>Fundamentally, of course, inflation- and unemployment- in 1977-78 will be heavily influenced by the extent of wage indexation applying. </para>
      <para>If we assume, for example, that future National Wage Case decisions embody a broadly similar degree of partial indexation as in 1976-77, by mid- 1978 a wide range of price indicators would be registering quarterly rates of increase of the order of <inline font-style="italic">2-2Vi</inline> per cent. </para>
      <para>Unless the degree of wage indexation is reduced, it will mean wage rate increases of around 10 per cent for 1977-78 as a whole. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome would contribute little to reducing real wage/productivity distortion. </para>
      <para>If the Commission does make a contribution to this problem by lower awards, the outlook for jobs- and unemployment- will be strengthened. </para>
      <para>We shall, of course, continue to urge the bench to do so- stressing in that regard the relevance of the tax relief we are providing. </para>
      <para>As noted earlier, the underlying forward momentum of demand and activity has begun to reassert itself in recent months. </para>
      <para>That process will gather pace over the course in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Product growth will induce some short-term gains in measured productivity and some further improvement in profitability and profit levels. </para>
      <para>Growth of final domestic demand will again be concentrated in the private sector, with the cuts in personal income tax and some further decline in the personal saving ratio underpinning moderate growth in consumption while the business fixed investment growth already in train strengthens and broadens. </para>
      <para>As the trade account continues to switch around, it will contribute significantly to the growth of domestic product over the course of the year. </para>
      <para>It will also contribute to an improving balance of payments position, although the usual seasonal influences will work in the other direction for the next few months. </para>
      <para>With policy bearing down on inflation and business investment picking up, strengthening private capital inflows and the recently announced resumption of long-term official borrowing overseas should reinforce the capital account also as the year progresses. </para>
      <para>Gross non-farm product should increase by over 4 per cent between the June quarters of 1977 and 1978. </para>
      <para>This compares with a corresponding increase of 1 per cent between the June quarter 1976 and the June quarter 1977. </para>
      <para>Due to the within-year patterns- particularly the strong first half and weak second half of 1 976-77- growth of that order in non-farm product over the course of 1977-78 would entail growth for 1977-78 as a whole of about 2 per cent. </para>
      <para>Although seasonal conditions are largely unpredictable, at this stage they seem unlikely to support more than a marginal increase in the volume of farm production; if so, real farm incomes would be likely to fall somewhat. </para>
      <para>Such an overall picture for activity would be consistent with strengthening, though still modest, employment growth during the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>This should broadly take up the growth in the work-force but perhaps not much more than that. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome would reflect, of course, the continuing serious real wage distortion and the characteristics of the wage determination process. </para>
      <para>Our policies will continue to erode that distortion and open the way to increased job opportunities and lower unemployment. </para>
      <para>That desirable outcome would be attainable more quickly were there to be greater moderation on the part of those demanding wage increases and on the part of those awarding them. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para class="block">This Budget has been carefully designed. </para>
      <para>It will be maintaining maximum pressure on inflation in the first half of the financial year. </para>
      <para>In the second half of the financial year, as the results of these policies bear their fruits, the Budget will add a stimulus to activity through the large increase in disposable incomes flowing from tax reductions associated with changes to the personal income tax system. </para>
      <para>The Government therefore, looks to a further slowdown in inflation in the second half of 1977-78, accompanied by a continuing pick-up in activity. </para>
      <para>In short, this Budget assures further solid progress towards the Government&#39;s economic and social objectives. </para>
      <para>The new reform of the personal income tax is of particular benefit, both economic and social. </para>
      <para>Economically, the Budget builds upon the foundations of the past eighteen months. 1976-77 was not an easy year, and 1977-78- in the very nature of the problems we confront- will not see any dramatic breakthrough to rapid economic recovery. </para>
      <para>But the Budget provides solid grounds for looking to further gains in reducing the underlying rate of inflation and inflationary expectations in the year ahead. </para>
      <para>That will, in turn, be reflected in rising levels of activity and growing job opportunities extending through into 1 978-79 and beyond. </para>
      <para>I commend the Budget to honourable members. </para>

		<para>Budget Aggregates</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The key Budget aggregates for 1977-78 are shown in the following table, together with comparable data for 1976-77: </para>
		<para>Outlays</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides for an increase of 10.5 per cent in total outlays in 1977-78; this is virtually the same as the increase recorded in 1976-77 (10.4 per cent) but well down on the increases in 1975-76 (22.5 per cent) and 1974-75 (45.9 per cent). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The budgeted increase implies, for the second year running, a reduction in total outlays expressed in real terms. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product, outlays reached a peak of 30.9 per cent in 1975-76, compared with 29.7 per cent in 1974-75 and around 24-25 per cent in earlier years. In 1976-77, reflecting the substantial deceleration in the rate of growth of&#34; outlays, this proportion declined to 29.6 per cent; the present estimates imply a further reduction in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for 1976-77 and the estimates for 1977-78 are classified by broad economic type in the following table: </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="106131197708163_60_2.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimates of outlays in 1977-78, classified by function, are set out in detail in Statement No. 3. The summary table below shows Budget outlays in 1976-77 and estimated outlays in 1977-78 classified according to their main functions or purposes: </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="106131197708163_61_3.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">The main features are: o The largest increase is in respect of the &#39;Not Allocated to Function&#39; category which includes interest payments and the bulk allowance of $90 million for prospective increases in wages and salaries of public servants, as well as the tax sharing entitlements of the States and local authorities and certain other payments to the States. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">*&#62; Social Security and Welfare payments are estimated to increase by $817 million, or 12.7 per cent, in 1977-78 and are estimated to constitute over 27 per cent of total Budget outlays. o The increase of $216 million  -  13.4 per cent - shown for General Public Services includes $50 million to be made available to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for expenditure on functions transferred to the Assembly on 1 January 1977. &#171; The reduction shown in outlays for Housing mainly reflects the rundown in expenditure by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and the transfer of responsibility for the Northern Territory Housing Commission to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly (for which provision is made in General Public Services).  o  The increase of $271 million (10.7 per cent) in outlays for Health in 1977-78 would have been $56 million (2.0 per cent) had it not been for the prepayment in June 1976 of about $216 million to the States for the Commonwealth&#39;s share of hospital operating costs in respect of the September quarter of 1976-77.  o  The reduction of $111 million (7.0 per cent) in outlays for Economic Services mainly reflects the proposed financing of the Australian Telecommunications Commission&#39;s capital program primarily from internal sources and off-Budget borrowings - advances from the Budget are estimated at $65 million in 1977-78 compared with $215 million in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Receipts</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 per cent in 1977-78 to S24 439 million. This is after allowance for the net loss to revenue of taxation measures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Reflecting the substantial cost to revenue of taxation measures introduced in 1976 and 1977, the estimated increase in revenues in 1977-78 is considerably less than the 17.0 per cent recorded in 1976-77 and the 19.7 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of the estimates for 1977-78, including the effects of measures on receipts, are in Statement No. 4. </para>
		<para>The Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated <inline font-style="italic">total</inline> deficit in 1977-78 of $2217 million is $523 million less than the 1976-77 deficit of $2740 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After allowance for the deficit incurred on overseas transactions - mainly in respect of defence and foreign aid expenditure - the estimated <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> deficit is $1347 million. This is $648 million less than the <inline font-style="italic">domestic</inline> deficit of $1995 million recorded in. 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Historical Data</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Historical data on Budget transactions are presented in Statements Nos 5 and 6. Statement No. 5 provides a detailed account of the Budget outcome for 1976-77 while Statement No. 6 presents Budget data for the period 1967-68 to 1977-78 in both functional and national accounts form. Table 2 of Statement No. 6 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by functional and major sub-functional categories in each year since 1967-68. An Appendix describes the basis of the functional classification of Budget outlays used throughout the Budget Statements. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The central objectives of macro-economic policy during 1976-77 were to reduce inflation while achieving moderate and sustainable recovery in private sector spending. Continued restraint on government expenditures, control of the growth of the monetary aggregates and advocacy of moderation in wage determination all contributed to the anti-inflationary thrust of policy during the year. The necessity to devalue the Australian dollar in November 1976 implied, at the time, a* marked change in the overall settings of macro-economic policy and the need to effect compensating adjustments to domestic policies. </para>

		<para>Activity and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the growth in economic activity in aggregate was greater in 1976-77 as a whole than in either of the two previous financial years, unevenness between sectors and over time continued to be a feature of economic performance. A sizeable increase in expenditure and product was recorded in calendar 1976, but the tempo of activity slowed again in the first half of 1977. The key question posed by this continued variation in performance concerns the strength and durability of the economic recovery that has been under way. Later sections of this Statement examine movements in major economic aggregates from that point of view. The following paragraphs describe major developments in the economy over the last year or so. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This commentary, including the accompanying charts, refers to semi-annual movements. All figures mentioned are seasonally adjusted and in constant price terms unless otherwise noted. Since the economy is an interrelated whole, using developments in real expenditures as the starting-point for discussion is, though conventional, to some extent arbitrary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It can be seen from Chart 1 that <inline font-style="italic">total final expenditure</inline> (panel g) rose in both halves of 1976  -  strongly so in the second half - before declining in the first half of 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private final consumption expenditure</inline>(panel a) increased in both halves of 1976 although, because of the decline in the March quarter, only slightly so in the first half of the year. The pace of consumer spending quickened in the second half of the year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of more than 6 per cent. The bunching of expenditures in anticipation of and immediately subsequent to the devaluation of late November&#39; appears to have been an important contributing factor; in effect, this resulted in the movement of some consumption out of the first half of 1977 into the second half of 1976. A further small part of the increase in recorded consumption was due to the reclassification of expenditures resulting from the changes to health insurance arrangements that took effect on 1 October; these have had the effect of raising the level of recorded private consumption expenditure since the December quarter. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Following very rapid growth through 1975-76, <inline font-style="italic">private dwelling investment</inline> (panel b) levelled off from mid- 1976 resulting in a lesser, though still sizeable, increase in the second half of the calendar year. The rapid expansion in new dwelling construction was not fully matched by growth in sales of dwellings; excess stocks of dwellings began accumulating towards the end of 1976 and, largely as a result, construction activity declined in the first half of 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private gross business fixed capital expenditure</inline>(panels c and d), which fell through 1975, has increased, albeit marginally, in each of the three half-years since then. Investment in <inline font-style="italic">other building and construction</inline> (panel c) continued to fall throughout 1976 and, although recovering slightly in the March quarter, fell again in the June quarter and was little changed on a half-yearly basis. Investment in <inline font-style="italic">plant and equipment</inline> (panel d) has fluctuated between quarters but in half-yearly terms has consistently recorded increases since the end of 1975. </para>
        <para class="block">

        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="106131197708163_65_5.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On average the <inline font-style="italic">public sector</inline> has accounted directly for only a small part of the growth in total final expenditures since 1975. A small decline in the first half of calendar 1976 was approximately matched by an increase in the second half; there was a further, slightly larger, increase in the first half of 1977. In 1976-77 as a whole, government expenditure at all levels (panel e) was 1.8 per cent higher than in the previous year; current expenditures were 5. 1 per cent higher while capital expenditures were 2.6 per cent lower. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Exports</inline>(panel f) provided a strong supplement to domestic final expenditure through most of 1976. Growth in the December half-year was over 16 per cent at an annual rate. However, the volume of exports declined in the December quarter and continuation of that decline into the first quarter of 1977 saw the volume of exports fall at an annual rate of 10 per cent in the six months to June 1977, in the process making the largest absolute contribution to the decline in total final expenditure in that halfyear (see Chart 1). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As panel h shows, between 1975 and 1976 the cyclical turnaround of stocks from decumulation to accumulation was substantial. But at the time this turnaround was contributing most heavily to the growth in gross national expenditure, <inline font-style="italic">import</inline> volumes (panel i) were also rising strongly, substantially offsetting the contribution of stock changes to product growth. Both stock accumulation and importing continued to increase in the second half of 1976, though less markedly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With the increases in imports and stock-building broadly commensurate in 1976, movements in the <inline font-style="italic">expenditure-based</inline> estimate of <inline font-style="italic">gross domestic product</inline> (panel j) (excluding the statistical discrepancy) and total final expenditure in each half-year were similar, with both showing stronger growth in the second half of 1976 than in the first. As panel j shows, movements in the <inline font-style="italic">income-based</inline> estimate of GDP (including the statistical discrepancy) were almost even between the two halves. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1976 as a whole <inline font-style="italic">gross domestic product</inline> (income-based) increased by 4.2 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">farm product</inline> by 4.1 per cent, and <inline font-style="italic">non-farm product</inline> (panel k) by 4.2 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the most recent half-year the fall in exports translated a broadly flat domestic final demand picture into a decline in total final expenditure. This was accompanied by a larger increase in imports than in the preceding half-year, and with markedly <inline font-style="italic">lesser</inline> non-farm stock accumulation non-farm product declined overall. (Further information on stock changes in the most recent half-year is contained in Table 4.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On present estimates for 1976-77 as a whole, domestic product (income-based) increased by 3.4 per cent, farm product by 2.4 per cent and non-farm product by 3.5 per cent. (Non-farm product growth for 1975-76 has been revised upwards from 0.8 per cent to 2.0 per cent.) The 3.5 per cent estimate for non-farm product growth for 1976-77 which, of course, remains subject to revision, compares with the forecast of about 4 per cent given in Statement No. 2 at this time last year; the pattern of developments within the year was rather more different from that foreseen, for reasons which are mentioned later. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Within the farm sector, the gross value of production of <inline font-style="italic">wheat</inline> is estimated to have declined sharply in 1976-77 reflecting a marginal fall in volume and a larger price fall. The value of <inline font-style="italic">sugar cane</inline> cut for crushing increased after the decline in 1975-76. The value of <inline font-style="italic">livestock</inline> slaughtered rose sharply again, but was still a little below its high 1973-74 level. The value of <inline font-style="italic">wool</inline> production also increased solidly for the second successive year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Industrial production</inline>grew moderately, though erratically, over the course of 1976 before falling back slightly in the first half of 1977. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">On the <inline font-style="italic">employment</inline> side one difficulty has arisen because of divergent trends shown by the quarterly population survey and by the estimates of employed wage and salary earners. As Table 1 indicates, the former has recorded a sizeable increase over the last eighteen months while the latter has shown little change (a slight rise in government employment offsetting a fall in private employment). The survey-based concept of employment is broader, including as it does employers, self-employed persons, unpaid helpers and agricultural employment in addition to wage and salary earners. The sampling variability inherent in the survey estimates and differences in the timing and methods of collection require that comparison of the two series, particularly over short periods, be made with due caution. Nonetheless, the increase in this estimate of employment over longer periods suggests that the former labour force categories have been expanding elements of the total employed population. It should be noted also that growth in the survey estimate has been stronger in part-time than in full-time employment and, more recently, also for females than males. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Observations about the level of and changes in <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> over short periods are complicated by difficulties with the seasonal adjustment process (as a consequence, seasonal adjustment of persons registered with the CES was discontinued from September 1976) and other special influences acting on the CES statistics. Indicators in Table 1 point to underlying labour market conditions stabilising in 1976 before easing further in the first half of 1 977 when labour force participation rates rose above earlier low levels and labour force growth outstripped the increase in employment. Unemployment rates among females and juniors have been above the average, even relatively more than usual in the latter case; relative wage movements have been a contributing factor. Despite the high overall incidence of unemployment, labour is reported in short supply in a number of skilled categories. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As with activity, price and income developments in the review period fall into two phases: 1976, when the trend of price inflation was distinctly downwards and factor income shares moved in favour of profits, and the first half of 1977 when the downward trend in inflation was interrupted and income shares remained at about their levels of the preceding half-year. With wage indexation continuing to link award wage movements fairly closely to the inherited rate of price inflation (extra-indexation increases have remained small throughout), increases in award wage rates (Chart 2, panel a) and ordinary time earnings (panel b) remained large in 1976-77. The increase in award wages and earnings for 1976 as a whole owed much to the February National Wage Case rise of 6.4 per cent; later in the year two partial indexation decisions and the slowing of price inflation contributed to lesser increases. More recently, the large award wage increase granted on the basis of the December quarter increase in the consumer price index boosted the rise in award wages and earnings in the June quarter (although the increases in the half-year were still slightly lower) . As panels a, b and c of Chart 2 show, there has been only a very gradual deceleration in <inline font-style="italic">award wages</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">earnings</inline> over the past two years. Although the pattern has been uneven between quarters average award wages and weekly earnings in the recent June quarter, when deflated by the private consumption and non-farm product deflators, were as high as or higher than in the same quarter of the two previous years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">consumer price index</inline> (excluding hospital and medical services) decelerated in both halves of 1976; the <inline font-style="italic">implicit deflator for major GNE components</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">aggregate non-farm prices</inline> moderated even more markedly in the second half. Table 2 details movements in these and other price indicators. With productivity growing strongly through the year (Chart 5), <inline font-style="italic">unit wage costs</inline> rose much less rapidly than wage rates and earnings in both halves of 1976. <inline font-style="italic">Unit gross surplus</inline> rose in both half-years; with product also expanding this meant that the level of <inline font-style="italic">gross operating surplus of companies</inline> increased by 23.5 per cent in the year as a whole. There was a sizeable rise in the profit share over the year from its previous very low level (Chart 4). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the first half of 1977, by contrast, measured productivity declined marginally and unit wage costs rose more sharply than earnings. Unit gross surplus increased but with product lower, the gross operating surplus of companies rose only slightly on the previous half-year. The profit share declined fairly sharply in the June quarter and for the half-year was little changed from the second half of 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The impact of the devaluation of the Australian dollar in November 1976 on the price indexes most sensitive to changes in prices of internationally traded goods was immediate and substantial (see <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Trade</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Manufacturing Industry</inline> price movements in Table 2). Effects on the broader indexes measuring final prices have been much less noticeable; this reflects both the more muted impact to be expected at later stages of production in a subdued domestic market, and also lags in transmission to final prices. Further, the prices &#39;pause&#39; discouraged some price increases during the period of its application from mid-April until late May. This latter influence was also undoubtedly a factor in the weaker profit share in the June quarter, already noted. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The rate of increase in the CPI (excluding hospital and medical services) levelled out in the first half of 1977, while aggregate non-farm prices and the deflator for major components of GNE rose more than in the preceding half-year (in part reflecting the influence of changes in composition). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1976-77 as a whole the increase in the broadly-based price indexes was four to six percentage points less than in 1975-76. Although the slowdown in the rate of increase of wage rates and earnings was much less marked, there were increases in both the profit share and, more markedly, the level of profits. In contrast to 1975-76, an increase in average <inline font-style="italic">farm sector prices</inline> (9 per cent, as measured by the implicit deflator for farm product) was sufficient, with volume growth, to produce an increase, of 18 per cent, in <inline font-style="italic">farm income</inline> following declines of 10 per cent in 1975-76 and 39 per cent in 1974-75. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With the rate and extent of unwinding of the 1974 distortion of real wages and the wage share being a key element in the process of recovery in activity and employment, wages growth and the factors underlying it warrant close examination. The system of wage indexation introduced by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in April 1975 remained the dominant influence in the process of wage determination over the past year, and its effect on the speed of real wage adjustment is of great importance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In analysing these issues it is essential to distinguish between the effect on total earnings growth - of increases in awards granted in National Wage Cases and other elements in earnings, including other award increases and hours worked, which are more directly responsive to the influence of the market place. Table 3 provides estimates of the contribution of the various influences to wages and earnings growth over recent years. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the basis of past experience in this country and elsewhere, the sharp downturn in economic activity in 1974 could have been expected to produce an early slowing in earnings and some decline in the real wage. In fact, although overtime payments began to decline early in the downturn in response to the easing demand for labour, large increases in award wages granted outside the National Wage Case arena persisted past the downturn. In 1975 as a whole, there was a sharp slow-down in other award increases, in the face of a more prolonged easing in the labour market and (not unrelated to that) a high degree of compliance with the principles of indexation. This contributed, with a fall in overtime, to the equally sharp decline in earnings growth in the first half of 1975 (see Chart 2). As in 1975, a substantial degree of indexation applied on average in 1976 but award wages increased by much more than in the preceding year on account of National Wage Cases (Table 3, first column) . A further slight deceleration in earnings occurred despite this because the market continued to bear down on the more flexible elements in earnings formation - other awards, overawards and overtime working (see Table 3). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The institutional element of wage fixation under the present system is not, of course, determined in a vacuum; by its very nature it is, however, several steps removed from the direct operation of market forces. As indicated above, in the adjustment necessitated by the massive wage increases of 1974, National Wage Case determined increases have moved in the <inline font-style="italic">opposite</inline> direction to other elements. There is, of course, a strong_possibility that this greater <inline font-style="italic">institutional</inline> contribution to awards and earnings has facilitated in some measure the lesser contribution from those other elements. The key question, however, is whether, in the prevailing circumstances, smaller national wage decisions would have been compensated fully by more rapid increases from other sources. On the evidence of Table 3, it appears likely that smaller National Wage Case increases in 1976 would have resulted in smaller earnings increases. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Sources of Growth in 1976</inline>
        </para>
        <para>In this document a year ago it was noted that: &#39;The second half of 1973-76 saw the beginnings of what, assuming continued progress in dealing with inflation, should on this occasion be a sustainable upturn.&#39; </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">The upturn did, in fact, continue into 1976-77 and was the strongest and most sustained lift in demand and activity since the onset of recession in 1974. Its characteristics differed significantly from the ephemeral upturn in demand and activity in the first half of 1975. On that occasion, as Chart 1 and Table 4 show, a large part of the increase in final demand emanated from the public sector, having its origins in the very large increase in Commonwealth outlays in 1974-75. The exceptional increases in real household incomes in 1974 produced some growth in private consumption expenditure in 1975, but this weakened again later in the year as inflation continued at high levels. There was little support from any of the other elements of private domestic final demand. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In contrast, the upturn in 1976 was concentrated in the private sector and fairly widely based. Table 4 shows percentage point contributions of major demand components to movements in gross domestic product, including the separate contributions of private and government domestic final demand. </para>
        <para class="block">

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In both 1974 and 1975, to a lesser extent, the contribution of private domestic final demand to GDP growth was weak and during fiscal 1974-75 much less than that of the government sector (this being the more remarkable since the latter is about one-third the size of the former). As long as that situation continued there could have been no prospect of a durable economic recovery. Recovery could not be sustained by burgeoning public expenditures because the associated intensification of inflation and inflationary expectations was generating offsetting depressive effects on private expenditures and eroding the international competitiveness of domestic producers. (The elements of this nexus were discussed in this document last year under the heading <inline font-style="italic">Factors in Continued Recession.)</inline> Policy, in recognition of this, has been aimed at controlling inflation and fostering private sector revival. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The rate of increase in Budget outlays decelerated sharply during 1975-76 before levelling out in 1976-77. The domestic deficit showed a broadly similar pattern, though it turned down a little later; approximate seasonally adjusted half-yearly figures are shown in Table 5. </para>

            <para>The usual seasonal pattern of receipts has been much affected by the introduction of the indexation adjustments to PAYE instalment deductions on 1 July 1976.

Similar allowance has been made throughout for changing patterns of company tax and personal income tax refunds. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">The strengthening of private expenditure in 1976 was thus of considerable significance for the durability of the upturn. As Table 4 shows, private final demand was a major element in the strengthening of GDP in both halves of 1976. Just as higher, and for a time accelerating, inflation and inflationary expectations exacerbated the weakening in private sector expenditures in 1974 and continued to contribute to subdued overall performance in 1975, the easing of inflationary pressures - both actual and expected - facilitated expansion of private spending in 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">One important element in this, which parallels the experience of overseas countries as inflation rates were brought under an increasing measure of control, has been the continued unwinding of the household saving ratio which began tentatively in 1975.

        <para pgwide="yes">Declining inflation and expanding business profitability during 1976 also shifted business confidence, actual and prospective rates of return on capital outlays, and flows of internal funds in the direction required for greater investment activity. As a result, a prospect began to emerge for the most sustained revival in business fixed investment for some years. As noted earlier, plant and equipment investment increased - in 1976, and although expenditure . on nonresidential building and construction fell further in 1976, the value of approvals and commencements began to rise from early in the year. Other factors were working to bolster plant and equipment investment in 1976. The investment allowance has been in force since 1 January 1976 and for the first half of that year double depreciation provisions also applied to a wide range of plant and equipment expenditures. Continued high unit labour costs were also encouraging investment of the labour-saving variety. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Improvements in the investment climate to date fall well short of what is required to permit a full investment recovery. For instance, as Table 7 shows, the company profit share remains significantly below its longer term norm. A feature of the economic recovery in other countries, even in the United States, has been the persistent relative sluggishness of business fixed investment despite a return to normal levels of profitability. This has raised questions about the prospective rate of return which businessmen now regard as adequate to justify the perceived risks associated with long-term capital projects in an environment of uncertainty and continued high inflation. Such questions are no less relevant in the Australian context. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Stock accumulation contributed significantly to GDP growth in 1976  -  particularly so in the turnaround from decumulation to accumulation in the first half of the year (Table 4). The stocks/ sales ratio (Table 7) had fallen in 1975 to an uncharacteristically low level for the recession phase of the cycle; severe stock shedding took place in the face of shrunken corporate cash flows and high costs of holding stocks. An easing of some of those factors and the improved outlook for sales allowed normal cyclical accumulation in 1976. The stocks/sales ratio declined a little further in early 1976 as a result of expanding sales, but this was reversed in the second half of the year. Although higher importing fairly fully matched stock building throughout 1976, there was sustained growth in export volumes until the final quarter of the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In summary, 1976 saw the beginnings of what promised to be a sustainable recovery in economic activity, based on growth in private sector expenditures occurring in an environment of declining inflation and restorative changes to the basic economic distortions that have been dampening consumer and business spending in recent years. However, the rates of increase in most of the expenditure and product aggregates in 1976 were not as strong as in previous recoveries and the 1976 expansion was more uneven, both across sectors and over time. Opinions differed, therefore, about the durability of recovery. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A lift in activity of this magnitude would usually have been enough to raise employment sufficiently to reduce unemployment notwithstanding a continuing growth in the workforce. In fact, as noted earlier in this Statement under <inline font-style="italic">Activity and Employment,</inline> and illustrated in Chart 5, total non-farm employment grew only slightly over 1976;&#39; <inline font-style="italic">wage and salary earner</inline> employment in the private sector actually declined and no impression was made on unemployment. Even after allowance for the usual productivity growth in the early recovery stage of the business cycle (Chart 5) the employment response, particularly for wage and salary earners (Table 8), was weak. Analysis of this topic is clearly of great importance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 4 (and Chart 1) showed the significant contribution of exports to domestic product growth in 1976. The relatively low labour intensiveness of many exporting industries would, of course, have enabled expansion of output to occur in those areas with relatively little employment growth. Discussion of the employment response to recovery in 1976 would be totally inadequate, however, if it failed to take up the implications of the persistence of the imbalance between real wage levels and productivity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 8 brings together some key aspects of the problem. Columns 1 and 2 of the table compare the product real wage with productivity, both measured on a per man hour basis. The product real wage, which was out of line with productivity at the beginning of 1976, remained so through the year, despite the sizeable increase in productivity that served to slow the increase in unit labour costs and prices. The associated trend in wage and salary earner employment is shown clearly in the table. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While cyclical productivity growth during 1976 ameliorated the real wage/ productivity imbalance for a time, the implications of the remaining imbalance for future employment growth should also be viewed in the context of the relationship between the product real wage and <inline font-style="italic">trend</inline> productivity. Moreover, the measure of the product real wage shown in Table 8 can be further refined to render its comparison with productivity more accurately illustrative of the remaining wage cost drag on improvements in labour market conditions. The national accounts concept of average earnings, while it does take in more than purely wage costs and, in contrast to the male-units earnings series, does reflect the effect of the transition to equal pay for females, does not encompass payroll tax - a significant non-wage labour cost. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Chart 6, which again uses March quarter 1973 as the base period, compares average real male and female awards, and average wages, salaries and supplements (national accounts basis) augmented by payroll tax per man-hour, with actual productivity per man-hour and trend productivity (calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the basis of estimated movements in productivity and employment from 1964-65 to <inline font-style="italic">1975-76).</inline> The remaining real wage/productivity distortion, relative to both actual and trend productivity, is clearly large. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As discussed in the Report of the Working Party on the Measurement of Labour Productivity, market sector productivity is the appropriate basis to consider in wage determination processes. Data on that basis, available only annually to 1975-76, were presented in the Commonwealth Submission to the August 1977 National Wage Case. In this document movements in the real product wage and other unit wage series are compared with productivity movements for the non-farm sector up to the June quarter 1977. The general picture of relativities between real labour costs and productivity for the non-farm sector has been broadly similar to that for the market sector. <inline font-style="italic">1977- The First Half</inline></para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the most recent half-year a number of factors temporarily interrupted the moderate expansion in total final demand; the non-domestic production sources of supply (non-farm stocks and imports) contributed negatively and non-farm product declined slightly. With farm product (and stocks) recording increases the decline in total domestic product was less. Unemployment drifted upwards. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Private domestic final demand was a little lower in the second half of 1976-77 than in the first half (Chart 1 and Table 4) . One contributing factor was the slackening in the first half of1977 in the previously very strong growthof private investment in dwellings discussed above (Chart 1, panel b). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">More generally, significant re-scheduling of expenditures from the second to the first half of the financial year accompanied devaluation: the December quarter of 1976 saw some consumption expenditure and investment in plant and equipment brought forward because of expectations of import price increases prior to and immediately after devaluation. Thus <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> of 1977&#39;s (first half) weakness in expenditure was 1976&#39;s (second half) strength; taking 1976-77 as a whole, private domestic final demand increased by 3.0 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 4 displays the substantial negative contribution to product growth stemming from net foreign trade in the most recent half-year, with both a decline in exports and a strong increase in imports contributing to this result. The weakness in the balance of trade in the half-year reflected a number of factors (see the <inline font-style="italic">Balance of Payments</inline> section of this Statement). In particular, the increase in the volume of imports was stronger than the general level of domestic expenditure would have indicated. Some of that strength appears to reflect the lagged effect of forward ordering of imports in anticipation of devaluation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The varying prominence of non-farm inventories in the cyclical process has also contributed to the unevenness of total non-farm output. Following a strong positive contribution to product growth at the turnaround, non-farm stock accumulation abated and was contributing negatively to product growth in the first half of 1977. Moreover, in contrast to 1976, when non-farm stock movements and imports were <inline font-style="italic">offsetting,</inline> they were working <inline font-style="italic">in tandem</inline> to depress domestic production in the first half of1977. Other economies have experienced a similar pattern of strong contribution to product growth from stock movements in the early part of recovery, giving way to a dampening influence later as the rate of accumulation eased off. This varying cyclical behaviour of stocks was, for example, one of the main elements in the so-called &#39;pause&#39; in the U.S. recovery late in 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing discussion embraces the readily identifiable reasons for the easing in economic activity between the first and second halves of 1976-77. Signs that they were largely transitory, rather than indicative of a petering out of recovery, began to emerge late in 1976-77. Although occurring too late to have much effect on the half-yearly movements in the relevant national accounts aggregates, retail sales and motor vehicle registrations strengthened over the course of the June quarter. Likewise, some renewed growth in export volumes and the beginnings of a more pronounced decline in import volumes presaged a more substantial turnaround on trade account. After falling in the March quarter, non-farm product increased by&#190; per cent in the June quarter. </para>
		<para>Balance of Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In1976-77 there was an overall <inline font-style="italic">balance of payments deficit</inline> of $481 million, following a deficit of$1 020 million in 1975-76. An increased <inline font-style="italic">current account deficit,</inline> attributable to both a reduced <inline font-style="italic">trade surplus</inline> and increased <inline font-style="italic">net invisible payments,</inline> was more than offset by a much larger <inline font-style="italic">net apparent capital inflow</inline> than in 1975-76.

        <para pgwide="yes">For analytical purposes, external account developments during 1976-77 should be divided into two periods - the five months prior to devaluation of the Australian dollar at the end of November1976, and the period thereafter.

        <para pgwide="yes">At the beginning of 1976-77 there was apprehension about the eventual impact on the balance of payments of the high, though moderating, domestic inflation rate. However, notwithstanding the continued growth in costs and prices in Australia at a faster rate than overseas, the average monthly <inline font-style="italic">trade</inline> surplus in the first five months of 1976-77 was larger than in either of the two preceding half-years. Towards the end of the period there were some signs of a weakening in the trade account. After showing (unsustainably) strong growth in the September quarter, exports fell in subsequent months; at the same time growth in imports quickened and, in retrospect, there appears to have been some advance ordering of (and paying, or covering forward against paying, for) imports in expectation of a change in the exchange rate. Notwithstanding continuing growth in net invisible payments abroad, the deficit on <inline font-style="italic">current account</inline> remained relatively moderate in the pre-devaluation period. </para>

There was a net apparent private capital outflow in the first five months of 1976-77 of over $600 million, powerfully influenced by exchange rate expectations; a substantial part of this outflow was attributable to speculative leading of import payments and lagging of export receipts. As a result, by 26 November official reserve assets were about one-third lower than a year earlier. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Against the background of this continuing loss of reserves, and the continued deterioration in Australia&#39;s underlying external competitive position, it was decided, with effect from 29 November 1976, to devalue the Australian dollar by 17.5 per cent and to institute a more flexibly administered exchange rate system. The immediate objective was to reverse the earlier speculative outflow of capital and to ease the sectional burden being shouldered by certain areas of the mining, rural and manufacturing industries in the effort to overcome inflation. At the same time, in recognition of the effect of devaluation on the overall setting of macro-economic policy, fiscal and monetary policies were tightened and the Government argued consistently that direct price effects of devaluation should not flow through into wages via indexation. Capital flows were being monitored closely and, as discussed below, inflow controls were soon extended. The objective was to preserve the gains from devaluation by minimising its potential second-round flow-on into the domestic cost and price structure. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">The Post-devaluation Period</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Devaluation had an immediate effect on capital transactions: the private capital outflows of the preceding months were quickly replaced by a very high rate of capital inflow. In December/January net apparent private capital inflow totalled about $900 million, reflecting a resurgence of new overseas borrowing and the start of the process of unwinding of pre-devaluation leads and lags in trade payments. Although the rate of private capital inflow diminished after the initial devaluation was reduced to 12.45 per cent in a series of eight steps, for the two-month period as a whole there was a balance of payments surplus of over $650 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In view of these developments, and the large inflows in prospect, as evidenced by applications for exchange control approval to borrow overseas, early action was taken, with effect from 17 January, to strengthen controls on overseas borrowing. The embargo on short-term overseas borrowings was extended to all borrowings repayable in less than two years, and a variable deposit requirement of 25 per cent was imposed on borrowings for two years or more for specific non-exempt purposes. This latter measure brought the effective interest cost of such funds more into line with that of domestic borrowing. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These extended controls, and dissipation of the unwinding of pre-devaluation leads and lags, resulted in a moderation in the rate of private capital inflow. In the last five months of the year, private capital inflow was much the same in total as in the <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> preceding months. However, after allowance for small net capital payments overseas on official account and a small net inflow as a result of marketing authorities&#39; capital transactions, total net apparent capital inflow was a little over $1650 million in the post-devaluation period. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The impact of devaluation - in particular its time profile - on the <inline font-style="italic">current account</inline> was more complex. As expected, the initial effects of the exchange rate change on export and import prices in Australian dollar terms showed up quite rapidly. Most export prices (in Australian dollars) responded quickly to devaluation (see Table 2); most of our exporters are price takers in world markets or sell under contracts denominated in foreign currencies. These initial gains appear largely to have been held. Similarly, import prices (in Australian dollars) rose substantially in the period immediately following devaluation (see Table 2). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The response of export and import volumes to such price changes is lagged. The lags involved are variable according to the particular circumstances of the time, and can be masked in actual figures by the operation of other factors. The postdevaluation period provides an interesting example. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the exports side, the immediate effect of devaluation on Australian dollar prices was partially offset by a period of subdued overseas demand for some main export commodities (e.g. wool, sugar and a number of minerals and metals) and by the effect of industrial disputes. The volume of exports in the second half of 1976-77 was therefore lower than in the first half. Even in the context of devaluation that is not surprising; while in some cases demand increases can be met by reducing existing stocks at near post-devaluation prices, in general the effect of devaluation on export volumes is very slow to emerge - especially for rural commodities with annual production cycles. The continued subdued overseas demand for some major Australian exports also served to delay the volume response. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The total value of imports increased sharply following devaluation. Apart from the price increases noted above, there was a strong rise in the volume of imports in the March quarter. In the closing months of1976-77 the volume of imports began to decline; in the June quarter imports of goods and services (seasonally adjusted at constant prices) fell by 5 per cent but remained above pre-devaluation levels. There appear to have been two main explanations for the delay in the emergence of the volume effects of devaluation (i.e. a shift away <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> imports to cheaper domestic substitutes). First, because of relatively slack domestic demand conditions, which led to some unintended stock accumulation, the price effects of devaluation, as reflected in import prices, were slow to be passed on to final buyers; that would be consistent with the sharp drop in the profit share in the June quarter (Table 7). The six-week price pause&#39; in the June quarter of 1977 may also have been relevant. Secondly, it appears that substantial orders for <inline font-style="italic">imports may have</inline> been placed late in1976 in anticipation of devaluation, with the arrival being concentrated in the first half of 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net outcome of these developments was a substantial reduction in the trade surplus in the post-devaluation period. With the net deficit on invisible transactions also adversely affected by devaluation in the short term, and with adverse seasonal factors operating in the period involved, the current account deficit increased appreciably. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">However, the resumption of private capital inflow more than offset the increase in the current account deficit. As a result there was an overall balance of payments surplus of$199 million in the last seven months of 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Monetary Conditions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table10 and Chart 7 set out the main factors producing changes in private sector liquidity and the volume of money over 1976-77 and the preceding two financial years. Table11 provides quarterly data on the asset composition of movements in the portfolios of government securities of major financial sectors over 1976-77 and the preceding two financial years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Strong injections from domestic budgetary transactions continued to be the dominant influence on private sector liquidity, with the domestic Budget deficit estimated to have run at seasonally adjusted annual rates of around$2100 million in the first half of 1976-77 and $1900 million in the second half. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Despite the drop between the two half-years, these seasonally adjusted figures mask an even stronger than usual within-year swing in domestic budgetary transactions, stemming largely from the concentration of company tax collections in the last four months of the financial year (see Chart 8). With the known prospect of an unusually large end-year seasonal liquidity contraction, adequate preparation within the private sector by way of stocking portfolios with short-term Government securities during the liquidity upswing was an important aim of monetary management early in the year. To facilitate that process, Treasury Note yields were raised. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Following the seasonally tight June quarter of 1976, private sector liquidity increased markedly in the September quarter, with the effects of the domestic Budget deficit of $2106 million only partly countered by unwinding of the Reserve Bank&#39;s commercial bill portfolio and a drain from private sector foreign exchange transactions. Substantial subscriptions to the July 1976 Commonwealth loan by the non-bank private sector were largely offset by sales of already issued securities to the authorities so that net nonbank take-up of Government debt amounted to only a moderate$156 million in the quarter. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Ease in financial conditions at this time was evidenced by strong growth in the monetary aggregates and in the balance sheets of major financial institutions. Subsequent financing of speculation against the exchange rate was facilitated and adverse expectations about the rate were reinforced by perception of the inflationary implications of domestic monetary ease. This meant that measures of domestic credit showed more rapid expansion than did the usual monetary indicators. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Notwithstanding the end of the seasonal run-down in the preceding June quarter, private short-term interest rates declined only a little in the early months of 1976-77. Expectations of early official interest rate reductions, which had been gathering some strength earlier in the year, were not maintained and sales of Government paper continued sluggish in October. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Against this background, and in pursuance of the Government&#39;s monetary objectives - that monetary growth should provide sufficient funds to foster sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while exerting some downward pressure on inflation - monetary policy instruments were tightened in early November. With primary liquidity growing strongly, restraint in secondary credit creation was required for financial conditions to be less than fully accommodating to inflation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These measures included further increases in yields on very short-term Government securities leading through to higher yields on short and medium Government paper, a percentage point rise in the SRD ratio and guidance to restrain lending by financial intermediaries. Nonetheless, speculation against the currency - strongly in evidence in September and October - continued, leading to the devaluation in late November. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To offset the expansionary monetary impact of the expected post-devaluation unwinding of leads and lags in trade payments and the turnaround in other private capital flows, further increases in official yields at the time of the devaluation were followed by increased restrictions on overseas borrowings in January and the series of small revaluations over the December-February period. The SRD ratio was increased from 6 per cent to 10 per cent in steps of one percentage point, the last increase being in February. Added emphasis was given to slowing the pace of lending by various intermediaries. The rapid strengthening of demand for Treasury Notes in the December quarter - particularly in the latter part - is reflected in Table 1 1 . </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the March quarter, primary liquidity rose by SI 031 million; an aggregate Budget deficit of SI 171 million in January and February more than offset a surplus of S518 million in March. Private sector foreign exchange transactions, having turned to surplus, added strongly to liquidity. Non-bank accumulation of Government paper early in the quarter was largely unwound in March as the seasonal tax harvest got under way; over the quarter as a whole, Treasury Notes in, the hands of non-bank holders fell by $366 million while their stocks of other securities (which include Treasury Bonds and Australian Savings Bonds) increased by S468 million. A substantial run-off in banks&#39; commercial bill holdings and diminished demand for other accommodation following devaluation meant that trading bank advances outstanding declined by S373 million in seasonally adjusted terms in January and February but resumed their growth in March. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the time of the seasonal liquidity peak at around end-February, private sector holdings of very short-dated assets seemed adequate, in aggregate, to negotiate the prospective large liquidity contraction associated with the very substantial tax harvest. The capacity of the banking system to finance this seasonal funds transfer was augmented by reversion of the LGS ratio from 23 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 April. In early April, major trading banks&#39; margins of free liquidity averaged a little over 10 percentage points but with considerable dispersion between banks. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="106131197708163_86_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the event, financial markets met the withdrawal of funds without exceptional strain. Aggregate funds flows to the Government on Budget account during the period turned&#39; out to be fairly well in line with expectations; none the less, some tight periods in markets were occasioned by difficulties in matching the maturity structure of assets with an imperfectly known pattern of funds flows. Sensitive private short-term interest rates increased seasonally. Reflecting some revision to interest rate expectations and a level of rates more in accord with the market&#39;s more optimistic perception of current and future rates of inflation following the publication of the consumer price index for the March quarter, the non-bank private sector subscribed heavily to the Commonwealth May loan and subsequently made substantial net purchases of Government paper through the market (see Table 11). This, together with some reversion to deficit in private sector foreign exchange transactions in May-June, sharply reduced the liquidity of major trading banks at the tail-end of the drain. To maintain the banks&#39; liquidity positions, the SRD ratio was reduced by two percentage points around year-end. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In last year&#39;s Budget Speech the Treasurer foreshadowed that growth in the broadly defined volume of money, M3, in the 10-12 per cent range during 1976-77 would be consistent with the aims of Government policy. The 10.6 per cent increase recorded in M3 for the year, compared with 13.8 per cent in 1975-76, signifies considerable success in the operation of monetary policy during a year which was not without its difficulties and in which circumstances changed markedly as it unfolded. A substantial within-year firming of monetary conditions is indicated in the reduction in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth of M3 from 15 per cent in the half-year to December 1976 to 6 per cent in the half-year to June 1977 - though problems of seasonal adjustment exaggerate the apparent turnaround. This pattern partly reflects the fact that, following devaluation, demands were made on the monetary instruments additional to those already required by fiscal settings in order to maintain the overall anti-inflationary stance of policy. In early July the controls on overseas borrowings reverted to their settings prior to mid-January. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An important element of the monetary outcome was the contribution that $1089 million in sales of Commonwealth Government securities to the non-bank private sector, made towards financing the large domestic Budget deficit. Australian Savings Bonds continued to prove a useful addition to the set of monetary instruments, netting (after allowance for redemptions of Special Bonds and Savings Bonds) $366 million in subscriptions, almost all by the non-bank sector. Although holdings rose substantially over the liquidity upswing, aggregate Treasury Note portfolios of non-bank groups declined marginally over the year as a whole. The bulk of the growth in holdings of other securities (mainly Treasury Bonds) was concentrated in the seasonally tight halfyear. (Table 11 contains details of Government financing transactions.) As in 1975-76, when a net $1122 million (or 77 per cent of total non-bank take-up) was received from Australian Savings Bonds, non-bank take-up of Government paper accounted for over 50 per cent of the domestic Budget deficit. Reflecting a complex of factors, some data pertaining to which appear in Table 10, banking sector (excluding Reserve Bank) holdings of government debt fell by $252 million in 1976-77 compared with a rise of $71 million in 1975-76. This, together with portfolio adjustments of other sectors, meant that 56 per cent of total Budget financing was accounted for by borrowings from the Reserve Bank in 1976-77. Further details of Budget financing are set out in Statement No. 5. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While sale of Government securities to the non-bank sector is generally the least inflationary method of financing a given deficit, that policy mix does not have the same advantages for anti-inflationary policy as a smaller Budget deficit. The securities acquired may be highly liquid assets readily convertible into cash - indeed even longer term bonds can be monetised without significant capital loss if official interest rates are not flexible upwards. Furthermore, the size of the public sector borrowing requirement has direct implications for the cost and availability of funds for private borrowers in financial markets. These points have added force when, against the background of a succession of large Budget deficits, the stock of outstanding Government debt has been greatly swollen. The deficit financing task during 1976-77 was not, then, just to place new paper in the hands of firm holders but to ensure also that as far as possible the outstanding stock in the hands of non-bank holders remained in such hands. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The public sector&#39;s borrowing requirement seems to have been a little larger in 1976-77 than in 1975-76, after allowance for prepayment by the Commonwealth late in 1975-76 of some funds required by the States in 1976-77, which implied an artificial switch of State budget deficits from the earlier year to 1976-77. The reduction in the Commonwealth&#39;s Budget deficit was more than offset by growth in the borrowing programs of public authorities outside the Budget sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although corporate profits continued to record firm growth and demand for investment funds remained subdued in 1976-77, substantial stock accumulation <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> have meant (the data are extremely limited) that the corporate sector&#39;s borrowing requirement was larger than in 1975-76. New fixed interest raisings grew strongly in 1976 while equity financing by listed companies was2&#189; times the level of the year before. The fall in share prices over the early part of 1976-77 was reversed at the time of devaluation. The Sydney Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index was 3 per cent lower at 30 June 1977 than a year earlier. The household sector&#39;s demand for funds remained firm, particularly for personal loans and housing finance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These financing requirements were met without a sharp rise in the general level of private sector interest rates; administered rates were unchanged. First mortgage rates for housing finance held steady. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">With the strong inflow of funds to banks and building societies during the liquidity  upswing, lending for housing returned to a high level in the second half of 1976. In the March quarter 1977, when deposit growth was slower than expected, lending fell more than seasonally. However, the effects were short-lived, and a renewed pick-up began in the June quarter. </para>

		<para>Background</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The preceding analysis has portrayed an economy that, for a variety of reasons, experienced a temporary pause in domestic activity around the end of calendar 1976 and into the early months of 1977. In discussing the various elements of the total picture, attention has been drawn to factors which could be expected to continue to depress and to others which can be expected to prove transitory. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most important in the latter category is that the balance of payments on current account has begun to show signs of improvement and can be expected to improve further over the months ahead. The expected gains from devaluation are taking time to emerge for import-competing industries, but should gather further momentum over the course of 1977-78. On the other hand, there are continuing forces, associated with still high inflation and the level of real wages, which will serve to hold back the pace of private sector recovery, and, more especially, of employment growth. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Government policy for some time now has &#39;been based on the premise that control of inflation is fundamental to the achievement of other economic policy objectives. Some success has been achieved but the reduction of inflation necessarily remains the primary economic policy objective. It has also been increasingly recognised that long term sustainable recovery in the economy will be possible only if the profitability of investment is restored to an adequate level. The Government has consistently pressed the case for continued moderation in wage increases as a means both of reducing inflation and restoring corporate profitability and employment. There have been encouraging improvements in profitability, but even after allowance for the influence of underutilised capacity, the rate of return on invested funds would not appear to be sufficient to ensure an adequate level of investment in the medium term. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The prospects for significant growth in employment depend very much on the trend in real wages. So long as the price of labour, and particularly certain categories of labour, remains excessive relative to its product, there will continue to be both a tendency for contraction in the overall scale of production and, for any particular level of activity, a heightened tendency to substitute capital for labour. The latter process is now seemingly occurring at an advanced rate. Clearly, if the wage settlement processes do not serve to further reduce the share of labour in the national income, market forces will operate to reduce employment or at least the rate of growth of employment, and the same end will be attained - but more slowly and much more painfully. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in wage relativities and compression of margins have led to a change in the composition of unemployment at the cost of the female labour force, the young and the unskilled. Those changes cannot easily be reversed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In January this year, the Government announced in broad terms its intentions for this year&#39;s Budget; namely, constraining government outlays to within zero real growth and further reducing the deficit. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These intentions were seen as consistent with the overall requirements of policy, and they remain so. In the months since then, the Government has reaffirmed in its decision-making the weight it places on the desirability of continuing fiscal restraint. As elaborated in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech, not only is this expected to contribute directly to the primary objective of policy but also to permit, at an appropriate stage of the developing situation, some easing of the overall settings of monetary policy. Expenditure growth has, accordingly, been held back to 10.5 per cent in nominal terms and the deficit is estimated to be$2217 million (the corresponding domestic deficit is $1347 million). This compares with recorded deficits of $2740 million in 1976-77 and $3585 million in 1975-76 (and domestic deficits in the two years of $1995 million and $2905 million respectively) . </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">What then is the economic outlook for 1977-78 and the period ahead given the Government&#39;s Budget decisions and&#39; the background of other relevant developments? </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Forecasting is an uncertain undertaking at any time but is the more difficult in a period in which the economy is operating outside its normal range of functioning. A table of key economic ratios introduced in this Statement last year served to illustrate this observation. Its updated counterpart, Table 7, indicates that although considerable progress has been made in the return to stable conditions there is still some way to go. As already noted, the continuing high rate of inflation, together with the continuing high cost of labour relative to capital, have their implications for the recovery path. They also have their implications for uncertainty surrounding private sector expectations and decision-making. These heightened uncertainties naturally translate into uncertainties attaching to the macro-economic outlook. Expectations are obviously crucial, but the ways in which, and the extent to which, policy influences them cannot be predicted with precision. The following description necessarily makes judgments about how expectations are and will be developing and, on that basis, details the most likely path that the economy will take. By the nature of the exercise, the description cannot hope to be correct in all its specific elements although, hopefully, greater certainty should attach to the broad picture. </para>
		<para>Assumptions</para>
        <para>The following assumptions underlie the overall forecast. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> The improved budgetary situation will permit some gradual easing in monetary instruments over the course of 1977-78; the broad aim will remain to administer monetary policy so as to continue to provide adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down on inflation and inflationary expectations. o Apart  from  the Budget proposals themselves, -there  will be no new  fiscal measures during 1977-78.  o  The recovery in overseas economies will continue at a steady, albeit moderate, rate and Australia&#39;s balance of payments will strengthen over the course of 1977-78.  o  Seasonal conditions will be broadly consistent with a level of real farm product similar to that in 1976-77.  o  Partial indexation of award wages  will  continue,  as  will restraint  in  increases outside the indexation guidelines. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It should be explicitly acknowledged that, so far as the last of these assumptions is concerned, the factors governing it are only indirectly within Commonwealth policy influence. Yet there can be no question that full indexation of wages would have most serious repercussions. Equally, exclusion from award wage adjustments of changes  in  the consumer price index attributable to devaluation and oil price increases is essential  if  the desired effects of these changes are to be fully garnered. To the extent that devaluation serves simply to raise the <inline font-style="italic">general</inline> domestic cost and price structure, its intended effect of increasing relative prices (and profitability) in the import-competing and export industries will not be achieved; similarly, if oil price increases flow significantly into prices generally via wage indexation adjustments, then the intended <inline font-style="italic">relative</inline> price effects of the policy will be to that extent eroded. </para>
		<para>Expenditures</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private consumption expenditure</inline>is expected  to  grow  at a  moderate rate over  the  course of 1977-78, this being accompanied, as  in  1976-77, by some decline  in the  saving ratio. Real household disposable income was boosted in the September quarter by the introduction of personal tax indexation and the new system of family allowances. It then fell slowly in the remaining quarters but for the year as a whole was 1.6 per cent higher than in 1975-76. Consumption increased by 2.8 per cent. In early 1977-78 there was again a significant increase in real disposable income because of the annual indexation adjustment of tax scales. The changes to the tax scales taking effect in February 1978 will lead to a further significant increase in the second half of the year. Further easing in the labour market could tend to dampen consumer confidence; so too would any acceleration in the rate of inflation. On the other hand a lift in private expenditures is now  Occurring  as the timing and other effects of the devaluation on spending recede. In summary, moderate growth in consumption  is  expected, accompanied by a lower average saving ratio than in 1976-77, but remaining well above its average level over the 1960s. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Investment in dwellings</inline>weakened in the first half of 1977, as the industry cleared its excess stocks and the rate of loan approvals by major lenders slackened temporarily. Loan approvals quickened over the past quarter and the government has acted to remove any official restraints on lending for private home building. After allowance for some lag for these developments to show up in work done, the prospect is for activity in this area to return during 1977-78 to the high levels achieved in mid-1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The timing of <inline font-style="italic">investment in plant and equipment</inline> over the course of 1976-77 has been influenced by taxation concessions and by the forward shift of investment in anticipation of devaluation-induced price rises. The marked improvement in corporate profitability and in actual and expected inflation, together with the incentive to substitute capital for over-costly labour, have all contributed to lifting the underlying growth in investment. Continued improvement in inflationary expectations and profitability, the expected modest uplift in domestic spending and product, and a quickening in the pace of mining activity should see the flatness in investment in plant and equipment of early 1977 give way to significant expansion over the course of 1977-78. Year-on-year growth may, however, be quite moderate as a result of the pattern of investment over the course of 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The outlook for <inline font-style="italic">investment in other building and construction</inline> is also encouraging. The steep decline in expenditure of the past two years appears to have been arrested in the first half of 1977. Private <inline font-style="italic">other (non-residential) building</inline> approvals and commencements, though erratic, were substantially higher in the second half of 1976 and into 1977 than a year or so earlier; and while the precise timing of the resultant investment is uncertain the outlook is for growth in this area through 1977-78. Private expenditure in the heavy <inline font-style="italic">construction</inline> area seems likely to benefit progressively from important new mineral developments expected to get under way in the period ahead. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Continued growth in <inline font-style="italic">government current expenditures</inline> over the course of 1976-77 - primarily at the level of State and local governments - has been partly offset by declines in <inline font-style="italic">government capital expenditures.</inline> 1977-78 could well see more moderate growth in current expenditures together with some growth in capital expenditures. Again, however, growth is likely to be stronger at the State and local government levels; growth in the Commonwealth sector will be largely confined to semi-government authorities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The evidence of the past two quarters is that non-farm <inline font-style="italic">stock accumulation</inline> has slowed a little from the rates recorded in the second half of 1976. The ratio of stocks to sales now lies somewhat above the level of recent experience and, with a more moderate rate of growth in consumption than in 1976, there could be modest stock decumulation over 1977-78. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">External transactions in 1977-78 will continue to respond to the net depreciation of the exchange rate in late 1976-early 1977 and the further depreciation in early August, as well as to overseas and domestic economic conditions. Overall, there is likely to be a deficit in the early part of the year, largely reflecting normal seasonal influences. However, with our international reserves now realistically valued and with a renewed program of moderate but steady borrowing abroad on government account, Australia&#39;s reserves are such that no difficulty is expected in financing such a deficit. During the latter part of the year, the balance of payments is expected to strengthen, with a resumption of additions to reserves. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The present outlook is for continuing real growth, at a moderate pace, in Australia&#39;s major export markets. Subdued overseas demand in the early part of the year for certain Australian products may be followed by a strengthening as the year progresses. Export receipts should benefit from higher average prices, partly as a result of the full-year effect of devaluation. Higher Australian dollar import prices resulting from devaluation should lead to increasing substitution of domestic production for imports, which may also be affected by clearing of what may well have become some excess stocks. The trade balance is thus expected to strengthen further as the year progresses and the current account deficit should follow a similar pattern. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On capital account, with the resumption of long-term official borrowing overseas already noted, a moderate net inflow is expected on government capital account. Transactions of primary produce marketing authorities are however expected to result in a net capital outflow in 1977-78, mainly in the first half of the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net apparent private capital inflow should increase in 1977-78. In particular, the prospects for increased domestic investment, and continued progress in reducing the underlying rate of inflation, should lead to higher long-term investment from overseas. </para>\
		<para>Monetary Conditions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing would imply moderate net monetary inflow on private sector account during 1977-78. The other major primary formation factor - domestic budgetary transactions - is estimated to contribute substantially less to private sector holdings of LGS assets than in 1976-77. Borrowings under approved programs for semi-government (Commonwealth and State) and local authorities are expected to increase by$245 million (see Budget Paper No. 7). The aggregate public sector demand for borrowed funds is thus likely to be no greater than in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Security sales to the non-bank sector have been very strong in the past several months primarily reflecting, it would seem, expectations of lower interest rates associated with a more favourable inflation prospect. Given the favourable outlook for gross corporate profits, the present expectations for increased business fixed capital expenditure, the relatively small increase in company tax collections (see Statement 4) and the possible stock decumulation, the corporate sector seems likely to require, in aggregate, considerably less in borrowed funds from other sectors in 1977-78 than in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The overall policy context of this Budget should serve to sustain the strength of official bond sales. This, when coupled with likely business demand for funds, holds open the prospect of lower growth in the monetary aggregates than in 1976-77 in conjunction with reduced pressure on interest rates and some gradual easing in the settings of other monetary policy instruments. In this connection, it will be noted from the Budget Speech that official restraints on lending for housing have been removed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Putting a little more precision on the outlook, expected growth in the volume of money (broadly defined) over the course of 1977-78 is in the range of 8-10 per cent given the assumptions and general environment discussed above. If the associated expectations about product and price outcomes are realised, this would continue to represent, as in 1976-77, monetary growth consistent with the objectives of policy; namely, to provide sufficient funds to underwrite sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while maintaining downward pressure on inflation and inflationary expectations. Some increase in the velocity of circulation is expected. </para>
		<para>Product</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The outlook for domestic demand and the balance of trade is consistent with year-on-year growth in <inline font-style="italic">gross non-farm product</inline> in real terms of about 2 per cent between 1976-77 and 1977-78. Because of the pattern of change within 1976-77 - a strong early period followed by a flat close - 2 per cent growth for 1977-78 as a whole would represent an increase of more than 4 per cent <inline font-style="italic">over the course of</inline> the year; that is, from June quarter 1977 to June quarter 1978 non-farm product is expected to grow by over 4 per cent, compared with 1 per cent from June quarter 1976 to June quarter 1977. It is of course the rate of growth over the course of the year which influences the prospective trend from now on in such other elements in the outlook as employment and unemployment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Real farm product in 1977-78 will, as always, be greatly influenced by seasonal conditions; at present it is expected to be at much the same level as in 1976-77; on that basis, real aggregate farm income would be likely to fall from the previous year&#39;s level. </para>
		<para>Labour Market</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given an expectation that real wage levels will continue to hamper demand for labour, the projected product growth of over 4 per cent over the course of 1977-78 would probably be accompanied by growth in <inline font-style="italic">productivity</inline> of more than half that amount. Employment growth from June 1977 to June 1978 is therefore likely to be something approaching 2 per cent. For the prospective development of unemployment the relevant comparison is between this anticipated employment increase from June 1977 to June 1978 and the likely change in the <inline font-style="italic">labour force</inline> over that period. Given expected job opportunities, the participation rate is likely to be litt&#39;e changed at end 1977-78 from end 1976-77. On this basis, the labour force increment from June 1977 to June 1978 would be almost the same as the employment increase. Therefore, although there is some prospect for a reduction in <inline font-style="italic">unemployment,</inline> on balance the likeli-  hood is for little or no change over this period. Given the pattern of product and employment changes, this through-the-year result would probably be accompanied by further easing (in an implicit seasonally adjusted sense) to around the end of 1977, followed by a moderate down-trend over the course of 1978 as product and employment growth gather momentum. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Growth in employment in year-on-year terms in 1977-78 corresponding to growth from June 1977 to June 1978 approaching 2 per cent would be around 1 per cent; labour force growth on this basis would be about the same. The public sector is expected to generate some of this growth in employment, although less than in 1976-77; most of it is expected to occur in the private sector. </para>
		<para>Prices and Incomes</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This year&#39;s May decision of the Arbitration Commission recognised the serious consequences that would flow from compensating wage earners for devaluation-induced price increases. As noted above, similar consequences would flow from full compensation for the results of oil price increases. On the assumption that there will be some further discounting on both these accounts in the following decisions, with a degree of partial indexation for the balance of the increase in the consumer price index, the outlook for (male) <inline font-style="italic">award wages</inline> growth in 1977-78 is of the order of <inline font-style="italic">\0i</inline> per cent following a 12.9 per cent increase in 1976-77. As noted in the discussion of the revenue estimates in Statement No. 4, the assumption that has been adopted for average weekly earnings is that they will also increase by 10! per cent in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of the effects of the prices and wages &#39;pause&#39; from mid-April of this year, the increase in the <inline font-style="italic">consumer price index</inline> in the June quarter was perhaps a little lower than it might otherwise have been. In addition, final prices have not yet fully reflected the increases in import and other prices that occurred in response to devaluation. The unwinding of both these factors may increase somewhat the September quarter outcome for the CPI. Similarly, the decisions relating to the prices of petroleum products will have a direct impact on the CPI in the December quarter and an indirect impact in that and later quarters depending on the speed and extent to which increased costs of transportation and production are passed through into final prices. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On the other hand, a number of influences will be acting to reduce the underlying rate of price increase in 1977-78. This Budget continues the overall thrust of policy of the past couple of years - particularly reductions in the growth in government outlays and in the deficit and a slowing in the rates of increase in the monetary aggregates. Inflationary expectations are undoubtedly being wound down. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Judgments about the inflation prospect depend on a range of interrelated factors including the rate of profit recovery. A slower rise in unit profits and or more favourable wage determination developments would mean a lower anticipated inflation rate. Whatever the outcome for the year as a whole there should be a first-half increase somewhat higher and a second-half increase somewhat lower than the increase for the year as a whole. That is to say, the expected pattern of change is for a slowing in the rate of inflation as 1977-78 progresses; the rate of change of <inline font-style="italic">consumer prices</inline> in the June quarter 1978 seems likely to be 2-2i per cent. Movements in <inline font-style="italic">broadly-based deflators</inline> would be of a similar order to that in consumer prices, with the downward trend in rates of change possibly emerging a little earlier. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The movement towards import parity for domestic crude oil and other related decisions is expected to add something less than 1 per cent to aggregate price indexes during 1977-78. To the extent that wages are compensated for these policy-induced price rises, the general inflationary effect will, of course, be greater. In terms of the overall inflationary outlook, however, the major contributor will continue to be the wage indexation treadmill; if the Commission were to award increases at a lower degree of indexation than has prevailed, then the increase in prices in 1977-78 could be markedly less than in 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Projected growth in average weekly earnings and prices would lead to some decline in real average earnings per employed person over the course of 1977-78. Employment growth of the anticipated magnitude would, however, be sufficient to mean no decline in real aggregate earnings over the period. Given the actual and projected changes in personal taxes - the indexation reduction of 1 July 1977 and the new scales of 1 February 1978 - cash benefits and other income components, aggregate real household disposable income would in these circumstances show a noticeable rise over the course of the year, although not much change in year-on-year terms. Together with the expected increase in measured productivity, this outcome for wages and prices would be, as noted above, consistent with a further recovery in the profit share in national income. By mid- 1978, factor shares are likely to be closer to the levels of historical experience than for any time since mid-1973. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The foregoing picture would represent a further significant step along a path of sustainable growth although not, clearly, one of rapid recovery. As has been the case for several years, recovery will be consolidated and strengthened the more rapidly inflation is wound down. This, in turn, remains heavily dependent on the extent to which money wage increases are held to less than inherited price increases. Arbitral decisions apart, success in that objective will continue to depend on the overall economic environment created by fiscal and monetary policy. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The following table shows, according to major functional and sub-functional headings, actual outlays in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and estimated outlays in 1977-78: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The following chart gives a broad impression of the relative size of the major functional blocks of total outlays and recent and projected movements in those proportions. It is emphasized that changes in these functional blocks from one year to another are affected by a number of special factors, such as hospital pre-payments to the States in 1975-76, introduction of family allowances in 1976-77, large repayments by the Australian Wool Corporation in 1976-77 and 1977-78, and changes in administrative arrangements. </para>

		  <page.no>99</page.no>
		</subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">Outlays for defence in 1977-78 are estimated at $2343 million, an increase  of  7.4 per cent over 1976-77 and equivalent to 8.8 per cent of total Budget outlays. This estimate does not include any provision for increases in wages and salaries of defence personnel during 1977-78 although provision for such increases is made in the $90 million bulk allowance for wage and salary increases. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="106131197708163_98_0.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para>Manpower Costs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has been made for an increase of $73.8 million in defence manpower costs in 1977-78. The main reasons for the increase are the full-year effects of awards and determinations made in 1976-77 and an increase in service strengths largely associated with the manning of new equipment coming into service and the activation of HMAS Stirling, Cockburn Sound, W.A. An increase in the number of pensioners and the effect of pension increases brought about by indexation, offset in part by one less pension payday in 1977-78, are the main factors accounting for the net increase of $14.9 million in the defence forces retirement and death benefits provision. Manpower costs are estimated to account for 52.6 per cent of total defence outlays in 1977-78 compared with 53.1 per cent of actual defence outlays in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Defence Equipment and Stores</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, armour, artillery, etc.) are adequate to meet likely contingencies. Outlays on &#39;capital&#39; type equipment in 1977-78 are estimated at $318.7 million, or $41.5 million more than in 1976-77. Substantial provision is made for many on-going acquisitions of new equipment including patrol frigates, an oceanographic ship, Oberon submarines, patrol boats and electronic counter measure equipment for the Navy, Leopard medium tanks, Rapier surface to air guided missile systems and Nomad aircraft for the Army and Hercules CI 30 and Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft for the RAAF. Provision also has been made for a start on some new major equipment projects and on other equipment, details of which will be announced by the Minister for Defence in due course. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on supporting equipment and stores is estimated at $222.9 million in 1977-78, compared with $196.6 million in 1976-77. Outlays on repair and maintenance of equipment and stores already in service - including periodic refit of naval vessels and overhaul of service aircraft, vehicles, etc. - is estimated to increase by $5.3 million. </para>
		<para>Defence Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain facilities, including adequate living and working accommodation for defence personnel. Advances to the States for the provision of housing for servicemen and their families are estimated at $26.1 million, $9.0 million less than the amount spent in 1976-77. In addition to this housing, which is being built by State Housing Authorities, the Commonwealth intends to acquire land and construct houses at Rockingham (W.A.) for personnel of the Cockburn Sound Naval Support Facility and of the ships to be based there. Other significant new projects include the acquisition of a large tract of land at Yampi ( W.A.) for use as a training area, the construction of Stage 2 of the development of Williamstown Naval Dockyard (Vic.) and Point Cook RAAF Base (Vic), and additional fuel storage facilities at military bases. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on these and other projects is expected to total $172.2 million in 1977-78 compared with $168.8 million in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Industrial Capacity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Tn the main, expenditure under this heading is directed towards the maintenance in Government factories and in industry of reserve production capacity considered essential for defence purposes. Expenditure is estimated at $53.6 million in 1977-78, compared with $51.3 million in 1976-77. Other expenditures covered under this item are the costs of production/ development of special defence projects in Government factories, such as Ikara and Turana, and in industry; production assistance for the construction of Nomad aircraft; and the acquisition and maintenance of reserve stocks of essential war material. The Government has also recently announced its approval to the production of a further 25 Nomad aircraft bringing the total approved for production to 120. </para>
		<para>Defence Science and Technology Establishments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence science and technology is aimed at assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in defence technology and at developing weapons and weapon systems suited to Australia&#39;s defence needs. The estimated expenditure of $91.6 million in 1977-78 covers the salaries, other administrative and operating expenses, machinery, plant and works services of defence science establishments and laboratories and the Woomera range. Some reduction in overall manpower levels is planned, but provision has been made for continuation of a modest level of trials activity at Woomera, in conjunction particularly with the United Kingdom. </para>
        <para class="block">Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government aims to help friendly countries in the region to strengthen their own and the region&#39;s defence capacity. Estimated expenditure of $25.9 million in 1977-78 ($25.4 million in 1976-77) includes $7.2 million to Indonesia as part of Australia&#39;s current three year commitment program of $25 million which terminates 30 June 1978, and $4.8 million for continuing assistance to Malaysia and Singapore. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $13.2 million is also included for defence co-operation activities with Papua New Guinea in 1977-78, compared with $14.0 million last year. The small decrease reflects the progressive reduction in numbers and support costs of Australian servicemen in Papua New Guinea in line with the continuing localisation of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. The allocation of $0.7 million for &#39;other countries&#39; reflects the provision of military training and advisory assistance to such countries as the Philippines and Thailand and the development of closer defence relations with Fiji and other countries in the South West Pacific region. </para>
		<para>Storage and Transport Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item comprises removal costs of servicemen and their families on re-posting, transfer of defence civil staff and their families, and storage costs associated with those activities. </para>
          <para>General Administrative Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This broad category of expenditure covers a range of items including travel, office requisites, postage and telephone services, fuel, light, power and water supply, freight and cartage, compensation payments and medical and dental services. The budgeted increase of $11 .0 million largely reflects increases in the costs of these services and some increased levels of activity. </para>
          <para>Natural Disasters, Civil Defence and Other</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included under this heading are outlays on the upkeep of the Natural Disasters Organisation, Commonwealth assistance to State/ Territorial Emergency Services through purchases of equipment and stores for those Services, and reimbursement of some salaries paid by the States to their civil defence personnel. Other outlays for civil defence, maintenance of war graves and various miscellaneous items are also included. </para>
          <para>Recoveries and Repayments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principal elements here are payments made &#39;by servicemen under the Defence Force Group Rental Scheme for rent of houses provided for their use, charges made for meals and accommodation provided at Defence establishments, contributions by other countries towards the cost of joint defence activities, revenue from disposal of surplus defence equipment and stores, and miscellaneous receipts. </para>
          <para>Loan Act</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1976-77 it was necessary to transfer an amount of $1504 million of defence expenditure from Consolidated Revenue Fund to Loan Fund to meet a prospective deficit in the former Fund. Expenditures transferred were financed from borrowings. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget estimates for 1977-78 show a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $901 million in the absence of further action to meet that deficit. The intention is that this potential deficiency should again be met by transferring sufficient defence expenditures from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Fund where they will be financed from borrowings for defence purposes. A Loan Bill to authorize these transactions will be introduced into Parliament during the Budget session. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays on education are estimated to increase by $210.9 million - or 9.8 per cent - in 1977-78 to $2371 million; this total is equivalent to 8.9 per cent of estimated total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1977-78 estimates for the programs of the education Commissions relate to the second half of the previously determined 1977 programs and the first half of the recently determined 1978 programs. For 1978 the base programs for universities, colleges of advanced education and schools are to be maintained at the same levels in real terms as in 1977; the base program for technical and further education is to be increased by 10 per cent in real terms. From 1978 these base programs will be supplemented for wage and salary increases in respect of recurrent grants only; up to, and including 1977, supplementation has been provided for all cost increases. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For planning purposes only the Government has announced guidelines for 1979 and 1980 which provide for increases of 2 per cent each year in real terms in the base programs for the tertiary area as a whole, and 1 per cent for schools. The Commissions are due to report by 31 August on the detailed allocation of funds for the 1978-80 rolling triennium within the guidelines announced by the Minister for Education on 3 June. </para>

          <para>Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As mentioned above, base expenditure programs for universities and colleges of advanced education in 1978 have been set at the same real levels as for 1977. Student intakes for both sectors are expected to be maintained at the present level. Some additional funds are to be provided in 1978 &#39;for non-government teachers colleges. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At estimated June 1977 price levels, grants to universities are estimated to total $675.6 million in 1977-78, an increase of $35.5 million over 1976-77. The bulk of  these funds will be expended on academic and administrative salaries within the universities, and on equipment, research and other operating costs. The proportion allocated for capital purposes is expected to decline further this year compared with earlier years when new universities were being established. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Grants to colleges of advanced education (including teachers colleges) are estimated to increase by $7.5 million to $469.3 million in 1977-78 (at estimated June 1977 prices). As with universities, the proportion of these funds allocated for capital purposes is expected to decline relative to recent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government is proceeding with the development of the Australian Maritime College at Launceston, which is expected to begin courses in 1979. Amounts of $1.6 million for capital purposes and $0.3 million for recurrent expenditures are to be provided for the College in 1977-78 from within the allocations for the advanced education sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government has sought an assessment by the new Tertiary Education Commission of an imbalance that appears to be developing between the supply and demand for teachers. The Commission is to provide advice on possible options that the Government might consider and to explore with State and other authorities the scope for reduction in trainee teacher intakes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government also has reviewed its program of recurrent assistance to non-government teachers colleges. In recognition of the contribution which these colleges make towards the preparation of teachers for non-government schools an amount of $1.4 million (at estimated June 1977 prices) is to be provided for these purposes in 1977-78 within the total funds available for the advanced education sector for 1978. </para>
          <para>Student Assistance</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme provides living and other allowances for undergraduate students. Subject to a means test all full-time non-bonded Australian undergraduate students admitted to approved courses at approved universities, colleges of advanced education and teachers colleges are eligible to receive these benefits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Following a review of all student assistance schemes in late 1976 benefits were increased substantially, and means tests relaxed, with effect from the beginning of 1977. It has been decided to further relax means tests and to increase allowances from the beginning of the 1978 academic year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The maximum (independent student) living allowance payable under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS), which was increased from $32 per week in 1976 to $43 per week in 1977 is to be further increased to $45.15 per week from the beginning of 1978. The means test to determine the level of allowance payable, which was relaxed from the beginning of 1977, is also to be relaxed further from the beginning of 1978. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking into account these proposed changes, the cost of TEAS for students attending universities and colleges of advanced education is estimated to increase from $112.0 million in 1976-77 to $137.4 million in 1977-78. About 85 000 students are expected to qualify for this assistance in 1978, an increase of 5000 on 1977 numbers. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Living allowances under the Post-graduate Awards Scheme, which provides assistance for post-graduate students on a competitive non-means-tested basis, were increased from $3250 per annum to $4000 per annum at the beginning of 1977. From the beginning of 1978 they will be further increased to $4200 per annum. This scheme is estimated to cost $9.7 million in 1977-78 compared with $8.6 million in 1976-77. About 2130 students are expected to benefit from the scheme in 1978, about 100 less than in 1977. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Basic eligibility varies according to the nature of service. Broadly, for those with &#39;active service&#39; incapacity or death resulting from &#39;any occurrence&#39; during service may be accepted. For those with &#39;home service&#39;, however, the criterion is narrower, in that incapacity or death must have arisen out of, or be attributable to, that service; incapacity or death arising from a condition existing prior to enlistment may be accepted if aggravated or contributed to by the conditions of service. </para>
          <para>Classes of Disability Pensions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pensions are paid to eligible veterans in three main categories: o The Special Rate (known as the T &#38; PI) Pension, payable to a veteran who, as a result of service, is blinded, or is totally and permanently incapacitated so that he is unable to earn more than a negligible percentage of a living wage; o The Intermediate Rate, payable to a veteran who, because of the severity of his incapacity accepted as related to service, can work only part-time or intermittently, and in consequence is unable to earn a living wage; and e The General Rate, payable to a veteran who has an incapacity accepted as related to service, but who is still able to work full-time although under difficulty. The amounts payable range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent of the maximum General Rate, according to the assessed degree of incapacity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pensions are also paid to the wives of incapacitated veterans and to their children. Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran&#39;s incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow&#39;s rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at &#39;orphan&#39; rates and other benefits. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">If a veteran&#39;s death has not been accepted as related to service, but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the Special Rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service. Other dependants of deceased veterans may qualify for pensions in certain cases. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">During 1976-77 the average number of veterans and their dependants in receipt of disability pensions was 489 000; in 1977-78 the number is estimated to be 471 000. The effect on expenditure of this estimated decline in numbers is more than offset by the full year effects of increased rates of benefits introduced in 1976-77 and the increases in benefit rates in line with movements in the CPI during 1977-78. </para>
          <para>Service Pensions</para>
        <para>Service pensions may be payable to: o a male veteran who served in a theatre of war and who has attained the age of 60 years or is permanently unemployable; o a female veteran who served in a theatre of war or embarked for service abroad and has attained the age of 55 years or is permanently unemployable; o ex-members of the Defence Forces of British Commonwealth countries who served in a theatre of war and have had at least ten yean residence in Australia; and o a veteran suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis irrespective of age or the area of service. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As with disability pensions, legislation will also be introduced to remove pulmonary tuberculosis as a basis for the grant of service pension. Those veterans currently receiving Service Pension for this reason will, however, continue to do so. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Service in a &#39;theatre of war&#39; means, in respect of the 1914-18 War or 1939-45 War, service &#39;at sea, in the field or in the air in naval, military or aerial operations against the enemy in an area, or on an aircraft or ship of war, at a time when danger from hostile forces of the enemy was incurred in that area or on that aircraft or ship of war . . .&#39; </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In respect of certain later service, &#39;service in an operational area&#39;, and &#39;special service&#39; as defined are the qualifications equivalent to service in a &#39;theatre of war&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A service pension is the broad equivalent of an age or invalid pension. The advantages to the veteran are availability of the service pension five years earlier and, in certain circumstances, eligibility for a wide range of repatriation medical treatment services. Service pensioners are eligible for the same range of pensions and allowances as age pensioners and the rates of benefits are the same. Like age pensions, service pensions will be increased in November 1977 and May 1978 in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Service pensions are paid, free of income test, to eligible veterans aged 70 years and over. For eligible veterans under 70 years of age, 50 per cent of any disability pension received is disregarded as income for service pension income test purposes. With this exception service pensions are subject to the same income test arrangements as social security pensions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">During 1976-77 the average number of service pensioners (including &#34;wives) was 151 200; this number is estimated to rise to 171 100 in 1977-78. Increased expenditure in 1977-78 reflects this increase in numbers, the full-year effect of pension increases granted in 1976-77, and the increased rates to apply in 1977-78. The proposed two increases in the rates of service pensions are estimated to cost SI 6.1 million in 1 977- 78 and $39.2 million in a full year. </para>

          <para>Invalid Pensions and Allowances</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Invalid pensions are payable to persons not less than 16 years of age who are permanently incapacitated for work to the extent of at least 85 per cent, or permanently blind. Pensions are subject to an income test except in the case of people who are permanently blind. If the incapacity or blindness occurred outside Australia, the residence qualification is the same as for an age pension. Invalid pensioners are eligible for the same additional payments as age pensioners and the rates of payment are the same. Similarly, wife&#39;s pension is payable, subject to income test, to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is not eligible for an age, invalid or service pension in her own right. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At 30 June 1977 there were 246 000 invalid pensioners (including wives of invalid pensioners in receipt of wife&#39;s pension) and during 1977-78 the number is estimated to increase by 13 000 to 259 000. However, this number includes approximately 19 000 pensioners of age pension age who will be transferred to age pensions during the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The average amount of invalid pension (including additions for children and supplementary assistance) is estimated to rise from $41.00 a week in 1976-77 to $46.30 a week in 1977-78, an increase of 12.9 per cent. The main reasons for this are the proposed increases in pension rates in line with the Consumer Price Index and the full-year effects of increased rates of pension introduced during 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated cost of the increases in rates of invalid pension in November 1977 and May 1978 is $20.9 million in 1977-78 and $56.1 million in a full year. </para>
          <para>Sheltered Employment Allowances</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Sheltered employment allowances are payable to disabled people engaged in approved sheltered employment who are qualified to receive an invalid pension or who would become so qualified if they ceased to be provided with sheltered employment. The allowance is subject to the same income test as applies to the invalid pension and the rates of payment are generally the same. An incentive allowance of $5 a week is paid (free of income test) to the recipients of sheltered employment allowance. Recipients of the sheltered employment allowance are not eligible for supplementary assistance. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">A</inline>handicapped child&#39;s allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a child under the age of 16 years who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention. The Government has decided to amend the Social Services Act to give the Director-General a discretion to approve the grant of a handicapped child&#39;s allowance, wholly or in part, where a person has the custody, care and control of a substantially handicapped child and, as a consequence of continuing substantive expenditure associated with the child&#39;s disability, the person suffers financial hardship. The number of recipients at 30 June 1977 was 22 000 and this number is expected to increase to 24 000 by 30 June 1978. Expenditure is estimated to rise from $10.9 million in 1976-77 to $18 million in 1977-78 as a result of the increased numbers expected to qualify for the allowance and the full-year effect of the increased rate of allowance announced in the 1 976-77 Budget. </para>
          <para>Handicapped Persons Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the <inline font-style="italic">Handicapped Persons Assistance Act</inline> 1974 the Commonwealth provides subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis to non-profit organisations and local governing bodies for the purchase, construction, extension, alteration, rental and maintenance of premises that cater for physically and mentally handicapped people. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Buildings qualifying for subsidy comprise day training centres for handicapped children, activity therapy centres and sheltered workshops for handicapped adults and  residential projects for people who attend these establishments. Residential projects for people who, because of a disability, need special accommodation to allow them to engage in normal outside employment also qualify for subsidy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Subsidies on a $4 for $1 basis are available also for the cost of furnishing and equipping the various types of centres, while assistance with operating costs may be provided by means of staff salary subsidies.

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has introduced a three-year program of assistance under the Act. $30 million was spent in 1976-77 and $39 million will be provided in 1977-78, rising to $52 million in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth pays a handicapped children&#39;s benefit of $5.00 a day, for each child under 16 years of age, to charitable and religious organisations conducting approved homes providing accommodation and care for mentally and physically handicapped children. The benefit continues to be paid to an eligible organisation when a child is absent from the institution for a short period only such as a week-end home visit. Expenditure is estimated to increase from $1.6 million in 1976-77 to $2.3 million in 1977-78 due to an expected increase in the number of organisations becoming eligible for subsidy and the full year effect of increased rates introduced in the 1976-77 Budget. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth has decided to make the service available, free of charge, to certain mentally and physically handicapped persons within the broad working age group who are not presently eligible without charge under the existing legislation because there is little prospect of their engaging in gainful employment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure is estimated to rise from $13.1 million in 1976-77 to $16.9 million in 1977-78 as a result of an expected increase in the numbers to be accepted for treatment and training and the full year effect of price and salary increases during 1976-77. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Homeless Persons Assistance Act</inline> 1974 provides, over a three-year period, for the payment of capital grants to voluntary agencies and to local authorities for approved projects (such as night shelters, reception centres and hostels) in order to upgrade and replace inadequate existing accommodation and to build new facilities for homeless persons. It also provides payment of a salary subsidy of 50 per cent of the salary of approved staff, an accommodation subsidy of 75 cents a person a day and a meal subsidy of 25 cents a meal in respect of non-resident homeless persons.

The total is $53 million less than expenditure last year but this is more than fully accounted for by an estimated $65.2 million reduction in estimated outlays classified to Housing in the Territories, which in turn largely reflects the run-down in expenditure on housing by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and the reclassification of other expenditure on housing in the Northern Territory to General Public Services as part of the $50 million allocation to be made to the N.T.

These advances, which are repayable at low rates of interest over a 53-year period, are mainly to assist the State housing authorities to provide dwellings for rental or sale on a concessional basis to low income families.

        <para pgwide="yes">During 1976-77, the Corporation was empowered to continue its operations under the financial arrangements that had applied to the Australian Housing Corporation. From 1 July 1977 its capital programs will be financed through the Defence Service Homes Trust Account while its operating expenses are being provided for within the votes of the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs. Capital advances of $22.0 million are being provided in 1977-78 for the Trust Account. An estimated $72.6 million, representing mainly repayments of principal by borrowers, will be retained in the Trust Account for relending, making a total of $94.6 million available for Defence Service Homes programs in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An application fee of $75 for an initial application for a loan to acquire a home and $50 for an additional loan will be introduced during 1977-78.

        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $15.2 million is being provided in 1977-78 for administrative expenses, including salaries and rent for the Corporation. This compares with $7.9 million provided as an administrative subsidy in 1976-77 under the previous financial arrangements. In that year, however, the Corporation also had available to it a surplus of $4.1 million carried forward from 1975-76 by the Australian Housing Corporation and other income including investment income of $4.5 million, making a total of $16.5 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The figures include an estimated interest subsidy element in 1977-78 of $24.9 million. In 1976-77 an interest subsidy of $23.1 million was paid to the Corporation. The interest subsidy reflects the extent to which interest charged to borrowers under the Defence Service Homes Scheme falls short of the interest rate payable to the Commonwealth on the Corporation&#39;s capital. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Repayments to Consolidated Revenue by the Corporation in 1977-78 are estimated at SI 5.7 million, including an amount of S3. 2 million in recoveries.

Of the latter amount, $17.2 million is for dwelling construction by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. The decrease in funds for the Australian Capital Territory reflects in part a slow-down in the rate of growth in the population of the National Capital while the reduction in the Northern Territory reflects the run-down in the program of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other Gross Advances for Housing include allocations from the Budget, re-cycled funds and estimated proceeds from private borrowings. These are estimated to decrease from $52.9 million in 1976-77 to $34.8 million in 1977-78 but this change is affected by a classification change. Whereas an amount of $21.2 million was advanced to the N.T. Housing Commission from the Budget last year there is no comparable figure in the estimates for 1977-78. Executive responsibility for the Commission was transferred to the N.T. Legislative Assembly on 1 January 1977, and for 1977-78 the amount to be advanced to the Commission will be determined by the Assembly from within the global allocation provided to that body (see Table 9E). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $14.6 million will be available to the A.C.T. Commissioner for Housing for first mortgage lending in 1977-78 ($12.9 million in 1976-77). Of this amount, $6.5 million will be provided in the Budget (the same as in 1976-77) and a borrowing of $4.5 million is proposed to be made by the Commissioner from private sources. The balance of $3.6 million consists of funds recirculated through a Trust Account. This increased sum will help to meet increases in the size of individual loans following the raising of the loan limit from $15 000 to $20 000, effective from 1 July 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $20.3 million is estimated to be available for first mortgage lending by the N.T. Home Finance Trustee. Of this amount, $15.0 million will be provided from the Budget for the concessional loans to eligible Darwin residents to rebuild dwellings destroyed by Cyclone Tracy. Borrowing proceeds to the extent of $5.3 million are to be utilised for the N.T. Home Finance Trustee&#39;s non-concessional home financing activities. </para>
          <para>Housing for Aboriginals</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An allocation of $35.3 million has been provided for special assistance for Aboriginal housing in 1977-78. This allocation, which is $5.6 million below 1976-77 expenditure, reflects a thorough reassessment of the program, leading to increased cost-effectiveness. Estimated outlays include $10.4 million in grants to States and $24.8 million in grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations for the construction and purchase of homes for Aboriginal families. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1977-78 provision for the Aboriginal Housing and Personal Loans Fund of the Aboriginal Loans Commission is $5 million, compared with $10 million in 1976-77. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from rentals in the Northern Territory are estimated to increase from $3.1 million in 1976-77 to $6.0 million in 1977-78. The increase reflects additional rents being charged for dwellings restored to pre-cyclone condition and a proposed increase in the overall level of rentals to apply from September 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Revenue from housing rentals in the A.C.T. is estimated to increase from $15.6 million in 1976-77 to $21.0 million; this reflects the full year effect of the rent increase in 1976-77 and a proposed further increase in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in 1976-77 included $4.5 million from its General Reserve and $0.2 million repayment of the initial advance made to the Corporation on its establishment in 1965. </para>

A further$17.5 million is included for capitalised interest on advances in 1977-78 and earlier years for growth centres. The $15.1 million includes $0.8 million - recorded as part of the general administrative expenditure item - for the Commonwealth&#39;s one-third contribution to the estimated administrative expenses of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and for the costs associated with the proposed scaling down of the staff of the Corporation. Included in the balance of $14.3 million is $5.1 million for assistance to the States for Albury-Wodonga and $3 million for Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur.

Expenditure on rehabilitation in 1976-77 amounted to $1.2 million and an amount of $0.8 million has been provided in the Budget for further rehabilitation in 1977-78; $0.7 million is provided for costs associated with the administration and maintenance of the Estate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $1.2 million is provided to meet the estimated cost in 1977-78 of further acquisition, planning and site development of land in the Woolloomooloo basin of Sydney. This continues the provision of financial assistance to New South Wales, which amounted to $5.8 million in 1975-76 and $3.0 million in 1976-77, under an agreement concluded with the State in 1974-75. The site is to be developed mainly for residential purposes. In addition to the provision of this financial assistance, the Commonwealth agreed to transfer to New South Wales, at no charge, land which was valued in excess of $11 million. Such transactions, by their nature, are not shown in the Commonwealth&#39;s expenditure estimates. </para>
          <para>Urban Flood Mitigation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to provide 40 per cent of the cost of flood mitigation works on Breakfast Creek and Enoggera Creek in Brisbane.

          <para>Area Improvement Program</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Area Improvement Program was established in 1973-74 with a view to helping to remedy deficiencies of public facilities in certain locations. Expenditure amounted to only $0.6 million in 1976-77 to discharge commitments and no funds will be made available in 1977-78; the purposes of the Program are now effectively provided for in new tax sharing arrangements with local government which provide substantially increased levels of untied general purpose assistance to local government. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $14.1 million is provided in the Budget for 1977-78 to meet remaining commitments to the States for land commissions/ urban land councils. A further $12.7 million is entailed in the form of capitalisation of interest payments on loans provided to the States in 1 977-78 and previous years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The assistance provided for land commissions/urban land councils is for land acquisition and servicing of the land acquired (where these costs are not met from normal government subventions) and urban renewal and redevelopment. The main aims of the program have been to make land available for residential and associated uses at fair prices, and to facilitate the efficient planning and development of new urban areas. Following the review of the Commonwealth&#39;s involvement in urban land development programs in 1976-77, the Commonwealth has, with the co-operation of the States, established an independent national inquiry into housing costs to prepare a report on the means available to improve the efficiency and to lower the cost of the supply of housing, and the provision of infrastructure services within existing national resources. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">This heading covers a number of items associated mainly with the development of urban land and community facilities in the Commonwealth Territories. The major item included in the total of $41.0 million is $33.9 million for land and community development in the Australian Capital Territory. The reduction of $6.3 million from the level of expenditure in 1976-77 largely reflects the decreased level of land development in Canberra because of the slow-down in the city&#39;s rate of growth. </para>

          <para>Sewerage and Garbage</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides a net $20.2 million for this purpose in 1977-78 compared with expenditure of $83.1 million in 1976-77. The decrease reflects mainly the Commonwealth&#39;s decision to discontinue assistance to the States for sewerage works. An amount of $0.3 million will, however, be made available to the States to allow the completion of a number of studies relevant to the rationalisation of the provision of sewerage services. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the Territories $5.4 million is provided in 1977-78 for the reconstruction and augmentation of the Darwin water and sewerage service, and a further $14.8 million for sewerage and waste disposal in the Australian Capital Territory.

        <para pgwide="yes">This item includes the administrative expenditure of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development (SI 2.9 million), the Darwin Reconstruction Commission (S0.9 million) and the National Capital Development Commission ($8.2 million). It also includes SI 1.8 million for private consultant fees for investigation, design and supervision for the National Capital Development Commission. As indicated earlier the estimate for 1977-78 also includes S0.3 million in respect of the Commonwealth&#39;s one-third contribution to the estimated administrative expenses of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and S0.5 million for the Corporation to meet costs associated with the proposed reduction in the number of Corporation staff. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The levelling off in this expenditure reflects reductions in staff numbers and administrative expenditures generally, consistent with the Commonwealth&#39;s policy of reducing its involvement in the area of urban and regional development. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Department of Transport provides many services to the air transport industry, including the provision and operation of over 80 airports and a network of air navigational facilities. Those activities account for the major portion of administrative and operational expenditure and outlays on buildings, works and equipment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on air transport activities in 1977-78 (estimated at $161.5 million) reflects the Government&#39;s current policy of expenditure restraint, and proposed reduction in staff numbers during the year.

The stabilisation arrangements provide for grower contributions to the Stabilisation Fund when export returns are relatively high and payments to growers from the Fund when export returns are relatively low. If grower contributions held in the Fund are insufficient to make required stabilisation payments, the Commonwealth, under certain conditions, contributes to the Fund to make up the shortfall. </para>

A further grower contribution of $30 million in respect of the 1976-77 crop season is expected to be paid into the Fund in 1977-78 and this amount, together with interest earned during the year, will be refunded to growers. No stabilisation contributions by the Commonwealth are required in 1977-78. </para>

Under these arrangements an equalisation levy (equal to the difference between the domestic price and the assessed average export price) is imposed on the production of certain prescribed dairy products, and the proceeds are redistributed among manufacturers with the object of protecting the domestic price structure and ensuring that manufacturers receive an equalised return from total domestic and export sales. Levy collections and payments to manufacturers are estimated at $50.0 million in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pending introduction of the new marketing arrangements, the Government undertook to provide a measure of income stability by underwriting the equalisation value of skim milk powder in 1975-76, and butter, cheese, skim milk powder and casein in 1976-77 and 1977-78. The levels of support for skim milk powder and casein are conditional on State participation on a $1 State: $2 Commonwealth basis. Under &#39;Price Support&#39; there is a provision of $6.5 million in 1977-78 for estimated Commonwealth liability for underwriting of cheese, skim milk powder and casein values up to 30 June 1 977, and of butter values up to 3 1 December 1 976. &#39;Repayments&#39; include, in addition to the new levy, repayments from the States in respect of the Dairy Adjustment Program and its predecessor, the Marginal Dairy Farms Reconstruction Scheme. </para>

In addition, the Commonwealth has agreed to provide up to S0.5 million in supplementary assistance for apple exports on a dollar for dollar basis with participating States, with the precise nature and application of the assistance being determined in light of information available from the 1977-78 export season operations. Supplementary assistance arrangements for apple exports have been in operation since the 1974-75 crop season. </para>

Under this scheme, which replaced the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, the Dairy Adjustment Program and the joint Commonwealth/State scheme of carry-on finance for specialist beef producers, financial assistance is made available to the States for purposes of farm debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation, carry-on finance and household support. Assistance for debt reconstruction, farm build-up, farm improvement and rehabilitation is made available by the Commonwealth on an overall 85 per cent loan/ 15 per cent grant basis with the Commonwealth contributing a further amount to assist in defraying administrative expenses. For the household support component the Commonwealth finances all assistance and contributes towards administrative expenses, with the States repaying to the Commonwealth all principal and interest recouped by them. For carry-on finance, the States share equally with the Commonwealth both the financing of loans (and administrative costs) and all principal and interest payments received from producers.

The difference between the commercial rates at which EFIC borrows and the rates at which it onlends is financed from the Budget by an interest rate subsidy payable to EFIC each year. A subsidy of almost $0.3 million was provided in 1976-77 and a provision of $1.5 million has been made for 1977-78 for this purpose. In 1976-77 a payment of some $0.3 million was also made in respect of a &#39;national interest&#39; case. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1976-77 &#39;subsidy commitment authority&#39;, the mechanism to control commitments on the Budget in the years ahead arising from the Corporation entering into loan transactions with overseas buyers at subsidised interest rates, was set at $15 million. At 30 June, the Corporation had entered into loans in support of capital goods exports aggregating $77 million, requiring use of the subsidy commitment authority of about $9.18 million, payable over the term of the loans. In addition, the Corporation had advance commitments to enter into loans of $11 million, involving use of a further $1.75 million of subsidy commitment authority in 1977-78. The Government has decided to increase the cumulative subsidy commitment authority to $17.5 million. The increase of $2.5 million over 1976-77, together with the balance of the authority not committed at 30 June 1977, will enable EFIC to enter into loans aggregating about $50 million in the next 12 months, and to support tenders for capital goods exports considerably in excess of this amount, given that only a portion of tenders are likely to be successful. </para>
        <para class="block">Industry Assistance Through the Taxation System </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A considerable amount of assistance to industry has been provided in the past through special taxation concessions. Some of these concessions were withdrawn during 1972-73 while others were withdrawn or modified in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. On the other hand, a new concession was introduced in 1974-75  -  double depreciation - applicable to new plant and equipment first used or installed ready for use by taxpayers in the manufacturing and primary industry sectors on or after 1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975. The double depreciation scheme was extended in both time and coverage in 1975 but when the income tax law was amended to provide a new investment allowance, provision was also made for the discontinuance of the double depreciation scheme for plant used or installed after 30 June 1976. The new investment allowance is applicable to new plant and equipment purchased, leased or constructed under a contract made on or after 1 January 1976. A 40 per cent rate will apply for the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978, and a 20 per cent rate for the period 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1983. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other provisions were enacted in 1976-77, which will affect revenue collections in 1977-78, relating to accelerated deductions for certain capital expenditure by mining enterprises, and to a deduction for a trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Such concessions result in a reduction of, or a delay in the receipt of, Commonwealth revenue (and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients). They are, in fact, as much a call on the Budget as equivalent direct outlays would be, and for this reason have sometimes been described as disguised expenditures. Assistance of this type through the taxation system has been provided mainly by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their assessable income additional to those authorised under the general provisions of the income tax law. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The amount of revenue forgone in 1976-77 through the main taxation concessions is estimated to have been about $246 million. Details are shown below. (Pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme in respect of exports in 1970-71 and prior years are included under the heading &#39;Manufacturing Industry&#39;.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely : </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A those allowing the deduction of larger amounts than are authorised under the general provisions of the law (included in this category is the rebate for export market development expenditure, which, until it was withdrawn, in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1974, gave a tax saving additional to the saving resulting from the deductions from income for this expenditure); </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">B those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">C those exempting certain classes of income, now confined to exemption of income from gold mining. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1976-77 under the main provisions in categories A and B are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly Industry Assistance&#39;. These provisions include the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; drought bonds and income equalisation deposits; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees&#39; amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. Taxpayers to whom these provisions apply are assessed on their taxable incomes for the current year at rates of tax corresponding to the average of their incomes for the current year and the preceding four years. One effect of the provisions, which is an intended effect, is to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">fluctuations</inline> in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but nonfluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward trend in incomes over a number of years and, even if there are fluctuations in income superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions can result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over a period of years are comparable. Under the new personal income tax system to apply from 1 February 1978, with no more than the standard tax rate of 32 per cent applying to taxable incomes up to $16 000 (the ceiling for the application of averaging), the unintended effects of averaging will not arise. The new arrangements are described in Statement No. 4. </para>

            <para>Taxpayers were allowed to claim deductions for depreciation in respect of certain plant that was used in manufacturing or primary production at twice the rates of depreciation normally provided. Eligible plant was that installed on or after1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975 of a kind that would have qualified for the 20 per cent investment allowance under Sections 62aa and 62ab if the investment allowance had not been terminated. Plant and equipment that continued to attract investment allowance by reason of its purchase under a contract signed before 22 August 1973 was not eligible for double depreciation. Double depreciation applied to a wider range of items of plant and equipment purchased and installed in the period 1 July 1975 to 30 June 1976.

While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of the plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law, they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Budget and a benefit, namely the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plant and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">An extensive review of apprenticeship training during 1976-77, which involved the States, the National Training Council and major employer and employee organisations, resulted in the introduction of a new scheme - the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training (CRAFT) - to replace the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme (NAAS). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">CRAFT became operative on 15 January 1977. It provides encouragement to employers to increase their apprentice intake by compensating them with tax-exempt rebates for the costs of releasing apprentices to attend (or to study for) basic trade courses provided by technical education institutions in any year of apprenticeship, or to attend full-time, off-the-job training courses in their first three years of apprenticeship. Rebates are set at $11 per day for apprentices attending stages 1 and 2 of a basic trade course, increasing to $15 per day for stages 3 and 4, if not completed in the first year. Full time off-the-job training rebates of S5.50 per day are payable to employers for a maximum of 260 working days. Both rebates are indexed annually to take account of movements in wages. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Weekly living-away-from-home allowances, of SI 7.60 for first year apprentices, and $6.80 for persons in the second year of their apprenticeship, may also be provided. These allowances are not tax exempt. </para>

Under this Scheme, apprentices sponsored by private employers are given full-time training in Commonwealth Government Departments for the whole of the first year. The costs (including wages) of this training are met in full by the Commonwealth. At the end of the first year the apprentices commence work with their employers.

Subsidies are available to employers who provide in-industry training or who release trainees for training during working hours. The 1977-78 provision for NEAT is $54.3 million compared with $31.6 million in 1976-77. This increase reflects an expected substantial increase in the numbers of trainees and the full-year cost of the new initiatives under NEAT which were introduced during 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">One such initiative, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, which is estimated to cost $18 million in 1977-78, is aimed at providing employment and training for young people who have been unemployed for long periods by making available allowances to employers who provide them with on-the-job training for six months. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">This section covers most of the expenditures undertaken by the Commonwealth Government in relation to policies designed to promote relations with foreign countries and external territories and to assist in the economic and social development of developing countries. Total outlays on foreign affairs and overseas aid are estimated to increase by $54.7 million to $571.3 million in 1977-78. About three quarters of this expenditure relates to various overseas economic aid programs to assist developing countries, including Papua New Guinea. A detailed statement of Australia&#39;s aid programs is given in the accompanying Budget Paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia&#39;s Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries</inline> 1977-78. </para>

        </para>
          <para>Aid Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $425.8 million is provided for expenditure on overseas aid in 1977-78, an increase of $45.7 million or 12.0 per cent over 1976-77. This increase is spread between bilateral aid programs ($17.4 million) and multilateral aid programs ($28.3 million). Taking into account &#39;Assistance Additional to Aid Payments&#39; (see below) total assistance to developing countries in 1977-78 is estimated to amount to about $460 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This figure does not, however, include significant amounts spent by the Commonwealth and State Governments on the education and training of several thousand students from developing countries who are attending various tertiary and other training institutions in Australia. The annual cost to the Australian taxpayer of providing assistance of this kind, not brought to account directly under the overseas aid program, is estimated at about $26 million. Australia also provides other indirect forms of economic aid through its contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations (e.g. United Nations Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation) that assist in the financing of aid projects in developing countries, and through the activities of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). The Government, in the national interest, has assumed large contingent liabilities in relation to developing countries through its support of EFIC activities in export and investment insurance. Since February 1975 EFIC has also operated a facility to finance exports of capital goods, with concessional terms provided, if necessary, especially to developing countries. </para>
          <para>Bilateral Aid</para>
          <para>Papua New Guinea</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $223.4 million is provided for expenditure on aid to or on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government in 1977-78, $4.9 million less than in 1976-77. Under the terms of an aid agreement announced in March 1976 Australia is to provide to Papua New Guinea, in annual instalments, a minimum grant of $930 million as general budgetary assistance over the five years commencing 1976-77. In 1977-78 the amount to be paid in accordance with the terms of this commitment is $200 million, an increase of $10 million over 1976-77. Expenditure on the provision of assistance under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Training Scheme is estimated to increase by $0.5 million to $1.6 million in 1977-78. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The decline in total expenditure on aid to Papua New Guinea in 1977-78 is due to a run-down in payments in respect of termination and retirement benefits payable to expatriate officers of former PNG Administrations and the Australian Staffing Assistance Group ($19.5 million) and to a tapering off in expenditure on upgrading civil aviation facilities at Port Moresby and Nadzab which are nearing completion ($1.6 million). </para>
          <para>Bilateral Projects</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Development Assistance Fund, under which expenditures on bilateral projects have been funded in recent years, was abolished at the end of 1976-77 following the establishment of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Expenditure on bilateral projects will now be funded by normal appropriation procedures, as was the practice prior to establishment of the Development Assistance Fund. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditures on bilateral projects are estimated to increase substantially to $71.0 million in 1977-78, an increase of $18.9 million on 1976-77. This reflects a substantial increase in Australian aid commitments to South Pacific countries, an expanded aid commitment to Indonesia and increased aid for other member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The expenditures embrace a diversity of activities including projects, equipment and expert advice directed towards increasing agricultural productivity, providing general infrastructure and improvements in transport and communication facilities. These commitments reflect the Government&#39;s policy of concentrating its aid program in developing countries in Australia&#39;s immediate region. </para>
          <para>Training</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on training programs (excluding training provided under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Training Scheme) is estimated at SI 6.6 million in 1977-78, an increase of $2.7 million on 1976-77. The increase mainly reflects increased costs, rather than expanded levels of activity. Under the various programs (for example, the Colombo Plan and the Commonwealth Co-operation in Education Scheme) funds are provided for academic training, of nationals of developing countries, for short courses to meet special needs (especially in specialised technical areas), for on-the-job training opportunities, and for third country and in-country training awards. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition, funds are provided for the Australian-Asian Universities Co-operation Scheme, whereby selected universities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore receive assistance from Australian universities in the form of equipment, provision of experts and fellowships for Asian academics to train in Australia. </para>
          <para>Food Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on food aid is estimated to increase by SI. 9 million to S26.6 million in 1977-78. This expenditure allows for a substantial increase, in real terms, in Australia&#39;s food aid commitments. Given the substantial fall in the price of wheat, the major commodity supplied under the program, the real increase is not reflected in money outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Major new</inline>commitments in 1977to78 entail an increase in the total quantity of wheat (or wheat equivalent) Australia supplies under the provisions of the Food Aid Convention of the International Wheat Agreement, provision of funds to cover freight costs on food aid provided in connection with a newly created bilateral reserve for emergencies occurring in needy countries, and provision of non-grain foods (e.g. skim milk powder) to developing countries. Australian food aid to the World Food Program is included under the heading &#39;United Nations Programs&#39;. </para>
          <para>Other Bilateral</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Support for voluntary aid organisations is estimated to increase from S0.6S million in 1976-77 to $1,625 million in 1977-78, reflecting the Government&#39;s increased support for the activities of voluntary aid organisations. Expenditure under this heading includes grants for the Overseas Service Bureau and the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, and direct financial support for small-scale development assistance projects carried out by voluntary aid organisations in developing countries. An amount of $0.7 million is included for expenditure on disaster relief. </para>
          <para>Multilateral Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under multilateral aid programs the Commonwealth provides support to a wide range of international organisations, including development finance institutions, United Nations agencies and various regional organisations.

          <para>United Nations Programs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments by Australia to aid agencies and organisations established under the aegis of the United Nations are expected to increase to $16.5 million in 1977-78. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">There is an increase of $3.5 million in 1977-78 in the provision for estimated expenditure under the World Food Program. The increase is due partly to Australia&#39;s commitment to progressively increase to 20 per cent the proportion of food grain aid channelled through this Program, in addition to its biennial pledge of cash and commodities (other than wheat). Australia&#39;s contributions to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees include an amount of $1 million for the appeal on behalf of displaced persons from Indochina in Thailand and other Asian countries. </para>
          <para>Regional and Other International Programs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total assistance to regional and other international programs is expected to increase by $4.9 million to $12.1 million in 1977-78, in line with the Government&#39;s policy of supporting major regional and international aid organisations. <inline font-weight="bold">Major regional</inline> organisations to receive increased support include the Association of South East Asian Nations, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the South Pacific Commission and the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. In addition, increased assistance is planned for the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research and Regional Education and Training Projects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision is also made for an amount of $1 million in 1977-78 for South Pacific Regional Programs to enable aid to be provided through multilateral channels to regional or individual country projects in that region. </para>
          <para>International Development Finance Institutions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total payments by Australia to the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development are expected to increase from $40.4 million in 1976-77 to $57.0 million in 1977-78. These expected payments include calls on Australia in accordance with previously announced commitments to those institutions. There is also provision for payments in respect of Australia&#39;s subscription to the second capital increase of the Asian Development Bank ($3.1 million) and maintenance of value obligations in respect of Australia&#39;s contributions to the International Development Association and capital subscriptions to the Asian Development Bank ($9.0 million). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $2.2 million is provided in respect of estimated payments in 1977-78 to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Legislation to authorize Australia&#39;s membership of this Fund and payment of a contribution of $8 million over a period of not less than three years was introduced in Parliament in May 1977. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is also provision for expected payments of$2.5 million to the International Monetary Fund&#39;s Oil Facility Interest Subsidy Account (which has been established to reduce the cost to certain developing countries of borrowings from the Fund&#39;s Oil Facility). </para>
          <para>Assistance Additional to Aid Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although Australia&#39;s Defence Co-operation program ($25.9 million in 1977-78) represents an extension of our own defence effort, it also supplements the Government&#39;s overseas economic aid programs to the extent that it releases for development purposes resources that recipient Governments would otherwise have set aside for defence purposes. Australia&#39;s assistance in this respect is referred to in the section on Defence Co-operation under Defence. In addition, the administrative expenses of the Australian Development Assistance &#39;Bureau, estimated at$8.3 million for 1977-78, are associated with Australia&#39;s aid effort. </para>
          <para>Cocos (Keeling), Christmas and Norfolk Islands</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included under this heading are the costs involved in administering these three small external territories. The increased amount provided for in 1977-78 reflects in part increasing expenditure on capital works committed in earlier years for both the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Membership of International Organisations and Other Non-aid Expenditure </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this item arises from Australia&#39;s membership of many global and regional organisations. Active participation in such organisations is an integral part of Australia&#39;s foreign policy and entails financial contributions to the administrative expenses and, in some cases, the functional activities of the organisations in question. Total expenditure under this item in 1977-78 is estimated to reach S20.2 million, an increase of $2.1 million over 1976-77. The major items include $4.7 million for the United Nations Organisation, $1.4 million for the Food and Agriculture Organisation, $1.5 million for the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, $1.1 million for the International Labour Organisation, $2.1 million for the World Health Organisation, $1.3 million towards the cost of the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East and $1.2 million for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Financial assistance grants, which made up most of these funds up to and including 1975-76, were determined under a formula which took into account the percentage increases in State&#39;s populations and in average wages in the economy as a whole, and a further betterment&#39; factor. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Financial assistance grants were replaced by personal income tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and State Governments in 1976-77.

Overpayments in a year are deducted from payments in the following year. Under &#39;Stage 2&#39;, for which enabling legislation has been introduced into Parliament, each State will also be able, if it so chooses, to legislate to increase its revenue from personal income tax or to give, at cost to the State, a rebate on personal income tax to residents in the State. The &#39;Stage 1&#39; arrangements include a guarantee that the States&#39; entitlements in any year will not be less than in the previous year and, in the four years 1976-77 to 1979-80, will not be less in a year than the amount which would have been yielded in that year by the financial assistance grants formula referred to above. </para>

          <para>Changes to Personal Income Tax System</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A new personal income tax system will apply as from 1 February 1978.

        <para>The elements of the new system are as follows: </para>
          <para>Rate Scale</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The new simplified scale will have a zero rate on that part of taxable income up to $3750. A standard rate of 32 cents will apply to all parts of taxable income above $3750. Two levels of surcharge will, however, set the effective marginal rates at 46 cents on taxable income from $16 001 to $32 000, and at 60 cents on taxable income above $32 000. </para>

          <para>Rebate Declarations</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the present system, if an employee does not lodge a declaration claiming the $676 general rebate, tax is deducted at the minimum rate of 35 cents in the dollar. An employee may have only one declaration in force at any one time and a person with two or more jobs would usually lodge a declaration with his or her main employer. It is proposed that equivalent declaration arrangements be continued under the new system. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">People who have &#39;second&#39; jobs will, usually, have income from their main job in excess of $3750 a year. Any additional income from &#39;second job&#39; earnings will thus generally attract PAYE deductions at or above the 32 per cent rate. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The following basic rules for the taxation of trustees are proposed: o for accumulating trust income to which no beneficiary is presently entitled and that is assessed under <inline font-style="italic">section 99</inline> to the trustee of a trust other than a deceased estate that is in course of administration (maximum 2 years), there will be no J tax if the income is $416 or less, there will be no zero-rating and, subject to shading-in provisions for income marginally in excess of $416, the standard rate and surcharges will apply.  o  for trust income of a trust other than a deceased estate, to which a child under 16 years of age at the end of the year of income is presently entitled and that is assessed under <inline font-style="italic">section 98,</inline> the same tax rules as above are to apply, but with a figure of S1040 instead of $416.  o  for other trust income to which a &#39;beneficiary who is under a legal disability is presently entitled that is assessed under <inline font-style="italic">section 98,</inline> and for income assessed under <inline font-style="italic">section 99</inline> of a deceased estate that is in course of administration (maximum 2 years), the first $3750 of taxable income will be zero-rated with the standard rate and surcharges applying to the balance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Where a beneficiary is taxed on trust income that has also been taxed to the trustee under <inline font-style="italic">section 98,</inline> the tax paid by the trustee is credited against any tax charged to the beneficiary, but no refund is made. </para>
          <para>Averaging for Primary Producers</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the present system, the tax payable by a primary producer is in part calculated by applying to the first $16 000 of taxable income a rate fixed by reference to &#39;average income&#39; of the current and four previous years. The general rebate of $676 and other concessional rebates are allowed. Under the new system, with the role of the general rebate now to be performed by the zero rate on the scale, the tax under the averaging provisions applicable to taxable income between $3751 and $16000 will be calculated at the standard rate of 32 per cent, and the first $3750 of taxable income will attract the zero rate.. Concessional rebates will again reduce the tax payable. </para>
          <para>Health Insurance Levy</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The present basis for determining the minimum taxable income subject to levy for health insurance levy purposes, by deducting unused entitlements to the general rebate against liability to levy, will no longer be applicable after absorption of the rebate into the rate scale. However, the present relationship between the income tax threshold and the health insurance levy threshold will be continued. The shading-in rate will be 34.5 per cent (equal to the levy rate of 2.5 per cent plus the standard rate of income tax of 32 per cent) with a levy threshold of S3479. Any unused concessional rebate (e.g. the rebate for a spouse) will, as at present, be allowable against the levy. For a taxpayer with a fully dependent spouse the minimum taxable income subject to levy will be $5087. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">o The flat standard marginal rate of 32 cents will apply, without surcharges, over the wide band of income from $3751 to$16 000. Nearly 90 per cent of taxpayers have taxable incomes falling within that band. The standard rate is well below the present marginal rate at the upper end of that band (45 cents) and almost 80 per cent of taxpayers having taxable incomes within that band will have their marginal rate of tax reduced. o The maximum marginal rate, on incomes above $32 000, is reduced from 65 to 60 cents, and the point at which the 60 cent rate commences to apply is increased from S25 064 to $32 001. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The new system will be indexed as from 1 July 1978. The indexation factor to be applied to the rate scale in 1978-79 will be half that given by the annual indexation rules but the full adjustment will be applied to dependant rebates. The cost  to revenue in 1978-79 of the new system on this basis is estimated to be $973 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes"> Provisional tax for 1977-78 levied on assessment on the basis of 1976-77 income will be calculated at 1976-77 tax rates. Where a taxpayer &#39;self-assesses&#39; his or her 1977-78 provisional tax on the basis of estimated 1977-78 taxable income, 1977-78 rates of tax will be applied in the calculation of that provisional tax. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Rebates will be allowed in 1977-78 for concessional expenditure in excess of $1590 at a rate of 32 per cent, i.e., a rate matching the new standard tax rate of 32 per cent.

In 1976-77 the value of dutiable imports grew by 28.5 per cent, in part in consequence of the effect on import values of the devaluation of the Australian dollar in November 1976.

Excluding the estimated effects on revenues of the changes in duties, collections are estimated to increase by 5 per cent.

      <para pgwide="yes">The overall deficit of $2740 million for 1976-77 was$132 million higher than had been estimated at Budget time. Total outlays were$1 97 million below the original Budget estimate but there was a shortfall of $329 million in total receipts. The outcome is summarised in the following table: </para>

      <para class="block">The main features of the aggregate figures are:    for the second year in succession total outlays were held below the original </para>
      <para class="block">Budget estimate;    this reflected the Government&#39;s continuing policy of expenditure restraint and operation of monitoring and approval procedures directed towards achieving savings in expenditures wherever possible;    the shortfall in receipts mainly reflected shortfalls in net PAYE and company taxation collections.    in turn, the shortfall in net PAYE collections principally reflected a substantially greater level of refunds than had been estimated; and    the actual deficit was closer to the Budget estimate than in any year since 1972-73. when the Budget aggregates were much smaller than they are now. </para>
        <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although outlays in total were held within the Budget estimate, there were substantial variations from the estimates for some individual components. The outcome for each major function is compared with the Budget estimate in the following table: </para>

          <para>Bulk allowances which could not be allocated at the time the estimates were prepared but which were allocated during the course <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the year. The non-apportionment of these provisions at Budget time is therefore partly responsible for particular differences between estimates and outcomes. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para pgwide="yes">Comments on the main variations from the Budget estimates follow. </para>
          <para>Defence</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Defence outlays in 1976-77 were $4 million more than the Budget estimate. Manpower costs were $20 million more, reflecting the impact of salary and wage determinations during the year. Expenditure on reserve capacity maintenance was higher due to increases in operating costs of defence munitions factories, including wage and salary costs. These increases, together with an increase in the working capital advance to the Government Aircraft Factory for the Nomad venture, were the main factors responsible for outlays associated with industrial capacity exceeding the Budget estimate by$5 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Against these increases there were shortfalls in expenditure on equipment and stores ($13 million), due principally to rephasing of payment schedules on major items, and on defence facilities ($10 million). </para>
          <para>Education</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on education exceeded the Budget estimate by $31 million. Student assistance payments were about $27 million greater than estimated and reflected the substantial increases in benefit rates, and the liberalisation of means tests, announced by the Government after the Budget was brought down and effective from the beginning of 1977. </para>
          <para>Health</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Actual outlays on health in 1976-77 were $366 million below the Budget estimate. The bulk of the shortfall was attributable to Medibank expenditures. Medibank medical benefits were $170 million less than estimated and hospital benefits and payments were $104 million less. There was of course no previous experience on which to base Budget estimates for these items last year. The shortfalls which eventuated reflected three main factors: fewer persons than expected opting for the basic levels of coverage offered by Medibank Standard; a lower than estimated rate of usage of medical and hospital services generally; and some over-estimation of projected increases in public hospital operating costs. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to the Hospital Benefits Re-insurance Trust Fund was $22 million less than the Budget estimate and the subsidy payable to registered health insurance organisations was $10 million less. These shortfalls reflected in part difficulties which some private health insurance organisations encountered in assessing their entitlements to payment and in submitting their claims before the end of 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Health Program Grants to eligible organisations were $6 million less than estimated. Following the restructuring of the health insurance arrangements from 1 October 1976 a number of recipient organisations became ineligible for further grants. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Pharmaceutical services and benefits were $40 million less than estimated largely because the volume of scripts processed was lower than had been assumed at Budget time. Outlays on nursing home and domiciliary care benefits and payments were $5 million less than estimated, mainly reflecting a lower than anticipated level of claims for nursing home benefits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other significant variations from the Budget estimates included over-expenditures on hospital services for ex-service personnel ($9 million) and health services in the Territories ($6 million) and shortfalls in respect of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories ($3 million) and general administrative expenditures ($10 million). The higher than estimated outlays on the first two items largely reflected salary and other cost increases. In 1976-77 the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories deferred some capital expenditure and required less by way of reimbursement for research activities than had been expected. Lower than estimated costs for the Health Insurance Commission in relation to its Medibank (Public) function and savings achieved by the Department of Health were the main factors accounting for the shortfall in outlays on general administration in the health area. </para>
          <para>Social Security and Welfare</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on social security and welfare exceeded the Budget estimate by $169 million. The major factor in this increase was the increase of $165 million in expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits - from $580 million to $745 million. The average number of benefit recipients in 1976-77 proved to be significantly higher than had been anticipated at Budget time. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There were several other significant changes: payments of service pensions and family allowances were respectively $14 million, .and $7 million higher than estimated, while payments of supporting mothers&#39; benefits were $7 million less than the Budget estimate. Delays in commencing projects resulted in under-expenditure of $6 million on estimated payments for children&#39;s services. </para>
          <para>Housing</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on housing were $19 million less than the Budget estimate with shortfalls of $22 million in respect of Defence Service Homes, mainly because of a lower than expected demand for loans and higher loan repayments, and $13 million in respect of Home Savings Grants, mainly reflecting lower than assumed application rates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Partly offsetting these shortfalls were increases in outlays on housing in the Territories ($7 million) and on housing for Aboriginals ($13 million). The latter increase mainly reflected the provision of additional funds after the Budget was brought down. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Urban and Regional Development nec and the Environment</inline>
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for the purposes encompassed under this heading were approximately $6 million less than the Budget estimate. An additional $11 million was provided for the growth centres of Albury-Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur after the Budget was brought down but this was more than offset by shortfalls in outlays on urban rehabilitation ($7 million), development of Aboriginal community amenities ($4 million), land development in the ACT ($3 million) and land commissions ($2 million) . </para>
          <para>Culture and Recreation</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on cultural and recreational activities were $3 million more than the Budget estimate. Net outlays on the National Broadcasting and Television Service were $8 million more than estimated because of wage and other cost increases. Capital assistance for leisure facilities fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million; drawings, through the States, by project sponsors were not as high as expected. Expenditure on the construction of the National Gallery was $2 million less than estimated. </para>
          <para>Transport and Communication</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There was a shortfall of $54 million in outlays on transport and communication. The call on the Budget by Australian National Railways was $22 million less than had been estimated: this reflected lower than estimated losses on operations during the year and delays in the letting of long-term contracts for capital items. Advances to the Australian Shipping Commission were $15 million less than estimated, reflecting both an improved cash flow and the deferral of some capital items. During the year the Overseas Telecommunications Commission made a repayment of capital ($10 million) which was not provided for in the Budget. Delays in the completion of the MoombaSydney pipeline project reduced the Pipeline Authority&#39;s requirement from the Budget by $4 million. </para>
          <para>Industry Assistance and Development</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under this heading exceeded the Budget estimate by $76 million. Provision had been made in the estimates for the Australian Wool Corporation to repay $245 million previously borrowed from the Government but in the event repayments were $100 million less than estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on the mining industry were a net $11 million more than estimated. Proceeds from divestment of assets acquired by the former Petroleum and Minerals Authority were $7 million less than estimated, because divestment was on balance less rapid than expected; for the same reason investment in petroleum and minerals development (by way of expenditure in relation to those assets) amounted to $4 million more than had been estimated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Grants to the States for beef industry loans were $12 million less than estimated reflecting, in part, the transfer of carry-on finance to the new Rural Adjustment Scheme which came into operation on 1 January 1977. Spending on the eradication of cattle diseases was $4 million less than estimated. Other shortfalls occurred in respect of outlays for export development assistance ($10 million) and marginal dairy farm reconstruction ($7 million). </para>
          <para>Labour and Employment</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total outlays for activities under this heading exceeded the Budget estimate by $19 million. The Government&#39;s decision after the Budget to continue existing arrangements for the stevedoring industry to 31 December 1977 resulted in payments to the stevedoring industry being $27 million greater than the Budget estimate; the Budget estimates were based on these arrangements terminating on 31 December 1976. Payments under the NEAT scheme were $8 million less than estimated. This largely reflected a change in the emphasis of the scheme towards more &#39;on-the-job&#39; training and a delay in the numbers of trainees building up to the expected levels. Outlays on apprenticeship schemes were $2 million more than the estimate. The number of assisted passage migrants in 1976-77 was considerably less than the number underlying the Budget estimate with the result that expenditure under this scheme fell short of the Budget estimate by $6 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays in this category fell short of the Budget estimate by $4 million. Payments to the States in respect of their personal income tax sharing entitlements were $21 million below the estimate, primarily because of downward revisions during the year of the estimate of personal income tax collections. Repayments of special advances made to New South Wales in 1971-72 and 1972-73 fell short of the Budget estimate by $10.5 million; these two loans were consolidated, and principal repayments rescheduled, after the Budget was brought down. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Natural disaster payments exceeded the Budget provisions by $6 million mainly as a consequence of payments following severe bushfires in Victoria and floods and cyclones in Queensland during 1976-77. </para>

Refunds of PAYE tax collections, which were $182 million more than estimated, relate to deductions from earnings in 1975-76, the first year in which the new income tax rebate arrangements operated. The estimate had not allowed sufficiently for the over-deduction of tax instalments for some taxpayers in the first half of 1975-76 (when the old tax instalment schedules applied), the effect of taxpayers not claiming dependants for PAYE purposes and the effect on refunds of unemployment and part-time employment. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Other taxes, fees and fines exceeded the Budget estimate by $33 million, mainly reflecting the Government&#39;s post-Budget decision to extend the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act beyond 31 December, which added $27 million to estimated receipts. </para>

        <para>FINANCING TRANSACTIONS</para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The manner in which the deficit in 1976-77 was financed is summarised in the following tables. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The first of these tables is the usual presentation of Budget financing transactions, recast to indicate <inline font-style="italic">Domestic Borrowings</inline> (DB) and its composition. While this presentation is useful for purposes of describing aggregate financing transactions - and in particular the <inline font-style="italic">securities</inline> (financing instruments) involved in those transactions - it does not bring out the net changes in the holdings of government debt of the several sectors with which the Budget sector transacts. This further information is relevant to analysis of the monetary implications of deficit financing. Portfolio movements, reflecting both net proceeds (subscriptions to new issues less redemptions) and subsequent market transactions in government securities, are shown in the second table; the link between the tables is <inline font-style="italic">Domestic Borrowings.</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">As defined here, DB is that portion of the Budget deficit financed by the issue of Commonwealth securities to domestic non-Budget sectors or by the use (running-down) of Commonwealth cash balances with the Reserve Bank.&#39;1&#39; Subject to minor qualifications, DB thus represents the increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth to domestic non-Budget sectors arising from its budget financing. (2 </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Economic effects of financing transactions depend importantly on which of the nonBudget sectors hold the stock of government debt. Private sector holdings of Commonwealth debt constitute the bulk of the liquidity base of the economy. (See also footnote (b) to Table 2.). Private sector take-up reflects a large number of factors which impinge on domestic liquidity conditions including the size of DB, official interest rates, the balance of payments outcome and net Reserve Bank lending to the private sector.*3) Other things being equal, take-up of government securities by the non-bank private sector provides an offset to the direct increase in banking sector liquidity and the volume of money that would otherwise have acccompanied an increase in the domestic liquidity base. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">This Statement presents details of Budget transactions since 1967-68 in both the national accounting and functional classifications. Traditional presentations of public sector data grew out of the requirement for maintaining Parliamentary control over the authorization of government spending. Information presented in a form suitable for this purpose (e.g. the Appropriation Acts) does not, however, readily lend itself to an assessment of either the economic impact, or the primary objectives and relative priorities of government financial activity. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">national accounts classification</inline> summarises Budget transactions (outlays, receipts and financing) within a classification framework which is broadly consistent with conventions recommended in the United Nations <inline font-style="italic">System of National Accounts.</inline> The classification of Budget transactions by economic type clarifies the nature of the transactions between the public sector and the rest of the economy. It provides a consistent framework for the aggregation of Commonwealth, State and local government transactions into consolidated figures for the public sector as a whole and facilitates comparisons with other national accounts data. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">functional classification</inline> categorises Budget outlays according to their primary objectives or purposes. This facilitates decision-making on the nature, extent and relative priorities of Government activities. The functional classification follows the same conventions for the determination of Budget totals as the national accounts classification. Additional information on the two classification systems is given in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A later section of this Statement refers briefly to the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, and to the total public sector (including State and local government). </para>
          <para>Budget Outlays - Summary</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following table shows increases in Commonwealth Government Budget outlays in each year since 1967-68, and those outlays expressed as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP). It can be seen that total outlays increased much more rapidly than GDP in 1974-75 and 1975-76 but less rapidly in 1976-77. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase of 10.5 per cent in Budget outlays in 1977-78 is expected to imply some further reduction in the ratio of outlays to GDP in the current year. </para>
        <para class="block">Budget Outlays by Function </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Functionally classified Budget data for the period 1967-68 to 1976-77 are presented in Tables 1 and 3 at the end of this Statement; Table 2 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by the major functional and sub-functional blocks over this period. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total Budget outlays have grown at an average annual rate of 17.3 per cent over the nine year period to 1976-77. Outlays on some functions, however, have grown much faster, and others much slower, as the table below shows: </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Comparisons of trends over the period covered in the tables are affected by a number of important factors, including the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, &#39;offsets&#39; to grants to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefits schemes, changes in the arrangements for funding tertiary education, the introduction of Medibank and family allowances, the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth, and part-funding of the capital program of Australian Telecommunications Commission by borrowings on the domestic capital market. These and other factors must be borne in mind when comparing movements in different categories of expenditure. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Average annual rates of increase, which indicate the <inline font-style="italic">trend</inline> in expenditures over a period, can of course mask significant changes within that period.

        <para class="block">Budget Outlays by Economic Type </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The national accounts for the economy as a whole provide a systematic summary of the transactions that take place within the economy, especially those relating to the production and use of goods and services, and to transfers of income or capital between sectors of the economy. By outlining these relationships the national accounts enable analysis of the processes by which production and expenditure are linked. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 4 attached to this Statement shows Budget outlays since 1967-68 classified according to broad national accounts categories. On this basis transfers between different parts of the accounts of the Commonwealth Budget sector are eliminated and additional detail included so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Budget sector and the rest of the economy, including other levels of government, and overseas. The national accounting presentation, by showing Budget sector transactions &#39;classified in a form which is broadly comparable with that presented for the economy as a whole in the Budget Paper <inline font-style="italic">National Income and Expenditure</inline> 1976-77, facilitates analysis of the impact of the Budget on the economy. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">By far the most important single category of receipts is income tax on individuals which increased from 39.0 per cent of total receipts in 1967-68 to 51.7 per cent in 1976-77. This increase stems largely from the effects of the progressive rate scale in a period of strong growth in personal incomes, particularly wage and salary incomes. This growth occurred despite adjustments to the rate scale and other elements of the personal income tax system that were made in 1970-71, 1972-73, 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 with a view to reducing rates of tax for most taxpayers. As well as reflecting the introduction of personal income tax indexation the 1976-77 figures were also affected by the abolition of tax rebates for dependent children and students, which accompanied the introduction of family allowances, and the imposition of the Health Insurance levy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Movements in some other categories of receipts are also affected by certain special factors: &#39;Other General Taxation&#39;, for example, is affected by the transfer to the States in September 1971 of pay-roll tax and the decision to abolish broadcast listeners and television viewers licences from September 1974. </para>
          <para>Overall Budget Results</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Government has incurred overall deficits on its budgetary transactions in each year since 1967-68 (see Table 1). Estimates of the domestic budget result are available only for the years since 1968-69. These estimates are shown in the following table, along with the overall Budget results for the same years; the latter are also expressed as a proportion of GDP: </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="106131197708163_215_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main transactions undertaken to finance the deficits in the Budget over the period have been domestic and overseas loan raisings, the issue of Treasury Notes and temporary borrowings from the Reserve Bank. Details of these financing transactions are shown in Table 6 to this Statement. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is, of course, no single measure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. Although the Budget deficit (or surplus) is often taken asa shorthand or summary measure of Budget impact, its use for this purpose is subject to a number of important qualifications. The deficit measures the difference between outlays and receipts and cannot adequately reflect the differing economic impacts of the components of outlays and receipts. Budget outlays on final goods and services have a  more direct impact on demand in the economy than do transfers and advances from the Budget to other sectors; the impact of these latter transactions depend on the spending propensities of the recipients and related timing lags. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Similarly, on the receipts side, account must be taken of the varying impact on activity of different taxes and other receipts. Taxes on incomes, for example, influence private demand for goods and services through their effects on the level of disposable incomes; sales taxes on the other hand principally affect private demand through the prices of goods.. Consequently, the &#39;mix&#39; of Budget revenues, as well as their total size, is a relevant Consideration in any assessment of the Budget&#39;s overall impact on the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is also important to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions; government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes and the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transactions by which the overall Budget deficit (or surplus) is financed are also of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An outline of the significance for monetary policy of Budget financing transactions is contained in the relevant section of Statement No. 5. </para>
          <para>The Budget Sector and Other Levels of Government</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Transactions of the Commonwealth Budget greatly influence, both directly and indirectly through transfers to other levels of government and authorities, transactions between all levels of government and other sectors of the Australian economy. Mention is made in the following paragraphs of the relationship between the Budget sector and the total Commonwealth Government sector and between the latter sector and the total public sector. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Table 7 attached to this Statement sets out national accounts estimates of the main categories of receipts and outlays of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, for the period since 1967-68. This table is prepared by offsetting transfers between the Budget and non-Budget sectors of the Commonwealth Government and consolidating all other transactions, to form a statement of the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole, with the other sectors of the economy (including other levels of government). Its preparation is described in the Appendix to the <inline font-style="italic">Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Australian Government Authorities, September 1974.</inline> The non-Budget sector may be broadly described as comprising the trading enterprises of the Commonwealth Government other than financial enterprises such as the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget component clearly dominates the transactions of the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole. There are, however, some differences between the relative composition of transactions of the Budget sector and the Commonwealth Government sector. The main difference is that capital expenditure by the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole is significantly greater than for the Budget sector, because authorities outside the Budget finance their capital expenditure from funds provided from the Budget in the form of advances, from their own internally generated funds and particularly in recent years, from non-Budget sources. The following table shows the composition of transactions of the two sectors in 1976-77: </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">At the Premiers&#39; Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth Government would cease to levy pay-roll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own pay-roll taxes as from the same date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth pay-roll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, financial assistance grants paid to the States in 1971-72 were reduced. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect&#39; of reducing the growth of outlays and receipts below the rate that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in special purpose payments to the States are recorded under the appropriate functional headings, while &#39;offsetting adjustments&#39; to General Revenue Assistance Grants to the States are taken into account under the functional heading </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities nec and Natural Disaster Relief. The assumption in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education by the Commonwealth Government contributed to an increase in outlays classified to Education but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. This means that the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown in the function Education, is somewhat overstated. A similar effect occurred in 1974-75, which was the first full year of the new tertiary education arrangements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the operation of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect the outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the relevant functions and receipts under the heading Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of the new Commonwealth Superannuation scheme with effect from 1 July 1976 gives rise to similar effects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Family Allowances scheme introduced in 1976-77 involved the abolition of taxation rebates for dependent children and students, offset by substantial increases in family allowances in place of child endowment. The effect of this measure was to sharply increase the level of outlays under the Social Security and Welfare function in 1976-77, and to increase receipts from personal income taxation, above what they would otherwise have been. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Notes on Tables 1, 2 and 3: Budget Outlays Classified by Function </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To the extent possible, the definitions and concepts adopted for the historical series are the same as those used in Statement No. 3 (although Table 3 provides less detail than do the tables in Statement No. 3). <inline font-weight="bold">Major discontinuities</inline> are indicated where appropriate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations would be met by the States out of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling$1 60 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show these amounts classified to &#39;Payments to the States, etc&#39; instead of Housing&#39;. However, for the purposes of the calculation of the trend rates of growth and the chart of proportions of total outlays, these amounts have been included in the function &#39;Housing&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of revisions in the classification of items to the various functional headings (see Appendix to the Budget Statements) the figures in Tables 1 and 3 are not entirely comparable with those given in the Budget documents in previous years. </para>

		  <title>APPENDIX TO THE BUDGET STATEMENTS - THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF BUDGET OUTLAYS</title>
          <page.no>235</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the functional classification is to bring together outlays with like objectives or purposes. In this way the classification aims to present information on the nature of government activities, on the resources devoted to particular objectives and to facilitate assessments of the effectiveness of outlays in meeting objectives. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Compared with the classification used in Budget Statements prior to 1973-74, the functional classification has the added advantage of being based on national accounting conventions. There is thus a consistent conceptual basis underlying both the economic classification and the functional classification. This removes a considerable source of confusion which existed in Budget documents prior to 1973-74 when two conceptually different classifications were used - the so-called &#39;conventional&#39; classification and the national accounting classification. </para>
      <para class="block">Basis of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The conventions and principles used in the functional classification are essentially those set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts,</inline> United Nations, New York 1968. That classification is a widely accepted international standard for the classification of public expenditure by function. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The Australian Bureau of Statistics has concurrently adopted these conventions and principles in the documents it publishes on public authority finance. While the major functional headings adopted for Budget purposes are conceptually consistent with those used by the Statistician in his publications, it should be noted that the figures published by the Bureau for Commonwealth Government outlays cover both Budget outlays and outlays by Commonwealth Government authorities which operate outside the Budget sector. They therefore differ somewhat from the figures shown for the Budget sector in the Budget Statements. Information on the transactions of authorities operating outside the Budget sector is shown in the <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Outlays of Commonwealth Government Authorities</inline> which is published with the Budget documents. Two further differences should be noted. First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements &#39;net&#39; of the relevant primary industry levies and charges; these outlays are shown on a gross basis by the Statistician. Secondly, for the years prior to 1974-75, part of the expenditure incurred by some Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities operating in Papua New Guinea is classified by the Statistician as foreign aid. In the Budget Statements these outlays are shown under the same functional heading as similar outlays made within Australia. Supplementary information on the functional allocation of these outlays is available in the Bureau&#39;s publication <inline font-style="italic">Public Authority Finance - Federal Authorities.</inline></para>
      <para class="block">The Structure of the Functional Classification </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The major functional headings are shown in the summary table in Statement No. 3. Brief descriptions of the contents of each function are given below. These descriptions are intended to convey the scope of the outlays included under each heading rather than to be a detailed listing of the contents of each category. Further detail on each function is provided in the body of Statement No. 3. Historical data for the period 1967-68 to 1976-77 are given in Statement No. 6. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">From an examination of the classification structure set out in the Budget Statements it will be evident that the functional classification is relatively aggregative in nature. On the whole it has not been possible, for example, to dissect the administrative outlays of departments and to allocate them over the particular sub-categories shown under each functional heading. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Outlays under each functional heading in the classification have been grouped together into readily identifiable blocks. These blocks do not, as a rule, purport to represent detailed purpose-oriented sub-functions or programs; rather, they are meant as recognisable and meaningful groupings which lend themselves to discussion and analysis. Nevertheless, the main outlay blocks are decidedly more purpose-oriented than was the case with the categories of expenditure identified under the conventional classification used prior to 1973-74. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Given the need to produce a continuing and up-to-date record of actual monthly outlays and receipts which is consistent with the overall estimates embodied in the Budget Speech and documents, it has been necessary to work largely within existing central accounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than detailed costing documents. The figures presented, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented where necessary by a limited amount of sub-costing of substantial appropriation items which cover several functions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. Furthermore, some outlay and receipt figures are netted in arriving at aggregates. Expenditure votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may, therefore, be classified under more than one functional heading and it will not always be possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Statements. The introduction of the functional classification, however, does not alter the structure of the appropriations or the summaries presented with the Appropriation Bills, such as the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure.</inline></para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the broad purposes for which government outlays are undertaken, it is important to note that such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions. Military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme, however, requires that an outlay be classified to the function which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example above, the primary function is considered to be defence; this is in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is not possible, in any single classification system, to focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to the Government or the public. Supplementary information on particular aspects of expenditure is therefore provided in other documents; for example, details of wage and salary estimates are shown in the document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> and a separate Budget Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other supplementary Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech this year deal with the Civil Works Program and Australia&#39;s Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries. </para>
          <para>The Implications of Adopting National Accounting Conventions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The use of definitions of Budget outlays and receipts based on national accounting conventions places Budget data on a basis which, in the main, is conceptually consistent with national accounting information published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and can be related to that information. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The principles underlying the national accounting presentation of Budget data are set out in the Appendix to the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled <inline font-style="italic">National Accounting Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure of Australian Government Authorities,</inline> September 1974. Concurrent with the introduction of the functional classification in 1973-74, some changes were made to the previous national accounting definitions of outlays, receipts and the deficit, used in the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para class="block">The more significant of these changes were: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>net advances to the Australian Wheat Board are now treated as outlay items, rather than financing transactions. This brings the classification of these short term advances into line with that accorded to other advances from the budget; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>purchases of land and existing buildings (including inter-departmental transfers for which a financial adjustment is made) are now treated as outlays rather than offsets to the proceeds from the sale of these assets under a receipts heading. This change permits gross outlays on these assets to be shown under the appropriate functional headings. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other conceptual changes in line with the principles set out in the publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> were also introduced. These changes relate mainly to the treatment of rents and business enterprise transactions and are indicated in the September 1974 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin. Overall, they do not have a very significant effect on the figures shown for total receipts and total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The adoption of national accounting conventions implies that the receipts and outlay figures shown in the Statements attached to the Budget Speech relate to the net transactions of the budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important characteristics of the national accounting treatment shown in the Statements are: </para>

          <item label="(a)">
            <para>the transactions of various Funds forming the Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, payments to Trust Accounts are not shown as part of outlays; rather, the expenditure from Trust Accounts is included. The aim is essentially to record the transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy. Allowance is made, however, for adjustments between functions arising from the transfer of existing assets where financial adjustments for these transfers are recorded; </para>

          <item label="(b)">
            <para>receipts derived from activities which are essentially of a governmental nature, involving regulation and compulsory payment, are normally treated as revenue items. As mentioned earlier, however, the various primary industry levies and charges which are collected by the Government and applied more or less directly for the purposes of commodity stabilisation, research and promotional activities are offset against the relevant outlays. Other recoveries and repayments are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net outlay figures. For example, repayments of principal on advances to other authorities are offset against the corresponding advances under the same outlay heading. Bringing together the relevant outlays and recoveries or repayments makes it possible to see more readily the extent of financial resources which are directed through the Budget to a particular activity. Other taxes, compulsory charges, licence fees and the like which are of a general revenue nature are treated as receipts items under the heading &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines&#39;; </para>

            <para>the operating revenues, net of operating expenses, of activities which are carried out as business-type enterprises are shown as receipts items.

          <item label="(d)">
            <para>certain transactions which are netted in published totals of the receipts and payments of the Public Account are shown in gross form. The more important of these are interest on loans raised by the Commonwealth Government for State works programs and for the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas Airways Ltd. Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading &#39;Public Debt Interest&#39;, while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>

The Government has announced that in future increased emphasis will be placed on the childcare aspect of the program. Some projects, under the program combine both, child-care and pre-school aspects and there is difficulty in obtaining consistent data, over several years, to allow a dissection of expenditure between thechildcare services (which, primarily, serve a Social Security and Welfare purpose) and pre-schools (which, primarily, serve an Education purpose). As a consequence outlays under this program have been reclassified in total from Education&#39; to &#39;Social Security and Welfare&#39;. The associated administrative costs now are included under the General Administration heading in the Social Security and Welfare function. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory Administration.In</inline>the past, Commonwealth expenditures in the Northern Territory have been classified to the relevant functional blocks (health, education, etc.), rather than grouped together under a single Northern Territory heading. </para>

        </list>
        <para pgwide="yes">On 1 January 1977 executive responsibility for some functions, previously administered by the Department of the Northern Territory, was transferred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Funds for these functions are being provided to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in the form of two block amounts, with responsibility for the allocation of these amounts among particular functions residing with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays from the allocations to be provided to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1977-78 have not, therefore, been allocated across the functional headings in Statement No. 3; these amounts have been classified to a new sub-heading &#39;Allocation to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly&#39; under function 9E &#39;General Public Services - Administrative Services&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other expenditures by the Commonwealth in or for the Northern Territory, continue to be classified to the relevant function. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This treatment of Northern Territory outlays will be revised as the the transition to self-government continues. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a consequence of changed administrative arrangements and problems of data availability, it has been necessary to make some changes in the composition or presentation of the various outlay blocks. Where appropriate these have been footnoted in the tables. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because the functional classification is derived largely from the appropriation accounting system, adjustments to the historical series are constrained by availability of suitable data in that system. In particular, the major changes to departmental administrative arrangements announced in December 1972, June 1974, June 1975, and December 1975, have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent series of outlay aggregates for the periods covered in the Budget Statements. Where possible, the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by sub-costing and regrouping appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies and produce an entirely comparable series. This should be borne in mind when examining the tables in Statement No. 3 and, more particularly, Statement No. 6. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For these reasons, considerable care must be exercised when comparing functionally classified data in the 1977-78 Budget Statements with those in Budget Statements for earlier years. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- It was announced in the Budget Speech earlier tonight that the Government is introducing new arrangements for the pricing and taxation of crude oil produced from presently known Australian fields. For several years I have been arguing that energy in Australia is unrealistically priced. The price of petrol here is less than half the price in countries like Japan, France and Italy. While consumers would welcome the continuation of this situation, the fact is that it cannot continue. The quadrupling of international oil prices in 1973-74 ushered in a new and disturbing realisation of the essential role oil plays in the standard of living the world either enjoys or aspires to. Events since then have reinforced that realisation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Oil plays a key role in the transport on which the modern world depends. It is also the energy source for which we face the most critical shortages. President Carter&#39;s energy statement contained the estimate that on current trends, demand would overhaul supply some time around the mid 1980s. Nobody seriously questions this forecast. If this situation is permitted to occur, the market price for oil will be anyone&#39;s guess. Governments the world over must make every attempt to forestall such a demand-supply squeeze. They must take active steps to mitigate the effects of dearer oil- a certainty whether or not world demand outpaces availability. Oil supplies 45 per cent of the world&#39;s energy needs and 47 per cent of Australia&#39;s. It will remain for decades the most important energy source. It is at the heart of any country&#39;s energy policy. </para>
          <para>I am currently preparing a statement which will deal comprehensively with all forms of energy. That statement will be presented to the House as soon as practicable. The matters discussed in this present statement form an integral part of that forthcoming statement of energy policy. For Australia, our central energy policy objectives must be threefold. Firstly, we must encourage oil exploration and development. Secondly, we must encourage greater economies of energy usage and encourage people to use other fuels in preference to oil. Thirdly, we must foster a more intensive search for alternatives to oil. Each of these objectives requires the price to be increased. That is why I have constantly argued that we should move gradually and predictably towards higher oil prices. This approach allows us to avoid the large, abrupt, destabilising increases which would otherwise occur. </para>
          <para>Price is not the only instrument available to promote our policy. Clearly the Government can and will exhort consumers to reduce their usage of oil products in the national interest. But realistic pricing remains critical to the success of a policy. Energy saving measures like, for example, insulation of houses, need to become recognised money-saving propositions. Higher priced oil will also assist in bringing about the economic introduction of alternative energy technologies such as coal conversion and solar power. A higher price will raise the return on successful exploration. An improved return on investment provides a strengthened encouragement for exploration; moreover, we would expect that higher earnings by existing producers will be ploughed back into further exploration here in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has given a general outline of the new arrangements. I will now describe in some additional detail the pricing, allocation, and levy arrangements, and deal briefly with the question of their likely impact. As already announced, the Government has decided to implement a scheme which will take the price of indigenous crude oil from presently known fields in the direction of import parity. This will be achieved through a uniform method of price determination. The new scheme will apply to each presently known field in Australia and will apply from midnight tonight. Producers will receive die import parity price, determined by the Government every six months, for a specified part of their production. Import parity will be received for either the first six million barrels of oil produced from each field per annumcalled the &#39;basic allowance&#39;- or a proportion of production per annum, rising over time according to a specified schedule, whichever is the greater in any particular case. The schedule is 10 per cent from tomorrow until the end of the present financial year, rising to 20 per cent for the financial year 1978-79, 35 per cent for financial year 1979-80 and 50 per cent for financial year 1980-81. </para>
          <para>For all additional production from each field or new development, the producers will receive the price which was current up to the time of the introduction of the new arrangements. That is $2.33 per barrel in the case of the Bass Strait fields and $2.88 per barrel in the case of the Barrow Island field. All production from the Moonie and Alton fields and other small fields will, in practice, receive import parity prices, as the output from those fields will be well below six million barrels per annum. </para>
          <para>The Government will review the position before June 1981 to decide the rate at which the further progression to full import parity for presently known fields should take place. Oil from fields discovered after 14 September 1975 will continue to receive full import parity. The present crude oil absorption policy, whereby all crude oil produced in Australia is required to be processed in Australian refineries, will be continued. Indigenous crude oil, with its high yield of light fractions, is ideally suited to the local market demand. The export of the indigenous crude oil would therefore simply mean the exchange of our own oil for another, probably less suitable, imported oil. The existing embargo on exports of crude oil will therefore remain in force. The Government is, in any case, under an obligation to continue the present crude oil absorption policy and associated allocation arrangements until at least 1980. This is because most refineries have undertaken considerable plant investment on the basis of that policy and to prematurely abandon it or phase it out would arbitrarily disadvantage a substantial section of the oil refining industry. </para>
          <para>The import parity price will be set every six months by the Commonwealth Government. It will be calculated on the basis of the price of Arabian light oil at the nearest refinery port, adjusted to allow for an appropriate quality differential. This differential will take account of the suitability of indigenous crude oil for the local market. For the period until 3 1 December 1977, the import parity price will be set at $13 per barrel. Officers of the Department of National Resources will be having discussions with the oil industry in the near future to determine the precise basis on which the import parity price should be calculated in future periods. The new pricing arrangements give a consistent set of ground rules applicable to all present and future developments in existing fields. They will remove any apparent arbitrariness inherent in the previous method of price determination. The basic allowance will apply to the combined existing developments in each presently known field and to each substantial new development in such fields. The figure of six million barrels per annum has been selected to ensure that new developments will immediately receive import parity prices for all or most of their production. It will ensure firstly that different producers are treated equitably and, secondly, that adequate recognition is given to the fact that oil from the smaller fields is typically more costly to produce than oil from the larger fields. </para>
          <para>As already announced, the crude oil levy will be increased by $ 1 per barrel to $3 per barrel. The levy will be deducted from the price for import-parity oil, and added to the price for below-import-parity oil. In effect, therefore, producers will pay the levy on import-parity oil, and consumers will pay the levy on belowimportparity production. The likely effects on prices, company profits, and Government revenues of the new arrangements were mentioned in the Budget Speech. The new arrangements will increase the prices received by existing producers approximately as follows: For the remainder of 1977, the average price for all Bass Strait fields already in production, net of the crude oil levy, will be about $3.20 per barrel. For Barrow Island, the average price received will be about $6.60, and for Moonie the price received will be $10 per barrel. If world prices rise at 6 per cent per annum and no further changes are made in the levy arrangements, corresponding net prices by 1979-80 could be of the order of $6.20, $7.30 and $11.60 for Bass Strait, Barrow Island and Moonie respectively. </para>
          <para>The net prices in the early period would be somewhat lower than the prices which would have resulted from acceptance of the precise Industries Assistance Commission recommendations. The new arrangements will immediately increase the average price into Australian refineries of all oil including imports by an estimated 25 per cent. While the actual extent of any petroleum product price increase will be a matter for the Prices Justification Tribunal, the resultant increase will probably be of the order of 2&#189;c per litre on the price of regular motor spirit. On this basis, the recommended price of regular motor spirit in Sydney would rise to approximately 1 9c per litre. </para>
          <para>The Government is, of course, most reluctant to increase the price of petroleum products to Australian consumers. But the option of maintaining indefinitely a low price for the bulk of Australian refinery feedstocks is simply no longer available to us. It needs to be recognised that the Australian consumer has been paying less than the real value of the petroleum he uses. Furthermore, over the phasing-in period he will continue to pay less than in most overseas countries. Compared to the new likely price of 19c per litre in Sydney, the French motorist pays 39c, the Japanese motorist pays 38c, and the German, Swedish and British motorists all pay over 30c. Petrol prices in Australia remain considerably below the 25c per litre in New Zealand and are now at roughly the same level as Canadian prices. Only the United States among major Western countries has cheaper petrol than Australia and the thrust of  President  Carter&#39;s energy policy is to increase the price of oil products to American consumers. </para>
          <para>It must be recognised that our decision to move towards import parity pricing for known crude oil merely hastens the inevitable. In the next few years, production from the Bass Strait fields will begin to decline as those fields approach the end of their economic life. These fields comprise 90 per cent of present day Australian production. Hence oil produced overseas, imported at prevailing world prices, will account for an increasing proportion of the input to Australian refineries. Furthermore, should more oil be discovered in Australia, it is already established Government policy that that oil will be priced at full import parity. The new arrangements will effectively increase the amount of oil available from presently known fields. There are over 400 million barrels of oil, or two years worth of consumption, locked up in fields and not economically extractable at current prices. Australia cannot afford to leave this oil m the ground. The basic allowance of 6 million barrels per annum of oil at import parity prices for each new development will provide an assurance that these reserves can be extracted. </para>
          <para>There are several considerations other than basic energy policy considerations which the Government has necessarily had to take into account when formulating its new policy. One is the Government&#39;s overriding aim of lowering the rate of inflation and raising the level of activity in the economy generally. There is a need also to avoid the significant dislocation which could be expected to follow as particular industries suffered large cost increases. It is for these reasons that the Government has decided to increase prices gradually rather than all at once. The new arrangements will result in very substantial increases in the profits of each of the current producers. For this reason the Government is considering the application of a resources tax to these profits. Accordingly the Government will be seeking early discussions with the relevant oil producing companies on these matters. Any decision on the future of the crude oil levy will be taken in the light of decisions on the resource tax. </para>
          <para>The Government considers that the new pricing arrangements represent the most appropriate way of bringing Australian oil prices to world levels. The new taxation arrangements will aim to achieve an appropriate division between producers in the form of net returns, and the Government- and hence the taxpayer- in the form of taxation revenue. Over the transitional period, the Australian consumer of petroleum products will, for some years, be able to pay prices based on crude oil prices below the price of imported crude. Many other countries in a less fortunate position than Australia have had to adjust to the hard reality of high oil prices very rapidly. Our own oil reserves will allow us to adjust gradually, and consequently at less cost in terms of disruption. But we must take advantage of the time these reserves have allowed us to adjust our oil consumption habits and to prepare substitutes for imported oil. </para>

            <para>-In reply to the statement made by the Minister for National Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> I want to say briefly that what we have heard in the last few minutes was virtually a home town decision by the Government in support of its corporate friends when it has had a year to consider the report of the Industries Assistance Commission, which was presented in September last year. The Opposition has announced on other occasions that it is sympathetic to the general thrust of the IAC report where increases in the price of crude are accompanied by the presence of a secondary taxing structure. But what we have heard tonight represents an increase of 1 lc a gallon in the price of fuel to the Australian consumer, to the motorist in the city and to the farmer, and a massive increase in profitability for the main producers of oil in Australia, the Esso-BHP consortium in Bass Strait. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister said in his speech that the Government is considering the application of a resources tax on these profits and that, accordingly, the Government will be seeking early discussions with the relevant oil producing companies on the matter. That is not good enough. </para>
          <para class="block">The Government was presented with the IAC report 12 months ago and that report canvassed a secondary taxing or royalties system. The Treasury should have been instructed to present the Government forthwith with a number of taxing scenarios which the Government could have considered for simultaneous introduction with these proposals. Not only do we find that that is not the case, but also that the real story is hidden. There is no express mention in the Minister&#39;s statement of the kind of profitability which will flow to the companies by virtue of these decisions. On my quick estimate, from BHP and Esso, the Bass Strait producers, which have three fields which qualify under the 6 million barrels a year provision, there will be approximately 13 million barrels in respect of which the Government is offering import parity of $13. Taking into account the present price of $2.30, as well as the $3 a barrel, the benefit will be about $7.70 a barrel over 13 million barrels. That means that the Government has put $ 100m in excess profits into the hands of Esso and BHP without any express commitment to spend that money on new exploration. </para>
          <para>The Minister said that he hopes there will be new exploration. He should have insisted. There should have been an express provision that the money given to the companies would be spent in that way. As well, massive additional revenue will flow to the Government from these arrangements. That additional revenue should have been spent on alternative energy technology and research into alternative energy resources, but that was not mentioned in the statement. I believe that it is a very inadequate statement. It is a home town decision for Esso-BHP and the other oil producers. The Government ought to be ashamed. It has had 12 months to introduce a taxing system and it has failed to measure up to the challenge. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts of several Employment Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of the number of characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. </para>
            <para>With this caveat in mind, as stated in my answer to the honourable member&#39;s question No. 219 of 9 March, 1977, 1 am prepared to provide statistics of the numbers, age and sex of persons registered as unemployed in Offices of the CES contained in the respective electorates as requested by the honourable member but, as statistics of occupational categories for which unemployed persons are registered are not normally published by CES Office areas, I do not consider that the considerable clerical effort involved in their extraction would be justified for part (3) of the honourable member&#39;s question. </para>

              <para>The publication &#34;Main Economic Indicators&#34;, produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, contains indices of average earnings which enable a limited comparison to be made of the rate of increase of earnings in each country with the exception of Australia. The available indices for the countries other than Australia measure average earnings of adult and junior males and females and part-time workers whereas the two series for Australia contained in the publication are for average minimum hourly wage rates in manufacturing for males and females separately. The male rates only have been included in Table 1. For each country the index of real earnings was calculated by dividing the index of earnings by each country&#39;s consumer price index (all items). The statistical difficulties of making comparisons between earnings in various places, due mainly to differences in coverage and compilation; require that any interpretation of the figures in the table be made with caution. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: ( 1-4) Paragraph 133 ( 1) (db) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act came into operation on 8 July 1976. Subsection 133 (4C) allows an organisation a period of 12 months after that date within which to bring its rules into conformity with the requirements of that paragraph. </para>

          <para>The power conferred upon the Industrial Registrar by subsection 133 (4D) is not available to him until the expiration of the period allowed by sub-section 133 (4C). </para>
          <para>The rules of a number of organisations already prescribe terms of office which do not exceed the period prescribed in paragraph 133 (1) (db). </para>
          <para>I am advised that the Industrial Registrar has convened meetings of representatives of registered organisations in Melbourne and Sydney to discuss, among other things, the subject of paragraph 133 (1) (db), and that appropriate alterations to the rules of some organisations have already been certified by the Industrial Registrar. </para>

            <para>Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts of several CES Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each one of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of the number and characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (5) There are no reliable statistics of the number of abortions carried out in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Information is available for medical services for which medical benefits have been paid under various individual items in the Medical Benefits Schedule. The information relates only to services performed by medical practitioners on a fee-for-service basis, and which were the subject of claims for medical benefits. For instance the information would not include any of the large numbers of medical services provided by recognised hospitals to &#39;hospital patients&#39; in standard wards (i.e. the former &#39;public ward patients&#39;). Under the Commonwealth/State Hospital Agreements, these medical services are provided to these patients by the recognised hospitals. Medical benefits are not payable in respect of such services, and the cost of their provision forms part of the costs shared under the Hospital Agreements. </para>
          <para>The Medical Benefits Schedule includes medical services in the nature of gynaecological procedures which may result in the termination of pregnancy. Schedule item 6469 &#39;Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage . . . &#39; is the item under which most abortions would be itemised. </para>
          <para>Another gynaecological procedure which may result in the termination of a pregnancy is covered by Schedule items 6460/6464- &#39;Uterus, curettage of, with or without dilation, including curettage for incomplete miscarriage&#39;. Information is not available on the number of such cases in which a pregnancy was terminated as the items cover a number of gynaecological procedures apart from termination of a pregnancy. </para>
          <para>On the basis of information available it is estimated that the number of services for which medical benefits were paid by Medibank and the private health funds in 1976 under item 6469 was 39,400 and the medical benefits paid amounted to $2. 5m. </para>

            <para>Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of Parliamentary electorates and in the majority of cases parts of several Employment Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of the number and characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. </para>
            <para>With this caveat in mind, as stated in my answer to the honourable member&#39;s question No. 219 of 9 March 1977, 1 am prepared to provide statistics of the numbers, age and sex of persons registered as unemployed in Offices of the CES contained in the respective electorates as requested by the honourable member but, as statistics of occupational categories for which unemployed persons are registered are not normally published by CES Office areas I do not consider that the considerable clerical effort involved in their extraction, would be j justified for part ( 3 ) of the honourable member &#39;s question. </para>

          <para>Information is available for medical services for which medical benefits have been paid under various individual items in the Medical Benefits Schedule. The information relates only to services performed by medical practitioners on a fee-for-service basis, and which were the subject of claims for medical benefits. For instance the information would not include any of the large numbers of medical services provided by recognised hospitals to &#39;hospital patients&#39; in standard wards (i.e. the former &#39;public ward patients&#39;). Under the Commonwealth/State Hospital Agreements, these medical services are provided to these patients by the recognised hospitals. Medical benefits are not payable in respect of such services, and the cost of their provision forms part of the costs shared under the Hospital Agreements. </para>
          <para>The Medical Benefits Schedule includes medical services in the nature of gynaecological procedures which may result in the termination of pregnancy. Schedule item 6469- Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage . . &#39;-is the item under which most terminations would be itemised. </para>
          <para>Another gynaecological procedure which may result in the termination of a pregnancy is covered by Schedule items 6460/6464- &#39;Uterus, curettage of, with or without dilation, including curettage for incomplete miscarriage&#39;. Information is not available on the number of such cases in which a pregnancy was terminated as the items cover a number of gynaecological procedures apart from termination of a pregnancy. </para>
          <para>On the basis of information available for item 6469- Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage . &#39;-it is estimated that the amount paid as medical benefits in 1974-75 was $0.9m, and in 1975-76, $2.4m. This procedure was not introduced into the Medical Benefits Schedule until 24 April 1974 and so information on this procedure prior to 1974-75 is not available. </para>

            <para>The health program grants were introduced with effect from 1 July 1975 as part of the Medibank arrangements. Their main purpose was to provide a source of financing, in lieu of the payment of medical benefits, for services provided by medical practitioners employed on a salaried or sessional basis by approved organisations. Health program grants were paid on the basis of reimbursing approved organisations for the cost of providing approved medical clinical services free of charge. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>With the introduction of the modified Medibank arrangements on 1 October 1976 significant changes were made in the method of financing medical services, with private medical benefits funds and employers assuming a much greater role. As from that date Commonwealth medical benefits have not been payable in respect of services rendered to privately insured persons or for medical expenses incurred by employers. </para>
        <para>As a result of the above changes the health program grants have not been payable since 1 October 1976 in respect of those organisations shown as having the grant terminated on 30 September 1976. </para>
        <para>The changed health program grants arrangements adopted from1 October 1976 take into account the basic principle that charges should be raised for scheduled medical services provided to people who are insured for both medical andhospital benefits with registered health benefits organisations. Exceptions to the application of this principle are permitted in special circumstances, e.g. where privacy considerations are paramount. Consequently the levels of the health program grams to approved organisations are now generally determined so that grants meet the cost of medical clinical services provided to persons covered by Standard Medibank. </para>
        <para>I would remind the honourable member that I recently announced the expansion of the scope of existing Health Program Grant arrangements to provide funds for projects which have potential for demonstrating increased effectiveness, or efficiency of health services, whilst at the same time containing costs. Active encouragement has been given to the development of project proposals pending necessary amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. </para>

            <para>Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates.

Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of those Offices.

          <quote>
            <para>Statistics of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) are normally compiled according to individual Employment Office areas. It is not usual for the boundaries of these to coincide with the boundaries of parliamentary electorates. In the majority of cases parts of several Employment Office areas would be contained in any one electorate. Conversely, however, some Employment Offices either contain a single electorate or parts of more than one electorate within their boundaries. </para>
            <para>It is possible to state roughly the proportion of each CES Office area contained in a particular electorate and to provide statistics relating to the total number of persons registered as unemployed in each of those Offices. Any attempt to apply the relative proportions to these total figures, however, in an effort to obtain an estimate of the number and characteristics of the unemployed registrants in that electorate, would be misleading as the distribution of population and unemployment within each CES Office area is unlikely to be uniform. </para>
            <para>With this caveat in mind, as stated in my answer to the honourable member for Werriwa &#39;s question No. 219 of 9 March, 1977, I am prepared to provide statistics of the numbers, age and sex of persons registered as unemployed in Offices of the CES contained in the respective electorates as requested by the honourable member but, as statistics of occupational categories for which unemployed persons are registered are not normally published by CES Office areas I do not consider that the considerable clerical effort involved in their extraction would be justified for part (3) of the honourable member&#39;s question. </para>
            <para>The following are the answers, in terms of CES Office areas, to parts (1) and (2) of the honourable member&#39;s question: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Statement No. 4 attached to the 1976-77 Budget Speech contained a note indicating that the investment allowance announced on 20 May 1976 was estimated to cost $200m in 1 976-77 and $600m in a full year. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes. The estimates are based on forecasts of the level of investment, but the cost to revenue lags investment by one year as tax is payable by businesses generally in the year following the year of income. The cost to revenue of investment allowance in 1976-77 and 1977-78 therefore depends on the level of investment in 1975-76 and 1 976-77 respectively. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The 1976-77 estimate has since been reduced to $100m and the 1977-78 estimate, previously $550m, was put at $450m in the light of the results of a survey which suggested that the lead time (i.e. the period between the ordering of the plant-after 31 December 1975-and its installation) was greater than had been expected. Furthermore, although, on review, the level of private investment in plant adopted for the purpose of the estimate was higher than that previously adopted, the survey results indicated that the range of equipment not covered by the new allowance was greater than had been anticipated. </para>

              <para>No; see answer to (3) above. </para>

            <item label="(5)">
              <para>A revival in investment forms only part of the Government&#39;s strategy for economic recovery. The Government&#39;s aim ever since it took office has been to achieve a balanced, sustained expansion in economic activity. The severe slump in non-dwelling investment during the first half of the 1970s has impaired the provocative capacity of the economy. Recovery is thus more than usually subject to the danger of quickly meeting supply constraints which could rekindle inflation and abort the recovery. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Against that background the Government has chosen a strategy which rests at least partly on the proposition that private investment expenditure should play a conspicuous role relatively early in the course of the recovery. There is a normal tendency in the recovery process for non-dwelling investment to lag behind the recovery in other areas. The investment allowance is designed to shorten that lag by encouraging businessmen to bring forward new investment. In this way, capacity will expand as activity expands, instead of waiting until bottlenecks are encountered, by then of course it is too late. </para>
          <para>Indications are that investment in plant and equipment has, in fact, been moving in step with the overall recovery. In 1976, private gross fixed capital expenditure on plant and equipment, in constant prices, was 6.4 per cent higher than in 1975. Expenditure in the second half of 1976 was 7.6 per cent higher than in the second half of 1975. </para>

              <para>1 ) to (5) I am advised that the research project in question is the solar-ammonia project which is being conducted within the Department of Engineering Physics, Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian National University. The project has been concerned with studying processes for the mass utilisation of solar energy, using ammonia as a means of chemical storage, with a view to developing a 10 megawatt power generation station. A power station of this size could supply enough electricity to serve a town of 10 000 people. </para>

          <para class="block">The solar-ammonia project has been funded from the be- f inning of 1974 to the present time from the resources of the Research School of Physical Sciences but the project has now reached a stage where the level of funding required exceeds the financial capabilities of the School. It was estimated by the research group, in their submission of May 1976 to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, that further development of the project to the point where a significant pilot plant could be constructed would require about $2.0m over a period of S years. On the assumption that University funding could continue at the current level, an additional amount of about $1.4m would be needed to reach the required level of funding. </para>
          <para>The future of the solar-ammonia project has been reviewed within the University over the last 18 months as part of an overall review of the research programs of the Research School of Physical Sciences. The review, which involved both internal and external assessors, considered that&#39; the required level of funding was beyond the means of the Research School and the University. It was therefore decided that the School should continue to support the project to the end of 1977. The expectation is that the technological and economic viability of the process will then have been examined to determine the feasibility of proceeding to the first production stage of a 10 MW electrical generating station. </para>
          <para>The University has recognised that there is a place for applied work of this nature in the Research School of Physical Sciences, although the primary role of this and other Research Schools is to undertake fundamental scientific research. Financial constraints are such that work of an applied nature can be supported only during an initial exploratory phase, on the understanding that funding from sources outside the University must be obtained before any extension to the often much more costly development phase can proceed. </para>

              <para>1 ) The present referral system, which was introduced on 1 November 1970, was directly based on the recommendations of a special working party which included senior representatives of the medical profession. A formal system was considered necessary because of the introduction at that time of higher benefits for a large number of services when rendered by specialists and consultant physicians to referred patients. The system is a formalisation of procedures which previously existed within the medical profession, and provides written evidence that a referral has taken place. The referral requirements relate solely to the payment of medical benefits. The system recognises the fundamental right of a patient to seek referral to a specialist or consultant physician, and that, when referral is requested, medical benefits are payable at the appropriate higher rate. The system also acknowledges that, as a general rule, an initial consultation by a general practitioner is in the best interests of the patient. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The only statistical information available relates to the number of services for which benefits have been paid at the specialist rate. Referral certificates may be valid for periods up to three months or twelve months and there is no way of knowing how many specialist services may be performed during these periods in respect of any referral certificate. Moreover, in the case of surgical operations, for example, a referral certificate may cover procedures performed by as many as three specialists- the surgeon, the assistant surgeon and the anaesthetist. No special staff are employed to process referral certificates. Checks to ensure that referral certificates are provided where necessary to enable benefits to be paid at the higher specialist rate are carried out as a normal assessing procedure. Notices of referral are processed by Medibank and private medical benefits funds in assessing benefits, not by the Department. Printing of notices of referral pads is arranged by the Department; however the current annual printing requirements are approximately 100,000 pads comprising SO notices to a pad. </para>

              <para>Unless a referral system is used, specialists could be overwhelmed by patients, many of whom may require only G.P. treatment. The referral system is a filter for the protection of patients, general practitioners and specialists. The current referral system is considered to be the most satisfactory method of achieving the desired result, providing a relatively easy and economical procedure which has been successful in meeting the majority of cases involving the need for specialist treatment. The Medibank Review Committee considered the operation of the referral system during its examination of Medibank in 1976, but did not propose any changes. </para>

The referral may be to a private or salaried specialist attached to a hospital or polyclinic, or to a private practising specialist. Referral forms or cards are in use in some of these countries, however, little detail is known about their referral mechanisms. </para>

              <para>No- without further information it is not possible to identify the particular general practitioners and to ascertain whether there had been any infringement of the Health Insurance Act. However, in this regard the Government has introduced a Bill to amend the Health Insurance Act, which will make accountable practitioners, who initiate pathology services, as to whether the services are reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of their patients. This accountability will be to a group of their professional colleagues on a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry. Where the Committee finds that a practitioner has initiated excessive services it may recommend that the practitioner be reprimanded and/or the medical benefits paid for the services identified as excessive, will be re-paid by the practitioner either to the Commonwealth or the private health fund as appropriate. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Prior to 1974 a significant number of official offices had been closed on Saturdays and the Saturday trading hours of others had been reduced in accordance with a lower level of customer demand. Closure of all official post offices on Saturdays resulted from direct action in 1974 by certain staff organisations which instructed their members (including counter staff) not to attend for overtime duty on Saturdays. Until that time, counter staff completed their weekly hours over the five days, Monday to Friday, and were rostered on overtime in order to provide counter services on Saturdays. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Negotiations with staff organisations to re-open some official post offices on Saturday mornings were not successful. Studies showed that it was not practicable to provide counter services on Saturdays under any acceptable rostering arrangement whereby the Saturday duty could be regarded as normal duty with time off in lieu during the week. </para>
          <para>Additionally, cost benefit analyses have been made on the re-opening on Saturday mornings of those official post offices which, prior to 1974, did provide a Saturday service. On the basis of providing a counter service only, costs (at current prices) would be to the order of $4.8 million a year. At many of the offices, the costs involved would not be justified by the service demand, and overall, it is most unlikely that any significant additional revenue would be earned. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Recent surveys have indicated low demand for Saturday counter services at many non-official post offices that do provide services on Saturdays. Based on these surveys and for the economic reasons given in (1), the reintroduction of services at official post offices on Saturdays is unlikely. Postal services continue to be provided at those non-official post offices where there is a reasonably high demand for counter services on Saturdays. </para>

              <para>1 ) Nominations for the addition of goods to Schedule A of NAFTA are received and exchanged by both Governments on a regular basis. In Australia the Department of Overseas Trade is primarily responsible for the preliminary examination of such nominations, in close consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce and Primary Industry depending on the nature of the goods under consideration. Acting on the advice of the relevant Department that, on a prima facie basis, inclusion of the goods in Schedule A would not be detrimental to the particular local industry, and provided the nomination is acceptable to the New Zealand Government, the proposal is widely advertised in both countries. In Australia an advertisement giving notice of nominations under consideration is placed in all the major daily newspapers and a considerable number of industry associations, lobby groups and interested individuals receive a circularised notification of the proposals. Interested parties have a period of 60 days within which they may comment either in support of or in opposition to the nominations. In the event that objections to particular nominations are substantiated, by reference to the Industries Assistance Commission, if necessary, the goods are not added to the Schedule. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>As outlined above considerable efforts are made by several Government Departments to acquaint interested parties with proposals for the addition of goods to Schedule A of NAFTA. The procedures currently followed have been in operation since the Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1966 and the method of notification of proposals is consistent with that normally adopted in similar circumstances by other Government Departments and agencies. While the Departments concerned endeavour to directly contact known industry organisations, it is not always possible to ensure that every interested party is consulted in this way. However, all nominations are subject to public scrutiny for two months and it is considered this provides ample opportunity for comment. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>In view of the fact that mushrooms are already traded duty free between Australia and New Zealand, it was not expected that inclusion of the goods in Schedule A would be detrimental to the local industry. The proposal to include fresh mushrooms in Schedule A of NAFTA was publicly notified on 17 March 1977. Subsequently, the Secretary of the Australian Mushroom Growers&#39; Association has had frequent contact with officers of the Department of Overseas Trade and, as a result of these discussions, the inclusion of fresh mushrooms in Schedule A has been deferred. In accordance with normal procedure it is proposed that a reference will be made to the Industries Assistance Commission for enquiry and report as to whether the inclusion in Schedule A of these goods would be detrimental to the Australian industry. </para>
