          <para class="block">Australian governments since the war have maintained an unbroken and unqualified commitment to the goal of full employment. This was more than an economic policy; it was a commitment to 2 great and enduring ideals- the ideal of individual security and the ideal of growing national prosperity and development. At the heart of that policy was a belief by successive governments, whatever their political affiliation, in the right of all Australians to a decent job and a decent standard of living. The architects of that policy- the wartime and post-war Federal Labor governments- enshrined full employment as a fundamental and continuing objective for governments. Even in periods of recession and economic difficulty- indeed, especially in such times- successive governments saw their first priority and overriding duty as the preservation of the livelihoods of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>The Fraser Government has abandoned that commitment. It is the first government in Australia&#39;s post-war history to do so. It has jettisoned an objective of all national governments in all modern industrial societies. Nowhere in the speeches or utterances of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> or his followers is there a firm and unqualified pledge to maintain full employment. Far from seeking to restore full employment, the Fraser Government&#39;s policies are designed to put people out of work. After 1 8 months of the Fraser Government, 18 months of bungling and mismanagement, 18 months of lies, deceptions and broken promises, it has come to this: Australia has the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. And month by month, week by week, day by day, the underlying crisis is deepening. </para>
          <para>The scale of this social and human disaster- a disaster almost unprecedented in Australian terms and unlike anything the vast majority of our people have experienced- can be measured by the deteriorating unemployment statistics under the Fraser Government. Eleven months have passed of the first full financial year since the Fraser Government came to power. The results are clear. Unemployment under this Government has increased by 3 1 per cent. It is much worse today than it was a year ago. In his Budget Speech last August the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There will be a gradual reduction in unemployment, although little of this will be experienced in the course of this calendar year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was the Treasurer&#39;s promise, his considered and expert judgment in his Budget Speech. Like all the Government&#39;s promises on the economy, his statement fell far short of a commitment to full employment in principle: Nevertheless it was a promise. And that promise has been broken. Statement No. 2 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech predicted a 2 per cent growth in the work force and a growth in employment &#39;of the order of one to 2 per cent for the year as a whole&#39;. That was an official admission that unemployment would get worse- and indeed it has. There has been no &#39;gradual reduction in unemployment&#39;, as the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech; there has been a rapid increase, and the underlying level is still increasing. </para>
          <para>By every possible means, by every strategem and deception, the Government has sought to confuse the figures and to conceal the havoc it has wrought. It has abolished the seasonally adjusted statistics; it has stood over the Commonwealth Employment Service to get its figures down to &#39;rock bottom&#39;; it has scrapped whole categories of people, including many Aboriginals, from the lists of unemployed; it has used every means of persuasion or coercion to discourage the unemployed from registering for benefits; it is breaking the law, it is defying the High Court, by refusing benefits to people who have challenged its heartless and vindictive policies. Yet the figures still speak for themselves. They condemn the Treasurer; they condemn the Government. At the end of January this year the number of people unemployed was 354 589- that is 5.8 per cent. In raw terms, unemployment between the end of October 1 975 and the end of last January rose by 107 000-43 percent- under the Treasurer&#39;s administration. </para>
          <para>There has been no significant decline in the first months of this year. Instead of the usual improvement in the months after Christmas, the situation is virtually unchanged. At the end of February, the percentage of the work force unemployed was 5.7; at the end of February last year it had been 5 per cent. At the end of March this year it was 5.4 per cent; a year before it had been 4.3 per cent. At the end of April this year it was 5.2 per cent; at the end of April last year it had been 4.4 per cent. In every month, therefore, the figures have deteriorated. The peaks normally evident when school leavers are seeking work are now a permanent plateau. They are evidence of a chronic and continuing malaise. The Fraser Government has ensured that unemployment is no longer a problem but a way of life in Australia- a growing cancer in the nation&#39;s economy. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer cannot wriggle away from the responsibility for our national crisis by blaming the Labor Government. That excuse will not wash; the people are sick of it. Everyone knows that unemployment in Australia increased between 1972 and 1975 when the world was gripped by recession. But it increased in that time in every major western country. Between the end of 1972 and the end of 1975 in every Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development country unemployment had increased. It increased between those dates in Germany, in Britain, in the United States of America, in New Zealand, in Canada and in Japan. It certainly increased in Australia. But it increased in every OECD country in those years. No one in those countries, no one aware of the trends in neighbouring countries, saw their problem as unique or exceptional. It may be that, in Australia, people thought this was singular to Australia. But if one was in the United States one knew the same problem occurred in Canada under a different sort of administration. If one was in France, one knew it occurred in Germany under a different sort of administration. Everyone in the OECD countries saw the unemployment position deteriorating from the end of 1972 to the end of 1975. </para>
          <para>The great difference, however, between Australia and the other OECD countries, and the great indictment of the Treasurer and the Fraser Government is this: Unemployment under this Government has got steadily worse while in other western countries it has got steadily better. The OECD statistics for unemployment between March 1976 and March 1977 show that Australia&#39;s unemployment record under this Government was worse than that of any other country save Canada. In most western countries the level of unemployment has fallen in the past year. In Australia it has risen. In the United States it fell from 8. 1 per cent to 7.9 per cent; in New Zealand from 5.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent; in Germany from 5.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent; in Japan from 2.4 per cent to 2.2 per cent. In Australia alone it has increased- from 4.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent. It has increased in Australia because the Fraser Government, alone among the nations of the industrialised world, is cutting back on national or Federal expenditure and public sector programs. Unemployment, falling in the early months of last year under the impact of the Hayden Budget, promptly took off again when the Treasurer began his disastrous reductions in Federal works programs and his disastrous reductions in federal outlays to the States and local government. </para>
          <para>Let it never be forgotten that Labor&#39;s policies were reducing unemployment from the high levels of the international recession. Under the impact of the Hayden Budget unemployment was declining towards the end of 1975 and in the first months of 1976. In February last year, as a result of Labor&#39;s policies, it fell by 40 200. The Government had every opportunity to pursue and strengthen that recovery. After the March figures were published this year the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> admitted: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No one can get any joy from the end-of-March unemployment figures which are less favourable than this time last year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of the April figures he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There was a further weakening of the labour market last month. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How many more weakenings are there going to be? The Minister has admitted that the figures have worsened under the Fraser Government, that the Treasurer&#39;s policies have failed, that the Budget last August was misconceived and was wholly inadequate as a strategy to deal with recession. It was a document designed to put people out of work and in that respect alone the Budget has achieved its purpose. The Treasurer can squirm and protest as much as he likes but he cannot dodge the figures. He cannot explain away the destruction of jobs and the wrecking of human lives and opportunities under his Government&#39;s policies. The Statistician&#39;s figures are just as damning as those of the Commonwealth Employment Service which I have been quoting up to this stage. The Statistician&#39;s figures tell the same story. According to the Statistician, unemployment in February was 5.3 per cent of the work force. Moreover, the average duration of unemployment has increased under this Government. In November 1975 the average duration of unemployment was 13 weeks. By November last year it had increased to 1 7.6 weeks. According to the Statistician, more than one third of the people unemployed during 1976 had been out of work for 6 weeks or more. Unemployment under this Government is not only afflicting more people; it is afflicting them longer. </para>
          <para>The crisis for young people is an economic disaster and a human tragedy of a kind we have never experienced. Australia&#39;s youth are the first and most vulnerable targets of the Treasurer&#39;s policies. In October 1975 there were 8127 unemployed school leavers. In October 1976, after 1 1 <inline font-style="italic">lh</inline> months of Fraser Government, there were 1 1 238, an increase of 38 per cent. By January this year 54 937 school leavers were registeredthe highest total ever recorded- and the figures would have been higher but for the Government&#39;s decision to deny income support to school leavers who could not find work. If we take all people under 2 1 years of age the number out of work at the end of January was 156 000- that is 26 000 more than a year before. According to the Statistician, one in every 6 young people in the labour force was unemployed in February. Of those between 15 and 19 years, more than a third- 33.9 per cent precisely- had been unemployed at some time during 1976. More than a third of Australia&#39;s youth- the best educated generation Australia has produced- have tasted the futility, the hopelessness, the social rejection and personal humiliation of unemployment. </para>
          <para class="block">They have suffered from this Government &#39;s policies and will bear the marks of that experience for the rest of their lives. </para>
          <para>In rural and outer suburban areas the plight of young people is even more <inline font-style="italic">serious.</inline> In the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne unemployment levels of 40per cent among young people are common. The average rate among youth is just under 17 per cent. In the Liverpool CES district in my electorate, over 58 per cent of the unemployed in February were juniors with little prospect of gaining work in the near future. The report of the Study Group on Youth Affairs commissioned by the Government and tabled on 24 February states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Youth unemployment was regarded as the most pressing problem affecting young people in all areas visited. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The figures show that the highest unemployment in the Western world is in the western suburbs of Australia&#39;s largest city. Nor are young people the only victims. Women, migrants and Aboriginals are all among the first to be retrenched and the last to be employed under the Fraser-Lynch recession. Between October 1975 and March of this year Aboriginal unemployment increased by 46 per cent-from over 8000 to over 12 000. In March, when there is usually a decline in the number of Aboriginals registered for employment, the number this year actually increaseddespite the fact that the Government threatened to withhold benefits from Aboriginals in remote areas unless they left their traditional homes and went to live in towns where no work was available for them. </para>
          <para>The cost of this tragedy in economic and human terms is immeasurable. Some idea of the misery entailed can be found in recent reports and studies on the emotional and physical sideeffects of unemployment. The Australian Government Inquiry into Poverty commissioned a report which showed that one-fifth of unemployed people surveyed had convictions for criminal offences. Surveys by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, by social workers and by governments abroad show beyond doubt that unemployment is the first step in a cycle of personal and family breakdown that can lead to intractable social problems. The Government ignores these findings and brands the unemployed as loafers and misfits. The figures give the lie to the Government&#39;s propaganda that work is available for the unemployed if only they would bother to look for it. At the end of April there were 21 000 unfilled vacancies for the 290 000 unemployed- one job for every 14 people seeking work. And among those seeking work are many of the best qualified and best trained graduates of our universities and tertiary institutionsmen and women whose valued skills are lost to the community. If last year&#39;s graduates are still without work, what hope have thousands of others who will be seeking work in a few months time. </para>
          <para>Finding jobs for the victims of the Treasurer&#39;s incompetence can never be considered a cost or a burden on society. It is unemployment that takes the real toll- in waste, in lost production, in lost revenues, in direct and indirect costs that the community has to pay. The Government is blind to all evidence that its high unemployment policies are damaging human lives and setting back recovery. To run the Australian economy with an unemployment rate of 2.5 per cent means a loss of at least $ 1,000m in annual output. At the current level of unemployment, that is, in excess of 5 per cent, the cost to the economy in lost production must conservatively be set as being at least $2,000m. Much of this lost production would have flowed back to the Government in taxation revenue; the direct costs of income support schemes would be relieved. A recent survey of European Economic Community countries, commissioned by the Community&#39;s Directorate of Social Affairs, provided a striking measure of the public sector costs of unemployment. After examining the contribution to government revenue which an employee makes through direct and indirect taxes, and the savings in unemployment benefits, the survey concluded: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In Britain government expenditure of up to 90 per cent of average earnings of industrial workers to enable people to work rather than be unemployed would lead not to a increase but a reduction in the budget deficit. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, an unemployed man, as soon as he became employed, would generate government revenue in excess of 90 per cent of his earnings. Other EEC countries reported increases in government revenue greater than the employed man&#39;s earnings. The Australian Government must shift resources away from income maintenance for the unemployed to the generation of new employment opportunities and manpower policies if the tragic costs of unemployment are to be relieved. </para>
          <para>The Government, always ready to blame the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for our economic problems, is still peddling the line that wage increases are causing unemployment. Only yesterday the Treasurer twice told us that the Commission&#39;s wage judgments had put more people out of work. The cynicism and dishonesty of the Government&#39;s attacks on the Commission are without precedent in our national life. If reducing real wages and living standards were the answer to our problems, unemployment by now would be well and truly cured. The truth is that, while real wages have fallen under this Government, unemployment has risen. The fallacy in the Government&#39;s policy has been thoroughly exposed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission itself. It has reached its findings on evidence put before it by all the partiesincluding the Government. </para>
          <para>In his statement on 31 March the  President  of the Commission was quite clear about the relation between wage levels and recovery- and by recovery&#39; the  President  and the Commission meant, as most rational people would understand the word, the restoration of jobs, consumption and productivity. The  President  of the Commission said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On the material before us, it is not clear that a reduction in real wages without immediate compensatory action from other sources will provide a stimulus for recovery. A reduction in consumption spending with further deterioration in economic activity could ensue. A further point to consider is the increased risk in these circumstances of a breakdown in our indexation package, which could add to inflation and discourage spending even more. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government offers a brutal and simplistic justification for its high unemployment policy. It seeks to persuade the Australian people that by throwing men and women out of work all our economic problems will be cured. There is no evidence that this is happening. Even if there were, a policy that subordinates jobs and individual welfare to corporate profits and investors &#39; dividends is an inhuman policy. It should be morally unacceptable to any Australian government, and no government but this would have entertained it. </para>
          <para>The people are being told: &#39;Your jobs are not important. Your family&#39;s security and happiness are not important. Your children&#39;s future is not important. Go without jobs, go without incomes, go without a fair and humane system of unemployment relief, and some time, somehow, some day, inflation and recession and industrial stagnation will be overcome&#39;. Where is the evidence for this? Inflation is still running at more than 12 per cent a year, devaluation will make it worse, and the Government&#39;s attack on disposable incomes has reduced the demand for goods and services. What sort of economic recovery is it that requires hundreds of thousands of Australians to go without work and to sacrifice their dignity and self-respect and the welfare of their families? Only the Fraser Government- only a government with the narrow and twisted conception of recovery which this Government espouses- would consider such a policy for a moment. </para>
          <para>My colleague the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> will outline in this debate some specific measures the Government should take at once to head off our developing unemployment crisis. Those measures flow naturally from our policies in government and the economic proposals the Labor Parry has put forward since the Budget last August. In the short term there must be no further delay in developing realistic and worthwhile job-creation and manower schemes. The Fraser Government&#39;s grabag of schemes and incentives has been worthless. Its community youth support scheme provides no employment opportunities at all for young people. It attempts to assist young people to find jobs that are not there. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s only other substantial response to the unemployment problem was the special youth employment training program which has assisted some 6200 young people out of the estimated 120 000 young people out of work. The Government has in fact reduced expenditure on employment assistance and job creation programs. In notes attached to Appropriation Bills (No. 3) and (No. 4), introduced in April, the Department of Finance announced that the Government had saved $10m on the National Employment and Training scheme this financial year. Why was this money not redirected to the special youth employment training scheme so that some of the thousands of unemployed young people could be provided with employment? The 1976-77 Budget reduced expenditure on unemployment relief grants, structural adjustment assistance and the Regional Employment Development scheme by $160m. That is the measure of the Government&#39;s concern for the unemployed. It is ignoring manpower programs that will reduce short term unemployment and attack the long term problem of structural unemployment. </para>
          <para>When unemployment in February reached its highest level since the Great Depression the Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Robinson)</inline> informed us that unemployment was a myth. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations informed us that unemployment was stable. The Treasurer himself informed us that unemployment had nothing to do with economic recovery and that the figures did not matter. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Unemployment data are never among the leading indicators of economic recovery. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask the House to reflect on those words. Certainly under the Fraser Government unemployment data give no sign of recovery, but what are we to think of a Treasurer who pretends that recovery is possible, and indeed is happening, while unemployment is getting worse? The Treasurer&#39;s bewilderment and desperation with the state of the economy have led him in to a realm of metaphysics and obscurantism beyond the reach of rational argument. Recovery means higher unemployment! Reducing real wages will lead to greater consumption! Black means white! </para>
          <para>No one in the Labor Party pretends that our unemployment crisis is other than difficult and deep-seated, or denies that the long term solutions will involve quite drastic approaches to the structural nature of the work force and our industries. There are no easy answers. Our structural problems, like the high social costs of our run down and inefficient community services, are in large part the legacy of decades of conservative neglect and the failure to come to grips with problems that have now become urgent. No government, however, can callously and deliberately encourage unemployment as the Fraser Government has done. No government can ignore the immediate challenge it poses to human welfare. No government can abrogate its responsibility to Australia&#39;s youth- to the coming generation. </para>
          <para>For the unemployed, especially for the young, the Government offers neither sympathy nor hope. Many of us know, and others can remember, the feelings of an earlier generation of Australians who lived through the Great Depression. It was a trauma that haunted them for the rest of their lives. Will the new generation of Australians be condemned to a similar fate? <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a result of this Government&#39;s policies, thousands of young Australians, whose lives have been blighted by the treatment this Government has given them, will forever be suspicious of our system and resentful of our institutions. For the rest of this century a growing body of people, alienated and without hope, largely identifiable by age or race or region, will nurse their rankling memories of social rejection and personal disillusionment. </para>
          <para>The deliberate promotion of unemployment by the Fraser Government is not only adding to our economic problems and damaging the process of recovery but also destroying an essential part of the fabric of our national life. It is ensuring that large scale unemployment remains endemic in our work force and a permanent feature in the experience of our people. Without firm and committed policies to create jobs and restore employment, the Fraser Government will be sowing the seeds of permanent misery, of deep division and disunity, of destructive and perhaps ungovernable forces in Australia&#39;s national life. </para>

            <para>- I second the motion. The Australian economy is in the grip of a paralysing recession. That recession has been aggravated by and prolonged through the unwise, ill-considered policies of the Government. This year, after some 18 months of conservative coalition government, the condition of the economy has worsened. Inflation, which was starting to come down in 1975, has now become intractable. Inflation for this fiscal year will be no lower than and, conceivably, higher than when the Government came into office. The recession is deeper and more depressing. Industrial output remains erratic and uncertain. The motor vehicle industry has slumped badly. The home building industry has contracted sharply. Retail sales in real terms fell some 3 per cent for the year to April. New capital expenditure for the March quarter was nearly 3 per cent down in real terms on the same period last year. Overtime worked is as low as it was last year and last year it was at an extremely low level. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the face of these ominous indicators, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> persists in assuring us that the economy is strengthening. He implies that the best way of making it stronger is by belting it harder. He is out of touch with economic reality just as he is out of his depth with economic management. The economic fantasies of the Treasurer can be no substitute for remedies for the forbidding economic conditions of the present. The Associated Chambers of Manufacturers of Australia and Bank of New South Wales quarterly survey of industrial trends, released towards the end of March, reported that manufacturers expected no improvement in the economy over the succeeding 6 months. Further reductions in unemployment were expected. Towards the end of April prominent Melbourne stockbroker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> C. Goode, expressed bis irritation with the Government&#39;s economic incompetence by publicly complaining that the Government&#39;s severe restraints were stifling the economy. Less than 6 weeks ago the Australian Chamber of Commerce and National Bank quarterly survey of business reported a set back to trading and profit results for Australian companies during the March quarter. There was a 19 per cent drop in the number of companies surveyed reporting good or satisfactory trading results and a 24 per cent fall in the number recording good or satisfactory profits. A month ago, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research forecast worsening unemployment and inflation and expressed concern about the health and direction of the economy. </para>
          <para>On 27 November 1975, the now Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said in his policy speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was a cruel, ironical quirk. Since then the Government has been busily spearing the economy head first into the ground. The result is economic stagnation at a lower level of depression. Now is not the time for more of the same bitter economic brew that has done too much damage already. Unemployment in this country is too high. Tens of thousands of people are avoidably and unnecessarily out of work. More of the same ill-conceived economic measures will unnecessarily prolong and aggravate the unemployment problem. Now is the time for careful budgetary stimulation to selected areas of the economy to relieve the social and economic stresses so unremittingly applied to our society and its people by the clumsy economic tactics of the Government. The Government has to intervene to moderate the social and economic pain and disruption its policies are unnecessarily causing. </para>
          <para>We are all as concerned as the Government is about inflation but we are not as indifferent or as blank as the Government is to the unnecessary and avoidable consequences of many of its actions. With the high level of idle human and physical resources available in certain sectors of the economy, such as the construction industry, in its broad definition, careful stimulation can be selectively directed into the economy without fuelling inflation. Furthermore, the more employment opportunities generated, the more money will be spent by consumers; in turn, the healthier demand- measured by sales activitywill become, and, accordingly, the better business conditions will be. The less unemployment comes down, the less this will happen. </para>
          <para>Again, if we wait for market forces to provide the momentum to scrub out unemployment, we are in for an inordinately long and depressing wait. If there is to be any recovery in that way then increased demand would be met by using idle capacity in industry and working employees overtime before extra employment would be created. Capacity utilisation in industry is only 79 per cent and expected to fall, and overtime at 2.5 hours per employee in March is down nearly 40 per cent on the level for the comparable month of 3 years ago. It will be an extremely laggardly, hesitant recovery that has to depend on a depressed, stifled economy, wracked by massive unemployment, to generate any appreciable increase in aggregate demand. </para>
          <para>The post-war record levels of unemployment for each month of this year are a national disgrace. Not only that, the inequitable way in which unemployment is distributed between various groups is neither moral nor tolerable. Unemployment disadvantages the young more than the rest of the work force. Young females are disadvantaged more than young males. Young migrants are disadvantaged more than other young members of the work force. Women suffer the burden of unemployment more than men. The unskilled, the semi-skilled, clerical and administrative employees suffer a disproportionate unemployment rate. The Aboriginals fare worst of all. </para>
          <para>For instance, juniors are 39 per cent of the unemployed, but are only 12 per cent of the civilian work force. The unemployment rate among juniors is 15 per cent against a national rate of 5.2 per cent- that is, 3 times worse than for the community overall. There were 29 unemployed juniors for each unfilled vacancy against 15 unemployed for each unfilled vacancy nationally. In other words, competition for jobs among juniors is twice as tough as for the community overall. The unemployment rate among young females is 20 per cent greater than among young males. Unemployment among young migrants is nearly 17 per cent higher than among young Australian-born members of the work force. The rate of unemployment among women is nearly 70 per cent higher than among men. </para>
          <para>The most dreadful level of unemployment wracks the Aboriginal work force- 50 per cent! Every second Aboriginal worker is unemployed! That is a national scandal. The unfair, unjust way in which the burden of unemployment is distributed should be regarded as an outrage. Members of the Government, like cowards sheltering behind falsehoods, blame it onto &#39;dole bludgers&#39;. </para>
          <para>I concede that there is always a margin- a thin one- of the population who will abuse any public benefit. That does not explain an unemployment level of over 323 000 people-a level of unemployment 20 per cent higher than for the same month of last year and higher than that again for the same month of the preceding year. The unemployed are the casualties of the Government&#39;s heavy cannonading of the economy. Cynical superficialities will not drive out the hard facts that unemployment is becoming more deep seated, more long term. For instance, 72 per cent of the unemployed were in receipt of unemployment benefits in March this year, compared to 58 per cent in March 1975. </para>
          <para>Let us look at it from a different direction. More than every second person unemployed has been unemployed for 2 months or more. Every fifth person unemployed has been unemployed for half a year or more. That means that hard core, long-term unemployment is becoming chronic. The situation is worse now than for any other time in the 1970s. The evidence is that the blight will get worse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which illustrates the points I have been making. </para>

              <para>- Mysteriously, the work force is static after 18 months of conservative coalition government. No new jobs have been created by the Government but it has achieved record unemployment. The Government has succeeded in being a failure. It is a dreadful failure where there is a desperate need for it to be successful, in handling the economy, getting business going, winding down inflation and cutting back unemployment. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us look at the mysterious loss of work force numbers. In January 1976 there were 4 738 500 civilian employees, according to the seasonally adjusted index of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In March 1977 the figure was 4 730 100; that is, the civilian work force contracted by some 8500 people in an 18-month period when it would have been expected reasonably to have expanded by nearly 3 per cent or some 140 000. Somehow the Government has managed to lose the equivalent of about 2.3 per cent of the total labour force. In other words, unemployment is far more serious than the official statisitics disclose. Real unemployment would appear to be of the order of well over 7 per cent and nudging 7.5 per cent. That is a disgraceful situation. There is no need for such an extraordinary high level of unemployment. </para>
          <para>Unemployment is now higher than it was when the Government came to office but inflation has not abated below the level applying when the Government entered office. This is a shocking record of greater sacrifice imposed on the community without achieving any progress in managing the economy. But then, as has been observed so often before, the Prime Minister believes life is not meant to be easy- or, as he would put it another way, sacrifice is ennobling for the soul, provided it is made by someone else. I understand he wants to give even greater lustre to that virtue by reducing or at least not increasing unemployment benefits. So, between Government abuse of the unemployed as bludgers&#39; and efforts directed at reducing their living standards by squeezing their income from benefits, the hapless victims of the Government&#39;s economic severity find that they are treated like felons. Surely this is the only time that innocent victims have been treated as though they were knowing and wilful offenders. </para>
          <para>In spite of the contracted, sluggish state of the economy and the obvious undesirability of contracting it further, the Government is clearly charting a course of more austerity. The Prime Minister says the next Budget will be a no growth budget. He also confesses that additional costs of $ 1,000m are to be met from within that Budget, that is, for commitments entered into in the last Budget but to be paid for in the forthcoming Budget. So it is not a no growth budget for many of the established programs included within it. It will represent a severe contraction in real terms for many of those established programs. But it is even tougher than that. The Government is aiming for a Budget deficit of $ 1,500m as its preferred option. It cannot possibly do that without belting the economy through the floor. It is more likely to settle out of necessity for a deficit of somewhere near $2, 000m, according to informed sources&#39; advising the media. In short, the no growth Budget is converted into an instrument of severe and damaging contraction. </para>
          <para>Within the range of parameters mentioned, the Government is considering, first, a cut back of $ 1,000m in existing programs with a deficit of about $2,900m. That would be a Budget with no aggregate real growth in outlays or receipts. Alternatively it is considering cuts of between $ 1,870m and $2,370m, that is, with deficits within the range of $2,000m to $ 1,500m and with no aggregate real growth in outlays or receipts. In any instance, even with the mildest of the 3 possibilities, the consequences are forbidding. Unemployment as severe as it has been, would become rampant. Business activity would falter and collapse. The social and economic consequences would be shattering. </para>
          <para>Seeking to reduce the level of cuts in existing programs by increasing revenue solves nothing. Increased personal taxes mean less disposable income. That means even feebler consumer demand and, in turn, weaker business activity. Increased indirect taxes and government charges will reduce consumer spending power and aggravate inflation. The consequences of more economic primitivism from the Prime Minister and his clockwork Treasurer- of more economic contraction- will have most undesirable consequences, socially as well as economically. </para>
          <para>The next Budget should provide for mild, carefully selected and regulated expansion. A community employment creation program providing jobs for the unemployed on projects of lasting social benefit ought to be initiated. A substantial number of jobs can be generated relatively quickly in this way. After about 9 months&#39; operation the Regional Employment Development scheme was employing 3 1 000 people. With second and third round effects, many more jobs could have been created and a greater level of business activity sustained than would have otherwise been the case. The peak cost of the scheme was $ 1 23m in 1 975-76. </para>
          <para>It is far better to create meaningful employment of real and lasting benefit to the community in this way than to have people living on unemployment benefits and denied the opportunity of productively contributing to the community. Similarly, it is preferable to generate jobs and support the private sector by mild budgetary expansion in support, for example, of the construction industry. We can get a fairly accurate costing of such a program for 1976-77 by using figures quoted by the Treasurer in the House on Monday, assuming a full year experience and using this to illustrate the point. The Treasurer said that, with a job creation program providing a maximum of 50 000 jobs in the course of a year, the savings on unemployment benefits would be $75m. That means he has based his calculations on an annual average job creation level of about 26 000 jobs. In turn, using average weekly earnings which would tend to exaggerate the total cost, and assuming a 50-50 break up in costs between labour and other resources on average, one can estimate a total cost of some $540m in a full year to provide up to 50 000 jobs. </para>
          <para>That is, on the Treasurer&#39;s figures, the cost of providing such a large number of jobs would be nearly $300m less than the figure I had on an earlier occasion this week suggested as a result of quite cautious and conservative calculations. As against that, there would be personal tax revenues generated and unemployment benefits saved, as a result of these extra jobs, of $50m and $75m respectively. In other words, for a little over $400m net, 50 000 jobs could be created in the course of a year. Allowing for the momentum that would inject into the economy, there would be jobs for more than 50 000 people because one could reasonably expect that a turnover would take place as mild expansion occurred and additional job opportunities were created through second and third round effects in other parts of the economy. In the process, socially and economically valuable output could be provided for the community. </para>
          <para>In short, nearly 1 per cent of the unemployment could be eliminated. As against that a recent Committee of Economic Development of Australia survey disclosed that a 10 per cent increase in sales would only result in a 2 per cent increase in employment among manufacturers surveyed. That is because extra demand would be met from overtime, surplus capacity stocks, and so on without the need for much in the way of extra staff. To the extent that this can be extrapolated across the manufacturing sector- and it can only be done in a very rough and generalised way to give a guideline- it means that a 10 per cent real increase in sales would generate less than a couple of thousand jobs. </para>
          <para>In short, in the absence of Government intervention, any recovery will be long, slow and painful. It is the firm commitment of the Opposition that there ought to be immediate Government intervention of the nature which I have indicated today and of the nature which the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> has indicated in greater detail on earlier occasions. </para>
          <para>The absence of Government intervention unnecessarily condemns tens of thousands of Australians to the social distress and personal humiliation of unemployment. Its absence deprives </para>
          <para class="block">Australia of the added output services and the benefit of projects of lasting social value. Its absence is a prodigal waste of output potential. By careful selection and by responsible fiscal and physical administration of such a program there would be no fueling of further inflation. The Government&#39;s failure to adopt such a responsible course is evidence that it shirks its responsibilities to business, the unemployed and the nation. For that it deserves the strictest condemnation of this House and of the community. </para>

I say without any shadow of a doubt that it is a cynical, hypocritical, humbug motion which has been moved on this occasion in an attempt to show a sense of unity between 2 clearly disunified sides of the Opposition. It was moved by a man who, as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> has made clear in its editorial this morning, can lay no claim to a vote of confidence. He squeaked home by the narrowest possible margin. The honourable gentleman talks about confidence in the House and outside it, but it would be fair to say that the confidence of the Opposition in him was shown by only one vote, his own vote. </para>

Let us look at where the onus in this debate ought to lie.

          <para>I want to do a number of things in this debate. Firstly I shall look at the record, then put on the table the achievements of this Government, then analyse the problem of unemployment and point out where responsibility for that problem lies. Let us look at broken promises. The honourable gentleman who yesterday won by one or two votes is a man discredited in the history of this country as the Prime Minister who broke more promises than did any other man who held that office. I really do not need to weary the House with the sordid story of the loans scandal. What an irony it is for the honourable gentleman to make in this motion some reference to the High Court. The honourable gentleman knows that in a secret cabal a few Ministers set out to destroy and show contempt for law and order in this country. The honourable gentleman knows that very well indeed. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable gentleman for the point of order which he has taken. By inference, one is never quite sure what it is that he is saying about the Leader of the Opposition. I know what may be said privately by many members on the other side. I will leave the point at that. I think that all members of this House know precisely what the position is, and if any members on the Opposition side ever want to know the full facts and have them paraded let them ask me as Treasurer to put on the table the files relating to that question. We on this side of the House have nothing to hide, and if the Opposition has any inquiry to make about it let it front up a question in the House to me saying: &#39;Put the files on the table.&#39; </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I want to talk first of all about the broken promises of the former Prime Minister. What did he say in his 1 972 policy speech? He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The most pressing need in the tax field is to retard the trend by which inflation has forced lower and middle income earners into high tax brackets. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was the promise. Let me ask: What was the performance? His Government increased income tax receipts by 89 per cent in its first 2 Budgets and repudiated the indexation of personal income tax, in spite of the fact that the inquiry it had set up to look at the matter specifically recommended indexation. The Leader of the Opposition said in his 1974 policy speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I see no reason why taxes, direct or indirect, need to be increased in order to pay for any of our continuing commitments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the 1974-75 Budget there were substantial increases in an extensive range of taxes, including a surcharge on unearned income. In Labor&#39;s last Budget there were massive increases in postal charges and duties on beer, spirits and tobacco, as well as new taxes on petroleum, and a coal export levy. Let me also remind the Leader of the Opposition of his promise in 1972, stated in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Labor&#39;s first priority will be to restore genuine full employment- without qualification, without hedging. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As this House is well aware, the rate of unemployment reached 5.6 per cent of the work force at the end of December 1975, compared with the average rate of unemployment between 1963 and 1972 of 1.3 per cent. Time after time after time, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> and 50 per cent of the Labor Party in this House are well aware, the former Prime Minister broke promise after promise, discredited statement after statement, and for that reason he is no longer regarded by his own colleagues or the people of this country as a credible figure in the Australian Labor Party. I remind the honourable gentleman of what he said in his 1974 policy speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Price increases are now slowing down as government policies take full effect. This trend will be continued in coming months. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If one looks at the record one finds that inflation at the end of 1 975 was running at an annual rate of 14 per cent, or 16.4 per cent if the impact of Medibank is excluded, compared with the annual rate of 4.5 per cent at the end of 1972. The Leader of the Opposition promised at the June 1974 Premiers Conference that he would slow the rate of increase in government spending, and then proceeded to endorse the 1974-75 Budget, which resulted in an increase of 46 per cent in government outlays. The Leader of the Opposition promised economic growth of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent in each of his 3 years in office. The fact is that gross non-farm product in the December quarter of 1975, seasonally adjusted and at constant prices, was still 2 per cent below its peak level recorded 2 years earlier. </para>
          <para>Apart from what the Leader of the Opposition said in this debate about promises, we also had the &#39;economic rationalist&#39; the honourable member for Oxley, who had the gall, the cheek, the hide to talk in this House about economic management. Let us have a quick look at his personal record. Let me remind the people at large that that honourable gentleman brought down a Budget with an estimated deficit of $2.8 billion, which by January was expected to run out at $4.7 billion. That is his record of economic management. In August last year we said that the deficit would be $2.6 billion. It will run out on the track of that figure when the final information is available at the end of June. The honourable member for Oxley based his Budget on an increase of 5 per cent in real gross non-farm product. The result of his economic mismanagement was in fact an increase of only 1.1 per cent. We said in August last year that it would be 4 per cent. I maintain that the strategy is on line with that expectation. The honourable member for Oxley talked about a monetary policy which would not be fully accommodating to inflation. We came into office when monetary growth was at an annual rate of around 20 per cent, grossly accommodating to inflation. That was towards the end of 1975. 1 remind the honourable gentleman of what he said about speculation in relation to devaluation. The honourable gentleman, like the Leader of the Opposition, has a record in this House of irresponsibility. Looking at his record, I am prepared to match against it what we have done, point by point, chapter and verse. </para>
          <para>The economic policy issued by the Opposition earlier this year would bring about a sharp increase in inflation and a slump in business activity, and would lead inevitably to further unemployment. I remind the House of what the honourable member for Adelaide said about the Opposition&#39;s economic policy: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The danger in Labor&#39;s approach is the possibility of intensified pressure of demand, leading to  further  prolonging of inflation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would go on to say: &#39;And leading to the further loss of job opportunities.&#39; The Opposition has a policy which makes no reference to wages at all. I can assume only that full wage indexation as set out in the so-called Whitlam 5-point plan of 14 October last remains as ALP policy in this area. One never knows what the policy of the Australian Labor Party is. There was the Whitlam plan in October of last year. There was the Hurford plan in the earlier months of this year. Recently there was the Hayden plan. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, re-established in his position, confirmed himself as yesterday&#39;s man by going back to precisely the policy that he pursued in such disastrous terms between 1972 and 1975. </para>
          <para>This is an Opposition which has confirmed its commitment to abolishing the investment allowance and indicated that it would reduce the depreciation allowances available to business. There is no doubt that that would lead to a massive slump in business confidence and investment spending, thereby killing off economic recovery at the present time. The Labor Party policy abandons monetary policy as an instrument in the fight against inflation. All members of this House will appreciate how important it is that the rate of monetary growth should not be acorn.modating to inflation and that overall policy in this area should be applied responsibly but with that firmness which is required at the present time. Because of the increase in the deficit which is inherent in the Opposition&#39;s plan, there would be not only an inflationary increase in the money supply, but also, I believe higher interest rates as well. The Labor Party&#39;s economic policy statement issued this year makes no mention of the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition last October for reductions in company tax, more generous income tax rebates, and a reduced health levy. </para>
          <para>Finally, the confusion which surrounds what the Opposition now stands for was compounded by the reference of the honourable member for Oxley to $800m-worth of additional expenditure, claiming that major offsets could be achieved by suspending the investment allowance. As I have said in this House, and I want to reaffirm it because the honourable gentleman frankly cannot count, although the estimated cost of that allowance in 1977-78 is $450m, the amount relates to incomes earned and investments undertaken in the current year. Therefore the major saving about which the honourable gentleman talked in so simplistic a sense could not be made unless the policy were to be adopted on a retrospective basis. I am reminded that the honourable gentleman made this same mistake in relation to the investment allowance when he, as Treasurer, sought to cost the then Opposition&#39;s economic policy which was put down during 1975. The honourable gentleman was as much in error then as apparently he is now. Frankly, he is unable, apparently, to understand the retrospective nature of the investment allowance. The fact is that the net cost of what the honourable gentleman puts forward would be about $675 m, not the $200m which has been claimed. </para>
          <para>I wish to turn now to the Government&#39;s achievements. Before going through a number of the areas in which the economy has shown a significant pick-up, let me quote the remarks of people independent of the Government and outside of this House. I refer, firstly, to Philip Shrapnel&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Economic Outlook</inline> of March 1977, in which he comments:  we were able to confirm that the recovery in business activity in Australia is now clearly under way . . . </para>
          <para>He goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The plain fact is that the Government has done nearly everything that needed to be done to reverse the following policies that created the economic crisis of 1974-75 . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then he goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">We believe that the Government knows exactly what it is doing, that its policies are coherent and consistent, and that it will correct the chaotic situation that it inherited within the 3-year term that it considered necessary to do so. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The retiring  Chairman  of the Australian Finance Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> E. Hill, is reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> as recently as 3 1 May, as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Solid progress has been made on the long road towards controlling inflation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He goes on to comment that the annual rate of inflation, after allowing for various Medibank changes, has been reduced by around 5 per cent over the past year, and that in the same period there has been continued economic growth in real terms. </para>
          <para>Hill Samuel Aust Ltd, a very respected merchant banking house in this country, made the following comments in its May 1977 bulletin: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The Government&#39;s economic policies, as reflected in the low March quarter&#39;s inflation level, are proving successful and if the Government holds firm on its policies we believe that by September-October of this year the outlook for the Australian economy will be substantially more favourable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The recent economic advisory service bulletin of the W. D. Scott organisation said this:  . . there are fundamental forces which lead to the conclusion that continuing recovery will be shown for the current period . . . </para>
          <para class="block">The document goes on to make a number of other comments about the recovery process which are consistent with that judgment. I note also from a recent Press clipping that the chief economist of the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> K. Brunner, forecast a very significant upturn in the level of private investment in Australia next year. </para>
          <para>All of this is consistent with the belief that the Government has put forward on a number of occasions, well supported not only by its official advisers but also by advice from outside. We have said, and I repeat it here again, that there will be no quick take-off. The Government does not seek that. Our economic policy is predicated on a gradual, sustainable growth par. The control of inflation will lead to gradual strengthening in economic activity and, as a consequence, to the progressive creation of job opportunities. I believe it can be seen without any shadow of doubt whatsoever that the strategy is beginning to work and, if held in place, certainly will produce the required results. As we have said all along, bringing this nation out of recession and putting it back into a pattern of strong economic growth will be a drawn out process. I want to make that perfectly clear, because it is consistent with all that we have said. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned before, we have aimed deliberately for a moderate increase in real economic growth over the current financial year. If honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House want to refer to the international position, let me point out that, as both the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have emphasised, there is a need for caution in the pursuit of expansionary policies and, in the cases of countries that have yet to bring down the rate of inflation to very low rates, continuing fiscal and monetary restraint is essential to the achievement of non-inflationary growth. I remind the House of the communique issued by the OECD Ministers last year, which stated in this connection:  . . because of the virulence of recent inflationary experience, there is a danger that inflationary expectations could revive quite strongly if the pace of the recovery is too fast. </para>
          <para class="block">The OECD also pointed to the risk of supply bottlenecks occurring in the fairly early stages of the recovery process because of the very low level of investment in basic industries during the recession. On this note I want to quote again from the communique of last year, which stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In most countries, policies should be directed more towards promoting investment rather than consumption. In many cases, this will require an appropriate recovery of profits from the depressed levels of recent years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Last year&#39;s Budget conformed very closely to the overall strategy to which I have just referred. It was based on the continuing advice of the OECD and the IMF. It was a Budget of fiscal and monetary restraint. The rate of increase in outlays was reduced from 23 per cent to slightly over 1 1 per cent and the deficit was brought down, thereby making it possible for a moderation in the rate of monetary expansion. </para>
          <para>We have introduced a tax allowance for investment in plant and equipment as from 1 </para>
          <para class="block">January 1976 and foreshadowed the introduction of the first stage of company tax indexation as from 1 July of this year. That is a very solid start to tax reform in the corporate area. It is in addition, of course, to tax reform in the form of tax indexation and tax reduction for individuals. The fiscal and monetary policies, combined with the deliberate stimulus to investment, have led to a strong moderation in inflation, a strong recovery in investment and company profits, a moderate increase in consumption and a very encouraging lift in real economic growth. We on this side of the House reject the pessimism, despair, gloom and despondency which the Jeremiahs and knockers of the Australian community are seeking to create at the present time. </para>
          <para>Let me illustrate the broad thrust of this proposition. First of all, inflation was significantly curbed during 1976. After allowance for the effects of changes to health insurance arrangements and indirect taxes and charges, the consumer price index in the second half of 1976 rose at an annual rate some 4 percentage points, or more, less than in the second half of 1975. There is further evidence of the decline in inflation during that period if one wants to refer to other significant economic indicators. I mention that the implicit deflator for the major components of gross national expenditure increased by 1.3 per cent in the December quarter of last year, compared with 4.4 per cent in the December quarter of 1975. 1976 was a year in which activity picked up. Over the year to the December quarter, the gross non-farm product increased by 5.2 per cent in real terms. That was a very solid start to achieving the 4 per cent growth projected in the Budget documents. Consumers increased their spending during the period. Real private final consumption expenditure rose by 2.2 per cent in the second half of 1976, to be 3 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1975. Company profitability began to recover strongly. Company profits were some 33 per cent higher m the December quarter of 1976 than a year earlier. There was an investment revival during the year. It was a strong revival. Investment in plant and equipment by priviate enterprises increased over the year, in real terms, not by one or two per cent but by 18.6 per cent. Private investment in dwellings rose by 20.4 per cent, also in real terms. </para>
          <para>Therefore in spite of what our opponents have sought to say in the House today, 1976 was a year of solid economic performance. Quite contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition has said today, the standard of living in Australia is higher now than it was when we took office. The final December quarter national accounts figures showed that real household disposable income was 1.2 per cent higher in the December quarter of 1 976 than in the December quarter of 1 975 . In order to compare Labor&#39;s record in its last 6 months in office we should look at the second half of calendar year 1975 when real household disposable income during that period declined at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent compared with the first half of that year. This again is a reflection on the Budget of the honourable member for Oxley. </para>

              <para>- I might also mention in a quiet way to the honouable member who is interjecting that families spent a greater proportion of their incomes in 1976 than they did in 1975 and real consumption per capita increased between the December quarter of 1975 and the December quarter of last year. On these 2 counts, and there are many others, Australian families were better off at the end of 1 976 both in terms of their real incomes and their levels of real spending than they were at the beginning of the year. Therefore, Australians are better placed now to upgrade the quality as well as the level of thenstandard of living. Opposition spokesmen have sought consistently inside and outside this House to tell the Australian people that living standards have declined, but the facts deny that. </para>

          <para>I want to refer now- I have left the good wine until last so as to bring responsibility home to where it belongs- to unemployment in Australia. The Opposition is seeking to fasten onto the politics of unemployment and it deserves the condemnation and indictment of the honourable members of this House for doing so. It created the very problem about which it now complains. As my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> has said, unemployment in Australia is too high, and I reaffirm that. I recall what I said in the Budget Speech last year, that the Government yields to none in its concern for the unemployed. In bringing down that Budget I made it plain that little, if any, improvement in the unemployment position could be expected in 1976 but that some improvement was envisaged in line with strengthening economic activity further into 1977. Recent figures are in no way inconsistent with those Budget expectations. What the figures really imply is that the number of persons genuinely unemployed is a matter for debate and the Government properly has sought to put the level of unemployment in context. There is a discrepency between the figures produced by the Commonwealth Employment Service and those prepared by the Commonwealth Bureau of Statistics, a point which I took up with the Opposition yesterday. There are doubts about the real meaning of the figures prepared by the CES, but I shall not go into the details here because they have been adequately outlined in recent debates. </para>
          <para>I turn now to employment as opposed to unemployment. Seasonally adjusted civilian employment fell by around 78 000 between June 1974 and December 1975 when honourable gentlemen opposite were in governement. Again in seasonally adjusted terms, the fall in employment was arrested during 1976, and as at last December employment was a little higher than it was in the same month of the previous year. I know that unemployment is a matter of concern to many people in this country and it remains a matter of concern to this Government. But there will be no improvement in the unemployment position while the profit share remains as it is, while honourable gentlemen opposite preach concern and despondency about the Australian economy, and while the present level of wage indexation is feeding into prices. The real problem of unemployment relates to the simple decision that an employer faces at present. When he looks at the price of labour and at the operations of his company- whether it is a large company or a small company- he takes a business decision that the company cannot meet the cost of labour as determined by the processes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and by discussions between employers and employees. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, honourable gentlemen opposite complain about a problem which they effectively created. No government has put more people into the ranks of the unemployed than the Labor Government. In 1974-75 there were 200 000 unemployed and it is a matter of humbuggery and a cynical reflection on the Opposition- I said humbuggery&#39; and that is a fair term to use- </para>

              <para>-All right. The Opposition comes into this House suggesting make-work programs of a type which it rejected when in government. Make-work schemes under Labor started in 1974 when there were 150 000 unemployed and concluded in December 1975 when there were 328 000 unemployed. Labor rejected the schemes which it now suggests we ought to adopt. The Government rejects the motion, and I move: </para>

            <para>- by leave- Successive governments have repeatedly stated that the nature of the research programs at the Joint Defence Space Research Facility at Pine Gap, its operation and the information derived from the programs are classified and must remain so. Ministers of both Labor and coalition governments who have been briefed on the facility have accepted that it is in Australia&#39;s national interest to participate in the facility and to preserve its secrecy. This is still the position and the Government will not depart from the long-standing practice of neither confirming nor denying speculation and claimed revelations&#39; about the facility. However, in the light of suggestions that the facility might have been used in bad faith by our American partner against Australian interests and to make an unauthorised intrusion into Australian sovereignty, the Government has decided to give some public reassurance as to the basis on which Australian Governments have continued to support the facility and its operations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Those Australians and Americans whose briefing has been authorised by their respective Governments are fully aware of the nature of the work of the facility and how the facility is operated. Those at the site whose responsibilities so require have equal right of access to all parts of the facility and to its activities and all results of the research. This right of access excludes only the 2 national communications rooms of the operating partners, to which, in accordance with standard practice at all joint installations, access is restricted to preserve national cipher security. National privacy in this respect, however, does not, and cannot, extend to denial of knowledge of the programs and activities of the facility. </para>
          <para>The interdependence of the staff in their work and the physical layout of the various areas of work are such that the scope of a program being undertaken is clear to all working there, Australia or American, and to supervisors visiting the areas. Even the most detailed information can be readily obtained and checked. </para>
          <para>The senior Australian on site is the Australian defence representative. He works closely with his United States counterpart, participating daily in the decision-making concerned with program activities. He likewise attends the daily staff conferences and meetings reviewing operations. He has detailed knowledge and experience of the capability and activities of the facility and, of course, complete access at any time to all areas and operations. There are other Australians on the floor working across the various shifts and programs and with unrestricted access. There is no way in which systematic deception or activities detrimental to Australian interests could go undetected, even were it assumed that it was feasible and advantageous ever to attempt them. </para>
          <para>Programs are actively monitored, both at the facility and by the Department of Defence in Canberra, to ensure compatibility with Australian national policy and interests. Australia has the right to intervene if it has doubts or objections regarding any activity. As the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> said on 7 February 1975: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">We know what goes on there and we can stop it if we want to. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was true then and it is true now. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam&#39;s</inline> Administration Australia&#39;s control arrangements regarding the facility were closely reviewed and strengthened. </para>
          <para>The Government rests its full confidence in the facility&#39;s being used only in accordance with purposes agreed by Australia on the knowledge of the facility&#39;s purpose and activities over many years and on the practical arrangements that ensure Australian access to and control of its functions and operations. This confidence is reinforced by the judgment that a United States administration would be unlikely to put in jeopardy the valuable benefits derived from the facility by trying to use the facility to gain some much less significant advantage in respect of Australia. </para>
          <para>The former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam, who was, of course, briefed on the facility, its operations and how it functioned shortly after assuming office, and again in 1973 and 1974, publicly declared that the facility operated with his Government&#39;s &#39;full knowledge and concurrence&#39;. He spoke publicly also of the valuable contribution made by the facility to world peace. Ministers in the present Government who have been briefed about the facility fully support such comments. They also are completely satisfied that the facility is not used against Australian interests, governmental or private. </para>
          <para>I might add to this statement that, subject to his obligation to preserve secrecy, which he renewed in the House on 4 May, my friend the honourable the Leader of the Opposition is welcome at any time to refresh his briefing on the facility in the Department of Defence and to raise any questions regarding it. I present the following paper: </para>

              <para>-by leave-This report is a substantial one and is the third report that the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has presented to the Parliament on the general region known as the Middle East: the first 8 years ago; the second last year and the present one. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>The &#39;Middle East&#39; was an epicentre in civilisation balance a millennium ago. It is, today, an epicentre for Euro-Asia and a great part of Africa and from this centre the waves of disequilibrium can sweep to the Australasian shores. The Committee has disciplined its investigation by examining the epicentre of Arab and Israeli tensions and their patron powers. We set down the facts as we discerned them and the discernable deductions we have made from those facts. However, we feel it incumbent upon us to indicate that the Committee cast a collective eye upon the periphery of the epicentre, particularly to the peripheral economic and military powers. We indicate the economic power of the oil producing states upon the periphery. A disturbance of a major order at the Euro-Asian epicentre would surely affect the Asian land mass as well as Australasia as it has in the immediate past and has begun to shake the economic stability of the industrialised nations once again. It is the hope of the Committee that the report will be debated by Parliament, digested by Parliament and will concern the Parliament. We think we can say as a </para>
          <para class="block">Committee that we regard the subject matter reported as sombre. </para>
          <para>A sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence heard evidence from or held informal discussions with over 40 witnesses. The evidence was heard in camera but some of it is being tabled with this report. Because of the human tragedy in Lebanon and its outreach for Australia with its large Lebanese community, priority was given to aspects dealing with Lebanon. Members will recall that the Committee tabled on 2 December 1976 a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Lebanon Crisis- Humanitarian Aspects.</inline> This further report concentrates on the Arab-Israeli dispute, it evaluates the prospects for peace and war, and the likely outcome in the unfortunate event of another war. The report also examines Great Power rivalry in the Middle East, the Palestinian question, and the importance of Middle East oil to the world and Australia. The Committee also reports in some detail on Australia&#39;s growing interest in the Middle East. </para>
          <para>The comprehensive report culminates in a large number of findings but due to time constraints I shall mention only a few. In the always unpredictable Middle East situation a fifth war in the region- although less likely in the short term- is easy to imagine and yet unthinkable in its consequences, which are likely to be more serious than in previous wars. Arab warnings of a renewed use of the oil weapon is a gloomy prospect for the non-communist industrialised nations. The Arabs now have an additional means of diplomatic pressure- their vast reserves of petro-dollars accumulated since 1973. The Soviet Union, which has experienced reduced influence in the region, may be tempted to make use of the Soviet Union&#39;s improved military capacity for intervention in the Middle East and thus risk a confrontation with the United States. Another war is likely to involve a much wider participation of Arab states than in 1 973. </para>
          <para>In any lasting Middle East peace settlement whereby all parties genuinely concede the right of every state in the area to live in peace and security there is a need to take account of a number of geo-strategic factors which are outlined in this report. These include, firstly, Israel &#39;s feeling of extreme vulnerability if confined to her pre- 1967 boundaries and, secondly, that over one million Palestinians live in Israeli occupied territories and could be an increasing source of internal unrest, and there are about another 2 million Palestinians who presumably aspire to the creation of a Palestinian homeland. </para>
          <para>The Palestinians&#39; future must be resolved before the Israeli-Arab problem can be finally solved. There is widening support for a Palestinian homeland &#39;alongside&#39; Israel. Preferably such a homeland should be associated with Jordan in the hope that King Hussein could keep dissident elements under control. While the Committee accepts such a concept in principle, it believes that Israel cannot be expected to allow a Palestinian homeland so close to the bulk of Israel&#39;s population until such time as the Palestine Liberation Organisation accepts Israel&#39;s right to exist. The Palestinian National Council declined to soften its attitude at its Cairo meeting in March. Australia has a moral responsibility to continue to support the survival of Israel- a small state with a democratic tradition. </para>
          <para>Despite the hair-trigger readiness for war in the Middle East &#39;confrontation&#39; states, there is optimism particularly among conciliatory Arab leaders that a Middle East peace settlement can be negotiated at Geneva within the next 12 months. This optimism is largely based on the belief that the United States can persuade Israel to withdraw from the Territory it captured in the 1967 war. United States and Soviet rivalry has focused on the Middle East where the United States is now the dominating influence. The shape of negotiations in the months ahead will depend largely on Israel&#39;s response to any United States pressure towards a compromise. United States pressure is not unrelated to United States friendship with Saudi Arabia, and lately with Egypt, and is due to United States obligations to Western Europe and Japan, which are dependent on Middle East oil. The Americans are in a unique position &#39;to influence&#39; Israel. Ultimately, however, the Israeli Government will make the decisions on any concessions that relate to Israel &#39;s survival. </para>
          <para>Despite the great difficulties described in this report, the next year or two is a particularly opportune time to launch a major peace offensive in the Middle East.  President  Carter is still in his post-election &#39;honeymoon&#39; phase and therefore in a better position to influence Israel; the Israelis, although politically more isolated, can bargain from a position of military strength, especially in relation to Egypt; and the &#39;moderate&#39; Arab states are in the mood to talk peace and are less constrained by the PLO, which has at the moment little capacity for independent action. The parties concerned should use this opportunity. The Committee would like to see an early and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East but it is concerned that a Geneva Peace Conference and  President  Carter&#39;s optimistic statements about peace in the Middle East may build up a false expectation of wholesale concessions which Israel cannot afford to make. This may disillusion moderate Arab states with America&#39;s Middle East policy, and may cause Egypt to welcome again large-scale Russian military supplies, which would make feasible in due course another combined Arab round against Israel. The best prospects for avoiding war may result from a continuation of &#39;stepbystep&#39; settlements but not necessarily on all fronts. There is little scope for Israeli concessions on the Golan Heights. </para>
          <para>The early 1 980s will be a particularly dangerous period in the Middle East. The world will be much more dependent on Arab oil in the early 1980s until such time as alternative energy sources can be developed. Israel will find the Arabs in a position of greater diplomatic strength due to their increased ability to wield the oil weapon. It may then be too late for Israel to make concessions to the Arabs, who are likely to have become disenchanted with United States peace efforts if they fail to bring results by then. The Arabs will then have the choice between the war option or the oil option, as practised in 1 973. Unfortunately for the peace of the world, the Arabs may combine both their options. The Arab oil producers have made it plain that in the event of another Arab-Israeli war the oil weapon will be used once again. Apart from the threat to Australia&#39;s oil imports, our security is unlikely to be directly threatened by a military conflict in the Middle East. However, increases in tension in regions such as the Middle East, where the super powers&#39; strategic interests are great and where their policies may conflict, tend to increase Australia&#39;s own strategic uncertainty and insecurity. At worst there is always the possibility that a world war could originate in the Middle East. </para>
          <para>The Committee recommends that Australia should continue to work in a sensitive way to assist movement towards a permanent and peaceful settlement. The basis of Australia&#39;s action should be the recognition of Israel&#39;s right to exist in security, and the encouragement of Arab initiatives to settle the displaced Palestinians. Australia should work in international forums as well as in private consultations with friendly powers to support the efforts of the United States-the most influential power in the region-to achieve a lasting Middle East peace settlement. This may require support for the resumption of United States step-by-step diplomacy, should the parties to the dispute become disenchanted with the Geneva Peace </para>
          <para class="block">Conference. Australia should give continued support to United Nations peace-keeping forces in the Middle East and, if requested, be prepared to enlarge its present limited contribution. </para>
          <para>Until such time as Lebanon can build up strong enough security forces to curb Palestinian forces in southern Lebanon, Australia should support the establishment in Lebanon&#39;s troubled southern border area of an effective international peace-keeping force to be drawn from disinterested powers. Such a force must also be of sufficient strength to curb armed incursions into and from Israel. Australia should support the implementation of limited forces zones and support the concept of great power guarantees, provided any state involved in the Arab-Israeli dispute is not forced to rely entirely on such measures for its continued existence. </para>
          <para>Australia should continue to expand its diplomatic representation in the Middle East. To ensure that Australia can independently assess the latest military tactics and technology used in the Middle East, several Australian ambassadors should have an Australian Armed Services attache available to them. To facilitate the potential for trade, Australia should establish diplomatic relations with Libya. Australia should encourage long term productive investment in this country from the Middle East oil exporting states. Australia should attempt to make itself less dependent on Arab oil supplies to lessen the possibility of heavy unemployment- it could be as severe as an additional half a million personsshould these supplies be reduced. Australia should give urgent attention to the development of a comprehensive national energy policy that will harness other potentially abundant energy reserves apart from oil, and that will conserve our scarce oil resources until alternative energy sources can be developed. It must be regarded as a realistic policy designed to deflect from Australia some of the consequences of conflict in the Middle East, particularly the use of oil as a weapon. </para>
          <para>Australian governments must make the Australian public aware of the need to conserve petroleum products. The only effective way to do this would be the introduction of some of the fiscal measures as canvassed in the Committee&#39;s report. In the event that the Australian Government makes allowance for the unpredictable Middle East oil situation by supporting a progressive increase in domestic crude prices in order to save a scarce resource, then a significant proportion of higher royalties should be allocated to the following: Firstly, to giving tax incentives for further exploration; secondly, to the development of alternative energy sources; thirdly, to increasing storage capacity for the types of crudes normally imported; and, fourthly, to the encouragement for research and development of suitable technology for the extraction of a higher proportion of crude oil from Australia &#39;s existing fields. </para>
          <para>The federal tax of over 9c a gallon on liquefied petroleum gas raises little revenue; it should be removed to encourage the replacement of motor spirit. Serious consideration should be given to increasing the use of relatively abundant LPG by subsidising the costs of conversion. Subsidies could be given direct to the manufactures of engines suitable for LPG. Australia should progressively increase mandatory stock holdings of crude oil and derived products to 90 days reserve by 1981. Priority in the meantime should be given to improving stock holdings related to the defence capacity of Australia. Both Commonwealth and State governments should have at all times in advanced preparation the necessary legislation to implement the conservation of scarce energy products. Early priority should be given to the amendment of the Liquid Fuels (Defence Stocks) Act. </para>
          <para>We do not always appreciate the sense of impending disaster which governs thinking and policy in Israel, but the atmosphere is well conveyed by the notable Jewish writer Saul Bellow in his book <inline font-style="italic">To Jerusalem and Back,</inline> and 2 quotations from his book will suffice. Writing of conversation at a social occasion in Jerusalem he notes: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The subject of all this talk is ultimately survival . . . At first it is hard to grasp this because the setting is so civilised . . . Here you sit at dinner with charming people in a dining room like any other. Yet you know that your hostess has lost a son; that her sister lost children in the 1973 war; that in this Jerusalem street, coolly sweet with night flowers and dark green under the lamps, many other families have lost children ... In the domestic ceremony of passed dishes and filled glasses thoughts of a destructive enemy are hard to grasp. What you do know is there is one fact of Jewish life unchanged by the creation of a Jewish State; you cannot take your right to live for granted . . . The Jews, because they are Jews, have never been able to take the right to live as a natural right. </para>

Reports are often presented and debate on them is shelved. We have never had a full scale debate or discussion on the Middle East in the 8 years that I have been a member of this place.

            <para>- by leave- The report on Australian defence industries is the result of what, I am sure, is the most thorough investigation of the subject ever undertaken by a parliamentary committee. Practically every plant or establishment of defence industrial significance was visited by the sub-committee. I should like to pay tribute to my colleagues on the sub-committee, the honourable members for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short)</inline> and St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> on this side of the House and the honourable members for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman),</inline> Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> on the Opposition side and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> from the Senate. We all, I am sure, wish to express our gratitude to the subcommittee staff- Malcolm Hills, Dan Barton, and our special adviser Ian Fleming. Our debt to them is immense. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In considering the requirements for defence industry, it is necessary to decide first the scale and warning time of any possible conflicts and whether overseas supplies would be available during such conflicts. The Committee has made its assumptions-for they must be assumptions; no one can prove or disprove them- as plain as possible. In one regard we have gone further than the last defence White Paper would suggest. We have considered what might happen if Australia were thrown back on her own resources, as nearly happened in 1942 and might happen again. We believe the Australian public should be aware of the gaps that would exist in such circumstances, for such awareness is an important step towards the exercise of balanced judgment and the initiation of reasoned actions while there is time to do so in an orderly manner. </para>
        <para>The report deals with some general issues applicable to all defence industries and then concentrates on 4 key defence industries- shipbuilding, aerospace, electronics and munitions. The electronics section of the report is not yet quite completed and it, together with a summary of conclusions, will be tabled in the Budget session and a request will then be made to print the whole report. I am concerned at many of the deficiencies revealed. We could not, for instance, build a combat aircraft in Australia from our own resources. We could not fit out a modern warship from our own resources. Our technological gap is probably worse now than it was in 1 939. The gap is not narrowing; it is widening. </para>
        <para>The Committee has made many recommendations in order to widen our defence technological base. Some recommendations involve changes in policies pursued by successive governments; others suggest effective implementation of policies to which in the past mere lip service has been paid. The report is unanimous, except for the highly contentious subject of merchant shipbuilding on some aspects of which 2 members dissented. I hope that this report will be of value to Australian defence and I commend it to the House. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I also would like to pay respect to the other members of the sub-committee One could only say that the report was not only exhaustive but that it was also exhausting. The sub-committee was involved in a great deal of work and travelled the length and breadth of Australia. We had innumerable meetings which took up a great deal of time. I think that every member of the sub-committee gave everything he possibly could to it. I particularly pay respect to the honourable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer)</inline> who was  Chairman  of the sub-committee and, of course, to the other members of the subcommittee. I submit that the report ought to be known as the Hamer report. I believe this would be an appropriate name for it. Without a doubt he carried out his duties as  chairman  of the subcommittee with what I can only call very great application. I also pay respect to the research staff who helped us, namely, Ian Fleming, Malcolm Hills, Dan Barton and Annette Quinn and, of course, our stenographic staff who, once again, did a wonderful and exhausting job. </para>

        <para>The only dissent was expressed by the honourable member for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short)</inline> and one can understand that. He originally came from the Department of Treasury and naturally he would tend to express the same attitude as that from his environment in the Treasury. I am not making this personal; I make that quite clear. I have often said that Treasury has far too much influence on the Parliament. Nevertheless, the honourable member without a doubt sincerely believes in his attitude. He has based that attitude on paragraph 7.70. Incidentally, the last part of that paragraph was inserted by him. He believes in the approach he took on the shipbuilding industry and one must give him full credit for that. I mention the shipbuilding industry in which I took interest myself. I hope the Government will take note of the report and its recommendations for an inquiry to maintain the commercial shipbuilding industry, particularly the dockyards at Whyalla and Newcastle. </para>
        <para>We carried out exhaustive inquiries. It was not something taken off the top of the head. We went into it with great depth. I make the point that our recommendations were unanimous, with the exception of one dissenting vote, on that subcommittee. In other words, people from both sides of the House appreciated the need to maintain this industry. Finally, I pay full respect to and thank the other members of the subcommittee for the exhausting job which they did. It was a good sub-committee. We got to know one another very well and to understand one another&#39;s view points very well. I commend the report to the House. In doing so I suggest that the appropriate name for it would be the Hamer Report. </para>

          <para>-by leave-The report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is one of the most important documents ever tabled in Parliament. It represents the most exhaustive, detailed and comprehensive independent investigation into defence industry in Australia since the Second World War. The recommendations are clear and capable of implementation. If implemented by the Government they will give real substance to the present shadowy claim that industry is the fourth arm of defence. I sincerely hope that there will be a full debate on this report in the Parliament and in the community. Although this is a committee document, in the main it is specific. It is a responsible document and where necessary it does not pull punches. It points out that the Committee is greatly concerned by the failure of the Department of Defence to have more of its equipment developed in Australia. Honourable members, the Government and the nation should carefully read the proposals for the shipbuilding, aerospace and other industries. A supplementary report on the vital electronics industry will be available shortly. I pay tribute to the staff who have assisted. The work of this Committee should also give heart to the public in that members of both major Parties have closely cooperated over many hours, days and months. Political rhetoric has been buried. Except for minor dissents all differences have been resolved in a real attempt to produce a substantial contribution to the national interest and to the future security of Australia. </para>

            <para>-by leave-The Committee&#39;s inquiry into Australia&#39;s overseas representation has concentrated on the appropriateness of staff numbers which, directly and indirectly, determine most costs in this field. The principal conclusion arising from the inquiry is that there is a need for more effective on-going systems of control over Australia&#39;s representation overseas. In the last 2 years dramatic reductions have been made in the staffing of departments with major responsibilities overseas. Yet they are still performing their functions without serious impairment. The Committee is recommending a system of biennial reviews by government of the whole field of overseas representation. They would be based on submissions by the relevant departments and by the central regulatory authorities. The reviews would enable government to determine the total volume of resources it is prepared to allocate to this area in light of competing demands on the limited available resources and bring greater discipline to departmental thinking on the use of their resources. The first review should take place in about February 1978. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Committee also makes specific recommendations aimed at improving departments&#39; capacity to keep under regular and effective scrutiny their allocation of resources overseas, notably more frequent inspections of posts by senior officers and improved reporting on management matters. The measures proposed are not a panacea. They are an aid to, not a substitute for, discipline on the part of departments and central authorities in constantly examining priorities and the elaborateness of their operations. It must always be borne in mind by governments and by departments that the average cost of having an Australia-based officer on an overseas posting now exceeds $70,000 per annum and in individual cases exceeds $100,000 per annum. </para>
        <para>The evidence collected by the Committee suggests that, as a result of the recent thoroughgoing reviews of staffing overseas, the numbers of staff now accord with essential workloads in the great majority of cases. The Committee is disturbed, however, by the size of the Australian High Commission in London despite major staff reductions in recent years. The Committee recommends that locally-engaged staff in London be reduced to 500, that is, by over 100. Other staff reductions recommended in the report would result in a minimum net reduction of 1 9 Australia-based officers and at least a further 50 locally engaged staff. Some of these reductions would be effected by the closure of posts in Rio de Janeiro, Karachi, Port-of-Spain and Christchurch. Others would result from withdrawal of representatives of the Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial and Research Organisation, the Attorney-General&#39;s Department and the Departments of Education, Social Security and Veterans&#39; Affairs. </para>
        <para>The Committee also recommends detailed examinations to determine, firstly, whether Australiabased staff at 8 Immigration posts should be withdrawn and the posts covered by a system of regional representation and, secondly, whether 25 positions at Trade Commissioner posts are justified by the essential workload at the posts. The Committee expects further reductions in staff to result from these examinations. The report places some emphasis on the need for Heads of Mission to be given greater delegated authority in administrative and financial matters. Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in particular, should be given a wide range of experience inside and outside of the Department to ensure that those who become Heads of Mission are equipped to handle administrative responsibilities capably. I point out that the words former&#39; and &#39;latter&#39; in recommendation 17 have been incorrectly transposed. I commend the report to the House. </para>

          <para>-by leave-Before making my comments, I wonder whether the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> will consider moving a motion that the House take note of the report. This is no criticism of the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on Expenditure but it has occurred to me that the Committee was set up substantially to oversight expenditure by the Public Service and the Executive. It has been ordered that the report be printed but without such a motion the House will not be given the opportunity to examine and debate the recommendations in the report, if it should so desire. I offer that comment. I will not refer to the specific recommendations because the  Chairman  of the Committee, the honourable member for Curtin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> has already done so. Incidentally, the incorrect recommendation was No. 19, and I think honourable members will understand, when reading the mass of words, how easy it is to transpose terms. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Committee is trying to design methods to examine expenditure, and a lot of the exercise, which involved tedious, painstaking work, related to the designing of methods and trying to adopt an objective approach. I think that members of the sub-committee will agree that some subjects do not allow total objectivity, and this field is one of them. Such things as deciding whether cuts in staff allow satisfactory service when there are different assessments of satisfactory service become subjective matters. There is also the political sensitivity of certain geographical areas, as well as certain areas of government policy. This morning a report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the Middle East was presented. If I heard correctly, the Committee recommended an increase in overseas representation, obviously on quite valid grounds. Some of the reasons for our overseas representation may not be related to a direct return to Australia. They may be political reasons or involve the question of the status overseas which Australia wants to maintain. They may be related to a show of strength in terms of numbers to preserve good relationships. One of the recommendations in the report related to postings overseas of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation representatives, and here we had some difficulty. </para>
        <para class="block">It would seem that their functions could be carried out by short visits, but it may be that Australia&#39;s international scientific status would be affected by their withdrawal. Once again, we have the question of a subjective assessment. </para>
        <para>In addition to the plea that, we adopt a routine for such reports from the Expenditure Committeewe have a motion that the House take note of the report- we should ensure that the House has the opportunity to debate a report which it wants to debate. The experience of the Committee in conducting its inquiries illustrates once again the inadequacy of the arrangements of the committee system of the House in regard to the way in which the committees are organised and the opportunities available for sittings of committees. I make that point in order to urge the Government to give serious consideration to allowing a parliamentary debate on the report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System so that the functioning of the committee system may be brought into line with what is necessary modern practice. In that way, committees such as the Expenditure Committee, which involves quite a large amount of time, would be able to deal with their reports more effectively. </para>

            <para>-by leave-The Joint Committee on Publications has asked me to draw to the attention of the House the unsatisfactory arrangement whereby only 9 copies of the report of the Australian Assistance Plan, which was tabled in the House this morning, have been made available to the Parliament for distribution to members. The Committee regards such an arrangement as totally unsatisfactory because it makes it extremely difficult for interested members to have access to the report. The Committee has asked that I draw to the attention of all Ministers and departments the need to ensure that adequate copies of all reports to be tabled are made available for all senators and members. Clear guidelines are set down as to the format to be adopted for the preparation and printing of publications. Additionally, 330 copies are to be provided to the Parliament for distribution to senators and members, to the Press, to research officers, to the Bills and Papers Office, and to other interested people in and around the Parliament. Frequently the Parliament is supplied with only a few copies of very important reports which are much sought after. I have instanced the example of the Australian Assistance Plan report merely to highlight the problem. Indeed, that report is dated March 1976, which means that we have added insult to injury in this case because the report has been available for some 1 5 months. Many other departments are guilty of not fulfilling this important requirement. The secretary of the Publications Committee has provided me with a list of reports tabled in the Parliament where less than 20 copies were made available to the Senate records and papers office for the period June to December 1976. I seek leave to incorporate this list in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">The broad purpose of this Bill is to enable each State, if it so chooses, to legislate to increase its revenue from personal income tax or to give- at a cost to the State- a rebate on personal income tax to residents in the State. This Bill completes the legislative framework of the tax sharing arrangements which are a central element of the Government&#39;s federalism policy- a policy aimed at restoring a proper distribution of powers and functions between the Federal, State and local spheres of government. I stress, at the outset, that the legislation I now introduce fulfils a fundamental policy commitment put by the Liberal and National Country Parties to the Australian community and overwhelmingly endorsed at the December 1975 election. It responds also to the arguments of Premiers over the years that they should have available to themselves a wider armoury of taxes to ensure greater flexibility in their untied revenues. </para>
          <para>Stage 1 of the income tax sharing arrangements established in legislation passed last year provided for the States to receive 33.6 per cent of personal income tax collections. Those arrangements replaced the old financial assistance grants formula. They will have provided the States with untied funds at levels significantly higher than they would have received under the old arrangements. Just as importantly, those arrangements have replaced the old system of handouts with one in which the concept is the sharing of tax revenues. Under the present Government, the States have received what they have been seeking for many years- a share of the income tax revenues. Stage 1 of the tax sharing arrangements is an important step towards more responsible government in Australia and the restoration of a proper balance in our federal system. </para>
          <para>The present Bill will enable the implementation of stage 2 of the tax sharing arrangements, and thus represents a further major step towards this objective. Under these proposed stage 2 arrangements each State will be able to vary, by its own decision, its total share of income tax collections. The States thus will have effective control of their own revenues as well as their expenditures and will, as a consequence, be able to establish their own priorities. Because responsibilities for revenue raising and spending will be more clearly recognised by the electors, there will be a greater incentive towards better housekeeping. The implications of tax sharing were well summed up by the Premier of Western Australia in the following words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In returning to this Parliament its right to a share of income tax collections, the Federal Government has also restored to us a far greater degree of financial responsibility. </para>
            <para>Western Australia is now entitled to 4 per cent of the national collection of personal income tax and the Government must live with the ups and downs in those collections as we were required to do in the years when the State levied its own income tax. </para>
            <para>This will require the acceptance of new attitudes to budgeting, recognising that variations in revenue from year to year are likely to be more marked than before, and an even greater emphasis on sound financial management practices. </para>
            <para>This is the price one has to pay, because with rights go responsibilities, and I for one would have it no other way. </para>

The stage 2 arrangements have also been the subject of joint Commonwealth- State officers&#39; reports, including a report which was considered at the Premiers Conference in April 1977. </para>
          <para>At that conference there was broad agreement on the following objectives which have been followed in the draft Bill: Firstly, there should be complete uniformity as between the States in all respects other than rates of any surcharges or rebates; secondly, the arrangements should be free of any significant constitutional or other legal doubt; thirdly, the scheme should be as simple and inexpensive to administer as practicable, consistent with legal requirements and the other broad objectives being followed; fourthly, the arrangements should impose the least inconvenience practicable on taxpayers and employers; and fifthly, the arrangements should be such as to avoid creating avenues for tax avoidance or evasion. It was also agreed at the April Premiers Conference that Commonwealth officers would consult with officers of Victoria and Western Australia regarding the Commonwealth &#39;s stage 2 legislation, and I record the Commonwealth&#39;s appreciation of the cooperation of the States. </para>
          <para>This Bill ranks as a significant further legislative step in the field of Commonwealth-State relations. It restores the States powers and responsibilities which are properly theirs. Because of its importance and complexity, the Government does not seek passage of the Bill during the present sittings. The Bill is introduced now to allow time for reflection and informed debate and, in particular, for consideration by the State governments. </para>
          <para>Before turning to the detailed provisions of the Bill I wish to deal with the constant assertions of our political opponents that the stage 2 arrangements amount to some form of &#39;double taxation&#39;. </para>

          <para>The first point to be made in relation to the charge of &#39;double taxation&#39; is, of course, that this legislation puts no compulsion on the States. It merely provides the framework to enable the States, as they may choose, to pick up taxing or rebating options. Only when a State chooses to impose a tax or allow a rebate, and legislates accordingly, will this legislation be brought into use. Some Premiers, as is well known, have urged the Commonwealth to reduce income tax. I must say, with a wry smile, that the enactment of this legislation will allow those Premiers to reduce income tax in their States. The second important point to be made is that, under this legislation, there will at all times remain one collection and administrative agency. Taxpayers resident in any State will still lodge one annual return of income with the Commissioner of Taxation and will receive a single notice of assessment on which Commonwealth and State components will be shown. There will be a single PA YE deduction from salaries and wages for Commonwealth and State purposes. In plain terms, there will be no additional forms to fill in. Thirdly, the States traditionally levy a wide range of taxes and charges. There is nothing new in identifying a tax as a particular State tax. The transfer of payroll tax to the States is an example. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the detailed provisions of the Bill. It has 4 major parts. One part gives authority for the Commissioner of Taxation to administer State tax and rebate laws that meet certain specifications set out in another part of the Bill and provides for payment to the States of what is collected by the Commonwealth on their behalf. It also deals with a number of miscellaneous matters. The other 2 main parts contain technical and machinery amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and other Acts. The first of these 4 parts calls for some comment. In drawing it up we have worked within the framework of principles agreed at successive Premiers Conferences and have consulted with those States- Victoria and Western Australia- that have wished to be associated with the framing of what is essentially enabling legislation. That is, this fundamental part of the Bill is something about which we believe we have the States&#39; basic agreement. </para>
          <para>In essence, the first part of the Bill is directed to ensuring that the objectives of uniform administration are practical and met. For example, it would be expected that each State increase or reduce tax only in respect of people who are residents of that State, according to a common definition of &#39;resident&#39;. In that way, no-one would be liable to tax in more than one State in any one year. Again, in the interests of simplicity, a State that wishes to impose a tax or allow a rebate will need to legislate in such a way that the State law can operate in harmony with the Commonwealth income tax law. As a consequence, State tax would be collected through the PA YE and provisional tax systems that are now a settled part of the Commonwealth personal tax system. </para>
          <para>Tax owing to the Commonwealth and to a State will be collected by the Commonwealth as a single, undivided, sum, with the State being paid its share of what is collected. It is because Commonwealth and State tax will be collected in this &#39; merged &#39; way that it is necessary, as set out in clause 76, for an appropriation to be made to enable payment to the States of amounts collected by virtue of State law. </para>
          <para>Finally, the magnitude of the activities of Federal, State and local governments should be put in true perspective. In the current financial year State and local governments will have under their supervision no less than 52 per cent of total public sector outlays in Australia. The percentage break-up is: Federal 48 per cent; State 46 per cent; local, 6 per cent. It is vital to the full understanding of intergovernment relations to appreciate the very significant role of State and local government in public finances. The idea that these 2 spheres are small and insignificant in the overall economic and social scene is a basic misconception. The detailed provisions of the Bill are fully explained in a memorandum that will be circulated to honourable members. The Bill is a very significant move forward towards the completion of our federalism arrangements with the States. I am sure that it has the support at least of all honourable members on this side of the House, and I commend it to the House. </para>

Katherine South Primary School is intended to be the first school built using the new system of construction developed by the Departments of Construction and Education during 1976. This system was designed to reduce design, documentation and construction costs and time. </para>
          <para>The school will comprise, each housed in a separate building, one 120 student learning area, one 240 student learning area, library, administration and multi-purpose area. The estimated cost of the revised proposal is $ 1.82m at April 1977 prices. The Committee, in recommending the construction of these works, concluded that the departments should monitor enrolments closely and document the project to allow deletion of the 120 student learning unit from the contract if enrolments do not increase as expected. The Departments of Construction and Education will comply with this recommendation in the further design of the school. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </para>

            <para>- This was a very difficult hearing for the Public Works Committee. The hearing was adjourned at Katherine and resumed in Canberra in order that the Department could present more information. Honourable members will see that the cost now is $ 1.82m. When the matter was referred to the Committee the cost was higher than $2m, as is required by the Act. The hearing highlighted the need to monitor movements of people in this area by way of estimates of population from time to time, and the Department after checking all sources available to it came back to the Committee and said that some errors, some over-estimation of future populations had been made. The Committee put to the Department that perhaps it would be desirable to reduce the size of this school. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> mentioned that this is the first school to be built under a very practical system of almost modular construction. It made the deletion of the not required section of the school rather easy and at the same time it makes the addition of it at a future time, if necessary, just as easy. At the same time, it makes the addition to it at a future time, if required, just as easy. It was a sensible solution to a difficult problem. One paragraph of the report recommends that the shower and change blocks be retained. I shall elaborate on that for the benefit of honourable members. There is a shower and toilet block at this school. It is not the first one in the Northern Territory. After the Committee had asked for and received information from knowledgeable people on the climatic conditions in the Northern Territory, it was felt that, in that area, it is not a luxury to have the facilities for children to be able to shower, especially after playing sport. Katherine is one place in Australia which is regarded by those expert in climatic matters as a very difficult place to live. Shower facilities were not regarded by the Committee as a luxury but as an essential. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr CALDER</inline>(Northern Territory) (2.1 SiMr  Deputy Speaker,  I support the motion for the approval of work on the school at Katherine South. I note that the proposal is for a new type of modular design which will be of tremendous advantage in the Northern Territory because it will allow a similar school to be built without extra cost and design time. One hopes that there will be some advantage in reducing the cost of producing this type of school in other parts of the Northern Territory. I commend the decision, which has been taken in conformity with the wishes of the people of Katherine that the Clyde Fenton school, which was originally envisaged to handle the situation, is to be built later to accommodate 400 children, instead of these 2 schools being combined with a school population of 800. This was considered by the parents and citizens of Katherine to be of an unwieldy size and to the disadvantage of the pupils concerned. I express pleasure at the speed with which this decision has been made. I compliment the members of the Public Works Committee and also the - </para>

            <para>- Yes, thank you very much. I was going to compliment the Department of Construction and the Minister for Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> for soldiering this project through with such expedition. While I am on my feet commending the proposal for the building of the school I point out that the pupils attending the Katherine South school have been educated in a quickly assembled demountable building. Prior to using this building they were taught in an open, unlined, corrugated iron building which was used as a display at Katherine showground. So this school building will be welcomed. I only hope that the work goes ahead quickly so that the hard conditions being experienced in this tropical and rigorous climate are overcome as quickly as possible. I note that the school is to be built in a position where the pupils will be able to use the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation oval which is used quite a lot in Katherine for cricket and, I take it, football as well. I have played on that oval on several occasions. </para>

            <para>-The 2 measures before the House are temporary measures or extensions of temporary arrangements that have now been in existence for some considerable time. The first Bill, the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Bill, simply extends the time of the application of the Provisions of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act from 1 July 1977 to 1 January 1978. The second Bill extends the duration of the charges to bring them into line with that period. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> in his second reading speech explained the necessity for these Bills. He explained that the Government intends in the spring session to bring in substantive legislation to deal with the difficulties associated with the stevedoring industry in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During the course of his speech the Minister used a curious expression twice. He spoke about a report by the  Chairman  of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby, and he simply said: &#39;The report will now be available publicly&#39;. He said the same thing about a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neil</inline> Stevens. I am rather intrigued as to why the Minister did not table the reports. It is essential that members of my Party have access to those reports, because when the Minister and the Government bring in substantive legislation in the spring session we would like to have had the advantage of studying the report during the winter recess to make ourselves familiar with it and to confer with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and other waterfront unions- I understand that there is already agreement on it- on the basis of the report. Naturally we would like to make ourselves familiar with that report so that when the amending legislation, which I believe will be very substantive, is introduced in the Budget session we will be familiar with the report. </para>
          <para>I understand that there is in the view of the Minister and the Government a need to have the legislation passed through the House as quickly as possible in the August session. If we are able to hold our conversations and carry out our deliberations when the House is not meeting, the Minister will find that the Opposition is better equipped to assist him to get the legislation through the House as quickly as possible provided, of course, that it meets with our agreement. We have no opposition at all to the legislation that is before the House. We will do nothing either in this place or in another place to obstruct it. It is something that must be done today or not done at all as the present legislation expires on 30 June. Therefore the Opposition does not oppose these measures but may not adopt the same attitude when the substantive legislation comes before this House in August. </para>

I think it would be unreasonable that it not be referred to. But there was an undertaking by the Government that no firm decision on the export and mining of uranium would be made until the full debate had taken place in this Parliament on the second Fox report. The Opposition wants it made clear that in agreeing to allow the matter to be referred to, which is what this motion does, we are not acknowledging that a full debate has taken place in this Parliament on that report because it is not the substantiative motion which will be before the Parliament during this debate. </para>

I point out to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has made a suggestion that Orders of the Day Nos. 3, 4 and 5 be the subject of a cognate debate. The Chair&#39;s position is that if there is agreement to that suggestion the Chair will allow that course to be followed. It seems from what has been said by the honourable member for Corio and by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that there is considerable doubt as to whether there is agreement. </para>

            <para>- I will be confining my remarks to the ministerial statement about the nuclear safeguards policy. Because the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said earlier in the life of this Parliament that there would be a wide ranging debate on the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry during the Budget session, I prepared myself only for a speech on the ministerial statement about the nuclear safeguards policy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The nuclear safeguards policy has been forced on the Government by 2 factors. The first is a rather hasty effort to get into step with the modifications to the policy of the United States of America that were announced recently by President Carter. The Government wanted some semblance of a safeguards policy, no matter how lacking it was in sense or logic, before the Prime Minister&#39;s visit to Washington this month. The second is to bolster the Government&#39;s case for an early acceptance of the need to go ahead with uranium mining and export before the full implications of the Fox report sink in with the Australian people. Past coalition governments have approved export contracts for uranium without showing the slightest interest in safeguards. The motives behind this latest ploy are all too obvious. The Prime Minister in effect was forced to devise a safeguards policy before the Fox report was released. It does not seem to have occurred to the Prime Minister that his announcing of a safeguards policy was prejudging the issue. This makes a mockery of the Fox Committee&#39;s call for a full debate on the many complex issues involved in its reports. </para>
          <para>In the Press at the weekend Professor Kerr, a member of the Fox Committee, referred in scathing terms to the pathetic nature of the parliamentary debate permitted by the Fraser Government. He reinforced the point that I have made several times in this House, that is, that an hour or two allotted to parliamentary debate of the 2 Fox reports is no substitute for full and sustained public participation. There will be a further debate of the second Fox report in the Budget session, as I said earlier, and, if I may say so, it will be a further waste of time. In the intervening months the Government will continue by stealth with the preparations for the export of the uranium. The miners and the mining companies will gear up as rapidly as they can for an early start to getting uranium out of the ground and out of the country. It would have been more honest for the Government to get the sham debate out of the way and announce that it was going to have the full debate this week. </para>
          <para>The safeguards put by the Prime Minister to the Parliament are completely unsatisfactory. The Prime Minister&#39;s 10 proposals are filled with contradictions. In practice they would not work. It is not made clear when and where these safeguards will be applied. Will they apply to existing contracts or will they be applied only to future contracts? The Prime Minister made it quite plain that the new safeguards are needed because the present ones are not strong enough to cover Australia&#39;s enhanced status as a uranium producer. But Australia now has contracts for the supply of over 9000 tonnes of yellowcake. So far, less than 1000 tonnes have been supplied. The Prime Minister has continued to commit us to the export of more than 8000 tonnes of yellowcake without adequate safeguards. They have been left to the protection of the international safeguards which the Prime Minister admits are not good enough. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> knows that. </para>
          <para>Turning to the other provisions put forward by the Prime Minister one finds that the measure of safety they provide is an illusion. It is implied that the safeguards of the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty are defective; yet we find when we look closely at these tougher safeguards that nothing has been added which will remove these defects and provide stiffer safeguards. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cannot prevent the diversion of fissile material to weapons use. India produced its bomb without violating existing safeguards. It used plutonium from a research reactor provided 20 years ago by Canada. When Canada withdrew its supplies from India the gesture proved futile because the United States and later the Soviet Union kept up supplies of enriched uranium to the Indian Government. We cannot expect Australia to be any more successful than Canada in dictating the end use of its uranium supplies. Even with the tightest controls, supplies of enriched uranium and plutonium can go amiss. The nuclear accounting systems at present are inadequate. The Acting Prime Minister must agree with that. For example, the Federal General Accounting Office of the United States has just revealed that up to 9 tonnes of enriched plutonium and enriched uranium could not be accounted for at privately owned nuclear facilities. This was an increase of 3.5 tonnes over previous estimates. Anybody with common sense can imagine the nuclear weapons that could be made from that amount of plutonium. Uranium cannot be located, cannot be accounted for and cannot be assured of not getting into the wrong hands. Yet the Government says that it wants to leave the safeguarding of our further exports to the international agencies. </para>
          <para>The Government is being extremely naive to suppose that if it moves to mine and export it will be able to account for every ounce of uranium supplied. It is just as naive to suppose that the safeguards will have any effect on those nuclear weapons producers which have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The so-called safeguard here is a bilateral agreement that Australian uranium will not be used for offensive purposes. That cannot prevent our uranium from replacing uranium supplied by other sources. Such a displacement would allow the diversion of supplies to weapons production without any technical infringement of the safeguards in the bilateral agreement. Australian uranium would permit the diversion of uranium from other suppliers who might not have insisted on a bilateral agreement on safeguards and whose conditions are not as strong as ours. With the best intentions, the Australian Government could be contributing to nuclear weapons proliferation. I remind the House of recommendation 3 of the first Fox report, which reads in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable members know that that is the one binding and firm recommendation of the first report. We know that if we continue to mine uranium we will accelerate the development of nuclear weapons not only by those nations which already have them but also by other nations which wish to get them. </para>
          <para>Turning to the other provisions, the Government &#39;s fifth safeguard provides a so-called fall back position. If the international safeguards fail to apply the bilateral agreement, Australia would give guarantees similar to those international guarantees. That may make the international safeguards work in some situations in which they might not otherwise work. But it does not get around the problem that international safeguards may not be effective even when they can be applied. If the safeguards are weak in the first place there is little point in patting oneself on the back because one has a fall back position that ensures that they will be applied. </para>
          <para>The Fraser Government&#39;s sixth proposal- the re-export provision- has the potential to be the best aspect of the Fraser Government&#39;s proposals. Under the bilateral agreements, reexport of Australian uranium by an approved client would be conditional on Australian Government approval. If this could be made to stick, then of course it would be an extremely valuable safeguard. The Prime Minister was extremely short on detail about how such an agreement could be enforced. The only sanction that springs to mind is enforcement of contractual obligation through the international justice machinery. It is hard to see how such a sanction would act to deter a customer bent on re-exporting. Cutting off future supplies need not deter. I hope the Acting Prime Minister understands that. It did not deter India when Canada cut off supplies. </para>
          <para>With regard to reprocessing, the Government&#39;s offer is a pledge to consult and co-operate with international studies and consultations. This is a rather dishonest way of dodging the issue. In particular I refer to the crucial debate about reprocessing between the United States and European governments. This debate has not stopped reprocessing with its attendant dangers of proliferation. All that the Government&#39;s commitment means is that Australia will not take a firm stand on reprocessing, nor has it anything of substance to contribute to the debate. If it has, I have not heard it from the Acting Prime Minister. I hope to hear it in this debate. </para>
          <para>It is just as unrealistic to expect that Australia could enforce adequate physical security over nuclear materials. How could we do this if yellowcake is already in the hands of a customer? How could it be enforced? Even more farfetched is the implication in the fifth provision of the Fraser Government&#39;s proposal that nuclear material supplied by Australia should remain under safeguards for its full life. The full life of nuclear material is at least 300 000 years. It is about time that the people who talk about looking after and pohang these safeguards understood that point. How could such a provision be enforced? Australia could not ensure that safeguards would apply for one year, let alone 300 000 years! </para>
          <para>In total, these provisions provide no safeguards for the peaceful use of any Australian exports of uranium. There are no teeth in these safeguards. They could not be enforced. The only card the Australian Government has is to withhold further supplies once a breach has occurred. In this situation part of Government policy would have to be as in recommendation 6 of the first Fox report which the Government has already rejected. Recommendation 6 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A decision to mine and sell uranium should not be made unless the Commonwealth Government ensures that the Commonwealth can, at any time, on the basis of considerations of the nature discussed in this report, immediately terminate those activities, permanently, indefinitely or for a specified period. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This may prevent aggravation but it will not undo the basic damage. Until safeguards covering the disposal of Australian uranium can be assured there is only one course open to the Australian Government- it must stop the mining and export of Australian uranium. The safeguards contained in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement are only a mask for the Government&#39;s basic motive, and that is greed. The Government wants to make more money. It wants to earn money by exporting uranium. However, I shall deal more fully with this matter in another debate. The greed of Liberal Party thinkers and National Country Party thinkers emerged clearly at the New South Wales Liberal Party conference last weekend. The conference expressed its support for a motion that the mining of uranium go ahead as quickly as possible. This motion was justified by the cold cash ethic that if Australia does not get its uranium out and sell it as quickly as possible it will miss out. As an after thought, a clause on safeguards was added from the floor. This shows the priority that the coalition parties give to safeguards! The coalition does not care about safeguards as long as the mining companies can get in for their cut and grab for the money as soon as possible. That is the morality of this Government and its supporters. </para>
          <para>For the reasons I have outlined the Opposition sees no reason to modify its stand. I remind honourable members opposite that the Australian Labor Party will not honour contracts to export uranium entered into by this Government. It is only recently that there has been an understanding that miners would have to be prepared to invest some $200m. We need to be given time to conduct a general debate on this issue. We need time for people to understand the real issues. </para>

            <para>- The future of uranium development and Australia&#39;s policy on nuclear safeguards and nuclear nonproliferation are among the most important issues facing the Government, the Parliament and the people of Australia today. Last week the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> made a major and important statement on Australian safeguards and nuclear non-proliferation policy. The Parliament now has before it the final report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. These are questions of supreme importance to Australia and to the international community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The energy crisis of the last few years has had profound implications for international relations and quite clearly is of major concern to the future economic growth and well being of mankind. The dwindling world supplies of petroleum have made it abundantly clear that the world must turn to other sources of energy.  President  Carter has crystallised this problem in a dramatic way in his energy policy announcement of 20 April. The central theme of that policy, which was acknowledged by the major industrial countries at the world economic summit meeting a few weeks ago, is that the world must adjust to the new realities in energy supply and usage. If it does not do so the world economy will be faced with precipitate and cataclysmic adjustments in the mid-1980s, the economic ramifications of which will be felt by developed and less developed countries alike. </para>
          <para>Australia is, of course, fortunate in that we are well endowed with indigenous energy resources. Our contribution and the part we can play in this international problem, is that of a reliable and dependable supplier of energy sources to those countries that are obliged to make the more painful and difficult adjustments than we ourselves will have to bear. Very clearly the major industrial countries must turn to an increased usage of coal and nuclear energy to satisfy their long term requirements. Australia has vast resources of coal and we have vast resources of uranium. The responsibility of Australia regarding these resources to the international community is real and clear. When it was in office the Whitlam Government clearly recognised these responsibilities. Our Government also recognises them. </para>
          <para>The use of uranium for nuclear electricity generation raises very special problems. These were, of course, very clearly recognised in the reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. Some of the problems have attracted increased international attention in recent times. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his statement to this Parliament on 24 May, clearly there has been an important statement by  President  Carter on nuclear energy in which he emphasised the need to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons or explosive capabilities without forgoing the tangible benefits of nuclear power. </para>
          <para>The Government has received the second report of the Ranger Inquiry. The inquiry is of course in the nature of an advisory body on environmental matters and has made a number of recommendations to the Government. But let me stress that ultimately it has to be the Government which will make the decisions on whether there should be further development. The Government was elected by the people of Australia and it therefore has the responsibility for decisionmaking in this matter. The Government, being the Government of Australia, must take the whole spectrum of national interests into account in making these decisions. It is not appropriate for me at this stage to comment in detail on the recommendations of the Fox inquiry. There are, however, a number of issues raised by the inquiry which are important to the debate. The importance of uranium in the world scene is wellrecognised. It is already important to the economies of many industrialised countries and it is being recognised by developing countries as vital to their prospects for economic growth. </para>
          <para>Already over 1 80 nuclear reactors are in operation, another 300 are under construction or on order, plus nearly 300 more are in the planning stages. This is a total of nearly 800. This is an enormous investment when one recognises that the cost of each power station is approximately $ 1,000m. In spite of the minimal exploration effort compared with that of other countries, the Alligator Rivers area, the subject of the inquiry, already accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the worlds known low-cost uranium reserves. More importantly in the world energy scene, the Alligator Rivers area is the worlds largest uncommitted uranium province. The development of that resource could make a similar contribution to Australia as did the development of the iron ore or coal industries in the 1960s. Naturally, development of these uranium resources would have a much greater impact on the economy of the Northern Territory. Such development would provide a firm basis for Northern Territory statehood. A greater exploration effort would certainly result in the region becoming even more vital to the world, to Australia, and to the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>Putting aside these obvious benefits, let us have a look at what the Fox Inquiry itself had to say. The Fox Inquiry identified 5 problems associated with uranium development. But it said that the most serious danger is the possible proliferation of nuclear weapons. In its second report, the Inquiry set out its attitude on this issue as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We did not make a recommendation about what Australia should do about the danger. The risk was apparent and great, but international relations (including trade, diplomatic and defence considerations) were involved and a decision as to the correct strategy had to be made by those equipped to make it. We know enough of the considerations affecting resource strategy to be aware of its complexity and the impact it can have on world affairs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Inquiry stated: </para>
          <list type="upperalpha">
            <item label="(A)">
              <para>That total renunciation of intention to supply was not justified, and was undesirable. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(B)">
              <para>That the options were either to proceed to supply as soon as practicable or to delay making a decision about supplying for a period of several years. In our view, a decision on the options depended largely on what was deemed to be the best strategy in relation to the matter of proliferation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In other words, the Inquiry outlined the issues, but left it to the Government to take the final decisions. These issues have to be seen in the context of international developments. I have particularly in mind the initiatives of the United States, Canadian and Australian Governments to the further strengthening of international safeguards arrangements. There have been extensive consultations between the 3 Governments on this matter. The recent initiatives of the Carter Administration are of particular importance. President Carter has committed the United States to the continued development of its program of light water reactors. At the same time, however, the United States Government is seeking to restrain the development of the plutonium economy. It has been made clear to Australia that it can play a central role in this area. Surely there can be no doubt that, if Australia were to make its uranium resources available, the strengthening of nuclear safeguards would be greatly enhanced. The possibility of premature development of the plutonium economy, with its implications for nuclear proliferation, could be avoided. It is only by acting now that we can contribute to long-term global stability. </para>
          <para>The recent statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on our policy on safeguards will make a substantial contribution towards achieving such stability. Where does the Opposition Labor Party stand on the issue? In an address to the United Nations the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> when he was Prime Minister reminded the world that the quest for resources was the oldest of all the causes of war. The Fox Inquiry itself stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It may be that by supplying some countries we would help to relieve those pressures which can lead to armed conflict, nuclear or non-nuclear. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But what is the Labor Party proposing to do? It wants to withhold uranium from the world thereby contributing to a situation which, in the view of the Leader of the Opposition, can only lead to an increase in global tension. Not only would such an attitude by the Labor Party lead to tensions regarding resources but would also contribute to what  President  Carter and many governments, including the Australian Government, are seeking to avoid, namely, the more rapid development of the plutonium economy with the attendant risk of nuclear proliferation. I was most disturbed at the scare-mongering tactics used by the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> in commenting on the Prime Minister&#39;s safeguards statement. He rubbished the International Atomic Energy Agency. In rubbishing the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, the honourable member has said that there is an implied reliance in the Government&#39;s policy on IAEA safeguards which, he claims, the Fox Inquiry said were next to useless. I draw attention to the section entitled Conclusions in chapter 13 of the First Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission recognises that these defects, taken together, are so serious that existing safeguards may provide only an illusion of protection. However we do not conclude that they render valueless the concept <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> international safeguards. We believe it is both essential and possible to make safeguards arrangements more effective. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister does, of course, go well beyond existing safeguard requirements. It is directed to achieving safeguards arrangements which are more effective. It requires conditions of control and use of Australian uranium over and above just the application of IAEA safeguards, the task of which is to verify that nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses. These cover: Careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment, and reprocessing; and physical security. This comprehensive approach is closely in line with the recent United States and Canadian policy and it builds on the recommendations of the First Fox Report. </para>
          <para>Of course, one important aspect of the comprehensive safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister is a requirement for IAEA safeguards. Equally, this is an important requirement of the safeguards policy recently announced by  President  Carter. Like the United States, we believe that the IAEA should remain a central element in nuclear safeguards systems. We will collaborate with the United States and other countries in further strengthening the IAEA. </para>
          <para>I would most sincerely urge the honourable member for Blaxland, in the interests of mankind, not to rubbish the IAEA. The policy put forward in the Government&#39;s statement represents a practical, reasonable and effective safeguards regime to seek from countries wishing to import uranium from Australia under any future contracts. The policy goes beyond a mere acceptance by Australia of our international obligations as a party to the non-proliferation treaty. It constitutes a policy as stringent as that adopted by any nuclear supplier. It incorporates and builds on the findings of the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. It incorporates the kinds of ideas in relation to safeguards being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, who, of course, was quite keen to see uranium developed during his period as Prime Minister. The policy which has been announced provides a firm basis on which we can work with others to strengthen international safeguards regimes in the world nuclear industry. Our policy and safeguards arrangements will be kept closely under review to take account of the future evolution of safeguards. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the attitudes and policies of the Labor Party and examine them in detail. Despite the conclusions of the first Fox Report and its recommendations on parliamentary debate, the Labor Party pre-empted any debate and formulated a fixed and unrealistic policy. So much for a parliamentary debate. Like the Government, the Labor Party has said that existing uranium contracts should be honoured. However, unlike the Government, which has not yet made any final decisions on new mining, the Labor Party pre-empted all rational discussion on these matters by saying: No new mining development is to take place. I would point out that the Labor Party has made this statement despite the Inquiry saying that a total refusal to supply would place Australia in clear breach of Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The most charitable view that I can take of the Labor Party&#39;s attitude is that it has been prepared by a group of incompetents. On the one hand, it says Australia should honour existing contracts, but on the other hand it says: No new mining developments. I ask: How on earth does the Labor Party expect contracts to be honoured when there is not enough uranium at the existing mine at Mary Kathleen and in the Government&#39;s stockpile? Presumably Labor would purchase overseas or renege on those contracts which it said it would honour. </para>
          <para>I remind the Opposition that its platform says that Labor will work for enrichment of Australian uranium resources in plants which are located in Australia. How do you enrich uranium if you are not going to mine it? Yet here is the Labor Party&#39;s 1975 election policy. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> has alleged that this Government was intent on committing Australia to a supplier role in the Western world &#39;s nuclear energy industry and that it has encouraged mining companies to enter longterm contracts for the supply of uranium, including to such countries as Iran. Obviously, the honourable member was asleep during his 3 years in Government; or perhaps he chose to ignore what his colleagues were doing. I would draw the attention of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition, to a joint Press statement of 2 November 1974 between the then Prime Ministers of Australia and Japan wherein it was said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tanaka</inline>expressed his appreciation of the confirmation of supply by Australia to Japan of the contracted 9000 short tons of uranium . .  </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Just 2 days earlier, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> had the following to say in a statement entitled <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory Uranium,</inline> which he tabled in this House: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When Australia negotiates further sales it will do so as a willing seller seeking willing buyers. In particular, we will ensure that our major trading partners-Japan, Italy and West Germany-obtain an equitable share of the uranium we have for export. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Not long after these 2 statements were madeabout 2 months- the then Prime Minister, now Leader of the Opposition, went on a long tour of Europe where he talked about uranium, among other things. He was virtually peddling Australian uranium to all the interested governments of Europe. Presumably he found what we have found- that one of the first things foreign governments, companies and individuals want to talk to us about is Australia&#39;s uranium resources. Obviously, he was successful. </para>
          <para>In making the second reading of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>International assurances have been provided by Ministers that Australia will meet the uranium requirements of our major trading partners, which could amount to a total of about 100 000 tonnes of uranium . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the second reading speech on that Bill, Labor committed us to supplying 100 000 tonnes of uranium. It is intriguing that in alleging that the Government was encouraging sales, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred to only one country- Iran. Let us look at that question. I deny that this Government has encouraged mining companies to enter into long-term contracts for supplying uranium to Iran or any other country. However, I cannot make this denial on behalf of the previous Government. I would remind the House that in March 1975 the friend and colleague of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, namely, the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> visited Iran in his then role of  Deputy  Prime Minister and Treasurer. He was accompanied by the then Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> At the end of their visit, they released a joint statement with the Iranians which included the following sentence: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Ministers agreed that Iran would be given access to supplies of uranium from Australia under favourable conditions. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I need add no more to the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This recital of statements by Ministers of the Labor Governmentstatements which would have been taken at their face value by our trading partners- lead me to ask: Where does the Labor Party stand on this question? Why is it that while in government Labor adopted a responsible position, whereas now in Opposition it is not only irresponsible but it is also incompetent? In office, the Labor Government committed Australia to supply 100000 tonnes of uranium. We have inherited that commitment. Now Labor wants to walk away. It wants Australia to abrogate Labor&#39;s commitment to supply 100 000 tonnes of uranium to our trading partners. What new information does Labor have that the Ranger inquiry did not have, that the Government does not have, which makes Labor say: No new mining. </para>
          <para>I believe that the best way to sum up the position presently facing Australia is by posing a series of questions. Is the Australian economy so strong that we can deny ourselves the clear economic benefits that would flow from the mining and export of uranium? Is our balance of payments so secure that we can forgo the considerable boost which uranium exports will bring? There are other wider questions of more farreaching consequences than the effects on the Australian economy. For example, will there be a nuclear power industry around the world regardless of whether Australian exports uranium? Would a refusal to supply uranium to countries which need it adversely affect our relationships with those countries? Will a refusal to supply create serious tensions internationally? Would we be in a better position to influence the course of the world uranium industry, especially in regard to waste disposal, to safeguards and to control of materials, instead of being right out of the industry? Not only has the Government to accept its responsibilities to the Australian people in finding the answers to these questions but also I believe the Australian people must answer them in a manner which will serve the best interests of mankind, not for tomorrow but for the next decade and for the next century. </para>

            <para>- It is about time that the Government came clean on the question of uranium exports. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is just starting to put on a little bit of pace. Let me just make this point clear. I quoted as the basis for the last major speech I made on this subject in the House of Representatives 2 extracts from the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquirythe Fox report. It is stated on page 1 79 of the report: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>A total renunciation of intention to supply designed to bring an end to all nuclear power industries or all  further  development of them would in our view be likely to fail totally in its purpose. If the purpose were simply to draw international attention to the dangers of and associated with the industry, that purpose might be achieved, but it is most unlikely that any worthwhile action would result. On the other hand, there are positive reasons against adopting such a course. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report goes on to state on page 1 80: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are aware of the view that total renunciation of intention to supply is undesirable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree with those sentiments and I stand by the remarks I made in the previous speech about them. But implicit in the Labor policy is this: The international nuclear industry is unintentionally contributing, as the Fox inquiry suggested, to the risk of nuclear war. For this reason, Labor has placed emphasis upon the question of safeguard development and waste disposal technology. Let me repeat the words uttered by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> in his first statement to the House on the presentation of the first Fox report. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government welcomes any international initiatives for strengthening the international non-proliferation regime. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, he said that the Government will do nothing itself about it. But if somebody else does the work to propose new safeguards, then maybe the Government will adopt them. There was no intention on the part of the Government at that time- that is 5 months ago- to do anything about safeguards. The Government has stolen the spirit of the Labor safeguard policy and tried to twist it so as to suggest that Labor is trying to put the damper on the development of the international nuclear community by withholding Australian reserves when, in fact, what we have been saying is that time has to be devoted to the development of international safeguards for protection against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We have said that this will take time, just as the strategic arms limitation talks have taken time between only 2 major super powers. Those talks have taken years. What we are dealing with here is a regime of safeguards governing a whole gaggle of nations who have moved and are moving into nuclear power. To do anything substantial about the development of safeguards will be a long, arduous and complex task. All we ask of the Government is this: Do not discount our asset. </para>
          <para>Do not discount our leverage by permitting exports now. Try to at least get some real improvement in the nature of these safeguards. </para>
          <para>The Minister says that the policy of the Opposition is to move the world closer towards a plutonium economy and that we should fall into line immediately with the policy of the United States of America to prevent this. I think that the prima facie policy of the United States is commendable. I said so in my last major speech in the Parliament on the subject that the policy of the United States is important because of its pervasive influence in the West, in the nuclear industry, in technology, in the monetary system and in global defence. Obviously, the United States has a huge input into the West in terms of any policy initiative it seeks to have accepted. But the point is, as the  Deputy  Prime Minister is aware, the French and the Japanese will go it alone in fast breeder development no matter what the United States says. That is how they see it. These nations are short on resources and because they have progressed in fast breeder technology they will not fall over themselves to suit United States nuclear policy. A little bit of the rub of what the United States is now doing is to opt out of fast breeder development because it is in some respects having problems with fast breeder technology development. </para>
          <para>The real issue is this: The world, regardless of the fast breeder, will come to rely upon a large program of conventional thermal reactors. The fast breeder reactor, even if its development were accelerated, would not be a large component of the commercial reactor programs of the Western world until around the turn of the century or later. The development of pilot fast breeder reactors is just beginning. It will be beyond the turn of the century before they proliferate to become a large component of nuclear power generation. At that stage there will be a larger market for uranium to fuel conventional nuclear reactors. The  Deputy  Prime Minister said that I had rubbished- that is the world he used- the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. He said that I did this to the detriment of that Agency and to the detriment of mankind. Let me quote what was stated in the Fox report in regard to the IAEA safeguards, lt is stated at page 120: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Experience with IAEA safeguards demonstrates that countries have noi been prepared - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I stress the words &#39; not been prepared &#39;-  to accept continuous surveillance of nuclear activities by an external authority. The control system established by the Agency involves accounting methods augmented by regular on the spot&#39; inspections. The inspections are carried OUt by a  team of skilled personnel within the IAEA: as at 30 June 1976 according to information available to the Commission, there were 79 inspectors, of whom about 50 regularly carried out inspections. Several witnesses were of the opinion that this force was far too small to maintain effective surveillance of existing installations covered by IAEA safeguards. </para>
          <para class="block">In addition, I will quote from the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister when the first Fox report was presented. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission recognises that these defects taken together are so serious that existing safeguards may provide only an illusion of protection. However, we do not conclude that they render valueless the concept of international safeguards. We believe it is both essential and possible to make safeguard arrangements more effective. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Could anyone now complain that I monstered the IAEA or that I have rubbished the IAEA? All I am saying is that the International Atomic Energy Agency is an imperfect instrument in a very imperfect nuclear world and that the basis of the Government&#39;s safeguards policy is too reliant upon the IAEA system of safeguards which is clearly inadequate. The Fox report backs what I said. So I think I have had enough of the Deputy Prime Minister trying to lecture me about the IAEA to disguise the real question about the competence of the IAEA to render an effective system of safeguards. The system just clearly does not exist. The Deputy Prime Minister says in his speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Our policy incorporates the kinds of ideas in relation to safeguards being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, the Government has incorporated the policies of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam).</inline> The Government has trailed the Opposition in nuclear policy all along. The Government had no idea of safeguards. The Government had no idea what to do with Australia&#39;s uranium policy. Now it is trying to pick up our lines on safeguards. But instead of doing it as we have and suggesting that time is needed for the development of adequate safeguards the Government is now formulating instant policy such as the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> before he left for the United States a week ago. This was a similar proposal to that the Leader of the Opposition enunciated in his speech in the Parliament a month ago. So much for your flattery of the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s proposal. All you have done is adopt his proposal and yet manage to abort the intention of his speech. So really you have not thought about safeguards. You have not really thought about the international environmental interest or the dangers. All you have thought about is getting your greasy little paws on the money even at this point when a proper market has not even developed- assuming that the market is your criterion. </para>
          <para>The  Deputy  Prime Minister in his speech said that the Labor Party decision pre-empted the Government&#39;s decision on the question of exports. Let us get this in perspective. The Labor Party made its decision after the presentation of the first Fox report which addressed itself to the question of exports. The second Fox report deals only with mining particular deposits in the Northern Territory. It is the first report which deals with the question of whether Australia should export. That report was presented on a Thursday, the last sitting day of a parliamentary week, about 5 or 6 months ago. On the following Tuesday you were to make a statement in the Parliament about the first report and about exports in relation to existing contracts. What you intended to do was jamb the Opposition into a parliamentary debate - </para>

              <para>- When I said &#39;you&#39; I meant the Government, so-called. The Government then proposed that the policy on existing contracts be debated forthwith. The Opposition of course, being a parliamentary party, had to come into the chamber with a defined attitude, and we met that day to determine it. When the Government found out that we had determined our policy it backed-01 and called off the debate. Let that go on the record. The Government thought that it was being smart in trying to jamb us into a premature policy. We had the first Fox report and made up our mind on the basis of it. Considering all the qualifications addressed to the dangers of nuclear power in that report we decided that we would opt for a position of delay, and we carried a motion which I have often recounted to the House. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Further on in his speech the  Deputy  Prime Minister said that the Opposition would run out on existing contracts because we could not meet them. All that the Opposition says is that to the best of Australia &#39;s capacity Australia would meet existing contracts from what is available at the Mary Kathleen mine and from the government stockpile. There would be a shortfall of about 1700 tonnes to 2000 tonnes between the contracted tonnage and our capacity to meet the contracts, but those deliveries will take place after 1984. The major contractee is Japan. It has scaled back the proportion of electricity generation attributable to nuclear power from 60 million kilowatts to 36 million kilowatts. Obviously Japan is in the process now of stockpiling uranium but only at reasonable prices. In respect of the delivery of 1 700 tonnes after 1 984-a good 6 to 8 years away- Japan, West Germany and the United States of Amercia which are the 3 countries to have contracted with us have plenty of time in which to arrange alternative supplies if they want to do so. They can get 1 700 tonnes in a butcher&#39;s shop without having to worry about whether Australia alone can supply it. So to the best of our ability we would supply it without needing to develop new mines. We have said that we will honour the existing contracts without rushing into a premature policy on new mines. </para>
          <para>The Deputy Prime Minister was rude enough to try to lecture us on our policy when the Government does not even have a policy. It has a day to day policy. It does not have a platform on this matter and never has had one. Yet he had the temerity to stand up and tell us what our platform on uranium is. Well, the parliamentary Labor Party just happens to have the right under our Federal rules to determine between conferences what the policy should be, and we have opted for a delay in the development of Australian uranium. Let me now refer to what was said in the Fox report. On page 1 80 the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Japan is perhaps the country most likely to need Australian uranium and it has already contracted for supply of all its requirements until 198S, almost entirely with countries other than Australia. When taken in conjunction it seems to us that these factors make delay an option which might reasonably be followed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I shall repeat that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">When taken in conjunction it seems to us that these factors make delay an option which might reasonably be followed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On page 1 8 1 the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Because the evidence from which each line of argument is derived remains conjectural and also for reasons stated earlier when discussing the proliferation problem, we have not found a compelling basis for a conclusion on the question whether it is preferable to delay coming to a decision about mining for a period of several years or alternatively to proceed with carefully planned development of the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words the Fox Commission made no decision about delay but canvassed it heavily in the report. The second Fox report not only canvassed the question of delay but also costed it. Discussing the economic effects of delaying the start of new uranium mining in Australia, the Commission said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A 2-year delay in the development of a national uranium industry accompanied by an equivalent delay in the incidence of benefits and costs would cause a loss of approximately 1 7 per cent of the present worth of estimated net economic benefits. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Seventeen per cent for 2 years. It continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This would be equivalent to a reduction in present worth of $99m at 1976 price levels in the case of a low estimate and $624m in the case of a high estimate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commission then went on to cost a 5-year delay. So the Opposition is in line not only with the spirit of the first Fox report which talks about the development of safeguards and the consequences of a delay but also with the second Fox report which suggests a sequential basis of development of Australian mines. Why did the second report of the Fox Commission suggest a sequential basis of development? It was purely and simply because it believed that three or four mines each with a throughput capacity of 3000 tonnes a year would depress the current uranium market. That is why the Commission went for the Ranger development at 3000 tonnes a year. The reason the Commission talked about delay was that in its view the market has not developed. </para>
          <para>Let us leave the environmental questions, the global environment interests and the moral questions aside for one moment and dwell upon the market. Does anybody in the Government seriously suggest that there is at present a market for uranium in the world with spot sales at $30, $36 and $40 a lb? In many mines the cost of production is just under $30 a lb. Mary Kathleen cannot produce at less than $28 a lb. I acknowledge that that is an inefficient mine and that a new mine with larger tonnages would produce at less cost. However, the market has not developed. Why was RTZ pressuring the Labor Government to move into Mary Kathleen rather than to develop the Ranger and Pancontinental mines? It was because it did not want those mines depressing world prices. There will not be a real market for uranium until the middle 1980s because the world did not move into nuclear power policy until the Arab oil boycott in 1 972 forced countries to rethink their energy policies. Some moved towards nuclear power. That move in some countries has been temporarily held up by environmental objections and the general view that nuclear power is undesirable. Many countries in which power rationing is a political reality will move ahead with a proportion of their electricity generation coming from nuclear power. So there probably will be some firming of the market in uranium in the middle 1 980s. </para>
          <para>Talking only about the market and commercial aspects, these mines will take about 3 years to fabricate. There is probably a lead time of 18 months to 2 years before they can begin. If the market starts to improve in about 1985 or 1986 a decision on Australian uranium would need to be made in about 1980 or 1981 in order to get the benefit of that market. However, the industry and the Government are suggesting that these reserves will be rendered valueless unless we move now towards a policy to develop these reserves. The reserves have been lying there since the millennium. They were discovered in 1 969 and yet the industry and the Government say they must be developed now to maximum returns. Is anyone seriously contending that, if these reserves were to have been discovered tomorrow, the mining interests would not be intending to mine them with huge returns in the middle 1980s? Of course not. Of course that would be their intention. But because they found them in 1969 they want now to have their hot hands upon the money. Pancontinental was prepared to sign a contract with the Italian hydrocarbon organisation, ENI, at less than $6 a lb only a few years ago. When the Labor Minister for Minerals and Energy said that there would be no export approval, a great hue and cry went up in the industry. What a terrible thing that was! Now, the long term price is around $36 a lb. Spot sales are around $40 a lb. Even given inflation compensation, the price has dramatically improved. </para>
          <para>It is simply a buyer&#39;s market. The European Economic Community and the Japanese will certainly buy uranium. They will stockpile it if the price is right. But they are not desperate. The United States is self sufficient in uranium until about 1987. Japan is self sufficient in uranium until 1990. The European Economic Community will buy cheaply if it can. Yet the fools in the Government want to flog it off as fast as they can mine it so that they can please the local industry. They have no regard for the global environmental interest. They have no regard for the development of safeguards. They do not even have enough damn commercial sense to make the best of a bargain that they want to enter into. The Prime Minister will run to the United States in a week or so and fall at the knees of  President  Carter with his Cart it to Carter policy. He will offer Australian uranium to accommodate that policy. Does Japan, our major trading partner, agree with the Carter policy? Of course not. It is a country without resources. It is committed to allocating a proportion of its electricity generation to nuclear power. That country knows damn well that, if the world moves as  President  Carter wants it to move on the basis of conventional reactors, it will pay through the nose for uranium. It is opposed to that policy and it will go ahead with fast breeders. </para>
          <para>I do not applaud that attitude. I do not applaud the development of the nuclear industry for one moment. But the nuclear horse bolted about 15 years ago. It is now very late in the day to lock the gate. The best we can do in this imperfect system is to improve the safeguards and do something about weapons proliferation and waste disposal. The Opposition is determined that the Government will not get its grubby hands upon the returns from Australian uranium until those conditions are fulfilled. It will not cart it away to please companies until the Australian national interest is met. I have stressed in the Parliament over and over again that a Labor Government will exercise the prerogatives available to it through export controls by interrupting cash flows for these developments if it must, so that a national consensus on uranium policy is reached. We are determined to give effect to this worthwhile objective. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member is only a oncer. He will not be back. He should shut up and keep his place. We will not be caught up in a premature policy by the Prime Minister or the  Deputy  Prime Minister committing himself to exports while in the United States or elsewhere. Let the message be clear. The Opposition does not believe that the total withholding of Australian uranium reserves in perpetuity will stop the development of the nuclear industry. But it believes that Australia has one hell of a card to play in trying to improve the system of international safeguards so as to do something positive for mankind about the threat of nuclear proliferation and contamination of the biosphere and the food chain from these toxic actinidesOpposition members will not depreciate Australia&#39;s assets by falling over themselves to please the United States at the knees of Schlesinger. Carter or anybody else. Australia is a sovereign nation with a sovereign interest and the power to make rational decisions in the national and international interest. No amount of name calling or provocation by the  Deputy  Prime Minister will remove us from that course. The Government had better settle down to understand that the aim of the Opposition and the trade union movement is for a rational policy on the development of Australia&#39;s uranium reserves and the future course of the international nuclear community. We will not be distracted from our path. </para>

            <para>- It is a little hard to follow the reasoning and attitude of the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating).</inline> On one side we had the high minded moral attitudes. On the other side we had the grubby, greasy paw extended. We have always known that he does not realise whether he is Arthur or Martha. That has never been more clear than today. I know he is uncomfortable with the attitudes of his own Party. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This debate is about whether Australia should develop and export its uranium resources. Australia has the greatest known resources of cheap uranium in the world. It is not just a case of whether the world will have uranium because plenty of uranium is available in other countries. It is a case of whether there will be a world shortage of uranium. Those who have been taking the high moral attitude have talked about the danger of world disaster from the nuclear industry. Much, indeed nearly all, of what they have said is true. The weakness of the argument is that the danger will exist irrespective of whether Australia develops and exports uranium. </para>
          <para>An Australian decision to deny or restrict that development would, in no way, decrease any of the real dangers to which they have drawn attention. On the contrary, for reasons I shall give in a moment, it would increase those dangers. Exports of uranium from Australia will do nothing to add to the dangers. Pandora&#39;s box is open. Australia cannot close it. </para>
          <para>The world needs power; it needs energy. For electrical energy which is a great part of the world&#39;s need there is no quick source available except nuclear power. It is the cheapest, cleanest and safest form of power available. It is the cheapest because of the rise in the prices of fossil fuels. To Australia, perhaps, with its abundant supplies of fossil fuels, there is not the same advantage. But for other countries, less fortunate than Australia, cheapness is of some consequence. Nuclear power is the cleanest form of power. Fossil fuels cause pollution and dangers in a way which nuclear power does not. We are all worried, looking ahead, about the change in the earth&#39;s atmosphere which can come from the development of fossil fuel plants and the increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We can conjecture the consequences. We cannot be certain of them. However, the conjecture is not very nice. We see over our cities a haze of pollution. Nuclear power will help us to dissipate that haze. It is the safest form of energy. </para>
          <para>No form of energy is free from difficulties and dangers. But if one adds up the dangers and deaths that we know occur from fossil fuel- in the coal mines, in the transport of fuel and by respiratory disease- we know that they are orders of magnitude greater than even the worst conjectures of the dangers from nuclear power. Nothing in this world is completely safe. Nuclear power is the safest form of energy available to us. </para>
          <para>Those who would deny that power to the rest of the world face a dreadful responsibility. The world&#39;s population grows exponentially and already famine looks to be round the corner. It is only by power, energy, with its effect on the availability of transport and fertiliser and things of this character that we can hope to reduce the danger of world starvation and deprivation. </para>
          <para>We in Australia have a very healthy kind of life, a comparatively luxurious kind of life. Are we to deny those advantages to the rest of the world because we want to sit on those sources of power which are here by geological chance in the Australian soil? The world will not tolerate that, I would think. But it is worse than that. Starving people are desperate people. People deprived of the means of material advance have a habit of seizing what they cannot get by peaceful means. If one thinks of the danger of war, and nuclear war, one of the things we can best do to add to that danger would be to deprive the rest of the world of power, of energy. This is what the policy of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> is designed to do. </para>
          <para>There is a dreadful responsibility on those who, in Australia and elsewhere in the world over the last four or five years, have campaigned as they have against the growth of nuclear energy. Let them remember that in the coming decades millions of people will starve to death because of what they have done. Let them try to bear on their consciences the guilt of those deaths which are now, I am afraid, irrevocable because there is a time lag in all these things. A delay of four or five years has already cost the world dearly enough. </para>
          <para>I am not going to go into the motives or the manipulations of those who have campaigned against nuclear power. I simply draw to the attention of the House the fact that we had a very well organised and well orchestrated campaign. It has not occurred by chance. I am willing to say that in this, as in other cases, most of the victims of this campaign have been sincere people who just do not know what has been done to them, who has done it or why they have done it. </para>
          <para>I return to the fact that it is Australia&#39;s responsibility to the world to mine and make available uranium as quickly as possible. I return to our position here. In a way the Fox reports are already out of date because 3 things have happened which have made them outdated. First there is the impact of the power crisis whose magnitude we have realised only in the last few months. Second there are the Carter initiatives in regard to breeder reactors. I say in passing- it is obviously true- that if we deny ample supplies of uranium to the world we will immensely increase, in Japan and Italy and elsewhere- as the honourable member for Blaxland said a few moments ago- the drive towards the fast breeder reactor. Those who think that there are special dangers in the fast breeder reactor in present circumstances might well consider that by denying uranium to the world they are making the development of that fast breeder reactor inevitable. There is a third thing, which is a local thing, on which perhaps I should not dwell too much. That is that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has made new discoveries in the Alligator River area, not proved as to their magnitude but indicating that under that plain there are numbers of Nabarleks, Rangers and Pancontinentals still to be discovered. </para>
          <para>What about our own Australian advantages? Firstly, the development of uranium would add tremendously to our budget revenues. It would be a profitable trade. I hope that it will all be in Australian hands, but whether or not it is in Australian hands the companies involved will be paying nearly half their profits into the Federal budget. Those profits, looking ahead, would be enough to pay our age pensioners. Who is going to talk about the greasy paws of the age pensioners? I do not think those are suitable words. Surely there is nothing wrong in a government&#39;s thinking ahead for its own revenues on which social development and welfare payments may well depend. </para>
          <para>But secondly there is this little matter of the balance of payments on foreign account. On current account we are already deeply in the red. We are not paying our way. And this is at a time when we are able to produce from our own resources 70 per cent of our oil requirements. We will not produce 70 per cent of our oil requirements from our own known resources very long. It is only six or seven years before we have to find another <inline font-style="italic">$2&#165;i</inline> billion or $3 billion a year in foreign exchange in order to keep our motor transport running. </para>
          <para>Let those who want to delay the development of our uranium remember that they are opting for permanent petrol shortages for the whole of the Australian community. What about these greasy petrol tanks? It is fine to talk of them like that, is it not? But it will not be so fine when the people cannot fill up their cars at the nearest petrol bowser. </para>

              <para>-Sure. That is why it is important to get this development under way as quickly as possible. Speed is of the essence in this because there is a long inbuilt delay between the decision to develop and the actual mining and export of the uranium. It is a delay of years. Time is short- for the Australian Budget, for the Australian motorist. But worse than that, time is short for the world. Those who want to delay our development of uranium bear a dreadful responsibility not only to the Australian people but also to the people who in decades to come will be starving because we did not do things now. </para>

            <para>- I want to quote from the first Fox report where the commissioners mention that in considering the evidence they found:  that many wildly exaggerated statements are made about the risks and dangers of nuclear energy production by those opposed to it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I certainly agree with that. They continued:  what has surprised us more is a lack of objectivity in not a few of those in favour of it, including distinguished scientists . . . There is abundant evidence before us to show that scientists, engineers and administrators involved in the business of producing nuclear energy have at times painted excessively optimistic pictures of the safety and performance, projected or past, of various aspects of nuclear production. </para>
          <para class="block">They go on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Ultimately, when the matters of fact are resolved, many of the questions which arise are social and ethical ones. We agree strongly with the view, repeatedly put to us by opponents of nuclear development, that, given a sufficient understanding of the science and technology involved, the final decision should rest with the ordinary man and not be regarded as the preserve of any group of scientists or experts, however distinguished. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree entirely with that view. Let us go to the final recommendations by the Commissioners because I think that they have been grossly misinterpreted. The first 2 recommendations of the first report are identical in wording after each defines the area of recommendation; in other words, for mining and milling of uranium and for the ordinary operation of nuclear power reactors. The Commissioners say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The hazards - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, the hazards for any of these activities-  if properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to mine and sell Australian uranium. </para>
          <para class="block">If properly regulated and controlled&#39; is the key point. From this, in my view it depends on one&#39;s interpretation of &#39;hazard&#39; as to whether one takes the simplistic view that uranium mining is safe or whether the anxieties surrounding all that flows from such mining, and in essence discussed in the bulk of the report and the subject of the remaining 13 recommendations, mean that the total hazards preclude mining. In the very next recommendation, No. 3, the Commissioners said that &#39;The most serious hazard associated with the industry&#39;- that must mean mining as well as nuclear power reactors for, if not, what else?- &#39;is that the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war&#39;. Recommendation 4 states that the regulation and control of mining is advised, not for the purpose of ensuring that it is just physically safe for the miners at the time, but &#39;for the purposes mentioned in chapter 16&#39;. This chapter deals with wider issues and reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The wider issues . . . arise out of grounds of opposition to the Ranger mining proposal. It was submitted that there were dangers associated with ... the production of power in reactors, that there were serious and unresolved problems concerning the disposal of radio-active wastes, that there were risks of terrorist theft and use of plutonium, and that there were increased risks of nuclear war flowing from nuclear proliferation. It was contended that the continuing development of the nuclear power industry would produce greater inequality - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Not equality, but inequality-  between the developed and underdeveloped countries, and that this is, as well as being undesirable in itself, was likely to lead to increased international tension, lt was submitted that, taken alone, some of those matters constituted sufficient ground for not mining, and that taken together they certainly did so. </para>
          <para class="block">The Commissioners are not necessarily agreeing with all that. They are simply stating that they were the issues raised. Then the Commissioners proceed to try to deal with them. In their assessment of the dangers inherent in the fuel cycle operations, whilst admitting that at present &#39;those risks provide no proper basis for a refusal on our part to supply the advanced industrial countries which are likely to be our customers&#39;, the Commissioners add a rider with an ominous ring: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is possible that, in the future, the operations of a nuclear power industry in a particular country, or the operation of those industries generally, will be found to be more hazardous than now appears. This could simply be the consequence of growth, but is more likely to be the result of information coming to hand as the result of further research and experience. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We have had some examples of that recently and President Carter&#39;s reaction, but I shall come to that point again later. While disposal of low level wastes appears satisfactory at present, they could constitute a problem if supervision were relaxed or if the operation became too widespread, or the bulk too great. But surely this is inherent in the development of nuclear power. As it spreads, these dangers will increase. Then there is the problem of high level waste. Experiments have been going on but no one is yet satisfied about the techniques for the disposal of this high level waste. Even if the spent fuel rods, which now must be stored carefully, are eventually reprocessedthere is some doubt that this will be economically feasible- the problem will arise of what to do with the long lived radio-active constituents in the waste. In either case, storage is reasonably safe, not absolutely safe, provided care is taken and the ponds or tanks are kept in a secure location under regular observation. So the whole lot if ifs and buts go on. </para>
          <para>The Commissioners cannot dismiss the question of terrorism. They point out that while the risk is very small, if this practice were ever indulged in, it would constitute an appalling situation. They say that this risk of terrorism alone does not constitute a sufficient reason for Australia declining to supply uranium but it is an added reason for stringent controls. They go on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The most serious danger in our view is that of proliferation of nuclear weapons. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commission feels this threat, despite the extensive precautions taken under the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards system, to an appropriate commentary on those 2 systems, one can only note  President  Carter&#39;s recent actions which tends to suggest that those 2 agreements probably are nowhere near as safe as we believed. In fact, Carter&#39;s action proved that they were not safe enough by a long chalk. So he is seeking to prove the precautions. Whether he will succeed remains to be seen. The Commissioners said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We mentioned earlier an argument that Australia should permanently refuse to supply uranium . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">They go on to suggest that in their view this threat to never supply uranium may not succeed in achieving the objective of cautioning the world and encouraging it to be more careful. They say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are of the view that total renunciation of intention to supply is undesirable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commissioners state that without qualification. However, they are clearly in favour of temporary postponement of supply. Even if such action does not succeed in deterring other nations from embarking on a program of nuclear power development, at least some of the &#39;existing problems may be more satisfactorily resolved&#39;. The Commissioners state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is a possibility that during this period technological advances will reduce hazards to man and the environment, especially with regard to the treatment and disposal of highlevel radio active wastes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commissioners, whilst concluding that Australia &#39;should take the course which is determined to be the most effective and most practical in order to bring a favourable response from other states in relation to the proliferation problem&#39;, insist that &#39;if the mining and selling of uranium proceeds, it should be on a strictly controlled and regulated basis&#39;. The Commissioners go on to point out many of the controls. Their second report does not relieve any of the anxieties that the first report raised for the would be miners. In fact some commentators suggest that it would enormously increase the cost and reduce the sales and profits. Yet the Commissioners comment: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We see no escape from those disadvantages, serious though some of them may be, if Australia is to participate in the nuclear power industry with a due sense of responsibility to the people of the world and its own people. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">An argument was put to the Commissioners that once mining commences no government would have &#39;the strength to resist the pressures for its continuance and even expansion. &#39; I think this is a very serious difficulty. The Commissioners said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We believe that this is a serious consideration. If the argument is a sound one, then our proper course is to recommend against commencement. What seems to us to be vital is that a clear and firm statement of policy be made at the outset, supported, from the outset, by a strong system of control. If this is done, it is our hope and expectation that governments will be able to maintain effective control for the purposes we have mentioned. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So in my view it is facile but dishonest to interpret the first and second recommendations as approval for mining to go ahead, which is what the Press did initially. The hazards involved, beyond the immediate technical hazards of mining and ordinary operation of nuclear power reactors, have not been resolved. These hazards associated with the nuclear industry may, singly, not be sufficient to suggest uranium should not be mined or exported, but taken together, as they must, they present an overwhelming case at least for postponement of these operations. True, each one is just a straw, but how many straws does one need to break the camel &#39;s back? In no way can recommendation 3 or any of the following recommendations be seen as either unrelated to the first 2 recommendations, or supporting the contention that the first 2 recommendations mean mining and export of uranium by Australia should proceed without a full community debate on all the implications of nuclear power. As the Commissioners pointed out in their introduction, the questions which arise &#39;are social and ethical ones&#39; and so the answers must evolve from discussion in which all sections of the community are involved, not just a small group of self-appointed experts. </para>
          <para>I conclude with some comments on the social and ethical considerations. We have heard a lot about the needs of the world for energy and so on and how, by depriving the world of nuclear power, we will be depriving the underdeveloped countries of great advantages. The sad fact, of course, is that the fruits of nuclear power development as it has been going on thus fargiven the escalating costs and so on, it is difficult to see how the picture will change- go to the developed countries and not to the underdeveloped countries. </para>
          <para>Let me tell a story to try to illustrate the basic anxieties I have. I remember talking to a nuclear physicist about this subject and raising with him my anxieties about nuclear power stations and so on. He said: &#39;I would live next door to a nuclear power station&#39;. I was quite shocked. He could tell by the look on my face that I was shocked. I said: What do you mean?&#39; He said: &#39;I think that it is technically possible to construct safe power stations and it is obviously technically safe to mine uranium if you engage in all the appropriate precautions&#39;. He meant the sorts of things that the Fox report has recommended. I still looked very downcast. He went on to say: &#39;But that does not mean that I would recommend the mining of uranium. That does not mean that I would recommend the building of nuclear power stations&#39;. </para>
          <para>I said: &#39;What are you talking about?&#39; He said: The question is not the safety of the stations; it is mankind&#39;s future and mankind&#39;s needs and there are 2 factors. One is the hazards associated with the end products, such as the waste materials and the plutonium cycle&#39;. He obviously shared the view of the Fox commissioners that these matters still represent a significant hazard that we are not yet sure we can control. All the ifs&#39;- if we can control this, if we can control that and if we do something else- depend not upon the scientists but upon ordinary people and upon governments. </para>

              <para>- They depend upon the security of the societies which use this technique. Someone asked: &#39;How about gunpowder?&#39; One could burn all the gunpowder in the world and not do terribly much harm. Nuclear power is a different order of danger. We are depending for the safety, care and protection of the whole of mankind, by means of proper regulations, upon fallible human societies. We need to protect nuclear waste for a mere 250 000 years. Who would put money on any government surviving for 200 years yet alone 250 000 years? Can we be sure that 200 years from now the government of the United States will be a safe government that is dedicated to using and caring for the nuclear power industry in the way in which the present Government is dedicated? How about some of the tinpot countries- I shall not name themaround the world which are now eager to buy this technology? We are talking nonsense. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What is the other worry? The other worry is the energy requirements. The nuclear power industry may forestall the crisis, if we are lucky, for 40 or 50 years, but what then? This is the second point that this scientist made. He said that mankind is mad because it is proceeding to use energy at a faster rate than is safe or it can produce with its present technology. The only really safe source is solar energy. To continue on this path using nuclear power to aid and abet our greed and our waste of energy resources is simply to put off the day when we will have to face the crunch. I disagree with the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> who spoke before me. If we decline to develop nuclear power now we will more readily recognise the limitations of energy facing mankind and face the problem sooner. </para>

            <para>- I think it is worth remembering what we are actually debating. We are debating whether we should mine and export uranium and, if so, under what conditions and safeguards. We are not debating whether we should have nuclear power stations in this country. There is no such proposal. We are not debating whether we should store nuclear waste in this country. There is no such proposal. The information we have before us is the first report of the Ranger Uranium- Environmental Inquiry- the Fox report- which deals with the export of uranium and which really comes under 5 headings, namely, the dangers associated with mining and milling, the dangers associated with the operation of nuclear reactors, the dangers associated with the safe disposal of nuclear waste and the 2 key questions of terrorist activities and nuclear proliferation. The second Fox report deals not with the general problem of export but with the specific problems of the Northern Territory and has drawn attention to very serious and difficult problems concerning environmental control, respect of the rights of Aborigines and national parks. We also have before us a statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on the safeguards that the Australian Government proposes to apply if we decide to export uranium. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before I look at the disadvantages of exporting uranium I will look at some of the advantages. Firstly, although there is some difference of opinion about what the price is likely to be, at a minimum it could bring in $ 1,200m a year, which should be compared with the $800m derived at present from the wool industry and the amount of something like $2,000m derived at present from the whole mining industry. This is peculiarly important because when our Bass Strait oil runs out in the mid-1980s, if not before, we are going to face a serious balance of payments problem. The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating),</inline> using a rather elegant phrase, said that we could not wait to get our greasy paws on the money. If governments do not see that national resources are kept up, social services inevitably will suffer. It is the duty of a government to see to the best interests of its community. Any responsible government must do that. I think the advantages are great. </para>
          <para>Let us turn to the problems. The first is the problem of terrorists getting hold of nuclear ex- plosives. That is truly a danger, but I think that it as been generally exaggerated. It is much more difficult for terrorists to manufacture an effective nuclear weapon than many people imagine. Nevertheless it is a danger that we must recognise. Secondly, there is the danger of nuclear proliferation, which is very serious indeed. This problem is also sometimes misrepresented. It was misrepresented most recently by the honourable member for Blaxland, who referred to an Indian nuclear explosion. There is no denying that India exploded a nuclear device in 1 974 and that at the same time a bilateral agreement between Canada and India was in force, but that has no similarity with what is being proposed now. </para>
          <para>India is not and was not then a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the safeguards that applied to India at the time were rudimentary and did not exclude the so-called peaceful nuclear explosion; nor did the agreement with Canada apply International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In any case, the nuclear materials used were of Indian origin and not of Canadian origin, as claimed by the honourable member for Blaxland. According to the safeguards proposed by the Prime Minister, India would not be supplied with uranium by this country. Our safeguards are very tight, and far more explicit and go far beyond what is presently applied by any other country. I think that they are a notable contribution to the safeguard situation throughout the world. </para>
          <para>It is worth remembering that as an exporter we would have some chance of influencing the situation about nuclear safeguards. If we refuse to export we will lose that opportunity. The safeguards applied to the transfer of nuclear materials are vital to the future of this world. Further, it does not appear that by refusing to export we would have any influence on this proliferation. The Fox report was quite clear about that. By refusing to export we would have no influence. On the matter of nuclear proliferation it does not matter one way or the other whether we export. The nuclear proliferation will continue just the same. But if we become a controlled exporter we can influence significantly the nuclear safeguards throughout the world. That, to my mind, is a most important contribution that we can make to the future of the world. </para>
          <para>The second danger mentioned is the danger of mining and milling uranium. I do not think that this danger needs to be taken too seriously. No one has made any very substantial suggestions as to the danger of the open cut mining of uranium and the subsequent milling and export of yellowcake. It is much safer, for instance, than coal mining. There is a small problem with regard to the tailings that are left behind after milling. They are radio-active and have to be disposed of. It might be worth mentioning in passing that there was a rather quaint suggestion in the second Fox report which appeared to say that these tailings, mixed with water, should be put into an excavation and that then rocks should be put on top of them. I think we should perhaps draw the attention of the Fox committee to the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Archimedes</inline> a few thousand years ago. I should have thought that the rocks would almost inevitably sink and the water borne tailings would come to the top. That may have been a factor which the Committee did not consider. </para>
          <para>The other factors which we have to consider in the second Fox report in respect of our mining and milling concern the environment, national parks and Aborigines. We must not under-rate rate these considerations but also we must see that they are held in balance, each given its due weight. In the planned uranium mining area in the Alligator River zone there are about 1000 Aborigines. We must, of course, see that their rights are protected. I should like to make one point about them, and I am glad to see that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> is at the table. I am informed that at the moment some of these Aboriginals have very severe alcoholism problems. I mention this now before mining starts because if we do not make it clear that that is the present position we might find a few years after mining starts that mining will be accused of creating their alcoholism problems. I should like to put this fact on the record. The reason for their present state has nothing to do with mining; it is the consequence of recent unwise social policies. </para>
          <para>It is essential that the requirements with regard to the environment and national parks are reasonable. What is suggested in the second Fox report is the machinery, the structure, which if followed exactly would result in something like a 2 year&#39;s delay while mining companies endeavoured to make the necessary inquiries, investigations and submissions. I believe that this is not necessary. We must see that interests are protected, but that this is done in a sensible and reasonable way. In particular, we must see that State and Federal environmental laws for uranium mining and export are coincidental. We must not have a situation where a mining company has to meet 2 separate overlapping environmental requirements. Above all, we must see that the mining companies have a clear code which they can understand and follow. Government has a duty in this regard, and I am sure that this Government will accept that duty. </para>
          <para>The next risk is that of nuclear reactors. The present boiling water reactors are not dangerous. They are substantially safer than fossil fuel power stations. They do not blow up, as some people seem to think. Under certain circumstancesthis is very remote- they might emit some radiation. The only way in which we can really look at the risk is in statistical terms. It has been assessed by the Rasmussen Committee that people living beside a nuclear power station are 300 000 times as likely to be killed in a car accident or 8 times as likely to be killed by a thunderbolt as they are by an emission from a nuclear power station. There is a risk but it is one that must be kept in proportion. </para>
          <para>In any case, is this an issue on which we should make a decision? If the government of a country, knowing the risks, such as there are, of nuclear power stations, decides that it is in the economic and social interests of its people to import uranium for a nuclear power generation system, have we the right to deny that government the uranium? Surely that is a decision that should and must be made by the responsible government concerned. It is true there are dangers in respect of nuclear reactors. The fast breeder reactors certainly have unsolved environmental problems. The reprocessing and the subsequent disposal of waste also has unsolved, but not necessarily insolvable, problems. Australia has 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the easily accessible world uranium sources. If, by denying our uranium to the world, we succeed in creating an artificial shortage of uranium, we will surely accelerate the introduction of a plutonium economy- fast breeder reactors and reprocessing. The fast breeder reactor uses uranium about 30 times as efficiently as an existing reactor. Countries denied uranium will surely look for other ways to use what they have more economically. There is an old saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I fear that many people who campaign against the export of uranium will achieve exactly the opposite of what they hope to achieve. </para>
          <para>We have some moral decisions to make. I should like to put them to the House. The first moral question we have to ask is: Have we the right to decide for other countries whether they should use nuclear power generation, or is that a decision for the governments of the countries concerned? The second question is: Have we the right to neglect to use our power to improve nuclear safeguards? The third moral question we must answer is whether this country with 0.4 per cent of the world&#39;s population has the right to deny the rest of the world access to 25 per cent of its most important energy source. These are most important questions. I submit the answer to the three questions is an unequivocal no. A responsible government must make the decision to make our uranium available to the world. It is true that it would be in our national interest to do so. However, it would also be in the interests of the rest of the world. Therefore, I strongly recommend that we should mine and export our uranium. </para>

            <para>-The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> joined this debate this afternoon and once again displayed his impetuous and almost vandalistic attitude and his desire to consume the finite resources of this country. There is no one in a greater hurry than the Leader of the National Country Party to get stuck into using up our uranium resources. The fact of the matter is that the Acting Prime Minister has continuously pre-empted public debate. Public debate, when it is all said and done, is just not restricted to 3 hours of parliamentary debate. But the people of this country are entitled to know and to be exposed to the pros and cons of the many matters that have been the subject of deliberation by the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. </para>

          <para>The Government has done very little to promote public debate in this country. The Government has brought on this debate very hurriedly before the Parliament goes into recess so that it can say that there has been public debate. No doubt there will be some early governmental action after this debate is concluded. The publicis being left in the dark. </para>

              <para>-That happens to be the situation. The contempt with which the view of the public generally is held is probably best demonstrated by the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> actually made a statement, which is the subject of this debate, one day before the Fox report was presented.

          <para>Shortly stated, the Prime Minister&#39;s statement of 25 May was designed to placate; it was designed to dampen rising public concern. The Prime Minister made ten or eleven points in his statement. One was that His Honour Justice Fox was to be appointed adviser to the Prime Minister on nuclear and associated matters. Criteria for uranium supply were laid out for our consideration. Australia was to be selective about the countries to which uranium was exported. Criteria were to be applied to the non-nuclear weapons states. Uranium would be supplied to them only if they were parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. Uranium would be supplied to nuclear weapon states only if they gave assurances that the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards standards would be maintained. Then there was a provision that once uranium left Australia it had to be covered by the Agency&#39;s safeguards in agreements to export. There were to be bilateral agreements with countries wishing to import Australian uranium to ensure no diversification to military purposes and to allow Australia to cease supply if the Agency safeguards were breached. These safeguards are to apply for the full life of the material. Fallback safeguards are to be included in the bilateral agreements if the nonproliferation Treaty safeguards cease to apply. </para>
          <para class="block">This, in essence, is the outline of the proposals put by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> There are other proposals which time will not permit me to mention.

The nonproliferation Treaty is said to be inadequate and ineffective. After all, His Honour stated: </para>

              <para>-I think it is a good point. I raise it objectively because, if anybody is capable and competent to provide useful advice about this vital matter, it is one of those 2 departments. There is no point in being enthusiastic about the production of uranium for power and the resultant benefits to the world if we do not tie up the non-proliferation factor. It seems to me that by either design or omission Fox has been recreant to his responsibility or the Government has been recreant to its responsibility by not ensuring that the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs gave evidence on this important matter. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Then, I ask: What sanctions can Australia realistically expect to impose in order to enforce safeguards policy? If these policies, which the Prime Minister has outlined as Government policy, are not given effect to, what do we do? What are the sanctions? I suppose that once countries with a similar philosophy to ours would have sent in a gunboat. In any event, this is a Government which believes in sanctions. We have been talking about the Industrial Relations Bureau. What are the sanctions to apply in relation to the breaching of an undertaking in this respect? Do we stop trade with the countries concerned? Do we refuse to export uranium? Do we break off diplomatic relations? Frankly, I do not think any of those alternatives are acceptable or effective. We cannot afford to stop trade. In any event, if safeguards are ignored after export, the damage is done. I describe the situation in terminology which the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is certain to understand: The horse would have bolted and dire consequences would follow. </para>
          <para>If we fulfil safeguards and do not export to countries which have dealt with non-signatories to the non-proliferation Treaty and which are developing plutonium economies, we must bypass the United States of America which has sold enriched uranium to India, and also Japan which, through its Australian Ambassador this week called on Australia to ignore the policy of the Carter Administration against fast breeder reactors which Japan is rapidly developing. Then there is the question of physical protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox concluded: </para>

          <para class="block">Recently, as is now generally known, an American college student and a British newspaper developed ways of constructing nuclear weapons. All they required was plutonium to complete their bombs. Unfortunately, in America alone, over 9000 tonnes of plutonium was listed as unaccounted for last year by the General Accounting Office. In addition, a United States based nuclear brokerage house has confirmed that, in 1976, it sold to foreign buyers 1 12 pounds of plutonium- enough for 3 large bombs -in 2 separate transactions. </para>
          <para>The belief that bilateral agreements will prevent the proliferation of the nuclear club is naive and not based on known facts. Even if bilateral agreements are made and if importing nations use Australian uranium for peaceful purposes, Australia has no guarantee that this will not simply replace uranium diverted to explosive weapon making. There is nothing in the Prime Minister&#39;s catalogue of assurances which safeguards this position at all. In other words, we could be supplying uranium for <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> and non-belligerent purposes but that uranium could be taking the place of uranium which could be used for those undesirable purposes. The decision of the Nixon administration in 1973 to allow private enterprise to take over from the Atomic Energy Commission meant that in 1974, when the United States Atomic Energy Commission announced it was to cease selling uranium, it artifically forced prices to skyrocket. </para>
          <para class="block">As a result the bottom dropped out of the United States domestic market and 2 United States corporations, General Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corporation, face losses said to be in region of $500m each. For these corporations only the proliferation of nuclear reactors can save their huge investments. Thus, a grey market has developed. In addition, both West Germany and France, with nuclear technology comparable with that of the United States have begun their own sales campaign. France is to supply Pakistan with a $25 billion reactor and West Germany is to supply Brazil with an $8 billion reactor capable of separating plutonium from other waste products. </para>
          <para>The decision of President Carter on 7 April this year to halt the development of a plutonium economy has not stopped France or West Germany, nor has it stopped Iran&#39;s search for a nuclear reactor. The essence of the problem is not only the halting of fast breeder development but also the complete cessation of the use of nuclear fuel because plutonium- admitted by all to be a greater risk to world peace- can be made from the waste products of water cooled reactors. <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> magazine has alleged that Israel has 13 nuclear bombs, made using plutonium allegedly delivered by the Central Intelligence Agency from the United States stockpile. By the end of this year 5 more military dictatorships will possess nuclear weapons. I refer to Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, the Argentine and South Africa. Who wants to leave the destiny of mankind in the hands of unelected and undemocratic national leaders? </para>
          <para>The safeguard issue appears to be a cover for the clash between the 2 commercial interests which stand to gain or to lose the most, that is, the uranium miners and the reactor manufacturers. The miners want high prices for their product while the nuclear reactor manufacturers must boost world sales to recoup their investments. To do this they must first maintain low prices for enriched uranium and, secondly, they must stop the development of fast breeder technology which cuts into their market. The fifth point of the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, requiring that all nuclear material be kept under full safeguards for the full life of the material, by implication requires that this protection will continue for 250 000 years. We know all about the arrangements under which the storage is to take place. Subterranean salt beds are to be used and there is to be a vitrification process, but can honourable members imagine somebody standing guard over these pits for a quarter of a million years? Can we really be certain that deposits so dangerous to the world will be effectively safeguarded? Notwithstanding the potential reprocessing of waste products to develop plutonium, the issue of storing waste products is of great importance. The Fox report stated: </para>

          <para>The fact of the matter is that there are many matters unresolved and which stand in doubt. I believe that the policy of the Labor Party, which is being formulated progressively but which still represents sensible objectivity, ought to be looked at very carefully by the Australian people. We advocate that until the questions that I have asked, and many others which I could ask if there were more time, are answered there ought to be a moratorium over the exploitation of uranium. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I have only one thing to say about uranium and that is: Dig it up and sell it as soon as possible. I will give my reasons for saying that but before I do I must say that the Opposition today has made one of the most puerile contributions to this debate that I have ever heard. The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> offered only one assertion, that is, that Labor had led the field in the marketing and safeguarding of uranium. That is absolute nonsense. What it did was lead the retreat from responsibility and that is the truth which everyone in this House knows. The Opposition held up uranium mining for no real purpose at all. During Labor&#39;s last 2 years in office, when it could have been doing something about it, it did nothing. It had the opportunity but the Lefties, as always, had Labor very solidly by the important parts and it was tied up. They tied up the Labor Government so much that nothing happened and we are hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. The Australian economy has lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to this delay. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition when in Government was able to find a lifebelt in the Fox inquiry to stop a row within its own Party about the marketing of uranium. That was another $5m or so down the drain and further delay. In 1975 we came into office and found ourselves faced with the difficulties of the Fox inquiry but we were prepared to go on with it. I have seen one or two disrespectful accounts of the Fox inquiry and one of them seems to sum up the 2 volumes of the Fox report in one simple sentence: Your attitude to uranium mining depends on what sort of person you are. I think that is a fair comment on the whole report. Certainly the report went into a lot of detail, technicalities and so on, but I do not think it has really advanced the argument on whether or not we should dig up and sell uranium any further than if it had never been published. </para>
          <para>In any case, the Fox inquiry does not seem to have found any real reason why we should not go on with uranium mining and I think that the Opposition is really wasting its time trying to hold up the exercise. Certainly there has been a hue and cry in the community, largely started by the same gang of pro-communist agitators who are doing a splendid job of wrecking the trade union movement and trying while they are at it to destroy this country. Unfortunately, and this always happens, good people are fooled and drawn in. That sort of thing has happened many times before. We can all recollect the story of Chicken Little who panicked the whole farmyard by crying that the sky was falling. That is the sort of thing to which the Opposition has been contributing. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> in his contribution cried Jonah and cried that the sky was falling. </para>
          <para>On this side of the House we know that it hardly seems possible that the honourable member for Blaxland, the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> can agree with the extremist views of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass).</inline> The first 3 honourable - members to whom I referred went to Japan and saw there the need of the Japanese people to acquire uranium in order to provide necessary power. They know that in Japan at least there are no fundamental objections. I am quite certain that they feel, as we do, that the best thing we can do is dig it up and sell it. The only difference between those members I mentioned, and I will include the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> because I think he has a lot of commonsense on this matter, and us is not in relation to digging it up and selling it but that the Opposition would like the Government to do the digging and selling. That is really the only fundamental difference between us. We saw this sort of dichotomy in the Opposition earlier this week but I suppose that on the final day of our proceedings the less said about that the better. </para>
          <para>There is a whole range of argument in favour of nuclear energy but that is not the real nub of today&#39;s debate. It is relevant, certainly, and I will come back to it a little later on. The fundamental point today is whether we should dig and sell uranium. No essential argument against this has been advanced in either of the Fox reports. Certainly no argument against it has been advanced today by the Opposition. As I said before, the only difference between us is in who should dig and sell uranium. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has advanced strict- perhaps too strict- safeguards for the export of uranium, so there is no need to hesitate on the digging and selling. Let us get on with it. It is in our interests to do so. </para>
          <para>At the moment we share a method to feed nuclear reactors at least until the next ice age; that is, to use a new and very abundant fuel, abundant throughout the world and in Australia. That fuel is thorium, an element somewhat lighter than uranium. Unfortunately, thorium alone will not do. Uranium is needed to prime the pump and start the process. Australia has 2 1 per cent of the world&#39;s proven uranium reserves and probably a lot more than that. Prospectors are not going to say anything about the areas they have marked out for fear of difficulties with either State or Federal governments. They want the whole market situation to be made clear before they come forward and so the reserves are probably greater than we thought. In any case, a few decades from now nobody will need uranium because we will be using thorium reactors. But for the next 2 or 3 decades uranium can and will save people from starvation which would otherwise be inevitable. </para>
          <para>That is the basic argument for digging and selling uranium, I suppose, but part of today&#39;s debate certainly involves arguments for and against nuclear power. As far as I am concerned, there are no moral arguments against uranium, just as there are no moral arguments against coal, electricity or rubber. It is hard enough today to live by the 10 commandments without inventing a few more. There are very good arguments for nuclear development and I think that some of the referendums in the United States have made clear that the people there are not the slightest bit concerned. A couple of weeks ago, Jimmy Carter addressed the United States Congress and said something of great importance. He said that the energy crisis was the greatest crisis in the history of the United States, short of the crisis of war. He said that the United States had been hurt by the crisis and that Japan was in even worse straits. The real sufferers, however, are the inhabitants of the under-developed countries. Three billion out of four billion people who live on this planet live in abject poverty. Without energy they cannot pump water, they cannot irrigate their fields, they cannot even obtain energy rich fertilisers. Sooner or later- and it might be sooner- they face starvation. The use of nuclear energy in the developed countries could indirectly help the developing countries, principally by increasing the amount of oil available for their use. Oil is needed for the small machinery which is of vital necessity in the poor countries. </para>
          <para>The richer countries, the developed countries, could and should first of all use less energy.  President  Carter absolutely outlined that the first emphasis of the United States must be on economising on energy as well as using more effective ways to employ it. But he then said, after paying due respect to the need for using a lot of coal, that they could not solve the problem without using nuclear reactors. So the very person the Opposition has been quoting with some approval this afternoon has made it quite plain that nuclear reactors are necessary to solve the energy problem. He wants to reduce the period of licensing in the United States of America from 10 years to 3 years because the energy is needed now. By the deployment of nuclear reactors, 16 million barrels of oil a day could be saved. This represents more than one-third of the production of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. If this can be done and if nuclear reactors can be used as part of a means to provide energy, oil prices might no longer rise. They might even fall. The world has become very small. The industrial revolution is spreading over the face of the earth. The first desirable effect is the saving of lives everywhere. This has given rise to a population explosion; so much so that it is now a certainty that in the year 2000 there will be at least 7 billion souls on this globe, provided they do not starve to death first. They do not need to starve to death if we can help to solve the energy problem by the export of our uranium. </para>
          <para>I want to say a few words about objections to nuclear power. All the answers to any objections I have ever seen are in a book which is available in the Parliamentary Library. It is called <inline font-style="italic">The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear</inline> and is written by Professor Beckman. I recommend it to those Opposition members who are genuinely interested in some arguments for nuclear power, instead of promoting the sort of literature that they seem to be quoting constantly against nuclear power. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member can make his own judgment about that. Professor Beckman has answered most of the objections that have been put forward by the Friends of the Earth and others. He says that uranium is much safer than hydro-electric power because the collapse of dams in various parts of the world has killed thousands. Big industrial nuclear reactors, of which there are more than 60 in the United States today, have not harmed a single person. Nuclear reactors are cleaner and safer than coal. Many people have been killed in mine accidents throughout the world, including here in Australia. The point was made earlier by the honourable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer)</inline> and the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> in regard to the pollution produced by the burning of coal. It has hurt perhaps even a greater number of people. Nuclear reactors are safe when properly controlled and at least in the United States they are safe. I concede to the Friends of the Earth their right to speak up for a pure environment. I sometimes wonder about methods they use but no one can deny them their right to speak up if they feel there is some difficulties we are not handling properly. They really should support nuclear reactors if they are genuine in their desire to cut down pollution because they are the cleanest method of producing electricity. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Many more objections have been raised, some of them by the honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass),</inline> and some by other honourable members. If they are really interested in the subject, I offer them the challenge to read this work which contains, I think, all of the answers for which they would be looking. It would be quite unfair and improper of me before sitting down not to pay some sort of a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Edward</inline> Teller who has had such a great deal to do with the development of nuclear energy since its inception. He, too, has had his moral qualms. Honourable members might recollect that many years ago there was a tremendous nuclear debate in the United States. It was exactly the same sort of debate that we seem to be having in this country in the last couple of years. The only difference is that the American debate took place about 27 years ago. To be completely candid, this is why I am so appalled that we have had to go on with the exercise of the Fox report. All of this work has been done before. It has been done very effectively and very thoroughly. For some reason that is peculiar to Australians, we want to go over the whole trauma and the whole exercise again and therefore waste millions of dollars and cause further delay. </para>
          <para>In any case, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Teller</inline> was retained by the American Government to give a professional opinion as to whether it ought to pursue nuclear energy in depth. After examining everythingincluding all the material covered in the Fox report-all those years ago, he gave what I believe to be and what I think time has shown to be the correct advice to the American Government. I think all of us, particularly those of us in what we call the anti-communist world, have reason to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Teller.</inline> Apart from the enormous industrial development and the enormous benefits that civilisation has gained from nuclear power, there is no question that the United States has done the job in preserving the balance of nuclear power in war-like terms. It has done so because it was given good advice by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Teller. Dr Teller</inline> at least is honest enough to admit that nobody can answer finally all of the conundrums on any new system of power. </para>
          <para>Perhaps the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Teller</inline> provide a good note upon which to conclude my speech. Recently he addressed the National Press Club in a humble, genuine and sincere way. He concluded with what he called a purely personal reminiscence from his early childhood. He talked about a number of children- he says that we are all children- who escaped and went out to see the world. They came to the crossroads and found a sign. On one side it said: &#39;This leads to nowhere&#39;. On the other side it said: &#39;This leads to everywhere&#39;. He says that the children chose the latter course. They got into a lot of trouble but they got home. I think that is the message for us today. We begin this long track of going somewhere by digging up our uranium and selling it for the benefit of Australia and for the benefit of the underprivileged people of this world. </para>

            <para>-The release of the Government&#39;s safeguards policy and the second Ranger uranium inquiry report have enabled the Parliament to discuss in depth the conditions under which Australian uranium is to be mined and whether it is to be exported. In my view the issues have been largely oversimplified and polarised by the minority groups which are emotionally or financially involved so that the Australian public, in effect, has been asked to choose between 2 extremes- unlimited nuclear power for the world or bans on uranium mining. In my view, this type of choice is neither necessary or helpful, nor does it provide anywhere near the best solution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first Ranger report expressed the view that total renunciation of the intention to supply uranium is undesirable. The commissioners simply could not convince themselves that the serious problem of nuclear weapons proliferation could be assisted materially by leaving Australian uranium permanently in the ground. In spite of this, there are still some who believe that uranium bans will help to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and that the world must now give up the option of nuclear power. It is seriously proposed in some quarters that future shortages of oil and gas in this century can be met entirely by the application of solar power and energy conservation alone. I must confess that I do not share that view. </para>
          <para>The turning point in the Australian debate has been the recent announcement of  President  Carter&#39;s nuclear energy policy. It should be made clear to Australians that this policy in effect means firstly, nuclear power will not be abolished world-wide; secondly, the demand for yellowcake will increase because of restrictions on United States fast breeder reactors and reprocessing plants. This means to other countries an increased input of about 45 per cent; thirdly, if recycling of plutonium and uranium is reduced, ample enrichment facilities will be needed; and fourthly, a system of international waste disposal centres probably will be required. I think that is inevitable. An important assumption of the new American policy is that the majority of world uranium resources is held and can be controlled conjointly by Australia, Canada and the United States. A moratorium on Australian uranium exports would isolate Australia from the world councils. It would encourage the proliferation of fast breeder reactors and reprocessing plants and would lead to accelerated uranium exploration and development all over the world. It has a great potential for maximising the effectiveness of nuclear safeguards. I find it rather odd that there was hardly any notice taken in Australia of the results of a conference on the transfer of nuclear technology at Persepolis in late April. A number of points were made at the conference, and among them were the following: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>The essential point is that most countries look upon nuclear power as the only route to energy and independence. For those countries which do not have large deposits of uranium this independence will come only with the breeder reactor. The reprocessing or further processing of isotopes is essential to the operation of the breeder, no matter what the cost. Hence any suggestion that reprocessing and recycling are unacceptable strikes at the very root of this motivation for adopting nuclear power, and naturally is reviewed with alarm. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>Although President Carter has concluded that the United States can afford to defer the breeder, many other countries cannot afford such a course. They view the breeder as an imminent reality and this view is supported by the rapid progress in liquid metal fast breeder reactor development in Europe. They want to make firm plans for a nuclear future now. The national investment required to establish a nuclear breeder capability is far too large a development to be made if its ultimate objective is in doubt. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Other points were: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="6.">
              <para>Many feel that the restriction of reprocessing is not an effective deterrent to nuclear weapons proliferation. This leads to two concerns: That restriction of reprocessing is far too high a price to pay for a marginally effective safeguard that reliance on that restriction will blunt the effort toward more effective means of proliferation control. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="7.">
              <para>The emphasis in the Carter statement on exploring other breeder types and other fuel cycles tends to destroy the credibility of the technical basis for the statement. There are no fuel cycles which are consistent with breeding and which provide an effective technological barrier to proliferation. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="8.">
              <para>Many nations feel that reprocessing of spent fuel is the only feasible route to safe ultimate disposal of radioactive wastes. Some are legally committed to that route. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">We ought to grasp the reality which faces many nations in the Western world, particularly Japan. People seem to assume that now that Britain has vast resources off the North Sea she is selfsufficient. We ought to cast that assumption aside because it is not a fact. This is one of the realities that we have to face up to constructively in this debate. There is a need to work out cooperatively with the United States and Canada a governmental safeguards policy which must be detailed. If safeguards requirements are to be continually improved the Government must be responsive to outside suggestions. For example, the message should be made even clearer to uranium buyers that any nuclear explosion set off by countries other than the recognised nuclear powers- that is, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, China and France- will result in immediate and permanent cessation of uranium supplies from Canada, Australia and the United States. </para>
          <para>Rightly, Australian policy ought to call for a continued system of bilateral safeguards if for any reason the system of IAEA safeguards lapses. This would cover a situation where, for instance, a uranium buyer ceased to be a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There seems no reason, however, for Australia to contemplate selling uranium to any present nonsignatories of the NPT, although loopholes exist in the new policy for both France and China, while new safeguards for other non-signatories are foreshadowed. Compulsory membership of the NPT by uranium consumers should be agreed to without delay by Canada, Australia and the United States. This country&#39;s greatest influence as a major potential supplier of uranium is not with small nuclear powers such as Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan and Korea but with important customers such as West Germany, Italy and Great Britain. Small countries conceivably could obtain uranium outside Canada, the United States or Australia for nuclear weapons manufacture. The European countries I have mentioned as well as Japan must eventually look to the suppliers&#39; group to provide fuel for their large nuclear power programs. Since these consumer countries are also capable of transferring crucial nuclear technology, such as enrichment plants or reprocessing plants, to sensitive countries, Australia can have an important say in restricting such transfers where necessary. Take the West German contract with Brazil. Had West Germany been reliant on Australia I think that our policy could have had a marked effect on the West German attitude. </para>
          <para>Perhaps the greatest danger connected with any safeguards policy is an official overconfidence in its application. Events have prevented to a large degree the hope of nuclear weapons proliferation being entirely stopped. The process may be slowed down with suitable safeguards but no great reliability can be placed on them, especially the present IAEA inspection and accounting system. Honourable members ought to know that the 2 nations of which I am aware that have refused inspections, particularly with respect to the reprocessing structure, have been Great Britain and Russia. The role of South Africa as a possible willing supplier of uranium for nuclear weapons manufacture cannot and ought not to be ruled out in any evaluation of Australian and United States safeguards policy. This consideration alone makes total bans on Australian uranium rather futile. </para>
          <para>How seriously and with what expertise is the Government studying new ways of improving accounting, containment and surveillance methods? How can Australian yellowcake be traced and checked throughout a country&#39;s nuclear fuel cycle? What about the problem of material unaccounted for? Will the export of Australian uranium free other largely unsafeguarded supplies? Unlike the policies of the United States and Canada, the current Australian policy is not pressing future uranium customers to renounce plutonium recycling via reprocessing or breeder reactors. Although American fears of plutonium misuse seem to be amply justified, it is possibly unrealistic at this time to expect countries such as Japan to give up the plutonium option. I do not think they will. Furthermore, the U.S.S.R., France, Britain and West Germany are well advanced in fast breeder programs, particularly Great Britain and France. The world cannot yet afford to discard a large proportion of its uranium which would be used as plutonium in breeders. I think that it was Flowers in his report who intimated that Britain should not commercially run down its experimental fast breeder reactor but ought to keep its options open and keep one in the pipeline. </para>
          <para>The plutonium argument brings up the broader question of whether the interests of Australia, Canada and the United States are similar or even identical. Clearly they are not since the United States is expected to use 50 per cent of the world &#39;s uranium production as well as export a much smaller proportion of it. Available literature indicates that United States uranium reserves appear more expensive to develop than those of Canada and Australia, so an underlying United States aim maybe to keep the world yellowcake prices as low as possible. The danger for Australia in the Carter policy is that the United States will encourage excess foreign uranium production, such as the developing of the Pancontinental and Ranger mines simultaneously, for the purpose of delaying reprocessing for plutonium. At the same time, however, the fall in world demand will lead to excess uranium, the price of which then may once again slip down to $10 to $15 a lb yellowcake for a long-term contract. The United States would dearly like to stockpile cheap Australian uranium for future use against the market and possibly this can be averted by strict sequential development. </para>
          <para>I conclude on this note: The other danger of being too closely aligned with American policy is that some pressure may be exerted on Australia to export uranium to those smaller countries threatening to set up their own reprocessing plants.  President  Carter believes that an assurance of uranium supply will deter reprocessing. However, a better way to slow the spread of reprocessing is by restricting technology transfer. When we talk about a reduction in this area we put far too much emphasis on the raw material side and not enough on the technology side. It is the technology factor that is important, not whether a country uses imported raw material. This can best be approached by Australia exporting uranium mainly to technological countries, as I described them earlier. We also know that the major nuclear nations generally need uranium for power production. The same cannot necessarily be said for the smaller countries anxious to obtain a reprocessing plant. I merely indicate to the House at this stage that Australia, with the potential it has, would be wise to keep its options on this issue wide open. </para>

            <para>-This is the second debate which we have had on uranium in the past 2 months. It amazes me that most of the Opposition members approach this subject with gloom. The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> accused the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> of wanting to rush into the export of Australian uranium. We, on this side of the House, are concerned with the delay which is taking place in the export of this commodity. We favour some early action by the Government. Australia is in the fortunate position of having 2 1 per cent of the world &#39;s known uranium reserves. This will stand us in very good economic stead as the years go by. As a member of the Government Parties Trade and Resources Committee it has been possible for me to visit many of the uranium mining projects in this country. Most of them are situated in remote areas. The development of the uranium industry will provide expansion of employment in these areas. They are remote from any big cities or towns. Employment opportunities will be great when mining gets underway. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Markets for Australian uranium exist in the United States of America, Canada, West Germany, Japan and, possibly, Great Britain. If we do not get on with the job of digging the uranium out of our earth and marketing it, great opportunities in this field could be lost. Already, while we are discussing this subject in Canberra, uranium producers from South Africa are in the United States of America endeavouring to sell their uranium to that country. Many Opposition members have put forward the great dangers which exist in the mining and marketing of uranium. The honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martyr)</inline> said that the United States has been using uranium for power purposes for many years. The United States Navy has been nuclearpowered for 2 1 to 25 years. There has never been an accident. Some of the States are 35 per cent nuclear-powered and some of them are 15 per cent nuclear-powered. This has done away with pollution. Nuclear power is clean. It has provided the United States with another source of energy. Great Britain itself generates 15 per cent of its power by nuclear means. </para>
          <para>Nuclear power is on the increase. There has not been one loss of life in the world since the beginning of the nuclear industry. No doubt, great precautions have to be taken by those handling the nuclear product when it is providing power for the sources I have mentioned. Great care has been exercised so far and there is no doubt that those countries which are handling this source of power take these precautions. We in Australia do not have to fear loss of life from the mining of uranium. Some people have mentioned radon gas. Most of the mines in Australia will be opencut mines and there should be no danger from this source. The environmentalists in this country have nothing to fear. Members of the Government Parties Trade and Resources Committee visited the Northern Territory and Western Australia. We came away very impressed with what mining companies are doing in the restoration of the earth which they have uncovered to mine minerals and uranium. </para>
          <para>One matter which concerns me if we do not get busy and market this product is the fact that experiments are being conducted in countries overseas to produce uranium from sea water. In the past 2 weeks, an article appeared in the Press. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Japan&#39;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry has announced what it calls &#39;a great scientific feat&#39; in recovering uranium from sea-water. </para>
            <para>Two private Japanese concerns . . . have been conducting experiments for MITI - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The power body in Japan-  over the past 2 years and now claim the first successful experiments whereby uranium has been recovered. A total of 149 milligrams of yellowcake have been recovered from SO tons of sea-water based on a uranium absorption method developed by the companies using titanic acid in the process. </para>
          <para class="block">There is proof that this method can be used economically. We could lose sales of uranium which is available in Australia. We should get on with the job, get uranium out of the ground and market it. This country produces 70 per cent of its petroleum requirements. It has to import 30 per cent from Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Our own source of supply is diminishing at the rate of about 10 per cent a year. It is estimated, as the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> mentioned, that by 1985 we will be paying $2.5 billion to $3 billion to import our fuel from overseas. Therefore, it is essential that we get on with the marketing of uranium so that we can offset the balance of trade which will occur in those years. </para>
          <para>A lot has been said about the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. It is very similar to the first one. It reiterates the judgment made in the first report that a delay in plans for full scale mining is a serious option. Hence it recommends: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Calculated caution and sequential development, which apparently would not conflict with economic calculations of the complex  factors  of supply of and demand for fissionable material for nuclear reactors. It is of the opinion that, apart from existing small commitments, Australia cannot enter the world market on a significant scale before the early 1980s. Expansion of the  mining  operations from the Ranger to the Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits in the region and to other parts of Australia, based on experience acquired through cautious beginnings, will reduce the impact on the physical environment and allow for adjustments to be made in time, if need be, in relation with the Aboriginal community. Deliberate strategies strongly recommended by the Commission are the immediate creation of the Kakadu National Park in the same region which would protect for all time lands that are of great traditional significance to the Aborigine, and the direct involvement of Aborigines, in the demarcation and subsequent management of the Park. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report enters into considerable technical and administrative detail on the environmental controls and monitoring arrangements it proposes should mining proceed. It even recommends that the landscape setting proposed in the environmental impact statement prepared by the Ranger mining interests be substantially altered. It recognises, however, that the Ranger plans were prepared with conscientious concern. It says explicitly that large scale uranium mining would be highly profitable for Australia. It recommends government participation in the marketing of uranium and offers a number of options in the form of statutory controls, noting at the same time the value of freely operating competitive market forces. </para>
          <para>The worst feature of it is that it condones delay and states that we could defer the mining of uranium from two to five years. The report recommends that a national park be created at the Alligator River and ore bodies be separated from the national parks, that they be taken outside the parks. The report makes great play on Aboriginal land rights. In our tour of Western Australia and of this East Alligator River area we did not see any Aborigines. We saw Aborigines when we got to the main towns but in these mining areas we did not see any Aborigines. Apparently the do-gooders and perhaps Friends of the Earth are inciting Aborigines to go out into the mining areas, camp there and suggest that the areas are sacred Aboriginal land. This is a problem that we will have to overcome. </para>
          <para>It was good to hear the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> speak in this House on 24 May when he stated clearly that nuclear safeguards have been under the closest and most careful consideration from the moment that the Government took over the Treasury reins. He made it clear that there was international concern to establish a framework of control for nuclear safeguards and that consultations had taken place with the United States of America, Canada and other countries. This Government is determined that Australia should play an active part with other countries in the search for and achievement of joint solutions. We are going to market uranium. There is a responsibility on Australia to see that safeguards are taken in regard to it because the whole world will be watching our operation. It is essential that we see that these safeguards are taken. </para>
          <para>The Government will impose strict conditions on the overseas use of Australian uranium and will carefully screen importers before releasing it. These conditions will cover the entire civil nuclear industries of the importing countries and ensure that uranium meant for peaceful uses is not diverted to military or explosive purposes. The measures include: careful selection of customer countries; the application of international safeguards to verify that materials supplied for peaceful purposes are not misused; the establishment of additional safeguards through bilateral agreements and active involvement by Australia in international efforts to upgrade safeguards. Let us get on with the job. Let us dig our uranium out of the ground. Let us market it because these safeguards mentioned by the Prime Minister will control our export operations. </para>

            <para>- I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak for the fourth time on this question. I was not going to rise because I did not want to preclude anybody else from speaking but I understand that the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the Government have provided ample time for the debate today and tonight. For that I am personally grateful. I have heard every speech so far in this debate and I believe it is probably one of the best debates of its kind that have been conducted in this Parliament for many years. There has been very little attempt at political point scoring. I have vigorously disagreed with some of the arguments and agreed with others. But I think that is the sort of place this ought to be, where we can have that disagreement and vigorous attack on policies rather than on personalities. An amendment in my name is before the House on this question. It reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That the following words be added to the motion: and that the House is of the opinion that there should be a moratorium of at least 2 years on the mining and exporting of uranium, as mentioned in the Fox Report, to allow sufficient time for public debate, as recommended by the Fox Report, and for further research into the risks involved and possible future energy sources. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I shall certainly not be calling for a division on that amendment because of the obvious positions of the 2 political sides. I have not heard any member of the Liberal or National Country Parties agree with that amendment. Therefore one would hardly be hopeful of support for the amendment from those quarters. The Australian Labor Party, because of its structure, as I understand it, has a policy on the mining of uranium which would preclude any parliamentary members of the Labor Party from now voting for such an amendment, although by the speeches one hears from members of the Labor Party there is obviously a great number of them- perhaps half or more- who would not only agree with the thrust of my amendment but who would want to go a lot further. If I called for a division I would only be grandstanding and would embarrass terribly the seconder of my amendment. There is no point to that at all so I shall not be calling for a division on it. My stance on this question is well known. I am not against the mining, milling or selling of uranium. I am not against nuclear energy being used in the world; what I am against is its being used now and our uranium being sold until the proper safeguards and control of wastes have been demonstrated to us by scientists and by the technologists, and until proper control and regulation can take place. I am not persuaded that we have been so told by the experts. At the risk of being tedious I want to read into the record of this debate some extracts from the first Fox report. On page 1 85 it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a categoric, unequivocal and unambiguous sentence. That, in any report, ought to make every member of the House regard this as a serious matter, as I am sure every member of the House does. I shall deal with safeguards in a moment. On page 25 the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Nineteen countries - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This applied when the report was written; there are more now-  have nuclear power stations operating at 3 1 December 1 975. Another seven had power reactors under construction. Another six have them on order. </para>
          <para class="block">These figures are now out of date. All the numbers mentioned have been increased. I do not want unnecessarily to give offence to any country with which Australia enjoys friendly relations. Looking at some of those countries that have nuclear reactors on order and considering that they are going to have the facility of a nuclear reactor are enough to make any honourable member&#39;s hair curl in view of the calibre of government and morality in those countries. </para>
          <para>It is also interesting to look at some of the types of nuclear reactors some of these haircurling countries have on order. As I understand it- I do not completely understand the situation because it is a technical matter- there are basically 2 types of reactor that a country can use. One is an American reactor which is light, which performs the function of creating electricity or energy but from which it is difficult or impossible to make a nuclear bomb. There is a heavier reactor, made in Canada and other countries, which is more expensive, more efficient, less economic but nevertheless has the capacity of making a nuclear weapon. It is fascinating to know that none of the hair-curling countries have opted for the non-bomb-producing light reactor; significantly, they have all opted for the other one. If we are going to discuss safeguards, I think it is well to bear in mind that the honourable gentlemen on the Government side who are advocating open slather on uranium might be pure, might be altruistic and might be trusting in this particular area; but, having been a student of international relations for some time, I say that some of those countries do not merit my trust to have the most dangerous weapon in the hands of man ever since man came to this planet. I am not against the use of nuclear energy but I am against its use until the dangers have been solved. </para>

These are the 3 reasons why I have adopted this stance. I agree that the arguments put on the other side of the House today are persuasive and that one must listen to them. But I think that with a thing like this you have to make a decision. You cannot make it go halfway. The answer either has to be yes or no. Do we mine and sell it or do we not? I have come down on the latter side. </para>

          <para>On the dangers of radiation, the Commissioners say at pages 108-9 of the report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Apart from rapidly fatal effects (within days) of high doses, the major consequences of radiation are cancer - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">They did not say &#39;may be cancer&#39;; the major consequences are cancer-  which may occur some years after the individual has been exposed and gene mutations which may appear in subsequent generations. </para>
          <para class="block">That is the one sentence in the report that really bothers me because that makes it not an economic question. That makes it a moral question. The decision we take in this Parliament or the decision that is taken in the Cabinet room is not simply an economic question. It is a moral question, because the consequences of that action, according to the Fox report, are that gene mutations might occur and appear in subsequent generations. I am not an expert on the mutation of genes but as I understand it, some genes, when exposed to radioactivity, can be passively mutated and then passed on to a generation or 2 generations, and 2 generations from now children could be born with the passively mutated gene manifesting itself. Those children could be born with hideous congenital malformations. That is not the honourable member for Hotham saying that because he does not know anything about it; it is the Fox report. The report says that such a suggestion comes from highly expert and highly technical evidence. So uranium is a dangerous substance even to mine. </para>
          <para>I turn now to tailings, the low level wastes which one gets not from making bombs or plutonium but simply from mining uranium. Those wastes contain radioactive materials. According to the Fox report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Tailings contain radioactive materials which will remain harmful for over 100 000 years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I repeat: 100 000 years. The report goes on to say this disturbing thing at page 9 1 :   . . the Ranger proposal involves storing the tailings behind an engineered dam. A risk with this type of storage is that tailings will escape to the environment if the dam embankment is breached. </para>
          <para class="block">That, to me, is a terrifying concept. The tailings are dangerous; they cause cancer, they may cause gene mutations and they last for over 100 000 years. There is a danger over that period in regard to the type of storage envisaged because there is no guarantee that the material can be contained. But I think page 1 10 is the starkest, clearest page of the whole report. On that page there is this statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is at present no generally accepted means by which high level waste can be permanently isolated from the environment . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If we combine those 3 points, to me they provide an unanswerable case as to why we should wait until scientists can tell us of a generally acceptable way of containing the dangers and of isolating them from the environment. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the question of safeguards. I am not persuaded as to the safeguards enunciated by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 24 May or thereabouts, good though they read on paper. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> classified the situation as &#39; Fraser announces his eleven commandments&#39;. On paper they look great. On paper, if one were feeling disparaged, one could possibly get some consolation from them and say: &#39;Well, we are not going to sell our uranium unless we have got those safeguards&#39;. But I ask honourable members to consider this point. We are people in the political field. We have all been overseas. We have all visited other countries. Is there any member of this House who genuinely believes that those safeguards mean anything? Is there any member of this House who believes that the Non-proliferation Treaty is worth the paper it is written on? The Fox report says that it is only an illusion of protection. Has anybody here been to South Africa or Rhodesia? I have not but some honourable members have. We know that the United Nations has a unanimous ban on trade in most items with those countries. Does not the House know that since that ban was imposed trade with Rhodesia has nourished? I think the latest statistics show that it has trebled since the ban was imposed. The almighty buck, the almighty dollar, is the only arbiter in international trade. It is not morality; it is not the selfpreservation of people. It is the dollar that motivates trade. </para>
          <para>I have heard a rumour that the Arabs are not very friendly towards Israel. I have been to Israel twice and have had that rumour confirmed. I was standing in the port of Ailat in the south of Israel only 6 months ago. I was with a very close Israeli friend and I saw a tanker unloading oil at an Israeli port. I said to my friend: &#39;Where does that tanker come from?&#39;. He said: &#39;Chipp, mind your own bloody business&#39;, and smiled and walked away. I made subsequent inquiries and, of course, it was Arab oil. It was oil straight from the Arab States. If someone wants uranium and that someone will pay a high enough price for it, if someone wants plutonium and is prepared to pay a high enough price for it, there will be some means by which the almighty dollar will be satisfied and that sale will take place. </para>
          <para>On the question of safeguards, we need not have the Fox report. No matter how honourable we might be, no matter how sincere we are in saying that we have these safeguards and therefore we can wash our hands and sell our uranium, I wonder whether there is any member of the House who genuinely believes that these safeguards mean more than the paper they are written on. While Australian uranium remains in the ground we have a tremendously powerful force to exercise in lifting the world on to a safe and sane energy plane. I was disappointed with the speech of my friend, the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi),</inline> whom I admire enormously. If I heard him correctly, he virtually said that there was no hope for solar energy, tidal energy and wind energy in the near future. </para>

Those are my views. I am not against the use of nuclear energy but I am against selling our uranium now. Let us retard nuclear poliferation for as long as we can until we can ensure that there are adequate safeguards, until we can make absolutely sure that the wastes are safe, that they will not cause cancer and gene mutations in future generations and the other hideous dangers inherent in the use of uranium. </para>

He appeared to me after listening to him to be really explaining why there is absolutely no point in Australia keeping its uranium in the ground and why the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- the Fox report- is quite correct in stating that no matter what we do in Australia or what we recommend it is not going to make an ounce of difference to what happens in the world. That is because of our size and because of what has been pointed out by the honourable member for Hotham; that is, that the magic buck will find a way to make things happen. So I cannot follow his argument that we should leave our uranium in the ground for a short period or a number of years while certain things are clarified and certain safeguards are introduced. No matter what we do, if uranium is a curse it is a curse that will be with us. I accept the point of view, of course, that if it is proved that uranium is a curse, perhaps we should not on moral grounds encourage something that is bad. If that is the point that the honourable member was making, I agree with him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that I should be careful to ensure that the people who are listening to this debate this afternoon know exactly where we are at in the uranium debate. Honourable members will remember that a major statement of the first Fox inquiry was as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increase in the risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. Complete evaluation of the extent of the risk and assessment of what course should be followed to reduce it involve matters of national security and international relations which are beyond the ambit of the inquiry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable members will know that following upon that statement we had the Carter initiative. It was an initiative that electrified the world and that I think certainly changed the whole complexion of the nuclear debate in this Parliament and Australia. Suddenly the thing that was worrying most of us- the plutonium economywas encapsulated by the  President  of the United States of America, and suddenly all of the things that had been worrying people who had been branded as &#39;trendies&#39; and &#39;greenies&#39; became respectable. </para>
          <para>I think that that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox and his fellow Commissioners were pointing to. That is what the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> of 24 May on the Government&#39;s policy on nuclear safeguards followed on so responsibly and where this Parliament was fulfilling its proper role in deciding what should be happening in Australia. The nuclear debate can take place in many ways, but in the end somebody has to decide what is to happen. It must be this Parliament and it must be the government of the day. I was rather alarmed to hear the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating),</inline> who is a shadow Minister and who spoke second for the Opposition in the debate, carrying on as he did in an earlier debate and threatening, blackmailing and trying to assert that things will not happen unless the Opposition in this Parliament and the unions outside of this Parliament agree. I think that that is sad and irresponsible. It certainly appears to be immature from a member of the Opposition who is supposed to have so much promise. </para>
          <para>The second Fox report contains conclusions which I think it is already agreed throughout the community will enable uranium mining and export to proceed. The first inquiry gave the Government a reason for not proceeding if it wanted to sieze upon some of the suggestions contained therein. The thread throughout the first inquiry was mainly that there was nothing that one could really say that made the mining and export of uranium absolutely irresponsible. It is stated throughout the first 4 recommendations that if activities are properly regulated and controlled there is nothing to justify uranium mining not proceeding. The second report states that the Ranger project can proceed if the provisions of the report are adhered to- if the controls and safeguards are adhered to. </para>
          <para>What does that mean for us? Does that mean that we in this Parliament can now rush headlong into a decision to mine and export uranium? Is it a green light? Of course it is not. This Government still has a heavy responsibility in relation to the 2 reports and the points that have been raised by honourable members opposite in this debate this afternoon. It is hoped by many supporters of the Government and, I think, some members of the Opposition that we will be able now to proceed quickly and that we will be able now to make the sorts of decisions that national parliaments should make. We are the elected representatives of the people. Those who wish to lie on the road at traffic intersections and to block bridges do not have the responsibility for making decisions; it is the Parliament of Australia. The honourable member for Paterson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O &#39;Keefe)</inline> outlined to the House the work that has been done by the Government&#39;s back bench committee on trade and national resources. I think it is important for the people of Australia to know that when we talk in this Parliament about debate we are not necessarily talking entirely about debate that takes place in this chamber. The Trade and National Resources Committee, being a Government back bench committee, has met once or twice a week for almost the last 18 months. It has spent ten or fifteen days travelling throughout Australia looking at mines, taking evidence and deciding for itself just how our resources should be developed. The committee has taken evidence from prominent people on all sides of the uranium debate. Opposition committees do exactly the same thing. So those people who wish to discredit the Parliament and discredit the institution should remember that the hours spent on debate in this chamber are only a small portion of the discussion and debate that take place between members of Parliament. </para>
          <para class="block">I am sorry that the honourable member for Hotham has now left the House. I feel that some of the work that he did earlier in trying to get this debate brought forward was valuable. My only regret is that he was not a member of the back bench committee that did so much work on this matter. The honourable member claimed that the debate was being stifled, but manifestly it was not. If the Government makes a decision to proceed with uranium mining- I personally think that it should- the real crunch, I suppose, for the uranium industry over the next few months will come when it tries to get through the mine fields of recommendations and administration that have been laid down in the second Fox report. I believe that everything in this report is important and that it is absolutely crucial for the safeguards, in the main, to be adopted. But we must not let the sorts of safeguards that creep into what is predominantly a report to protect the environment set aside other important issues. </para>
          <para>Justice Fox was not asked to make decisions on the development of the economy of the Northern Territory. He did not have to fit the uranium situation into the development of Australia as a whole. He had something to say about the energy crisis, but really his was not the responsibility of solving it. The Government will have to take its decisions on this important report over the coming months against this wide background. It will have to make judgments as to whether sequential development of the mines is necessary or whether in fact there are other ways of going about the development of uranium resources which have not been put to Fox or which Fox has not thought of and which may enable work to get under way more quickly without any risk to the environment or the Aboriginal population in the areas concerned. </para>
          <para>This has been one of the most interesting parts of my parliamentary career to date. I was elected to this place at a time when the development of our uranium resources was such a burning issue for Australia. The Government is fortunate that it has such a strong majority and so many well qualified and experienced members, both on the front bench and the back bench, at a time when this decision is to be taken. I would be alarmed enormously if the decision on uranium had had to be taken at a time when the government of the country was not in such good hands. </para>

His  record over a long period is known to us all and many of us regard him personally as a friend. As a soldier in the Australian Army he was incarcerated by the imperial Japanese Army in 1942. He was released 3 years afterwards in 1945, as a result of the first use of atomic weapons in a world war. So it can truly be said that the atomic weapons used at that time were used to stop World War II, not to further the development of war. </para>

              <para>- We know that the Nazi Germany was experimenting with heavy water at Telemark in Norway. We know the enemy at that time was developing the know-how and experience that could have led to the development of an atomic weapon. A moment ago the honourable member for Port Adelaide said that it was unnecessary for these weapons to have been used in World War II. The fact of the matter is that the then  President  of the United States decided to use nuclear weapons because in his judgment this action would finish the war quickly and save the lives of at least hundreds of thousands of allied servicemen who were fighting in the Pacific. I mention this because I believe that the attitude of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is governed by those circumstances. No one could go through that tragic experience without developing an effect that would manifest itself later in life. The honourable member made it clear to me in his speech this afternoon that his great anxiety was that anxiety that is referred to by  His  Honour Justice Fox and by my colleague the honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem). His</inline> Honour said that &#39;the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war and that &#39;this is the most serious hazard associated with the industry&#39;. I wonder whether the House would accept that statement as being on its own entirely valid. I suggest to the House that if we take out the word &#39;nuclear&#39; and read that statement again we will find that the same validity exists, lt would then read this way: &#39;The power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of war&#39;. I suggest to honourable members that this has been the case over a long period. I suggest also that conquerors engage in the business of conquest when they know they can succeed. The reality is that as technological developments take place mankind will have to face up to the fact that conquests will not occur in the historical manner. It will not take place while a deterrent exists as it does at the moment. </para>

          <para>Australia is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. When we read what Justice Fox has to say about the Non-Proliferation Treaty we realise that honourable members who are speaking here against the export of Australian uranium ore should have second thoughts. By objecting to the export of uranium they are putting in jeopardy Australia&#39;s international reputation which has been gained from the ratification of this treaty. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry second report stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A total renunciation of intention to supply designed to bring an end to all nuclear power industries or all further development of them would in our view be likely to fail totally in its purpose. If the purpose were simply to draw international attention to the dangers of and associated with the industry, that purpose might be achieved, but it is most unlikely that any worthwhile action would result. On the other hand there are positive reasons against adopting such a course. Apart from financial considerations, which are not to be neglected, there are considerations to which we referred when dealing with the topic of proliferation. A total refusal to supply would place Australia in clear breach of Article IV of the NPT and could adversely affect its relation to countries which are parties to the NPT. </para>

          <para class="block">Am I to understand that the followers of the honourable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)-</inline> the members of the Australian Labor Party- who led the Government which ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are now saying to the rest of the world that the decision at that time was not to be taken seriously and that circumstances have developed to make them change their minds. Is that the position? I do not believe that it can be. Furthermore, I think that such a proposal put before the leaders of the Western world would be greeted with contempt. As the Prime Minister said on 24 May 1977: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At their recent summit meeting the heads of Government of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany, France, Japan and Italy committed themselves to increasing nuclear energy to help meet the world&#39;s energy requirements while reducing the risks of nuclear proliferation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In other words, the major powers on this earth have said that, if we will put our trust in them, they will be prepared to give guarantees that will make the possibilities of nuclear war far too remote a possibility. The other alternative, as we all understand, is to move into the operation of getting nuclear capacity because we are afraid that someone will use it against us. I think that such a policy will not be accepted by the great majority of nations. On the other hand, one must admit that there has been no attempt to conceal that this was the very fear in the People&#39;s Republic of China. I believe that its actions have been governed by the conviction in Peking that it was under great and real threat from the Government of Moscow. </para>
          <para>We listened to the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> speaking about national interests.  His  suggestion was that we should keep our exports within Australia until they were more valuable and then we would be able to get more funds from overseas when they were exported. It is quite clear from the report of Justice Fox that if that were done we would be in breach of the non-proliferation Treaty. I say to Australians, and I hope they will all understand this, that having ratified that Treaty the ratification being carried out by the Labor Government, we are in the position where we have to honour our international agreements. The leaders of the Western world are prepared to go to every rational, responsible length to establish the safeguards which they regard as vital. I would have thought that there was enough evidence to accept that at least the potential conquerers of this world- the conquerers who might be likely to engage in nuclear war- will go along with the nonproliferation Treaty while its suits them. They will go along with the strategic arms limitations talks agreements and they will go along with most of the international agreements. This seems to indicate that peace can survive on this earth. If it cannot, we will face great trouble in the future whether or not the people of Australia are in favour of exporting uranium. </para>
          <para>In my judgment it has been properly put forward by my colleagues this afternoon that for 0.4 per cent of the world&#39;s population to start dictating to the rest of the 4000 million people on this earth about their capacity and their right to decide whether they will develop nuclear industries would be entirely wrong. Not only would it be entirely wrong but also, in my judgment, it would be irresponsible and immature politically. I do not believe that will occur. As I understand it, gallup polls taken in this country have indicated that the majority of Australians have some comprehension of this matter which we are discussing. The majority of them are in favour of Australia honouring its international agreements and contracts and honouring article IV of the non-proliferation Treaty. I say in conclusion that it is my hope that the House will support the concept that Australia should proceed with international responsibility and not national selfishness. </para>

            <para>-This is the first time that I have entered the uranium debate, although that has not been due to any lack of attention or study on my part. I think that my interest in matters of environment and conservation is well known to members of the House. I have been rather reticent to enter the debate as a matter of conscience. I am one of those people who believe that the resource should be left in the ground until adequate safeguards are available. So far, despite all the reports and statements, I do not believe that those safeguards are available. I think it is fair to say that I am essentially a party loyalist. I support my Party&#39;s policies because I believe they represent the greatest hope for Australians to develop that way of life to which they are entitled. But on uranium the Party&#39;s policy, although restrictive, is still equivocal. I would not want honourable members to get the idea that although I am in quite a deal of agreement with the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> on this matter I am likely to be a Labor Party <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp.</inline> I am not, and for the reason that I believe other aspects come into the issue. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer)</inline> commented earlier that the debate was about the mining of uranium and not energy production through power plants, weapons etc. Of course, that is quite wrong. As a supplier of the raw material, we must give full consideration to what flows from it- from the raw material to the initial energy production, through the power plant; from the raw material to nuclear weapons; from the initial energy production procedure to the other forms of energy production available; or from the energy production to the use of the material left from that and once more to nuclear weapons. Finally, we must consider the problems that occur with the disposal of the waste from these processes. If anyone has any doubt about the importance of the supply of the raw material, I refer them to today&#39;s Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> In the world news section there appears a heading Australia&#39;s Key Nuclear Role&#39;. The article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia will be closely associated with important discussions leading up to the international nuclear fuel evaluation program proposed by America &#39;s President Carter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The article referred to the preliminary study which has been agreed on by Great Britain, the United States, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. While Australia will not actually join the exclusive world nuclear club, it will be fully and closely involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wedgwood</inline> Benn has expressed considerable interest in Australia&#39;s announced nuclear safeguards policy, and the article indicated that there was complete agreement that such nuclear safeguards needed to be secure and absolute. This matter is relevant to the visit to England of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> at this moment. In expressing my concern that leads me to refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> of 28 May 1977. It is not only the people here who worry about the long process. That article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government yesterday delighted environmentalists and exasperated supporters of nuclear power by announcing that Britain will not build a plutonium-burning fast breeder reactor until a full public inquiry on the project has been held. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One of the matters of particular concern about which the article comments is the long radioactive life of the nuclear waste left after the plutonium has been burned in the reactor and the dangers to a free democratic society posed by the substantial presence of plutonium, which is also the raw material for nuclear weapons. If there are absolute and secure safeguards and they still have to have inquiries like that in a country where nuclear power has been used for some time, further doubts must surely arise in our minds. One can see why we have a concern for these safeguards. </para>
          <para>Other matters were raised during this debate by other honourable members on which I think I should comment. I was disturbed to hear most honourable members use the term &#39;environmentalist&#39; in a rather sneering way. It is unfortunate that the word &#39;environmentalist&#39; is supposed to represent only an extreme group. Indeed, all of us who are interested in these matters, all of us who accept responsibility, must accept that over the years there have been great depradations of the world in which we live through lack of attention to these matters. One should not accuse individuals because they show some consciousness of the necessity for community concern in these areas. They should not be rubbished and derided because of it. </para>
          <para>The other matter which interested me was that at least one honourable member believed that anyone who opposed the mining of uranium was a &#39;Com&#39;. I do not know how he came to that conclusion. Anyone who looks at the environmental problems of society today realises that the attitudes on environment of the active capitalist and the active communist coincide, with equally bad results for their communities. In the industry of the capitalist society the profit motive means that the environmental factors are probably amongst the last to receive consideration. They are expensive and they are seen as disposable. In the communist system, of course, the productivity target which industry has to meet is the important thing and the easiest thing to disregard is the environment. I think that that sort of cheap name calling directed at those who take a serious attitude on the question of the environment is unfortunate. </para>
          <para>I have been distressed also by the attitude of some honourable members who say that other countries which have uranium as a resource are going to mine it and supply it and therefore we should do the same. Their approval is: &#39;If you can&#39;t lick &#39;em, join &#39;em&#39;. I suppose that the same gentlemen who take that approach would indicate to any young man that if he were in a situation of pack rape he should not worry about his moral and legal obligations but should just go along with it. I reject that sort of argument as a reason why Australia should be involved in the supply of uranium. </para>
          <para>I do not argue with the proposition describing the enormous economic benefit which would accrue to Australia through the mining of uranium. It is not only an economic benefit which flows from the sale of the raw material. Recent media reports would lead us to believe, following the visits overseas of various Government Ministers, particularly the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> that a certain amount of international blackmail is going on in other areas of trade. By that I mean that if we will mine and supply uranium we will also get markets in other areas. I think that the arguments have been put almost as bluntly as that. </para>
          <para>As well as these economic questions there are . moral questions. The claim has been made that the largesse from uranium mining would allow Australia to do so much more for our inhabitants in the way of social service benefits and so on. But would social security beneficiaries want to receive increased benefits at the cost of death and injury to people elsewhere on the globe? Would children want to receive adequate education at the expense of damage to future generations? We are also told that by depriving the world of uranium we are depriving needy and developing countries of a ready source of energy. My answer to that is that the developed countries are already doing this by their wasteful and profligate use of fossil fuels. We talk about international safeguards, but can these be enforced? Earlier today the honourable member for Hotham mentioned how so many of these problems could be got around. Let me quote from <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> magazine of 30 May this year what was stated in an article about a frightening case. It is headed: &#39;Uranium: The Israeli connection&#39;, and states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the foggy dawn of 17 November 1968, the Germanbuilt freighter <inline font-style="italic">Scheersberg</inline> chugged out of Antwerp harbor with a Liberian flag flying from its mast and S60 drums of yellowcake&#39; packed beneath its decks. The ship never reached its declared destination of Genoa, Italy. Instead, after IS days at sea it docked at the Turkish port of  Iskenderun  on 2 December, riding high in the water. Its strategic cargo- 200 tons of uranium, worth $3. 7m, that could potentially be used for nuclear weapons- had vanished. The disappearance of the uranium was first disclosed last month by Paul Leventhal, a former counsel to the Senate Committee on Government Operations, at a conference in Salzburg. . . . Who had the uranium? And how did they get it? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">After several weeks of investigation by correspondents from <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> it has been alleged that the whole thing was a complex plot conducted by Israeli intelligence agents. The purpose was to disguise a secret Israeli purchase of much needed uranium for its French built nuclear reactor. Much more detail is supplied in the article. It is suggested that assurances were given by the West German Government to <inline font-style="italic">allow</inline> the purchase to be disguised and that Israel promised West Germany access to its advanced uranium separation process that can be used to produce nuclear weapons. I think that honourable members ought to read this article because it is quite frightening. It has its humorous aspects in some ways. The cover purchaser of this uranium was a Casablanca pharmaceutical supply company named Chimagar. It had never bought uranium before. It was a firm which specialised in processing seaweed. Indeed, it really was not a good cover as Morocco is not a member of the European Economic Community and no nuclear material can be shipped outside the Community without a special permit. That is the sort of thing that can occur even with the present safeguards and controls. I think that it should be quite alarming to us. </para>
          <para>Comment has been made of the likelihood of damage from nuclear power plants. I wish to quote from an information paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Third Party Liability for Nuclear Damage</inline> issued by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Paragraph 12 on page 4 states: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="12.">
              <para>The safety record of the nuclear industry has so far been excellent. For example, in 20 years or so of operating nuclear reactors in the United States, there have been no third party claims arising from the operation of commercial plants. Nevertheless, the theoretical studies discussed above indicate a remote possibility of a very costly accident and this is the underlying assumption providing the basis for nuclear liability legislation. </para>

          <para class="block">That is the frightening thing. In this area it requires only one incident to produce frightening results. The nature of the debate has not allowed me to refer to either of the Ranger environmental inquiry reports as we had hoped. But I am concerned that the initial recommendations of that public debate have not been fully covered. The Minister for Environment Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> in response to questions I asked indicated that the Government&#39;s monitoring of the public debate has been conducted by at least one official.

            <para>-The House is debating matters relating to the mining and exporting of uranium. I do not want to deal specifically with many of the points that have been raised previously in this debate, but there is perhaps one point I noted that was mentioned earlier with which I should deal. In his address to the House earlier today the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> attacked the Government for having announced a safeguards policy. He said that to announce a safeguards policy before the release of the second Fox report is to prejudge the issue. By saying that, he was also by implication attacking his own Leader who announced a safeguards policy on 29 March in this House on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in respect of the export of uranium. The Leader of the Opposition, when he announced that policy, then went on to berate the Government for not having announced a safeguards policy. It seems therefore that it is a case of an each way bet for the Opposition. If we do not have a safeguards policy, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> attacks us for being behind the Opposition and for not being concerned about safeguards. If we do have a safeguards policy, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition attacks us for prejudging the issue. </para>

          <para>I have been following the uranium debate with some interest. I have studied the first report of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry and now I am studying the second report with some interest. It is interesting to read the 2 reports in view of many of the public statements by the protagonists and opponents of uranium mining. It is interesting to note that in many of the statements made urging a 5-year moritorium the proposition is put that a 5-year moritorium was recommended by the Fox inquiry. But, in fact, the Fox inquiry has studiously avoided making any recommendation one way or another in that respect. I shall refer to page 1 8 1 of the first Fox report where it deals with the matter of whether there should be some delay or postponement in supply of uranium to other countries. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Because the evidence from which each line of argument is derived remains conjectural and also for reasons stated earlier when discussing the proliferation problem, we have not found a compelling basis for a conclusion on the question whether it is preferable to delay coming to a decision about mining for a period of several years or  alteratively  to proceed with carefully planned development of the industry. What we do conclude is that at present Australia should not commit itself to withholding for all time its uranium supplies, and that it should take the course which is determined to be the most effective and most practical in order to bring a favourable response from other states in relation to the proliferation problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I find that many people who have listened to a number of the arguments put by protagonists in the debate are under the impression that the Fox inquiry has clearly recommended a moritorium for a certain number of years. As that quotation shows, that is not so. </para>
          <para>Some rather irresponsible assertions have been made also about nuclear power stations exploding or the possibility of their exploding. Those assertions cannot be justified. On the other hand, I have also objected to a number of the statements that have been made in support of uranium mining and export. Those arguments have been along the lines of let us dig up all that we can and flog it off for the money that is available, or have been along the lines that if we do not export uranium some other countries will come and get it. I think those sorts of statements also are irresponsible and avoid the very real and concerning issues which we ought to be facing. It is interesting to read the Fox report to get some perspective on many of the real problems that exist. However, the Fox report has a number of inadequacies and I shall point to some of them. The Fox report tried to cover so many issues that in many areas the commission was unable to make very clear decisions and recommendations. Simply because it did not have enough evidence on which to base any sort of conclusion, the commission would make some sort of wishy washy statement that really did not give any guidance one way or the other. Indeed, I think there are a few inaccuracies here and there. </para>
          <para>In this House on 26 April I directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> a question about the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. This aspect is referred to on page 104 of the first Fox report. The Fox report stated that Australia had not become a party to the Convention and I asked the Minister during question time whether that was so. The reply was that Australia has signed the Convention. Of course, before a country can ratify a convention it has to go through a process of ensuring that the legislation on that subject- in Australia&#39;s case it means both Federal and State legislation- is in conformity with the convention and that the necessary administrative processes are in existence to carry out the terms of the convention. It was apparent from the Minister&#39;s answer that Australia is proceeding to ratify the Convention by getting all the administrative processes under way. So it is not quite clear what the Fox report means when it says that Australia has not become a party to the Convention. </para>
          <para>One other respect in which I think the Fox report was most inadequate was Japan&#39;s position in the nuclear power generating area. On page 52 of the first Fox report there was a half page which purported to summarise Japan&#39;s situation. I shall read just one small extract from that summary of Japan&#39;s situation which I believe is most inadequate. That part of the report reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Replacement of part of Japan&#39;s proposed nuclear expansion program with an amplified coal-fired power station program, combined with greater emphasis on energy conservation, appears feasible. But the extent to which this could be achieved, or would be acceptable to Japan itself, cannot be assessed from the evidence. Base-load electricity generated by stations fuelled with imported coal would probably be more expensive than that provided by nuclear stations in many cases. However, the evidence indicates that the average capacity factor of some existing nuclear stations in Japan has been low, so the cost of electricity produced by them may be relatively high. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">For what is supposedly an expert report I suggest that that passage is so qualified by &#39;maybe &#39;s&#39; and could be&#39;s&#39; that all that the Fox report is saying is: &#39;We really do not know what the Japanese situation is&#39;. In January I was in Japan with a number of honourable members and senators and while there we took the opportunity of visiting the Tokai 1 power station which is situated about 70 kilometres from Tokyo. The Tokai 1 power station is the first commercial nuclear power generating station which Japan has established. It is not the only station; there have been many since then. The Tokai 1 power station was established in 1966 and has been feeding electricity into the Tokyo power grid ever since. Next door to the Tokai 1 station is the Tokai 2 station which will be commissioned later this year. It is a much larger and more modern power station. Nuclear power is seen by the Japanese as an energy source which will lessen her reliance on bulky fossil fuel. Of course, Japan is very sensitive to the reliability and regularity of supply of basic raw materials, particularly materials which can provide her with energy. Oil and coal must be imported in large quantities, and they create a further problem of stockpiling in a country with limited space. Thus the Japanese are attracted by the ease with which a year&#39;s supply of, say, nuclear fuel can be stored, providing a buffer against short term disruption of supply caused by regional conflicts and industrial boycotts. </para>
          <para>Japan has not yet recovered from the shock of the international oil crisis in 1973 when the action by oil producing countries brought Japan and some other oil importing countries almost to their knees. Another factor which the Japanese see as compelling them towards the development of nuclear power is the problem of atmospheric pollution in their overcrowded cities. The Government in Japan has a very active policy of discouraging industries which rely for their source of energy on coal and oil fired furnaces. Hydro-electric power developments are seen to offer little scope for meeting Japan&#39;s expanding energy requirements because Japan has used up most of the hydro-electric capacity in the country. Japan already has 13 nuclear power generating units in operation with a total output of 7428 megawatts. Presently under construction are a further 1 1 units and 4 more are being planned. Japan expects to be providing about 20 per cent of her electricity requirements from nuclear sources by the time the present construction program is completed in 1983. So for Japan there is no debate about whether to go nuclear- she already has. The main debate centres on methods and rates of progress and the siting of nuclear reactors. In that respect the debate on nuclear power in Japan is probably like the freeway debate in Australia. Everyone is in favour of freeways, but if people are asked whether they would like a freeway through their locality just a few yards away they would be against it. Public opinion polls in Japan indicate that there is a similar attitude to the development of nuclear power stations. </para>
          <para>I believe that in the case of Japan and, from what I understand, a number of other countries, they already have made a very clear decision that the development of nuclear energy is in their interests. Japan would say quite categorically that it is necessary for her own independence from the disruption that can be caused to sources of overseas supply of raw materials for her to have a nuclear generating capacity to supply a reasonable proportion of her electricity requirements. So I believe that the situation facing Australia is this: Many countries have made the decision to go nuclear for their power generation requirements. If a decision by Australia not to supply uranium would halt nuclear developments throughout the world I would probably be in favour of a moratorium on mining and exporting in order to resolve existing problems. I am troubled by some of the long term problems that seem to exist in relation to the disposal of waste. That is something that still has to be resolved throughout the world. However, the situation we face is that Japan and other countries already have gone nuclear. Several countries less politically stable and responsible than Australia have uranium supplies or are searching for them. Japan has contracts for the supply of uranium from Canada and South Africa until 1985. We were told in Japan that Japan is assisting Mali in its search for uranium. So it is clear that a number of countries in areas of the world that are less stable than Australia&#39;s area, countries which face potential conflicts and do not have such strict scruples about the supply of uranium as Australia has, are very active in the mining and exporting of uranium. </para>
          <para>Also there is the development of fast breeder reactors which has been alluded to by a number of speakers in this debate. Fast breeder reactors produce more and more plutonium. I believe that Australia&#39;s most constructive role is to become known as a responsible and reliable supplier of uranium to countries prepared to observe strict international safeguards. We should play a vigorous role in making those safeguards as effective as possible. This is the real option facing us, not the option of taking a high moral stand by not mining and exporting our uranium and hoping that, in some respect, that will prevent the rest of the world going nuclear. It will not. </para>

            <para>-This is one of the subjects on which there are 2 completely separate areas of discussion. One is the energy situation in the world and the necessity for new sources of energy. The other is the moral, social and ecological aspects and the damage which may be caused by providing the sources of energy which, I do not think anyone doubts, will become necessary in the very near future. We live in a society where any restriction on the use of resources, irrespective of what those resources are, is looked on as being unwarranted socialist government interference. Certainly, very few Australians and very few people in the industrialised west are prepared to look at their own situations and decide what their priorities are for the energy resources that now remain. People adopt an idealistic position and move along in the belief that something will come along some day and the problem will go away. It does not look as though this problem will go away. Nuclear energy, if it is used to its maximum extent, will delay the inevitable, possibly through most of our lifetimes and a little longer. But at that stage the problem will return. Technology may have advanced. It may not have. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Both Fox reports have one common factor. They have provided everyone, from whatever point of view they wish to argue, with a basis on which they can argue. It is assumed by those opposed to the mining and utilisation of uranium that the Fox reports suggest fairly strongly that Australia should not mine and export uranium. Those who wish to mine uranium can find parts of the report which make a different proposition. The present policy of the Australian Labor Party, that decided by the caucus, is based on the fact that confusion exists as to the future safe use of uranium and the capacity of the purchasers of that product to guarantee the safeguards which are necessary in the use of that product. It is not unreasonable that, as one of the major producer nations, we should be seeking that level of safeguard as a guarantee. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> made a statement the day before the second Fox report came down- we are debating that statement at the moment- in which he set out certain safeguard guarantees. He expanded on that statement in the United Kingdom yesterday in a manner which almost echoes the speech which was made here earlier this year by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam).</inline> It does not meet the requirements of those who want absolute safeguards. It certainly does not meet the requirements of the substantial proportion of those who want no mining at all. These are political decisions which, most likely, will be made with too much haste and little real consideration for their long term effects. Although we have had undertakings that a decision will not be made until the second Fox report has been properly debated as an entity in the Parliament, decisions will probably be made too early and without sufficient consideration being given to the 2 Fox reports and the other information available not only to the Government but also at international levels. </para>
          <para>The United States has a good moral position.  President  Carter has said that the United States is opposed to the development of fast breeder reactors. In the environment area and other major areas the United States seems to have a very sound policy line. It is opposed to the advanced technology of other countries ahead of the United States in that technology which damages the environment. I suggest that a certain aircraft is in that category. If an American supersonic aircraft had been constructed and was now operating, the demands of those working in the factories building those aircraft would have overcome the environmental problems surrounding its use. It is easy for  President  Carter to be self-righteous in this matter because the United States does not have that technological development at the moment. The people whom he is suggesting should not use their technology are the Europeans who are probably more dependent on nuclear power as an energy source at this stage than is the Unites States which has some basic petroleum supplies of its own. </para>
          <para>The key problem is whether nuclear energy can be used with reasonable safety to mankind itself. It is all right to say that the Japanese have made a decision to move into the area of nuclear power generation. The Japanese are in a similar situation to that of the United Kingdom late last century and early this century. With its high level of industry, it has to have massive supplies of energy available. In the United Kingdom, coal was the main source of energy. It is no longer a satisfactory source. Japan has never had a native source of energy. I think it is fair to say that we fought a war against Japan because of its need for access to petroleum which was cut off by an embargo in 1941. I do not think that the safeguards we are talking about at this stage are satisfactory. If we say to people &#39;If we sell you a product, we want guarantees that you will not use if for a certain purpose and that you will not sell it to another person&#39; and expect that that will be done we are being less than honest with ourselves. We sold aircraft to Indonesia on certain undertakings. They were used for quite different purposes from those for which we sold them. It is difficult to go into a market-place and say: &#39;I want to sell my goods but I want to drive the cars I sell you and eat the cakes I bake or whatever I provide you with.&#39; We are saying: &#39;We will sell you a raw material which is dangerous. Therefore, we want you to guarantee that you will use it in a certain way. Having sold it to you, we expect that you will not breach those agreements even though it may be necessary in your interests.&#39; </para>
          <para>The nuclear energy field is not an area into which we should rush. I do not think that a delay of a few months or even a few years will seriously jeopardise the energy resources that are available or are becoming available. Perhaps that sort of delay will provide safety measures and safeguards with long term consequences for the betterment of mankind which are more than matched by the money returns and some of the trade-offs which may be available at present. I am referring to greater access to the European Common Market and agreements with the United States which would be favourable to us. I am concerned that those sorts of trade-offs are not the way in which we should deal with a material which could have such adverse effects. We are talking of a half-life for radioactive waste material of SOO million years and more. At this stage no technology is available to us which can guarantee that we can protect future generations from the after effects of that nuclear waste. </para>
          <para>This Parliament is responsible for the export policies of a nation which is estimated to have 25 per cent of the world&#39;s known supplies of uranium. That may be a high estimate or a low estimate but the facts are that we are responsible for a major proportion of the world &#39;s uranium. In Australia we cannot make a decision on the basis of the argument about terrorists, atomic bombs etc. I think there is so much plutonium floating around the world at the moment that those sorts of arguments should not be taken into consideration. We should be looking at the specific consequences of accelerating the expansion of nuclear power generation at this stage without taking the trouble and the time to examine whether or not better conditions and circumstances and much higher levels of safeguards can be made available. By safeguards I do not mean agreements between nations because agreements between nations are only as good as the goodwill that exists between those nations. The history books are full of agreements between nations which were not worth the paper on which they were written. I remember one agreement in 1938 with a British Prime Minister. I remember a number written between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler in the late 1930s. History books are full of agreements in which the countries agreed not to do this and that. Such agreements are broken as necessity requires, whether that necessity be political power or economic requirements. </para>
          <para>Uranium is the basis of a vast source of energy. Rushing in to develop it in order to exchange it for market access or some other forms <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> influence would be irresponsible. I believe that delay in order to ensure that we are doing the right thing would be justified. At this stage I suggest that we should not be going into the mining and development of uranium but if delay can make certain that our decisions are correct I think delay is highly desirable. There is too much at stake and there is very little real information in the Australian community about this. I suggest that this debate is a preliminary discussion for Australia. A substantial proportion of the community is interested in this debate; a very small minority has any real understanding of what it is all about. </para>
          <para>This Parliament is debating uranium, I think for the third time in about three or four months. Most likely it has taken more time in the debate today than in all the other debates combined. There had been no previous debate of any substance. There have been gyrations on policies on this question by the political parties. The Australian Labor Party is a case in point. Only 2 years ago we adopted a platform which I doubt whether any constituent unit of the Party would accept as being a real and valid policy today. I would think that 2 years ago the attitudes of honourable gentlemen opposite would have been totally different from the attitudes they have in this area today. </para>
          <para>I remember a prime minister not long ago saying as part of his policy speech that we would construct a nuclear power station in Australia during the next few years. I think that was seven or eight years ago. Certainly the nuclear power station has not been built. I do not think any government since then has seriously considered building it because, first, it was not a necessary source of energy in Australia and, second, no government was satisfied that it could be done with sufficient safety to warrant its construction. I hope that the Government will delay any firm decision on the export and mining of uranium until such time as it is absolutely sure that such a decision is the correct one. I do not believe that sort of decision can be taken at this moment or in the near future. </para>

            <para>-This is a cognate debate on nuclear safeguards policy, the uranium industry and the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. I suppose I can claim with some justification that I have more than a normal interest in the decisions, the attitudes and the final debate- this is not it- which will produce our ultimate policy in relation to the export of uranium. My more than normal interest is stimulated by the fact that the only active mine in Australia producing and exporting uranium oxide is at Mary Kathleen, which is not only in the electorate of Kennedy but also very close to both of my home towns. </para>

          <para>The contribution of the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> was balanced and added splendidly to this debate. He brought out one matter in particular. He stressed the fact that agreements are broken. History has shown that. Attitudes change. I suppose we might well refer to the remarks of my Leader, the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> earlier in the day when he pointed out that the then Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> had canvassed the countries of the world in an all out endeavour to interest them in buying what is one of our major resources, uranium. From examination of the attitudes of the people on our right here-philosophically on our left- I do not think they have changed a great deal but they have become subject to the fringe of environmentalists who attract nothing but discredit on to the genuine, thoughtful, responsible people who have concern in relation not only to this matter of uranium but also to other matters. This is a group of people who are recognised- unless one is prejudiced in their regard- as the professional demonstrators, the professional bludgery </para>

In other words, the Prime Minister has allied himself with a man who has surprised the world by being so completely conscious of the necessity to supply safeguards. </para>
          <para>Let us look at what no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Margaret</inline> Maxly had to say and what she believes.  Her  own expression of opinion is this: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is one of the reasons why she believes Australia should undertake this venture. Here is an important point and I think it is worth consideration. No doubt it will receive consideration because the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> can be well assured that we are not rushing into this thing. But good heavens, how much longer are we to wait; how much longer are we to keep people out of employment while we consider and reconsider this matter? Admittedly we have had an analysis of the situation supplied by the 2 Fox reports. I think that we can safely say, if we are perfectly honest, because we are not going around the country and more or less justifying the expenditure and the lag of time, the years we have had to wait for the Fox Committee report to become available, that there is nothing new in it. For we people who are close to the uranium scene and for we people who confer from time to time with the people who are practically associated with the uranium situation there is nothing new in the Fox report. I say that if a decision had been made by the Government 2 years ago that decision would be little different from the decision which will be made perhaps 2 years hence, although I hope a lot earlier. God forbid that we have to wait that long. That is the situation. I cannot stress this point enough. I have to get across- we on this side of the House all have this duty- the expression of opinion that was so clearly enunciated by our own Leader, our own Prime Minister, and which was repeated here today by the Minister for National Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> who is also the Acting Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>Let us look at what the Prime Minister himself said when he talked about safeguards. He mentioned containment, surveillance and the accounting and inspection of nuclear materials. My goodness, the man could not have gone into greater detail. He summed up by saying this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Against this background, I would like to announce the following specific components of the comprehensive safeguards policy which the Government has adopted. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Note them and note them well. I am repeating them here tonight so that they will again appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I am repeating them so that the Prime Minister&#39;s words will counter the attitude of the media. This is the regrettable part of this whole situation. The media will give great headlines to every ratbag sort of demonstration that is put on from one end of the country to the other. I talk of demonstrations by those like Friends of the Earth. They have an affinity with the earth. I wish that that affinity was 6 feet deep. I have no compunction in making that comment. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party has degenerated. The regrettable thing is that there is a great element of hypocrisy on the part of many members of the present Labor Party. I repeat that the Prime Minister canvassed our uranium all around the world and hoped to get great sales of this product. Then we heard a suggestion during the debate today that we are just anxious to woo the big companies and that all we are concerned with is money and sales. The great capitalist, the multi-national story is put across again. Let us have a look at the capitalists. What does the bell boy <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> tell us? The bell boy <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> tells us that the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party would not live in anything less than an executive suite at the Wentworth Hotel. The bell boy <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> could tell honourable members a few other things as well. Let us cast our minds back to the advertisements about uranium that appeared in 1972. Some of the newspapers carried a full page advertisement and we saw some of the lesser lights in the business world such as Ken Myer supporting the Labor Party. Of course, he is not a capitalist! The Labor Party has no association with that type of person. It is economy size hypocrisy! </para>
          <para>I shall read the official safeguards enunciated by our Prime Minister. They cover: </para>

            <para>The need to keep policy under review; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I suppose that technical advances will have to be examined and we will be pliable in our attitude there.  careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards- </para>
          <para class="block">I was quite interested and fascinated by the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> in connection with this matter today. In one breath he was saying that the Agency&#39;s opinion was to be valued and in another breath he was telling us not to pay very much attention to it. The other components comprise:  bilateral agreements with customer countries: fallback safeguards;  that is extremely important-  prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing: </para>
          <para class="block">When we talk about re-export and reprocessing, we should stop to realise and to appreciate one particular fact: That if we are not going to export natural uranium we are going to stimulate the production of plutonium and other enrichment processes which will create a great hazard. Honourable members opposite should remember that when they talk about terrorism and all the other furphies. The remaining components are:  physical security; safeguard provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the human element of the uranium industry. I suppose I could also include the third subject of this debate, the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, under that heading. When I commenced my address to the House I said that I had in my electorate the only uranium mine which is actively operating in this country at present. There is a very large community and a very large body of workers who depend on that mine. It may interest honourable members to know that since the Mary Kathleen uranium mine went back into operation there have been a number of job vacancies. The company cannot get anyone suitable to fill those vacancies. When the Mount Lyell mine closed down the company thought it would have no difficulty in getting people to fill the vacancies at Mary Kathleen. They were not successful because extreme union bosses told people at the Mount Lyell mine that they were not to work at Mary Kathleen. I issue a word of warning to those bosses who are very comfortably situated in their great capital cities with their 4 television channels and so on. I say to them that it would be a decidely dangerous operation for them to appear physically on the Mary Kathleen uranium field. I suggest that if they do go up there they buy a single ticket, not a return ticket, because I do not think that they would need it. The people at Mary Kathleen depend on the mine for their existence. </para>
          <para>I wish to raise one final matter and it concerns people with whom I have grown up and know intimately and not for political purposes, the Aboriginal people. Let me tell honourable members opposite this and let them cut out their silly, stupid hypocrisy: If the Aboriginal people were to see the Ranger Mine develop tomorrow, they would take a fascinated interest and in time they would get to learn what was happening there. They would gain great advantages, monetary as well as physical, from the development of that area. The difficulty is that we get the great white bosses, the Uncle Toms- and they call us Uncle Toms- going out there and filling these people with alcohol and spurring them on to make them discontented. </para>

I hope that one day the honourable member will have his conscience pricked and feel some remorse in his heart for having used those words. I have a great deal of admiration for the people who demonstrate against this issue. I believe that they show true affection for their fellow man and the human race.

He pointed out in one of his lectures that some 10 000 young people between the ages of 7 and 12 years had died in the United States of leukaemia and that it was believed that these deaths had been brought about by the testing of atomic weapons in the atmosphere by the United States before it was agreed- </para>

              <para>- That happened before the United States agreed to outlaw testing in the atmosphere. The son of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Edward</inline> Kennedy had to have one of his legs removed at a very tender age because of leukaemia. I have often wondered whether that was the result of the atomic testing that occurred in the atmosphere some years ago before the great powers agreed to the outlawing of such testing.

              <para>- It should be within the knowledge of honourable members that, in the aftermath of the dropping of atom bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japanese women were giving birth to malformed children, as the statistics of the Japanese Government show. It is the inherent right and desire of every decent woman to reproduce. The girls of Nagasaki and Hiroshima went to other parts of Japan in anticipation of marrying and when it was learned that they had come from Nakasaki and Hiroshima they had great difficulty in being accepted because the statistics in Japan were showing up the malformation of young children. It was suspected that this was the result of the bombs being dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. </para>

          <para>I have some degree of respect for the Women&#39;s Electoral Lobby, which has dedicated itself to expressing concern about the reckless mining of uranium being allowed to continue. I applaud that organisation for its enthusiasm and enlightenment of society in general as to the effects of the mining of uranium if it is allowed to be done recklessly. Occasionally we hear the argument being put by supporters of the Government that we could become one of the richest countries in the Western world and that our foreign exchange earnings would be improved markedly if we produced enriched uranium and exported it. </para>
          <para>It is not so long ago that I attended a screening in this building of a documentary film on the life of Wilberforce M.P. in the Pitt Government in the United Kingdom about 1850. It was about the agitation by Wilberforce for the abolition of the slave trade and Britain&#39;s participation in the slave trade. The same arguments were raised then about the unemployment it would create in relation to the building of ships, about the ships &#39; crews being retrenched and about the foreign exchange that was being brought into Britain by its major participation in the slave trade. It was said then that underneath the decks of the ships there was valuable cargo. It should be recalled that Wilberforce made between five and seven attempts before getting his Bill through the House of Commons nearly 200 years ago.  His  attempts were frustrated because of the foreign exchange earnings. A similar argument is being put up here today by those who believe in the non-curtailment of the production of uranium. </para>

              <para>- It is capital intensive. I have learned through the years that wherever money and morals clash money eventually survives. One only has to recall the case of a wellknown drug company in West Germany that got writers, eloquent people and academics to advocate the sale of thalidomide before it produced that drug. The drug was supposed to be harmless to the human race. Money was put into the campaign to convince the public that the drug was harmless to human beings. This shocking scandal resulted in the drug company having to pay back millions of dollars in compensation to the unfortunate children who were born with defects as a result of the drug. That is what I mean when I say the power of money eventually survives in the Western world capitalist system. </para>

          <para>The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> at one time believed in stricter controls for the mining and export of uranium. But since he went around the world apparently he has been cushioned to take a more tolerant view. I am proud of the Labor Party&#39;s stance on this issue. We are very concerned about this matter. History shows that the Labor Party has always been concerned about the welfare of people in preference to money. I sincerely hope that the Australian people will take a greater interest in the mining and export of uranium because it is of major interest to the people of the world. In conclusion I want to quote something that was said by a famous American lady some time ago. She said that the people of the world are not as interested in the welfare of their fellow-man as they should be. </para>

            <para>- This debate which flows from the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and now encompasses the recommendations of the second Fox report and the statements of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on safeguards policy is an important element in the Government&#39;s consideration of the technically complex, diverse and internationally significant issues associated with uranium mining. It is natural and proper that Parliament should crystalise and provide a focus for the general public debate which is now taking place and which will continue on this issue. But whatever the tone of the debate, whatever arguments are put, however long the debate should last, at some stage the Government must accept its responsibility to decide the future of uranium mining in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has stated time and again that it would not make its decision until the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry had been received. However much the spokesmen of the Opposition would like to exaggerate, perhaps even to deceive, we have not yet made a decision on this matter. But we are now in a position to take further our consideration of uranium mining in Australia. </para>
          <para>The 2 Fox reports have emphasised the complexity of the issues confronting Australia over uranium mining. Australia has extensive deposits of uranium at a time when the world faces the need to make fundamental changes in its supply and use of energy resources, when there is growing concern for the environment in which we live, and when there is anxiety over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thus it is not merely a question of digging uranium out of the ground. The very mention of uranium propels us into an international arena and confronts us with a wide range of issues. </para>
          <para>I must say that speakers in this debate from both sides of the House have comprehended many of these issues, drawing them together in a consideration of nuclear safeguard policies, the potentiality of the uranium industry itself and the reports of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry. While I am on the subject of the inquiry I think I have to say that the Parliament is indeed fortunate to have available to it the 2 reports on the Ranger uranium problem. The 2 reports taken together represent a major contribution not only to Australia but also to international understanding of the environmental consequences of the uranium industry in the broadest terms as it affects mankind. In the Commissioners&#39; own words, it is a uniquely sensitive environmental consideration particularly when applied to the Alligator River area. I should like to convey to the Commissioners the Government&#39;s thanks for the very comprehensive way in which they have tackled their job. I know that each Commissioner has put an enormous amount of individual effort into the report. I think I can say that the people of Australia are indebted to them for their efforts. </para>
          <para>I should now like to address myself to the safeguard problem. In my statement to the Parliament on 1 1 November I indicated the Government&#39;s broad acceptance of the preliminary findings and recommendations of the report as a basis for future decisions on the industry. In particular, we strongly supported the inquiry&#39;s view on the need for the fullest and most effective safeguards on uranium exports. The Prime Minister&#39;s statement on uranium exports last week was the culmination of a long study by the Government of this significant aspect of the uranium mining question. For its part, the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry helped crystallise many of the issues and enabled the Government to take that issue further. The Government for some time has recognised the desirability of describing a comprehensive policy on nuclear safeguards. The announcement of that policy in no way pre-empted the decisions which the Government must take on whether to mine or export uranium. For the honourable member for Blaxland to say in this place that our safeguards policy really was something that we dreamt up on the spur of the moment in the last few weeks or that it was based on the Opposition&#39;s 5-point plan is absolute nonsense and total exaggeration. I stress again that this examination has been going on literally from the time that this Government came to office. It is Australia &#39;s contribution to international efforts to strengthen measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The timely development of this policy has enabled the Government to exercise a strong and responsible influence on international thinking on safeguards at a time when these matters are under close examination by many other countries. I refer here to the question of whether we should decide to export uranium. </para>
          <para>A basic feature of the Government&#39;s approach to safeguards policy is a recognition of the need to keep under close review safeguards policy and arrangements to take account of the evolution of international thinking on safeguards. I might add that my Department which is the Department responsible for the environment has maintained an active involvement in the interdepartmental committees which have advised the Government on these matters. Since the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Government, in formulating a policy in this matter, has taken into account the report of the Australian Safeguards Mission which was made late last year, the Prime Minister&#39;s correspondence with  President  Carter and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada and the recent visit to North America by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and several other Australian Government officials. But the essential elements of the Government&#39;s policy on safeguards have been made very clear in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. I do not think that I have to go through it here. But there are a couple of matters that I would like to take up. First of all, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 25 May 1977 stated that in one major respect the safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May falls short of supporting  President  Carter&#39;s recently expressed wish to see an end to recycling of spent fuel from conventional reactors to extract plutonium. </para>
          <para>I deny that statement completely. The safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister does not fall short of supporting President </para>
          <para class="block">Carter&#39;s policy regarding reprocessing. President Carter&#39;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1977 sent to Congress on, I think, <inline font-style="italic">21</inline> April defines export conditions relating to reprocessing as:   a requirement that no fuel exported from the United States be reprocessed without the prior approval of the United States. </para>
          <para class="block">The policy announced by our Prime Minister on 24 May contains an identical requirement. Australia supports the United States, Canada and other like-minded countries in constructive efforts to strengthen nuclear safeguards and reduce the risks of nuclear non-proliferation. A copy of the fact sheet issued by the White House on 27 April on  President  Carter&#39;s Nuclear NonProliferation Policy Act of 1977 is available from me for anybody who might want it. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> asked whether the new safeguards policy would apply to existing approved export contracts. In answer I point out that shipments are proceeding in respect of export contracts approved prior to 2 December 1972. As set out in the Government&#39;s statement of 1 1 November following the First Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, the Government is satisfied that appropriate controls would apply to the shipments under these contracts which will be used for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany, all of which are parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The material will be processed to uranium hexafluoride in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States which are parties to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and which require stringent safeguards on the material processed. Furthermore, in this regard as Australian uranium will be finally processed into enriched uranium in the United States, it will attract the full force of the safeguards policy recently announced by  President  Carter. If Australia proceeds with further development of its uranium resources, and safeguards agreements of the kind outlined in the policy statement are concluded, these will govern all subsequent shipments to those countries with which agreements are concluded. </para>
          <para>So, I summarise the position of the safeguards policy. Firstly, the Government has emphasised that it does not regard safeguards as a consideration to be balanced against plain commercial considerations. Secondly, the policy goes a long way beyond the 5-point plan proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> in this place on 25 March. Lastly, and most importantly, it goes a long way beyond the recommendations which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox in his 2 reports, particularly the first report. </para>
          <para>I go on now to some considerations of the debate itself. The motion before the House is, in essence, whether a decision on the further development of the uranium industry- that is, whether to permit the development of new uranium mines and the export of their products- should be the subject of further debate. The Government has recognised that the great issues raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox and his colleagues in their first report were of such a nature as required the involvement of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>We have been greatly encouraged by the very substantial interest which the Australian people have shown in this matter since the release of the first report. I have placed considerable importance on following the course of this debate since that time. As I have said before in the House, I asked both the staff of my office and officers of my Department to assist me in monitoring the debate. I kept myself closely informed both personally and through their reports of the various views which have been expressed. Of course, it should not be thought that the debate commenced with the first report of the uranium inquiry. That would be wrong. In fact, it has been going on for some years. The very existence of diverse views on mining and the export of uranium was one of the reasons which led the former Government to have the commission of inquiry implemented. The inquiry, of course, must be seen as a further significant element in the debate. Testimony to that fact is found when we consider that it sat for over 120 days and over 300 people were witnesses. The Government attributes great significance to the values and views which have been expressed, particularly during the last few months. We will continue to listen carefully to what is being said following the release of the second report. The Government will attempt to reflect, in any decision it may take, what it perceives to be the majority or consensus view of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>It would be foolish of me to suggest that the debate has a beginning and an end and that any clear and concise majority in favour of one course of action or another will emerge. The evidence that I have so far suggests that there is a wide diversity of views held very seriously by a diverse group of people and that any particular view is not limited to any specific section of the Australian community. In other words, the diverse attitudes on these issues are supported by Australians from a wide range of political and socio-economic backgrounds. Having said all that, I say bluntly to the House that on the evidence gathered so far- it is a comprehensive analysis which I have before me- the majority of Australians are not opposed to the mining and export of uranium given adequate safeguards over the uses to which these exports may be put and the guaranteed protection of the environment, the conservation of nature and the highest consideration for the interests of the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>However, I cannot support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> since clearly that would pre-empt the very recommendations which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox and his colleagues have made. Indeed, we are not faced with a single decision but with a whole series of decisions. I have no doubt that as those decisions are taken- some within a relatively short time, others within months and perhaps years to come- the debate will continue and, in turn, will influence the Government in the sequence of decisions. Whatever experience we may obtain through research and consideration of the other matters put forward by the commissioners will reinforce our capacity to make those decisions. I make some mention of the inquiry process. The inquiry and these reports epitomise in a most comprehensive and profound way what environmental concerns are about. The definition of environment in the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act states: - - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Environment includes all aspects of the surroundings of man, whether affecting him as an individual or in his social groups. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The commissioners have scrupulously followed the implications of this definition and have reinforced the validity of the environment as a dimension of concern, not only to governments but also to all Australian people. While referring to this Act, I make some comment on the inquiry processes which may be instituted under it. These processes are not commonly directed and are reserved for matters of particular complexity or public concern or, as in this case, where both of these aspects arise. The end point of an inquiry is the recommendations it makes, in the first place to the Minister responsible for environmental matters and then he- that is myself in this case- in turn carries them to the Government as a whole for its decision. I emphasise that it is the Government and, through it, the Parliament which in the end determine, and must determine, what is acceptable or otherwise for the Australian environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted.)</inline> I thank the House for its indulgence. I shall finish within a few short minutes. I finish on this note: As the national Minister concerned with the environment, I state that the thrust of the many recommendations of the inquiry seems to me to be entirely consonant with proper environmental protection. Of course, these recommendations will need much detailed examination by the Government. In particular, I have no difficulty if the Government decides to proceed with mining in relation to the first recommendation of the second report which is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No part of our proposals be varied unless it is clear that alternatives will be pursued which will just as satisfactorily achieve the same purposes and the same principles. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am sure that the proposals will be varied if only to take account of the fact that under the circumstances in which such a decision might be taken it will need to be recognised that uranium occurs widely throughout Australia. Thus, I would like to see further administrative arrangements developed which are consistent with the discussions I have been having with my counterpart ministers in the States on environmental assessment. Having said what I have said about the inquiry itself, I point out that I believe that the inquiry has led to the assembly of much relevant but, I suppose, previously relatively inaccessable information. It provides an opportunity to test the accuracy of data and the validity of judgments in an open forum and will enable the nation as a whole, the Parliament and this Government to develop and implement soundly based policy. </para>

I believe it is an issue which will affect not only this generation but many generations to come. I believe it is one about which the people of Australia and of the world should very carefully consider their attitudes and positions before making their decision. I am not so deeply concerned about the question of mining but I am deeply concerned, as a matter of conscience, about questions of waste and proliferation. </para>

              <para>- I am referring particularly to plutonium. For example, on the question of waste, a committee of my Party in this Parliament recently had before it <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hardy</inline> of the Atomic Energy Commission, who was said to be a pro-uranium man very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as a source of power, and I believe he is. But as he went on during the afternoon, discussing this matter and answering questions- I want to make it very clear that I am not making a personal attack on him- I felt that he became one of the strongest advocates of a moratorium. The arguments he put up were such that he was strongly advocating the cause of a moratorium and of the world having to attack the issues of waste and proliferation. In regard to waste, he discussed the various methods of disposal. For example, France drops the waste into the deepest parts of the Atlantic in stainless steel containers. Lately it has been said that it should be placed in containers about 8 feet or 9 feet high and the containers should be buried in particular formations such as salt or granite 600 metres below the ground. In other words, there would be a platform 600 metres below the ground. When all the holes were filled with the containers they would be sealed off and guarded for a thousand years. That was his submission. He submitted that although plutonium was active for 250 000 years it was dangerous to man for only 1000 years and therefore it was necessary to guard it for only 1000 years. Who can tell us what the political situation in the world will be in 50 years time or 100 years time? </para>

              <para>- Or in 50 days, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says; or in 500 years or 1000 years? How could such a guarantee be given? The honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> mentioned earthquakes. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hardy</inline> said that the waste should be buried in areas whose history is free of earthquakes. Once again, we could never be sure. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hardy</inline> also admitted that another proposal was floating around- I heard it first about a year ago coming from Japan and now it is coming from the United States- that those countries which sell uranium should control the sale and ensure that the plutonium is returned to them and buried in their own country. The north-west of Australia is one of the areas which has been mentioned. In other words, we would be the garbage dump for atomic waste. </para>

              <para>-I am speaking very seriously. These submissions were put before us by a very eminent atomic scientist in Australia. In answer to a question from me on proliferation and how it can be controlled, he said that that was something for the countries and governments of the world to handle by negotiation and agreement, and the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> will remember that. If I recollect correctly, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Hardy</inline> admitted that it was very difficult to get agreement between the various governments of the world on these issues. The point I am making is that this person, who was pro-uranium, was advocating the waste being buried roughly 2000 feet below the ground in special formations such as granite and salt. </para>

              <para>- Yes, in geologically sound areas, and it should then be guarded for 1000 years to ensure that it could not be obtained for purposes of manufacturing atomic bombs and so on. Secondly, he was advocating that there should be agreements between the governments of the world in relation to proliferation. Quite frankly, I think he damned his own case. I know that he is probably very dedicated to his viewpoint but his viewpoint does not happen to be mine. I believe that in making those submissions he strengthened the case against the sale of uranium for nuclear energy purposes. For this reason I believe that there should be a moratorium. Some argue it should be for 2 years, others argue for 5 years. I personally believe that it should be an extended moratorium so that the debate can continue. At present the vast majority of people are still quite uninformed on this issue. Next Sunday in my electorate we are showing 3 hours of films covering both sides of the debate. </para>

              <para>-Strangely enough, my friend, they do, as well as the economic consequences and the alternatives. We must remember that nuclear energy can fill a gap of only 20 years. That figure is based on the known resources of uranium in the world at this stage, and that is what we are talking about. In other words, when petroleum starts to run out there will be a 2-decade gap which nuclear energy will fill. From that time on we will have to look to solar power. One of the great things about this debate is that it is not just occurring in Australia. It is occurring throughout the world in countries such as West Germany, Japan and the United States of America. I believe that the result of this debate will be to force countries to inject more capital investment into finding alternatives for petroleum and nuclear energy and to investigate sources of power such as solar energy. This is the basic reason that I support a moratorium. I support it because it will force a debate. It is a debate which has to occur. Unfortunately this Government is endeavouring to ignore the main recommendation of the Fox report. </para>

              <para>- You have had no moratorium, brother. The Fox report came out only a few months ago. The Government wishes to move ahead straight away. I can say only this: I hope that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter)</inline> will finally realise how far wrong the extreme Right has been time and time again. It was wrong in issues such as Vietnam. I believe it will find out as time moves on that it is also wrong on this issue. For those reasons I am strongly of the view that the debate should continue. We are aware that these days individuals who can obtain plutonium can make crude atomic bombs with the use of science magazines published in the United States. </para>

              <para>-As the honourable member for Hughes says, schoolboys could make such a bomb. Certainly terrorists could do so. In other words, in the future it will not be a case of hijacking aeroplanes. Terrorists will turn to making crude home-made atomic bombs. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to consider these issues. I submit very sincerely that they are issues of conscience which will not just affect this generation but can affect many generations to come. I am not normally looked on as a young radical. I am speaking on this issue tonight as a matter of conscience because I have a very strong and firm belief that we should be prepared to allow this debate to continue, and that the Government should be prepared to grant a moratorium on the mining and future sales of uranium. It should do this instead of introducing into the Parliament papers such as the one presented by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 24 May 1977 headed &#39;Government policy on nuclear safeguards&#39;, which is basically window dressing to give him an excuse for further mining and to allow Australia to enter into further contracts for the sale of uranium to countries for nuclear purposes. </para>

The Prime Minister did not even have the decency to wait until the report was tabled in the Parliament. Having made those points which I think are very important, I submit very sincerely that a moratorium should be placed on uranium mining. There must be a debate on the subject. The debate is occurring throughout the world. It is important that the world be forced to face up to the fact that alternatives have to be found. I repeat that. I am deeply concerned not so much on the question of mining as on the issues of waste and proliferation. I am deeply concerned because they will affect many generations to come. </para>

              <para>- That is what is called a policy, as the honourable member for La Trobe quite correctly interjects. It is, in fact, a policy of political expediency. It is now recognised as a useful emotional vote catching gimmick to discover suddenly that there are such serious risks in uranium mining in Australia that it should not take place. Of course, this is in total contradiction of the proposition maintained earlier by most of the leading members of the Party opposite. In the halcyon days of their power all they were concerned about was getting the most money for uranium. The question of morality apparently did not appear so large as magically overnight it has now become. Professor Heinz Arndt made a couple of interesting points on this topic of the morality of the uranium debate in a recent speech. Of course, he is professor of economics at the Australian National University. He pointed to the comparisons between the long campaign against fluoridation of the water supply and the anti-uranium proposition. There was no doubt that the anti-fluoridation fanatics continued their fight against fluoridation despite being trapped by an experiment in a United States mid-western town. The water engineer announced that the water supply for March, I think is was, had been fluoridated. The city council was inundated with letters complaining about people&#39;s teeth falling out, their hair falling out, people becoming pregnant magically and people becoming unpregnant even more magically. Only at the end of this period he announced that in fact, the water supply had not been fluoridated at all. This did not discourage the wild campaign which, of course, was based on something of a paranoid streak which I suggest tends to run through many protest <inline font-style="italic">movements.</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As Professor Arndt pointed out, the general thing about protest movements of this kind is that the questions at issue are seen as matters of conscience. It was curious that that exact phrase was used by the honourable member for Chifley.  His  conscience has been prompted suddenly after so many years to come to the fore on this matter for the first time. Such people are also involved in value judgments which cannot be proved right or wrong. The other point that Professor Arndt made was that the issues often turn in part on highly technical matters which layman find it hard to understand, let alone assess, while the experts as in all matters of applied science can never be absolutely certain but nave to base their opinions on the weight of evidence. Professor Arndt points out that the present antinuclear campaign, which in Australia concentrates on opposition to mining and export of uranium, is clearly in this tradition of conscience radicalism. The issues, of course, are technically difficult. The points that seem to be raised by the opponents are based on an attitude of fear, risk, terror and confusing people by appealing to their emotions. What is not discussed by such people are the benefits, the need to go nuclear or, in fact, the risks of not going nuclear. </para>
          <para>Fortunately I had the opportunity earlier this session to discuss the first Fox report in the House. At that time I pointed out the serious consequence of carbon wastes in the atmosphere if we continued to use fossil fuels or continued to increase our use of fossil fuels at the dramatic and drastic rate of recent years. This will have a climactic effect on our capacity to survive on this planet. </para>
          <para>The alternative proposition with respect to uranium is that nuclear fuel is much safer and much cleaner, and that has been demonstrated very adequately to be the fact. The other point I made at that time and I want to repeat it as quickly as possible, is that the failure to provide uranium to power users will force the earlier arrival of the plutonium economy, which is the dangerous economy. That is the product which can Lc used in atom bombs. It is the area where the scare technique, the scare campaign, may well ultimately have a degree of accuracy. It is fascinating that the people who are opposing the use of nuclear power and the mining of Australian uranium are by their very actions forcing the power hungry nations of this world into a technology which uses hardly any uranium at all but which is desperately dangerous. It is an irony that this campaign will achieve exactly the opposite of what it hopes to achieve. </para>
          <para>One has to ask whether that campaign is based on a degree of integrity in many areas and I submit, as I did a few weeks ago, that that campaign largely seems coincidentally to be protecting the interest of Arab oil producers in an energy hungry area. There is no doubt that the provision of large quantities of uranium from Australia would help reduce the stranglehold that the Arab nations have on the fuel situation in this nation, and one does not have to breakfast with an Iraqi to understand that simple economic fact. </para>
          <para>The other points which Professor Arndt made are very real. They deal with the question of risk which clearly is the crux of the anti-uranium debate. He underlines the fact that it is in the next stage, and not in the current stage which, as we know, Australia is opposed to developing out of, when we would see plutonium used that there is a real risk. President Carter and the Australian Government oppose the development of that stage, and very sensibly. Apart from the moral position in opposing it there is the simple economic fact that if the world went into plutonium there would be no market for our product. The harsh commercial reality, as well as morality, forces us into supplying uranium without further delay. Already there has been a 5-year delay in the development of this energy source in an energy hungry world, and even if the Government goes ahead as fast as it can it will be probably 1980 before we could see a reasonable level of uranium production in Australia going to meet the markets for energy in this world. </para>
          <para>The general question of risk is raised by the anti-uranium people when they talk about terrorists. The fact about the terrorist threat is that there are many more easy ways readily available to terrorists to hold the world to ransom, and we have seen them used repeatedly. I do not believe that this is a real case against nuclear power. For heavens sake, the opportunities for using the most horrible chemicals have been with such terrorists for many years, and we have to live with that problem. Another question that arises from the anti-uranium position concerns moral suasion. It is held out to us that if Australia does not develop its uranium resources, if we do not supply this fuel for nuclear power stations, it will dramatise the situation and encourage the rest of the world not to do likewise. This is a very charming proposition but I would like to point out that the only people who could be influenced by such moral suasion are people in countries which are governed by the democratic process where the voice of the people can be heard. Let us face it: There is not much point in people in Hungary trying to use moral suasion; it did not work too well against the tanks last time. The people of Czechoslovakia did not find moral suasion very effective against the Russian military machine. The only place where it would have any effect is in the democracy where the people&#39;s voice is heard. There would be only one effect of moral suasion, assuming that it were successful, and that would be to further diminish the relative strength of the Western democracies against the totalitarian nations which are proceeding apace with nuclear power. The Russians have no such scope for moral scruples even if one concedes that there is a moral point to be had in failing to use uranium. The fact is that the moral suasion point is not only assinine in its effect but also terribly dangerous for the world. It increases independence from fossil fuels of a rival group of, say, totalitarian nations over democratic nations. </para>
          <para>Here we have on 2 scores the position being put by the Labor Opposition in this House and by the anti-nuclear campaign around this nation and benefiting a group of people who are in a very interesting situation in this world. In the first place there are the Arab oil producers, and in the second place there are the totalitarian nations. It is interesting to see the Labor Party assisting their cause with such enthusiasm. The fact is that there is no real point anyway in Australia having a moratorium or refusing to supply uranium to the rest of the world. As the Fox Commission has pointed out, if Australia were to stop uranium mining and exports further low cost supplies would become available from higher cost grade ore deposits in other countries to meet any deficiency created by Australia not exporting uranium. Withholding Australian supplies would not appreciably affect United States uranium prices, at least until 1990. The principal effect of not making Austraiian supplies available would be to make it necessary for other countries to put more effort into developing their resources. </para>

              <para>- Probably it would have been called the women&#39;s hysterical lobby at that time. No doubt it would have objected to the wheel even though ultimately a Miss Boadicea developed this dreadful weapon to its ultimate by fixing very dangerous sabres to the wheel and rushing through the ranks of her opponents with it. The point one should remember about Miss Boadicea is that despite the indiscriminate use of this new and terrible weapon she was eventually defeated by the use of conventional weapons. I do not know which weapon it was but the thing is that it was the wheel and not Boadicea which survived. Certainly there were dangers. Pregnant women riding in carts on wheels may well have suffered miscarriages as a result of the jolting. People could well have been run over by wheels being driven by reckless people. The wheels could have been used to carry guns and other wickedness around the place. People could have suffered heart attacks from driving wheels too fast. There was a dreadful attack on civil liberties because wheels made noise which affected people in the middle of the night, and further, they had to get out of the way of the wheels if they were coming towards them. There is no doubt that if the world had not recognised that the benefits of the wheel were far greater than its risks the wheel would never have been developed. Exactly the same situation exists in relation to nuclear power. ___ </para>

I was one of the few who worked with the honourable member for Mackellar, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth,</inline> in a group of members who were interested in the whole of the nuclear problem facing the nation.

          <para>It is now 20 years since I first went to Calder Hall in Cumberland and with a nuclear scientist went through one of the earliest British reactors. I do not think anybody should underestimate the fact that there has been only one nuclear accident in Britain. That was at Windscale when a plutonium operation overheated and was closed down. Nobody should underestimate the problems involved. On the other hand, it is not wise for people to build up fears and terror concerning the nuclear age in which we are all living whether we like it or not. - </para>
          <para>I want to refer to one of the great problems in front of us. When we talk about uranium and nuclear fission and energy the immediate thought in the minds of many people is death and destruction. They say automatically that this nation must not be party to anything involved with destruction. That is a perfectly honourable and moral attitude to take. It is one which must be respected. However, the whole world has so changed since the dropping of the first and second atomic bombs. We must get used to the world in which we are living. I hope I will not bore the House or those who are listening to me if I tell honourable members how many commercial reactors are in operation in various countries. I shall give a few examples. At this moment France has 10 commercial nuclear reactors in operation. They provide 8.5 per cent of the electricity used in France. Britain has 3 1 commercial reactors in use creating 10 per cent of its electrical energy. The United States has 56 commercial reactors now in operation producing 9 per cent of its electricity. The honourable member for Casey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Falconer,</inline> made an exceptionally good speech about Japan. He pointed out that Japan has 13 commercial reactors in operation producing 5.4 per cent of its electrical energy. Some people are astounded when I tell them that Switzerland with only 3 very powerful commercial nuclear reactors is producing 1 7 per cent of its electricity. Honourable members should not suppose that the Soviet Union and other countries are not also using commercial nuclear reactors to produce electricity. I do not wish to take the time of the House to read out the name of every country but there are 1 70 commercial nuclear reactors generating electricity in operation at present. One hundred and twenty-six are on order. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Table 3 from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission&#39;s twenty-fourth annual report. </para>

              <para>-Having brought everybody&#39;s mind to the time in which we are really living, I point out that we can see that the demand for uranium oxide will certainly increase. We forecast that more reactors will be built. One specific argument is worrying us about providing our own uranium. There are scientists who say that the second generation reactor, the sodium reactor breeder, will not require uranium and will use only plutonium. But, as we have already heard from the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> in a well delivered speech, that operation is being opposed by  President  Carter at the moment. Scientists are thinking seriously whether the second generation reactors should be allowed to operate. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that we now have 25 per cent or more of the world&#39;s reserves of uranium. Has there ever been a time in the history of this great nation when we stood at one of the most decisive moments in history? When before were we so important in the councils of the world? As a nation, we will not allow the export of our uranium to other countries unless we are quite satisfied that we will take full part in every international organisation in the whole of the nuclear energy field. Have we had an opportunity like this before? No, we have not. If we do not take this chance now it may not come again. It is essential for our children, our future and our position in the world that we get on with solving the greatest problem, that is the safeguards which are required. We have talked about safeguards. Did we not hear people using the wonderful expression &#39;safeguards&#39;? What safeguards are we talking about? The nuclear non-proliferation Treaty is something with which we can do our very best. It is an international agreement. As some honourable members have said, how can we enforce an international agreement, short of war or doing something like Israel did to rescue its people from Entebbe? How can we be certain that this treaty will work? We cannot. We have to take it on trust. But our own Atomic Energy Commission can take definite action. We are in a position to demand representation on the Atomic Energy Control Commission in Vienna. </para>
          <para>I put a question to the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> last week. I asked whether he could give me the name- just the name- of Australia&#39;s representative on this international Commission. He did not know. I also asked how many inspectors the nation had to police, observe and take part in the work of the Agency. He did not know. These are the questions which the Opposition should be probing. These are the questions which everyone else will be asking in a very short time. Everybody will say: &#39;What is Australia actually doing about safeguards&#39;. Will inspectors, for example, be able to observe our uranium arriving in other countries, being loaded into reactors and taken out? What rights will we have in this field? I believe that we must fight for those rights now. I am certain that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> is making quite certain on his journey that our voice in the control and inspection of nuclear equipment and material will be one of our great achievements in the closing years of this century. People are going to say about us: &#39;They had the courage to realise and to face up to their responsibilities. It was just luck that 25 per cent of the world&#39;s uranium was in their country. They simply did not stand by and behave like a lady of easy virtue and say: &#34;Help yourself&#34;. They said: &#34;We must be certain that we look after it and take care. But if we let this stuff go around the world we are going to police it and do our very best with it&#34;. &#39;. </para>
          <para>I come to the next argument. Is it too far ahead for us to ask of our friends that we enrich the uranium in Australia ourselves and export it? If a new science is developing concerning the recycling of waste, why should we not have the uranium back and go into the whole of the recycling science here? We are at a wonderful moment in time in a completely new era of a nuclear world. We simply have to get ourselves together and have sufficient courage to go into the world and play our full part. I do not want to say anything too disparaging about the Opposition but I cannot understand the point of waiting for 5 years to find out whether the safeguards would be all right. Members of the Opposition asked: How goes the science for looking after the waste material? Why do we not take part in all these operations ourselves? What are we waiting for? Waiting for Godot, I suppose. Let us not worry about what the Opposition says. </para>
          <para>I was very disturbed at a remark by one of the Opposition&#39;s leaders who said that whatever international arrangements this Government made the Opposition might default on them. I have never heard anything so hypocritical and downright dangerous. When we are making international agreements concerning nuclear equipment and this sort of material it should be possible for the 2 front benches to come together and make certain that we do not at a later date let down all our friends, neighbours and the world by ratting on a treaty that we have already negotiated. I have listened to the speeches of the Opposition with great pleasure. I am just sorry that this particular fault seemed to come through from all the Opposition speeches today. I do not want to take the time of the House. Other honourable members want to speak. It has been a most enjoyable debate. This is one of the most serious problems that face us because it concerns our own survival. </para>

            <para>- My constituent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Noel</inline> Ginn of Universal Street, Eastlakes, asked me to raise a matter which concerns immigration. I mentioned it to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar),</inline> who I think may be here later. Briefly, this is the situation: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Noel</inline> Ginn is a personal friend of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan,</inline> who is a Malaysian. He arranged for his friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> to visit Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> duly departed on 19 March on flight 893A from Kuala Lumpur and arrived at Mascot airport at 9 a.m. on the following day, Sunday, 20 March. I am told that at the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan&#39;s</inline> arrival at Mascot airport <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn</inline> was waiting for him as a friend in the outside terminal but they were unable to meet because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> was detained by the Commonwealth officials there and held in some sort of restraint for some hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> pleaded with the officials to allow him to make some contact with his friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn</inline> who was waiting outside. No action was taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn</inline> made inquiries as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> had arrived at the airport and was told that he had not. He then left the airport. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>So the situation was that this young man who flew all the way from Malaysia on 19 March, arrived on 20 March, and was held for some 2 hours at the airport on the basis that there was something wrong with his visa. He had no opportunity to contact his friend who was outside. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> also had with him a return ticket to Kuala Lumpur, evidence of assets and a key to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn&#39;s</inline> premises. So there was no doubt about where he was going to stay, no doubt about his intention to return. He was able to look after himself by way of money. He said he was treated very badly during this 2-hour restraint period. He suggested that he should stay. That request was denied and he was instructed to get the first flight back to Kuala Lumpur. Honourable members can imagine the young man&#39;s concern. He had only just arrived. He had been under detention for 2 hours and then been ordered out of the country. </para>
          <para>He was then flown to Melbourne, kept under police guard for some time and returned the same day to Kuala Lumpur, where he now is. So the unfortunate gentleman has been put to the trouble and expense of flying to Sydney and returning to Kuala Lumpur from Melbourne being required to return on the basis that there must have been something wrong with his visa. He had no opportunity to contact the friend with whom he was going to stay in Sydney. In his view he is entitled to compensation- certainly to the extent of $910 which was the cost of the return ticket. We are seeking compensation on his behalf. Anybody representing him would say that there must be some explanation of how this happened. He had a passport issued in Malaysia that was used to get him an entry visa to Singapore. I am informed that in that passport he had a visa to enter Australia, that visa having been issued in Singapore on 7 March. The circumstances were that this young man had a passport, had a visa endorsed in it, made a flight, was detained for 2 hours and was treated, as he said, very badly. No effort was really made to contact his friend who was outside.  His  friend left the terminal and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn</inline> was immediately removed back to Kuala Lumpur. He is still there. I might add that I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ginn</inline> if he would kindly get these instructions confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> and there is a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> confirming what I have said. I understand that there is some explanation and I would be grateful to hear it. </para>

            <para>I write on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs .</inline> . . who complained to me about the activities of the Community Relations Commissioner, the  Hon.  A. Grassby. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline>is reported in the Brisbane Telegraph of 20 April 1977 as claiming that generations of Japanese had been led to believe that &#34;Australians were racists&#34;, and that they, the Japanese, had &#34;been brought up on textbooks critical of the White Australia policy and our treatment of Aborigines.&#34; The newspaper report alleged that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> claimed that even in newly produced Japanese textbooks, Australian characteristics were held to include &#34;racial bias&#34;. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline>was speaking at a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation seminar on teacher education. </para>

            <para>Japanese born <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs .</inline> . . , who has been an Australian resident since 1 939 and a citizen since 1 967, had been &#34;distressed and annoyed&#34; by the allegations. She has since checked with many visiting Japanese students, Japanese exchange students presently resident in our country and numerous visiting Japanese businessmen and their wives. She frequently acts as an interpreter for such groups as the latter. She has even written to school-going relations in Japan requesting evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> &#39;s allegations. </para>
            <para>The result gives her even more reason for distress and concern. All those questioned by her advise they have no knowledge of the existence of such textbooks and that it was untrue to say &#34;generations of Japanese had been led to believe Australians were racists&#34;. In accordance with the Racial Discrimination Act, this amounts to a slur upon the Japanese. Besides, I have made my own enquiries. A young Japanese couple, friends of mine, lived with me in my Brisbane home for 15 months. They have no recollection of Australia being presented in their country of origin&#39;s textbooks and teachings as racist. </para>
            <para>Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> a student of Japanese? Can he actually provide sufficient examples, if any, of his allegations to sustain his all embracing claims? It is felt by some with whom I have since discussed this matter that this is but one more example of his being prepared to say anything for the sake of saying something to snatch media attention. </para>
            <para>On behalf of . . . , I formally lay the complaint that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> has made racist statements reflecting upon the Japanese and detrimental to the country which gives him his $36,000 a year salary.

            <para>- I wish to raise in the Parliament tonight a matter which I consider to be a great exploitation of people who are commonly called prohibited immigrants. I have spoken with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McKellar)</inline> in regard to this case and I am raising the matter so that I can place on public record the extent to which people who are in the unfortunate situation of being in Australia and classified as prohibited immigrants are being exploited by people who should know better. They are being exploited by solicitors, by one solicitor in particular. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Without naming the person who is classified as a prohibited immigrant, I should like to put into the public record the circumstances of this case. He is a Fijian of Indian origin. He came out to Australia in December 1976. He had been in Australia previously on a tourist visa. Basically he came to Australia with the intention of trying to get the approval of the Australian Government to stay in Australia as a permanent resident. He has a brother in Australia who is an Australian citizen. I do not know who advised this person from Fiji to go to this solicitor, but apparently within the Fijian and Tongan community here in Australia, this solicitor, whose name I will reveal in a few moments, has a name for being able to do something with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I think this is falsely so because all this solicitor seems to do is separate these unsuspecting people from their money. </para>
          <para>The solicitor concerned is a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> P. Khoury who practices under the name of Benjamin and Khoury, Solicitors and Attorneys at Law, of 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point. If my memory serves me correctly, when a person becomes a solicitor he becomes a servant or an officer of the court and there are certain ethics involved. One of the ethics, as I understand it, is not to separate poor unsuspecting people from their money. The circumstances of this case are that my constituent, as he is now, within a couple of weeks of arriving in Australia, was advised to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury,</inline> the solicitor at Potts Point. The first thing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> did was ask my constituent for $300 in cash. On my constituent&#39;s first contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury, Mr Khoury</inline> said to him: &#39;Well, the best thing you can do is give me $300.&#39; My poor unsuspecting constituent paid over that money at the first interview, without, I might add, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> even giving him a receipt for the $300. The purpose for my constituent paying the $300 in the first place was to get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> to represent him in his attempt to get permanent residency in Australia. On my constituent&#39;s next contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> he was asked for another $300. That made $600 which my constituent paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury.</inline> Then, on 20 April 1977, some 3 months later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> sent my constituent a letter. I shall read an exerpt from that letter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We request that you forward to us by return mail an amount of $500 being continuing retainer in this matter. We would appreciate receiving such within 7 days from the date hereof. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That makes a total of $1,100 which this solicitor wanted. Now what was the purpose of him wanting that money? What was the solicitor supposed to be doing? All the solicitor was to do was to get an application form from my constituent to forward to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for the purpose of trying to get him permanent residency in Australia. Up to the present time that form has not been sent to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I am informed by the Department that this Khoury character- I call him that- has purloined money from over 600 clients so far. I ask the Minister to investigate this rapacious solicitor. I ask the Commissioner of Taxation to investigate his activities and I also ask the Law Council to do so because a man like this should not be allowed to practice. He is a disgrace to the Australian legal profession. </para>

            <para>-The dog in the manger attitude of the Australian Cricket Board towards the Packer promotions is a shortsighted attitude towards professional cricket. Unless the Australian Cricket Board does a complete about face, the cricketing public of this country will be the losers. They will then be denied their right of seeing the thrilling spectacle of the world &#39;s greatest cricketers doing battle on the playing fields of Australia. As a former first grade cricketer and naturally a lover of the game, like so many thousands of Australians, I welcome the initiatives that lie behind the Packer promotion of a world series in cricket. The greatest single worry of all cricket lovers throughout the world is that the inauguration of a professional series would sound the death knell of the historic England versus Australia test matches as we know them. I have satisfied myself that this need not be the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Professional promotion of cricket is as inevitable as was the professional promotion of golf and tennis in this country. To ensure that the super tests and the traditional test series exist side by side is paramount. I believe that it can be achieved only if the Australian Cricket Board will face up squarely and perceive the inevitability of which I speak. There need be no interference with the series in Australia. In the 1979-80 summer no series is planned for Australia. The Australian team is due to tour India and Pakistan during that period. Negotiations on both sides in a spirit of conciliation and compromise can see the super series and the test matches proceeding without interference one from the other. </para>
          <para>My investigations lead me to the firm belief that Kerry Packer has requested a meeting with the Australian Cricket Board and that its only response has been that the Board will meet him in due course. I believe that it was foolhardy of the Board&#39;s Secretary in his recent endeavour to fly to England to &#39;kill off&#39; the Packer promotion by inflaming world opinion when neither he nor his Board has signified a willingness to sit down and talk. If this arms length attitude continues, the clear and unmistakable loser will be the public. </para>
          <para>The prospect of seeing the best players in the world gathering together in a series of super tests each season must surely excite the interest of even the casual supporter. I believe that the new professional group will provide more opportunity for younger players and that the group&#39;s existence will open up the opportunity for the emergence into international cricket of up and coming players. It will mean that our great players will not be lost to the sport prematurely. Certainly this has been highlighted recently with players like Ian Chappell, Ian Redpath and Ross Edwards quitting the game in their prime. </para>
          <para>I recall the old saying that there are none so deaf as those who do not want to hear. I believe that if the Board has adopted this attitude- many could be forgiven for believing that it has- it has fallen into grievous error. Let there be no mistake that the Australian Cricket Board over many years has rendered great service to Australian cricket and, as a direct consequence, to all Australians. Let it continue to do so by instigating a conference with the Packer group in an atmosphere of compromise on both sides. I am sure that if this were done common sense would prevail and that it would be to the advantage of all cricket lovers throughout the nation. When one looks at the Board&#39;s itinerary over the next 3 years one sees that only one tour of Australia that is guaranteed of success is planned in the next 3 years. </para>

            <para>- It has been prevailed upon me to raise in the Parliament a matter concerning a very enterprising businessman in Sydney whom I have known for many years. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norman</inline> Mitchell, who lives at Pennant Hills. He has a small pony stud farm at Glenorie. In 1972 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> imported three or four miniature ponies. They are known as Falabella ponies. They originated in Argentina 150 years ago. These ponies grow to a height of 36 inches and a maximum weight of 120 lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell,</inline> being a horse lover, as was his late father, brought in these horses at a cost of about $10,000. They were in quarantine in England for 12 months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline>is virtually at bursting point now because the Royal Agricultural Society will not give the horse a classification and therefore he cannot exhibit them at its shows. The Australian Pony Stud Book Society will not give them a classification and will not allow them to be registered. That seems to me to be unfair treatment of this decent, enterprising Australian because these horses are recognised in many parts of the world and are exhibited at shows and horse gymkhanas. In Australia the show authorities take an opposite view and will not give them a class.sification. I have before me correspondence between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> and the Australian Pony Stud Book Society. In a letter that the Society wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I regret to inform you that your application for the inclusion of Falabella ponies in a section of the Australian. Pony Stud Book was rejected as the Society does not intend opening any new sections in the near future. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That letter was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> on 29 April 1 977. He received a similar letter from the Royal Agricultural Society in Sydney when he made a similar request to have the horses classified and exhibited there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> has reached the point where he has written to Qantas Airways Ltd to ascertain the cost of disposing of the horses overseas because of what he considers- I believe that he has an argument- to be the unfair treatment of him by the pony club authorities and the Royal Agricultural Society in not allowing him to exhibit bis stock. </para>
          <para>Many Australians are greatly interested in these miniature ponies, which, as I have said, grow to a height of only 36 inches. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> has bred several himself since importing them in 1972. They are the world&#39;s smallest horses. People put them in the backs of their cars. They are very intelligent, they are very quiet and placid and they can be used to pull carts and give enjoyment to the children of today. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> has a case. I hope that my remarks in the Parliament will cause many Australians and Australian horse lovers to write to the responsible authorities and appeal to them to have these horses recognised at the eleventh hour before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mitchell</inline> makes a final decision to sell them overseas. </para>

            <para>- I want to use this occasion to raise a matter which is causing me and, I know, a number of my colleagues on this side of the House a great deal of concern at the present time, that is, the very narrow way in which the investment allowance provisions are being interpreted by the Taxation Office and the Department of the Treasury. I refer in particular to those provisions that apply to so-called onetonne commercial vehicles. I believe that many people in the community, particularly small businessmen, have been misled by a good deal of publicity about the investment allowance. They have suffered a very genuine injustice. It is not often that members of Parliament receive complaints which have real merit. I believe this complaint has merit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>People generally were told that they would be entitled to the investment allowance if they purchased a commercial vehicle with a load capacity of one tonne or more or a vehicle that could carry 9 passengers. So many people went to reputable dealers and purchased vehicles which were held out to be of a capacity of one tonne or more. Claims that the vehicles were of this weight were supported by advertising in newspapers, by pamphlets, booklets and so on. There were told that the vehicles had a capacity of one tonne. </para>
          <para>Now they find when they lodge their income tax returns that they do not qualify for the investment allowance. This matter is causing hardship to many small businessmen. The main reason for their claims being refused is the very narrow and I believe artificial interpretation being applied by the Commissioner of Taxation. He is saying that in fact passengers who are carried in the vehicle are not part of the load; that the petrol and tools carried by the vehicle are not part of the load; and the tray itself on the back of the vehicle is not part of the load. I believe that this test is too restrictive. It means that many vehicles which are known publicly and generally to be one tonne vehicles do not come within that classification. </para>

            <para>-In the few minutes available to me I should like to make some reference to the plight of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and in particular to the interim report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on industrial support for defence needs and allied matters which was presented today. As a preface to my remarks I remind the House that this is the industry that has been sentenced to death by this Government. I want to bring to the attention of the House some of the human heartbreak and difficulty that has been experienced by families of employees who were previously employed at the Newcastle State Dockyard. I should like to mention 2 instances. The first concerns a family man who has to travel to Sydney each week where he pays $40 a week rent. The family is in desperate difficulty because this man who is well qualified has had to take a much lower paid job. The other example concerns a husband who has left his family because he is simply unable to support his family in the unemployment benefit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should like to commend the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the justice of its report. I should like to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a few paragraphs from the report. Paragraph 7.86, in part states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It considers therefore that steps should be taken urgently to ensure the retention of large shipbuilding facilities in Australia which in the normal course would appear to be almost certain to cease operating in the near future. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>This is the only fair and balanced description of the problems of the shipbuilding industry that I have seen. Paragraph 7.87 of the report, in part, states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Committee-  is of the opinion that poor productivity and high costs in the past have stemmed primarily from inadequate work load, outdated plant and bad industrial relations. An important contributory factor has been the inability of the industry to offer ship buyers terms of payment as attractive as those on offer from overseas. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a very correct description of what brought about the problems of the shipbuilding industry, leaving out the politics of the matter. I urge the Government seriously to consider and hopefully to accept the recommendations of the Committee which are:  the industry to be rationalised; the existing ship construction facilities at Whyalla and Newcastle be retained; there be an injection of capital at both yards on a shared basis, sharing being between the Commonwealth and NSW governments in the case of Newcastle, and between the Commonwealth and the SA governments and BHP in the case of Whyalla, the amount of capital to be that needed to bring the physical capability of each of the yards to a standard matching that of overseas shipyards of similar capacity; there be workload on a continuing basis for the rationalised industry resulting from a &#39;build in Australia &#39; policy for Australian ships; </para>
          <para class="block">The final section of the paragraph states:   . . subject to a suitable manning productivity understanding with the maritime unions, and Australian flag policy for a proportion of overseas trade; </para>
          <para class="block">In general I believe that the recommendations of the Committee are practical. I believe they would be acceptable to the people involved in the industry. I believe that they would ensure that we as an island and as a maritime nation would retain a shipbuilding capacity. If the cost of updating the plant is to be shared between governments and the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and there is rationalisation- </para>

A great deal of suffering is occurring in the Newcastle and Hunter regions as a result of the IAC report and the Government&#39;s apparent acceptance of the report. On behalf of those people who are suffering I ask the Government, if it is not going to act on the shipbuilding industry in the near future, at least to implement the recommendations of the IAC in respect of providing special facilties for people in hardship and special facilities for the relocation of the people who are now unemployed as a result of the Government&#39;s decision on this matter. </para>

            <para>- I want to associate myself first of all with the matter that was raised by the honourable member for Braddon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> in respect of the investment allowance. This being the last night of the session, the last opportunity we might have to influence, to some extent, Treasury decisions on budgetary matters, I should like to raise one other matter, and that is the future of the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty which, as a result of the last Budget, was decreased from $78 per tonne to $60 per tonne as from the beginning of this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the House recently debated the phosphate fertiliser bounty legislation I thought it was appropriate that I should draw some comparison. The phosphate fertiliser bounty was marginally increased. The Government I believe quite rightly recognised the necessity for the increased bounty to be given to people on the land to whom the use of fertilisers is absolutely essential. Even within the debate on that legislation I can recall the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> saying that this is only part of a return to the rural industry which suffers heavily in the hands of tariffs. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> talk about the death knell of the shipbuilding industry. Let me give the House some costs in relation to this industry. The Australian nation subsidises the shipbuilding industry to the extent of $ 1 9,000 per man per year. The nation subsidises waterside workers to the extent of $13,000 per man per year. The manufacturing industry costs the nation $5,000 per man per year. </para>

              <para>- The very good honourable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McVeigh).</inline> The rural industry is already suffering, on the estimate of the honourable member for Wakefield to the extent of $2 billion a year. Many people in provincial and capital cities believe that rural industry is heavily subsidised. I refute this claim because most rural industries are self-sufficient. Certainly the Australian Wool Corporation works off loan funds, which are not a subsidy. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The phosphate bounty itself is a subsidy. I believe that a case can and should be made for nitrogen to be subsidised. </para>
          <para>I should now like to refer to the Industries Assistance Commission report produced some 2 years ago which suggested a decreasing factor of bounty. In that period we have seen a great increase in costs which the rural industry cannot pass on as far as export markets are concerned. We have seen prices for rural products come down to a point where they are almost meeting the cost factor going up. Wheat, for instance, has dropped from $110 to $90 a tonne, sorghum from $80 to $64 a tonne, and export sugar from $300 a tonne to an average of $235 a tonne. If there were a need initially for this type of subsidy on phosphate and nitrogen, it is even greater today. I believe that the Industries Assistance Commission report, being 2 years out of date, is history and we should not act on it. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Darling Downs nitrogen is absolutely necessary to production in some of the main grain and other agricultural crops in Australia as well as the sugar industry, dairying and the fresh fruit industry. All these industries use a yearly application of nitrogen. It has been argued that because wheat or the grain crops and sugar prospered temporarily a reduction in the bounty would more or less affect them only. This is not the case. There are other users throught rural Australia. It is necessary that they receive the bounty in order to keep costs down to the consumer. There are other users who are not faring as well as the wheat growers and sugar growers. </para>
          <para>As I have mentioned, that matter is only relative in any case because the IAC report is some 2 years old. I suggest to the Government that in forming its Budget it recognises the fact that the nitrogen bounty should be retained at the current rate. I fear that any reduction will never be recaptured. If the bounty is wiped out it could mean quite a number of bankruptcies in some rural industries. The alternative will still be a higher price to the consumer as far as the cost of the article is concerned. As rural industries are faced with heavy costs, I suggest to the Government that it look carefully at this matter and retain the bounty at the present figure of $60 per tonne. </para>

            <para>- I wish to rebut totally the speech made a few minutes ago by the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris).</inline> He referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Industrial Support for Defence Needs and Allied Matters. The honourable member selectively quoted parts of that report concerning shipbuilding in Australia. He failed to say that what he was talking about was referred to in the report in a defence context. He did not refer to a comment by me in the report, namely, that one of the main problems in the shipbuilding industry in Australia in times gone past was that the defence and commercial interests did not get together. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe there was an opportunity in the past for the commercial interests and the Navy to get together to design a ship using Australian innovation. A ship such as the Harrier Carrier could have been developed and constructed. It could have been based on the roll-on roll-off type of vessel. I think it is a tragedy that that did not occur. But so be it. The other point the honourable member for Shortland did not mention was the potential for the smaller and medium sized shipyards in Australia to grow. There are efficient shipbuilding yards in Australia building small and medium sized ships. I believe there is a chance for them to make their contribution by increasing productivity and finding their own mark. I think we will see patrol boats, heavy uplift ships and other ships built in these yards. I am confident of that. </para>
          <para>The final matter to which I refer tonight is a sad occasion for Australia and for Canberra and that is the passing in the Hague, Netherlands, earlier this week of the Dutch Ambassador to Australia, Baron van Aerssen. He left Australia a few weeks ago stricken with cancer and passed away earlier this week. I express to the Government of the Netherlands and to his wife my sadness on this occasion. Baron van Aerssen came to Australia as a boy when his father opened the first Dutch mission here. It was a joy to him to return many years later as Ambassador. He enjoyed Australia. He appreciated and spoke of the contribution which members of the Dutch community made in this country. I think that in part he was almost as much an Australian as he was a Dutchman. He had a charming wife. Both of them added to the enjoyment of and contributed to the diplomatic scene and life in Canberra. </para>

            <para>- I will not detain the House for too long. Tonight we learnt that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> announced that the Government has approved the introduction of a licenced citizen band radio service in Australia. I am sure that most honourable members will agree with me when I say that it is probably not before time. There is a great deal of merit in a citizen band radio service. However, I do not think the Government&#39;s problems have ceased with the legalisation of citizen band radio. During the last two to three months I have made it my business to look at the problem of CB radio from both sides, namely, from the side of policing the service and from the side of the operators. Quite frankly, some of the implications of CB radio are very frightening. I shall give a couple of examples. In my home city of Brisbane, we have learnt that CB radio has been used by drug rings, by SP bookmakers and in a number of robberies which have been uncovered by both State and Commonwealth police. We have seen it interfering with television services. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The citizens of Toowoomba had a problem with it because one section of the police radio in Toowoomba was virtually taken off the air one night by the operators of CB radio. The Australian legalisation will enable the 27 megahertz band to be used for 5 years and then it will be transferred to the ultra high frequency band. The fact that the 27 megahertz problem has not been overcome by the decision of the Government is the area which is of concern to me. Obviously, we can register CB radio sets but that does not mean that we will stop interference, that we will stop the pirate use of CB radio sets. At the moment the section which is attached to the Post and Telecommunications Department is desperately understaffed. I do not think it would be fair if I told the House the number of members of that staff who are trying to control CB radio operations in Brisbane. Quite frankly, the situation is frightening. They have had a devil of a job over the last few months in trying to keep the whole matter under control. </para>
          <para>Only last week one of the licensed inspectors of the Department was involved in an altercation with an operator of CB radio when the inspector went out to check on a matter. I understand that litigation is following. Inspectors have had problems. They have had problems with truck operators who have been using the radios illegally to warn people of weighing station checks and of police locations. They have had problems with people using CB radio for illegal advertising. They have had problems with people using incredible amounts of power to get the signal from one side of Australia to the other. In Brisbane one set which was seized was attached to a power plant which generated enough power to operate a small commercial radio station. That is an amazing situation. Obviously the appeal must go out to the Minister to check the situation in relation to his inspectors as fast as he possibly can. With the number of inspectors he has at the moment, I cannot see that he will overcome the problems which CB radio has been causing and will continue to cause until such time as CB radio is transferred to the UHF frequency. </para>

            <para>- I wish briefly to support the honourable member for Braddon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groome)</inline> in his complaints about the misleading effect the investment allowance rules is having on many small businessmen. The way in which the Taxation Office applies the formula is totally different from the formula applied by any State government in establishing what is a one ton vehicle. When is a one ton truck not a one ton truck? For an answer we go and ask the Taxation Commissioner. The formula is absurd in the sense that the Taxation Office seems to have gone to a position which is as far removed as possible from the registration requirements for one ton trucks in all States. The word in the legislation is &#39;load&#39;, not &#39;payload&#39;. If the legislatorsthat is, us- had wanted the word to be &#39;payload&#39; they would have said payload. Many of the people who complain to me wonder, in fact, whether the Taxation Office is implementing the legislation in such a way as to take the burden of the decision making away from the legislators and give it to the Taxation Commissioner himself. I regret that the Commissioner can take the view that 2 people are not part of a load for the purposes of this section but that 9 people are a load in terms of a full load in a passenger vehicle. That is a most extraordinary piece of interpretative gymnastics. I join with the honourable member for Braddon in hoping that the Government either instructs the Taxation Commissioner or changes the law appropriately. </para>

            <para>- Earlier this evening during the adjournment debate the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> raised the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> Suan Kin. My information is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> Suan Kin applied to the Australian High Commission in Singapore early in March 1977 for a visa to enable him to visit Australia as a tourist. It was considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> was not a bona fide tourist and his application for a visa was refused. I should like to bring to the attention of the honourable member what happens when a visa is applied for and refused. A stamp is put in the passport which states &#39;Visa applied for&#39;. It is not a visa, it simply alerts any other Australian office to the fact that a visa has been applied for but not granted. The &#39;Visa applied for&#39; stamp was put in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan&#39;s</inline> passport to show that he had applied for a visa but in fact it had not been granted. On 20 March 1977 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> arrived at Sydney International Airport travelling without a valid visa for Australia. Quite properly, he was refused entry and his departure from Australia was arranged on the same day by the airline which had carried him here. There is no question, on the facts that have been brought to me in relation to this matter, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tan</inline> was properly treated in respect of his attempt to enter Australia. I believe that the facts I have outlined should banish any worries which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith may have in relation to this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Secondly, the honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martin)</inline> brought up the question of exploitation of prohibited immigrants and he mentioned a particular solicitor in Sydney. I should like to draw to his attention and to the attention of the House a Press statement I issued on 16 May 1977 headed &#39;Exploitation of Prohibited Immigrants&#39;. I shall quote very briefly from that Press statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At least one body which receives substantial contributions from its &#39;clients &#39; continually makes representations on behalf of visitors, some of who have become prohibited immigrants by overstaying their authorised period of entry. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>These cases receive exactly the same consideration in the Department as those in which the people concerned approach the Department directly. The body concerned has absolutely no influence and in some cases appears to have done nothing more for the fees it charges than raise false hopes amongst people who did not meet the criteria for migrant entry or change of status. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Allegations are made from time to time about the fees charged by certain solicitors in various cities and towns throughout Australia. I made a point in the Press statement and I wish to make it again. I quote again from the Press statement: </para>

            <para>I note that it has been claimed that certain solicitors have charged large amounts for services related to immigration. People who believe this to be the case should provide the facts to the Law Society in their State of residence. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable member for Banks raised the matter and named a particular solicitor. If people have complaints about solicitors or organisations which they believe are charging unfairly for services which, I reiterate, are available free of charge to people who come to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, then in the case of solicitors they should make the facts available to the Law Society in the State of residence and in the case of any organisation they should make the facts known to me. </para>

            <para>The question whether, notwithstanding the abolition of the court to which he was appointed, a federal Judge is entitled under the Constitution to continue to hold his commission for life, subject only to the provision for removal from office contained in the Constitution, involves a legal opinion on the interpretation of the Constitution. I am not aware of any authority on this point. The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Act (No. 3) 1976 and the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1 976 provide for the abolition of the Australian Industrial Court and the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, respectively, on dates to be fixed by proclamation. Each of those Acts provides, however, that such a proclamation may not be made whilst any Judge of the court concerned continues to hold office. </para>
            <para>The Acts establishing the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory provide, in effect, that a presidential member or a Judge, as the case may be, may not be removed from office before he reaches retiring age (or during his lifetime in the case of those Territory Judges holding appointments for life) except by the Governor-General on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session praying for his removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. This tenure of office having been established by Act of the Parliament, it would appear to be competent for the Parliament to enact legislation making other provision for the removal from office of a presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or a Judge of the Territory Supreme Court, as the case may be, if the Commission or the Courconcerned were abolished. were circulated: </para>

            <para>For many years victims of many different circumstances have been called refugees. These have included displaced and stateless persons, those seeking political asylum, defectors, members of oppressed minorities and victims of natural disasters. </para>

          <para>In 1951 the United Nations adopted a Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This included a definition of a refugee as &#39;any person who, owing to well-founded fear, of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political group, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. </para>

            <para>In television, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has discontinued the public affairs program &#39; State of the Nation &#39;, a weekly program of 40 minutes duration which had been resumed after a previous discontinuation. It has also discontinued &#39;Today at One&#39;, a 30-minute weekday program in South Australia. Expenditure on &#39;This Day Tonight&#39; and Four Corners&#39; has been reduced. The coverage of minor sports has been curtailed, while several projected television drama productions have been postponed. </para>
            <para>In radio, separate evening programs for the various stations of ABC Radio 1 have been discontinued; these are now uniform for all capital cities. In the evening, Radio 3 now transmits the programs of Radio 2. Regional sporting services have been reduced. Recess periods over the Christmas period have been extended. The number of contract correspondents overseas and the allocation of funds for overseas communication circuits have been reduced. Radio dramas have been selected on the basis of lower cost. A projected America tour of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra has been abandoned. The continuing reduction in staff has been confined to &#39;natural wastage&#39;, without further termination of services by the Commission. </para>

              <para>Food and water supplied to international airlines leaving on flights from Australia is provided by the 3 Australian airlines. The kitchens, in Melbourne, used in the preparation of the food are subject to periodic inspections by my Department as to the standard of hygiene and food handling. Kitchens in Sydney, except those of Qantas which are outside the airport boundaries and therefore outside the jurisdiction of my Department, are subject to less frequent inspections. However Qantas have a health inspector who monitors their flight kitchens. Food samples from the Sydney flight kitchen are regularly checked for bacterial content and Qantas have recently appointed a bacteriologist-food technologist. With the co-operation of the Depanment of Science, microbiological surveys are carried out on a weekly basis on selected food and water samples in Melbourne and Sydney. My Depanment is not in a position to exercise control over the standard of food and water provided for passengers on international nights on the journey into Australia. The standards of food and water provided on such flights are, of course, a matter of major concern to the airlines concerned but I am not able to say, at this time, what precise supervision is exercised by overseas authorities. </para>

              <para>I am advised that the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends a maximum premissible concentration in water for each of a large number of radioisotopes. The World Health Organisation recommends minimum standards for the quality of drinking water which are consistent with ICRP recommendations. Both sets of recommendations have been adopted in whole or in part by a number of countries, including Australia. The limits for radioactivity in drinking water for individual members of the public, based on the above recommendations, range from 3 microcuries per litre for tritium to 10-5 microcuries per litre for radium. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>There are no internationally accepted concentration limits for radioactivity in sea water or in waste discharged because resulting human exposure to radiation depends markedly on circumstances. The ICRP in 1965 recommended that where low activity wastes are discharged to the environment, the pathways by which the released radioactive materials may cause radiation exposure to the public be identified and the levels of radioactive content (not the concentrations as such) released be limited to ensure that individual exposures do not exceed recommended limits. </para>

The average amount of radioactivity contained in this water is six to seven millicurie, of hard beta-emitters, 0.1 millicuries of aplha-emitters and three curies of tritium. As this is diluted by the nine million litres of waste water mentioned above, the levels of radioactivity involved are substantially less than the internationally accepted levels of maximum permissible concentration. </para>

It should be noted that in international trade negotiations binding of rates is considered to be a meaningful concession in so far as it provides a measure of stability in protective levels. Whilst it is not possible to quantify benefits accruing from such concessions it is considered that Australia&#39;s contribution in the Tropical Products Negotiations was a significant one, based on items in which developing countries had expressed interest. </para>

            <para>Persons in many different situations have been called refugees. These have included displaced and stateless persons, those seeking political asylum, defectors, members of oppressed minorities and victims of natural disasters. </para>
            <para>In 1951 the United Nations adopted a Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This included a definition of a refugee as &#39;any person who, owing to well-founded fear, of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political group, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it&#39;. </para>

It should also be noted that other Chilean arrivals include some refugees who have been classified for statistical purposes under normal migration criteria. </para>

        <para>The Government has also adopted special measures involving the approval, under relaxed criteria, of Lebanese migrants nominated by close relaves in Australia. It is estimated that some 10 000 have arrived under this program since December 1975. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: ( 1 ). ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) The Consumer Price Index is comised of a large number of individual items classified into sub-groups of comparable items. Given the construction of the index it is possible, therefore, for the Statistician to publish movements in prices of particular groupings of items. Quarterly price movements are in fact published for &#39;All Groups, excluding hospital and medical services&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However changes in major Commonwealth taxes and charges can affect many sub-groups in the Index. The Statistician does not publish an estimate of such effects. </para>
          <para>In Statement No. 2 attached to the 1976-77 Budget Speech and in my Press release No. 20 of 22 February 1977 estimates were provided of movements in the index, excluding the effects both of changes in health insurance arrangements and changes in major Commonwealth taxes and charges, for half-yearly periods since the end of 1 973. </para>

Gross non-farm product at factor cost has been used instead of national income since quanerly series are not published for the latter concept and since the profit share is less volatile when defined in terms of the non-farm aggregates.

              <para>) Statistics are not maintained by place of residence for persons granted Australian citizenship. From January 1949 (when Australian citizenship was introduced) to 1954. conferment of Australian citizenship in the Melbourne metropolitan area took place as a general rule in the Melbourne Court of Petty Sessions. Some private conferment ceremonies were arranged in special cases- such as those involving physically handicapped persons. Prior to 1949 persons naturalised as British subjects were not required to attend conferment ceremonies, but had their certificates of naturalisation posted to them. The table below shows the numbers of persons granted citizenship in the Coburg Town Hall since 1954 and the Broadmeadows and Brunswick Town Halls since 1962. Figures for the Broadmeadows and Brunswick Town Halls for the years 1954 to 1961 inclusive are not available. In recent years many residents of the municipalities mentioned have had Australian citizenship conferred at non public ceremonies conducted by delegated officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In a related question (Question 538). the honourable member asked how the &#39;profit share&#39; is defined and how the profit share has moved since 1965-66. I answer his present question in terms of the same concept of profit share as was used in that reply. </para>
            <para>As can be observed in the data provided in reply to Question 538. the profit share usually fluctuates with the level of economic activity. My answer to Question 538 provides data to work out what is an historically normal share of profits. If, for example, the &#39;normal&#39; share of profits is taken to be the average observed over the course of the business cycle, then on the basis of experience over the period 1959-60 to 1 972-73, which covers several complete cycles, then the&#39;normal &#39; profit share is about17j per cent. </para>
            <para>During the recession presided over by the former Labor Government the share of profits slumped well below the average recorded between 1959-60 and 1972-73: in the December quarter of 1 975. for example, it was 1 2.8 per cent. There has been a very encouraging, although partial recovery in the profit share under the economic policies of the present Government. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>From 1 January 1970 to 30 June 1973 pensions, benefits and similar allowances provided by the Government were not subject to income tax. Certain payments by way of pension, benefits or allowances became taxable as from 1 July 1973. These included age, service, invalid and widows&#39; pensions received by a person of pensionable age. A wife&#39;s pension received by the wife of a recipient of one of those taxable pensions was also made taxable. War and war widows&#39; pensions remained exempt from tax. </para>
            <para>For the 1973-74 income year people of age pension were entitled to a rebate of tax otherwise payable and the age allowance of prior years was discontinued. The maximum age rebate was $156 reducing by 25c for each $1 of taxable income over $3,224 (phasing out to nil at taxable income of $3,848). An effect of the age rebate was that an aged person whose taxable income in 1 973-74 was $ 1 ,92 1 or less was not required to pay tax. </para>
            <para>The age rebate was reduced to $130 for 1974-75. It operated to free from tax aged people with taxable incomes of $2,358 or less. Aged people with taxable incomes of between $2,358 and $3,224 were granted the full rebate of $130, which shaded out to nil at a taxable income of $3,744. The new personal tax system introduced in 1975-76 meant that no one with a taxable income of less than $2,5 19 was subject to tax. The age rebate (which had freed from tax incomes up to only $2,358 ) was discontinued. </para>
            <para>The provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to the taxation of pensions were further amended with effect from 1 July 1976. In the main, these changes brought into the tax field certain pensions paid to persons below age pension age. Consequently widows&#39; pensions, supporting mothers&#39; benefits and service pensions (other than those equivalent to invalid pensions) became taxable. At the same time unemployment and sickness benefits also became subject to tax. </para>
            <para>The following table sets out further details of the taxation position of the relevant payments as from 1 July 1973 and 1 July 1976. </para>

            <para>Australia is actively participating in ongoing international discussions concerning a new International Wheat Agreement to replace the existing Agreement which is due to expire on 30 June 1978. </para>
            <para>Since 1974, a great deal of preparatory work has been carried out on mechanisms which might form the basis of a new Wheat Agreement. Most of this work has been undertaken in the International Wheat Council in London but discussions are also proceeding in Geneva in the context of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Australia is participating in these discussions. </para>
            <para>There is widespread acceptance that the objectives of a new International Wheat Agreement should include the stabilisation of world wheat markets in order to help ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices and improved world food security. However, for a number of technical and other reasons, including differences of approach among some of the major participants, it has not yet been possible to progress to the stage of actual negotiations. </para>
            <para>The concept of reserve stocks to help stabilise the world supplies and prices and improve world food security has been discussed in some detail. Australia has pointed out that an arrangement providing for the accumulation and release of stocks would need to contain measures to safeguard commercial trade, if such an arrangement is to have reasonable prospects of success on a continuing basis. We are particularly conscious of the need to avoid undue risks that a world stockpile of grains might depress world market prices to unacceptably low levels, thereby prejudicing the Agreement itself and, importantly, the objective of helping to ensure continuing stability of supplies in the interests of the world food security objectives. </para>
            <para>Since February this year, the question of new international arrangements for wheat has been the subject of discussion on a number of occasions between Australian officials and senior representatives of the new United States administration and the Canadian Government. In March, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> H. McKay, Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, explored American and Canadian thinking on the subject during a visit to Washington and Ottawa. At a meeting in Ottawa on 2 1 April, the four major wheat exporters (U.S.A., Canada, Australia and Argentina) concluded that there appeared to be a large degree of agreement between importers and exporters on the need for the establishment of a new International Wheat Agreement. </para>
            <para>During a visit to Washington and Ottawa later that month I had useful discussions on wheat matters with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Bergland and other senior Administration officials and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Otto</inline> Lang the Minister in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board. I stressed that Australia favoured the early negotiation of a new IWA and that we would continue to play a constructive role in seeking to achieve a new arrangement in the interests of the world community. </para>
            <para>A second meeting of major wheat exporters was held in Washington on 27 May and a further meeting is expected to take place following the 80th Session of the International Wheat Council on 28-30 June. (2)On 10 May 1 977 the USDA estimated total U.S. wheat production for the year ending 30 June 1978 at55.8 million tonnes some 2.6 million tonnes below the previous crop. Production of winter wheat which is now being harvested was estimated at around 40.2 million tonnes, a decrease of 6 per cent over the previous year&#39;s crop. </para>
            <para>Plantings of spring wheat in the United States have recently been completed and are estimated at 6.2 million ha, or 14 per cent below last year. Plantings of barley, however, have increased by15 per cent to 4.3 million ha and barley production in 1977 could reach 9.8 million tonnes, 20 per cent up on 1976. </para>
            <para>The International Wheat Council has forecast wheat production in Canada at between 16 and 20 million tonnes which is considerably down on 1976 production of 23.5 million tonnes. Plantings of barley are expected to be 1 1 per cent above the 4.33 million ha crop in 1976 which produced around 13.0 million tonnes. </para>
            <para>The North American wheat crop in 1977 is, therefore, likely to be down substantially on 1976, but the outturn could still be large, given favourable weather conditions. The IWC considers that the world supply-demand situation for wheat in 1977-78 should be reasonably comfortable unless there is a crop failure in one of the major wheat producing regions. </para>
            <para>With production increases of barley expected in the United States, Canada and other major course grain producing countries, world barley production in 1977 should be near to the 1976 record of 715 million tonnes and the supply situation would appear to be adequate in 1977-78. </para>

This is because these benefits comprise two separate and independent parts; one is financed by the individual member&#39; s contributions and the other is financed by the Government. The benefit financed by the member&#39;s contributions depends on the contributions he elects, within specified limits, to pay during his membership of the scheme; the contributions so paid do not bear any particular relationship to the benefit financed by the Government. The maximum attainable level of contributor-financed pension is 20 per cent of final salary. The benefit financed by the Government is usually a pension that is related to the member&#39;s final salary, age at retirement and period of contributory service; the maximum attainable level of Government-financed pension is52&#189; per cent of final salary. </para>

I think it is important to note that where assistance is granted, most organisations such as sporting teams receive a 50 per cent travel subsidy from the Government, with the rest of the cost of travel being provided out of the organisation &#39;s own funds. </para>

            <para>Responsibility for plans for the protection of persons and property in the Lucas Heights area, and their co-ordination, rests with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The Commission has had, for many years, arrangements with N.S.W. authorities for the application of appropriate countermeasures for the protection of persons and property (including evacuation as a last resort) in the areas around the Research Establishment should they become necessary. The co-operating N.S.W. authorities are the Police Department, Board of Fire Commissioners, State Emergency Services and Health Commission. </para>
            <para>The emergency plans are reviewed, in the light of changing circumstances, at meetings of a Local Liaison Working Party which is composed of representatives of the N.S.W. authorities mentioned above ana officers of the Commission. </para>
            <para>The existing arrangements with the NS.W. authorities are being incorporated into a single document entitled &#34;A Plan to Cope with Accidents at the Research Establishment&#34;. This document is being prepared by the Commission in consultation with the authorities mentioned above. </para>

The fares from European points are not in every case the same as the reciprocal tares from Australian points. Some are higher and some are lower.

              <para>and (4) No. Reduced fares are in fact available to other countries in Europe, including Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries. These special reduced fares are based on the excursion fare agreed with the European countries with which Australia nas concluded air services agreements. Normally Australia/Europe fares are established after consideration of recommendations by IATA, but for some years now promotional fares on this route have not been covered by an LATA agreement. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In this situation it is only feasible to reach agreement on excursion fares with those European countries whose airlines operate scheduled services to Australia. Nevertheless, these special excursion fares are combinable with normal fares in Europe, so that a special reduced fare is available between Australia and any other point in Europe, including of course Copenhagen, Stockholm and Geneva. </para>
          <para>For economic reasons the price of the special reduced fares to Switzerland and Scandinavia must reflect the situation that neither area is linked on direct services with Australia. Accordingly, because the passenger has to travel to Copenhagen, Stockholm or Geneva on a combination of services involving a change of aircraft in another country, the cost to the airlines servicing Australia of providing travel to either country is greater than the cost of providing carriage to those European countries that are directly linked on air services with Australia. </para>

For this purpose the rebatable expenditure would include any medical expenses or funeral expenses (up to $ 100 per dependant) paid in respect of a dependent relative. As a general rule, nursing home fees are accepted as medical expenses only where the relative is an inmate of an approved nursing home and is entitled to receive intensive care benefits for the care provided. A dependant allowance would be available if the relative is a parent, parent-in-law or invalid relative, as defined, of the taxpayer and received during the year separate net income of less than $1,978, if a parent or parentinlaw, or $ 1,074, if an invalid relative. </para>

              <para>It is not possible to obtain the exact cost of paying single supporting fathers the same benefits as are at present paid to single supporting mothers because of lack of accurate data relating to the income distribution of such families. However, a costing based on preliminary data from the survey of families conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May 1975 indicates that the full year cost of such a benefit would be to the order of $8. 10m. For the purposes of this costing it was assumed that there would be no change in the workforce participation of the supporting fathers as a result of the introduction of the benefit and also that all those eligible for the benefit would receive it. </para>

            <para>Changes in wage rates directly affect the level of the Commonwealth&#39;s wages and salaries bill. Indirectly, through their effects on the general level of costs and prices, they also affect the Commonwealth&#39;s outlays on purchases of goods and services, indexed social security benefits and grants and advances to other sectors, including the States. Changes in wage rates also affect the revenue side of the Budget. The level of wages and salaries directly affects PA YE income tax receipts and price movements resulting from wage variations affect sales tax receipts. </para>
            <para>In all, it is estimated that a change in the general wage rate has a not dissimilar effect on total outlays and total receipts, so that the net change in the deficit is not large. But the various effects do not all occur at the same time; in the short run the effects on receipts would generally exceed the effects on outlays. </para>
            <para>The decisions of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to pass on less than the full percentage Consumer Price Index increase in some of its recent national wage judgments have not, therefore, greatly altered the ongoing Commonwealth Budget outcome from what it would nave been had the Commission passed on the full Consumer Price Index increase in all its decisions. </para>

            <para>In cases of alleged invasions of privacy, from whatever source, Australian citizens can have recourse to the law currently applicable. However, the matter of privacy, as the honourable member will be aware, has been referred as a specific reference by the Attorney-General to the Australian Law Reform Commission under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kirby.  His  report will be tabled in the Parliament and no doubt subjected to considerable public discussion and debate.

The allowance has effect from I July 1976, but companies will not benefit by it directly until their tax assessments issue in 1977-78. By contrast, wage and salary earners have been getting the benefit of tax indexation (on the basis of a 13 per cent factor) since 1 July 1976 and will further benefit when the second round of indexation (on the basis of a 10.9 per cent factor) begins for them on 1 July 1977. </para>

              <para>1 ) Commonwealth Police do not estimate that more than one Australian child is being abducted overseas every fortnight. However, several requests are received each fortnight from the Department of Foreign Affairs seeking the assistance of this Force in the taking of preventive action on behalf of a parent granted custody of a child who expresses a fear that the other partner to the marriage may attempt to remove a child from Australia without consent. In appropriate cases steps are taken to prevent such removal. The Department of Foreign Affairs would consider any request for repatriation of an Australian child under the rules which are laid down for repatriation of Australian citizens. The conditions of repatriation of Australian citizens require that the funds expended be repaid by the individual. The Department has in fact repatriated some abducted children under those provisions. </para>

              <para>The provisions most likely to be breached are sections 62, Migration Act and 10 Passports Act. In some cases section 67 (b) of the Crimes Act may have been breached. The Department of Foreign Affairs has undertaken a review of the Passports Act and the review indicates that within the ambit of the present responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs there is little that can be done by it alone to prevent child abduction. An approach has therefore been made to set up an interdepartmental committee to see whether, in conjunction with other departments, further steps might be taken to help prevent child abduction. </para>

          <para>A new edition of the directory of Ethnic Organisations in Australia is currently in the process of being published by the Department of Social Security and this will soon be distributed free of charge to persons and organisations concerned with the well being of migrants. The current edition of the Directory consists of separate publications for each State and the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
          <para>In view of the developing role of State Governments in publishing similar directories, the second edition will be a modified format and its primary purpose will be simply to provide a convenient, practical check list of organisations for all States and Territories in the one publication. The directory will also contain other information important to ethnic groups about matters which are primarily a Commonwealth responsibility. An important addition will be a comprehensive listing of multi-lingual material published by Commonwealth and State Government Departments. </para>

            <para>An area of land in the vicinity of Galston has been included in one of the four Zones currently being investigated as a possible location for a second major airport in the Sydney region. The basis of this inclusion is that the Commonwealth/State Committee conducting the investigation could find insufficient technical grounds presently available for the exclusion of this area as compared with other areas in the four Zones. It is stressed that the current study is very comprehensive and will look at the desirability of developing new airport facilities in comparison with the desirability of developing existing facilities taking into account the full range of social, environmental, technical and economic factors. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: ( 1-8 ) The position of the company referred to, in relation to Section 26 of the <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Takeovers Act,</inline> involves complex questions of fact and law which are receiving careful study. (9-11) It is recognised that Section 26 of the <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Takeovers Act</inline> can have the effect of requiring companies that are owned and controlled predominantly by Australian interests to submit notifications under that Section. However, it is also recognised that the Act must cover circumstances where companies with only a small proportion of shares held by overseas interests are effectively foreign controlled enterprises. The Foreign Investment Review Board has a continuing responsibility for keeping the Act under review. (12-13) The Foreign Investment Review Board has this matter under study. </para>

          <para>I remind the honourable gentleman that the network of intermediaries and con-men that was involved in his Government&#39;s clandestine attempts to borrow massive amounts of money from overseas was built up, not only because of the desire of his Government to deceive the Australian public, but also because the administrative arrangements which were then in force were not being observed by Ministers. I particularly draw his attention to that part of the guidelines that makes it explicit that any decision to proceed with overseas borrowings by the present Government is contingent on legislative authority being available and authority from the Australian Loan Council being obtained beforehand.

No doubt the Leader of the Government in the Senate at that time would have given him full details. If the honourable gentleman wishes to take this as being a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Licardy</inline> to me and, in the context of action taken under the Legal Practitioners Act, to infer that some impropriety was involved, then I invite him to do so. I remind him, however, that information obtained from documentation in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> possession, and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Licardy</inline> had access, led him to dismiss a Minister of his Government who had not only held responsibility for the then portfolio of Minerals and Energy but who had also acted as Prime Minister in the honourable gentleman&#39;s absence. I also remind him that his Government negotiated on an official basis with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and subsequently employed him to arrange an overseas borrowing of US$4 billion. Presumably the honourable gentleman had confidence, not only in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> but also in those individuals retained by him, including legal advisers, in pursuance of the then Government&#39;s overseas borrowing policies. Finally I mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> sworn statement presented to the Senate on 4 November 1 975 gave a detailed account of the honourable gentleman &#39;s extensive personal involvement in negotiations being carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> including, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> arrangements for payment of commission by avoidance of legal requirements.
