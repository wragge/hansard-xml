            <para>- I ask the Minister for Health a question concerning his statement last night that on the advice of the Federal Government the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists will tomorrow cease its field work in Queensland under the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program on the ground that some employees of the field teams are unacceptable to Queensland authorities. I ask the Minister Who were the Queensland authorities? On what grounds did they find the employees unacceptable? When were their views conveyed to the Federal Government? At what level was the Federal decision made? Is it a fact, as reported in the Press, that it was the Premier of Queensland himself who requested the Minister and the Prime Minister to stop the program because two Aboriginal liaison officers with the field teams had encouraged Aboriginals to enrol for the State election? If so, why could not the program continue uninterrupted since the rolls for the State election closed several days ago? </para>

              <para>- The ongoing aspects of the program will continue in Queensland as they are continuing elsewhere. Mass treatment for trachoma is being arranged for some 9,000 persons in the Pilbara and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Surgery is continuing in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and in the Northern Territory. For the information of honourable members, over 60,000 people have been screened. The Queensland screening program has been temporarily deferred because of complaints from Queensland authorities. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Who are the authorities? I have had a number of complaints, telegrams and telephone calls from individuals and also from the Premier and Premier's Office and also some concern expressed through his office and indirectly to me from the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement and Fisheries. I have also been informed that some Queensland Aboriginal communities have objected to some of the people engaged on the program. It has been a matter of great concern to the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmogists, to the Commonwealth Government and to me as the Minister because the only real role that we have in the program is that we provide funds under health program grants to the Royal College and certainly the College does not wish to become embroiled in any political controversy. Since there were alleged political overtones associated with the screening program, the College decided, after discussion with me to defer any further screening for at least one month unless other more satisfactory arrangements could be made. </para>
          <para>The  President  of the College went to north Queensland and to the Torres Strait Islands and discussed the matter with Professor Hollows, who was very reluctant to dismiss the people concerned; in fact, he refused to do so. The College felt that it had little alternative at present but to defer that aspect of the program. I am continuing my discussions with the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists in the hope that a more satisfactory alternative solution can be found to ensure that the screening program can go ahead as planned. In the meantine all other aspects of the program are going ahead. </para>

            <para>- I welcome very much the question posed by the honourable gentleman. Recent history shows that non-farm product increased by only 0.3 per cent in 1975, the last year of office of the Labor Government. In 1976, the first year of office of the present Government, the average rate of growth was 4.2 per cent. On present estimates non-farm product grew by 3.5 per cent in 1976-77. In the June quarter of this year nonfarm product was 4.9 per cent higher than in the December quarter of 1 975. As the Budget Papers indicate, non-farm product is expected to increase in real terms by 2 per cent in 1977-78 as a whole, which represents an increase of more than 4 per cent over the course of the year. The increase in non-farm product in 1978, as the Prime Minister emphasised yesterday, is expected to be some 5 per cent. Moderate growth of this order is certainly consistent with sustainable recovery, and the figures clearly indicate the very encouraging signs that 1978 will be the best year of economic performance out of the past five years. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations by reminding him and the House that among the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which take great care to ensure that members of unions are able to participate effectively in the affairs of their unions are three sections: Section 133, which gives to all financial members of the union the right to vote; section 152, which requires that union secretaries keep a correct account of union ticket butts; and section 170 A, which requires union secretaries to supply to the Commonwealth Electoral Office full particulars of all butts which they have in their possession. Having regard to those conditions or requirements of the Act, I refer to a very serious example of union balloting malpractice which is occurring right now in relation to the Australian Workers Union. At Mt Isa in Queensland more than 1,000 financial members of the union have been refused the right to vote. Does the Minister know that when complaints were made to the electoral officer the electoral officer told the members that he cannot get from the union secretary concerned a list of the members who are entitled to vote and that the union secretary is in breach of the Act and nothing is being done about it? Does the Minister know that the union secretary, on the other hand, when complaints are levelled against him accuses the electoral officer or not sending out the ballot papers? I want to know from the honourable gentleman now what action he proposes to take to ensure that all members of the Australian Workers Union who want to vote for or against the present office holders shall be given the right to vote, providing they are financial. </para>

            <para>-The ballot for the Australian Workers Union election in the State of Queensland is currently proceeding, as the honourable gentleman has said, and I am informed that it will close in early December. I am further informed that as at 3 1 July of this year the audited membership of the northern district of the AWU, which is the district of the union that is concerning the honourable member, was 10,313 members. I have made inquiries of the electoral officer responsible for the ballot in Queensland and those inquiries indicate that at this stage 6,419 ballot papers have been posted to members. I am advised that on previous experience this discrepancy is not an unusual proportion. But inquiries have revealed that there were no butts of membership tickets at the State AWU office for collection by the electoral office as at 7 November. However, it is understood that an additional number of butts are being posted from the Townsville office of the union and should reach Brisbane today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have confirmed that the electoral officer, in accordance with section 1 70a of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act mentioned by the honourable member, has required that all butts be made available to him. The electoral office in fact has received no complaints at this stage from AWU members about the non-receipt of ballot papers. But any financial member of the AWU who feels that he is entitled to receive a ballot paper should immediately contact the electoral office in Brisbane. There is still time for him to do that and for his membership to be checked and papers issued before the closing of the ballot. If people feel that they have an entitlement to vote and have not yet received the opportunity to do so I advise them to contact the Brisbane electoral office immediately. </para>

            <para>- I recall very well the High Court proceedings which made invalid and null the Petroleum and Minerals Authority created under the Whitlam Labor Government. That organisation was intruding into mineral activities which could well have been carried out by private enterprise or under State authorities. I am pleased to be able to say that in the case of the Wambo Mining Corporation $3m was repaid to the Commonwealth on 29 June 1977. In relation to Mareeba Mining N.L., its loan will be repaid by 1980. In the case of the Cooper Basin natural gas project which also has interests in petroleum exploration licence areas in South Australia, over a period of discussion with the South Australian Government we have been able to make arrangements to divest the Commonwealth's interest in this. We have been holding an 18 per cent interest in it. Whilst these negotiations have been somewhat protracted we have now reached a satisfactory conclusion. I hope to have the agreement signed by South Australia today and to be in a position later today to put out a statement giving the details. </para>

He has identified the complaint about employees of the field teams under the trachoma survey in Queensland as having come from the Premier, the Premier's Department and the State Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. I ask: Was their complaint, as reported, that the field workers had encouraged Aboriginals to enrol for the State election? If not, what was the complaint? I also ask the Minister whether he has noted the remarks of Professor Hollows, quoted in today's <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> to the effect that 'they are the best two field workers we have ever had'; that they 'have been too busy working their arses off to help save sight to have time to get into politics' and 'that the team could not function efficiently without the two men'.

            <para>- I have not received any specific complaints. The complaint to which the honourable gentleman referred was seen by me for the first tune in the Press this morning. The broad complaint that has come to my notice is that the people involved with the program are unacceptable to Queensland authorities because they are political activists and are unacceptable when an election campaign is being conducted. The Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists does not wish to become embroiled in a political situation. The complaint is a general one and I have not had the opportunity of discussing the matter with Professor Hollows. I would like to discuss it with him ultimately. He has been out of contact because he has been operating on Thursday Island. I have a very high regard for the work that he has done. I do not want to detract in any way from his work or the work of the Royal College. If the Leader of the Opposition is agreeable I shall seek to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the Press statement that was cleared by the Royal College and me. </para>

			<para>The Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ralph</inline> Hunt, has advised the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists that some employees of the field teams of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program ( at present working in Queensland ) are unacceptable to Queensland authorities. </para>
			<para>Because of the importance of this medical program obtaining complete co-operation from both Commonwealth and State Governments the College has accepted the advice of the Federal Government that the screening and diagnosis program be deferred. Accordingly, the field team workers are to cease work from Wednesday, 9 November. </para>
			<para>The field Director, Professor Fred Hollows, is to discuss the timing of resumption of the Program with the Executive Committee of the College. </para>
			<para>Last week the College <inline font-weight="bold">President, Dr James</inline> Rogers of Hobart, went to Thursday Island to explore alternatives to deferring the Program with Professor Hollows. However, Professor Hollows considered that the field teams could not function efficiently with other than the present arrangements. </para>
			<para>The trachoma program is conducted by the Royal Australian College or Ophthalmologists and is funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government has responsibility for obtaining the co-operation of the State authorities. </para>
			<para>So far, there have been excellent results from the Program and the Government is most grateful to the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists for their efforts and for the very good work done by Professor Hollows. </para>
			<para>The Minister and the College consider that this important Program, which to the present has examined more than 60,000 persons, must not be jeopardised in this way and that a delay of one month in completion of the Program will allay any concern. </para>
			<para>Meantime, the on-going aspects of the Program will continue: mass treatment for trachoma is being arranged for some 9,000 persons in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, and surgery is continuing in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. </para>

            <para>-I am aware of the concern of many members of the Baltic community about the attitude of the Labor Party on this matter. I have to say that there is in writing considerable justification for that concern. I think that one of the most profligate purveyors of policy the Labor Party has ever had is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Combe. In a letter dated 22 August of this year he wrote to a prominent member of the Baltic community in a manner which shows that the Labor Party has learnt nothing from its irresponsible action in recognising incorporation in 1974. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe's</inline> letter, in offensive and even abusive terms, casts a slur on the people of the Baltic States. In the letter he describes as 'a stupid deception' the attitude that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are not legally part of the Soviet Union. In 1974 his leader- the present Leader of the Opposition- described it as a cruel deception. What was a cruel deception in 1974 becomes a stupid deception in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe.</inline> The particular interest of this letter is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> seeks to excuse his leader and lay the blame for the grievous error at the door of a senior public servant, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Plimsoll. In his letter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That tactic, frankly, is contemptible. Members of the Baltic community know who was responsible for the decision of the then Government. The Leader of the Opposition knows who was responsible. Indeed the Foreign Minister in the previous Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> knows who was responsible and knew at the time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> was, at best, only a reluctant defender of the Prime Minister, as he had reason to be, as the decision was taken during his absence overseas. It was only by dint of continued and consistent effort by members of the then Opposition, the present Liberal-National Country Party Government, that the facts were dragged out of the then Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>The decision to recognise the incorporation of the Baltic states became public knowledge only when a Press report out of Moscow- not an official Government statement to the Parliament, not a Government Press release- disclosed the fact one month after the decision by the Prime Minister in Canberra and nearly three weeks after the Australian Embassy in Moscow had been informed. The Australian people had no reason to suspect that such a decision would be taken. The members of the Baltic community in Australia were treated rudely and with utter contempt. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe's</inline> letter shows that nothing has changed. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the first part of the question which seeks in a comparitive form the action that the present Government took. On 17 December 1975, just four days after the present Government was elected to office, it instructed the Australian Ambassador in Moscow that he and members of his staff should not in future make official visits to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McComas</inline> the Honorary Consul for Latvia in Australia prior to the Labor Government's decision, was informed that he could resume his functions as Honorary Consul. We executed our duty to move away from de jure recognition. That was done within a matter of days of election to government. In short, the Government said very quickly and very effectively that it did not accept the legality of the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. This remains the situation. The Government's policy will not change after 10 December. </para>

If so, were the borrowings prompted by the further run down of $7m to $8m in the level of Australia's reserves in the week ending 2 November? Why has the Treasurer found it necessary to devalue the dollar by 1.2 per cent since the Acting Treasurer announced the borrowing of $ 1,700m on 27 September? Does this mean that the Government is following a policy of devaluing the Australian dollar as well as, in the words of the Prime Minister last year, a policy 'of putting Australia into hock*? </para>

          <para>I say to the honourable gentleman in general terms about the balance of payments position that since the devaluation in 1976 the balance of payments position has, of course, strengthened. Export revenue in seasonally adjusted terms for the recent September quarter was 12 per cent higher than for the December quarter 1976. The value of imports has fallen by 7 per cent between the March and September quarters. The volume of imports is now almost certainly below the immediate pre-devaluation level. The honourable gentleman knows that the current account deficit fell appreciably in the September quarter. The Government's expanded overseas borrowing program has reinforced the capital account and now is encouraging a more favourable flow of private capital. The honourable gentleman would know that as at the end of October the reserves figure stood at the comfortable level of about $3 billion- slightly higher than a year ago. The external position is sound. I just ask the honourable gentleman to have a modicum of responsibility and to cease his persistent and destructive attacks on the exchange rate. </para>

As I said earlier, discussions are still going on with the College to see whether an alternative method can be found to ensure that the screening goes on. The rest of the program is going on.

            <para>- The advertisements do demonstrate the contribution that the Australian Telecommunications Commission is making to communications generally throughout Australia. What has not been recognised by members of this House and indeed by the community at large is the substantial number of initiatives which Telecom Australia is taking to improve services throughout the country. When loose comments are made as to the so-called profit or surplus of Telecom, people lose sight of the fact that under an Act of this Parliament there is a need for the Commission to find at least 50 per cent of capital works, long service leave and depreciation allowances out of revenue. That is a decision of this Parliament. The capital requirement for Telecom Australia this year alone is over $900m. If we talk of the capital involvement in Telecom we are talking of the order of $6,000m. So the surplus has to be seen in relation to that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Generally speaking, I think that the Parliament and certainly the Government are very pleased with the relationship with the Telecommunications Commission. I know from my discussions with the Commission that it is seeking and will continue to seek ways and means of improving communications, particularly in the rural areas of Australia. We have a vast island continent. Regrettably in some parts of it the population is shrinking and it is terribly difficult to maintain the services that Telecom would wish. I believe that a greater acknowledgment by members of this Parliament and by the community as a whole of the immense contribution Telecom makes would be helpful. After all, all surplus is ploughed back for the benefit of the system. The Australian community owns Telecom and any surplus that is made is of course used for the benefit of increased communications. </para>
          <para>In this growth market members of the Opposition would do well to seek to use whatever influence they have to get people in the trade union movement to co-operate in the use of the technology that is available. Regrettably at the moment some members of the trade union movement want to set their face against technology. If we are to have the best possible communications in Australia we have to use technology and we have to pursue development. I hope that each and every one of us will make a contribution in that way. </para>

            <para>-My attention has not been drawn to these so-called threats by the Premier of Queensland; but I can well imagine the threats there would be to the people of these outlying areas if there were a change of government in Queensland, just as there would be if there were a change of government in the National Parliament. The whole performance of the Australian Labor Party over the years has been to concentrate expenditure in the public sector, and very much against the rural sector. One classic example was water resources. Under Labor Party policy we saw the tapering off of water resources programs over a number of years. Money for local government was contained to a very low level. When we came to office we ensured that more money would be made available for local government, and more money is being provided for local government. We ensured that there would be a return of many of the incentives and benefits to the rural community, and they have been returned. Under the Labor Administration they were taken away. The interpretation which the Labor Party is putting on the things which the Premier of Queensland has been saying is prompted by its own conscience. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I am aware of the recent misleading advertisement to which the honourable gentleman refers. I consider it a most serious matter that the Labor Party should so mislead the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The facts are that in the period from December 1972 to December 1975-the years of the Labor Administration- the level of unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory and Queanbeyan rose by approximately 224 per cent. Since December 1975 the level of unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory has risen by a further 83 per cent. These figures are publicly available and they give the lie to the claim made in the advertisement of the Labor Party candidate. I think it is not good enough that the Labor Party should mislead the people of the Australian Capital Territory in this way. I am pleased to take the opportunity to set the record straight. In addition let me say that unemployment in the Australian Capital Territory is still well below the national average. </para>

Will he say whether in his view, these events embarrass Australia in international relations and will he discuss with his colleagues who are directly responsible for this matter ways of introducing legislation in Australia to protect whales as endangered species and at the same time to provide alternative employment for those few people in Albany in Western Australia who are employed in this industry? </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, who is in charge of the Electoral Act. Is the Minister aware that a candidate of another party for the new Federal seat of Fadden is masquerading by newspaper advertisements as if he has the endorsement of another party as well as his own party. Will the Minister ensure that when the Electoral Act is amended, it is so amended that we extend the principle embodied in the alteration to the Constitution last May in relation to casual Senate vacancies when political parties were recognised for the first time and thus prevent, by law, candidates indulging in delusions of grandeur or just plain false pretences? </para>

Did he and the Prime Minister forecast in the last national election campaign two years ago a growth rate in the following year of 6 per cent to 7 per cent and 'jobs for all who want to work', to mention just two economic indicators and two broken promises? Is it not a fact that he and his party were wrong in every economic forecast they made during that election campaign? Why should we take any notice of the economic forecasts of unkown origin mentioned by the Prime Minister yesterday and by the Treasurer today in Question Time in the light of the abysmal record and the depressing information . . . </para>

            <para>- One does not need to rely on the forecasts brought down by this Government to recognise that recovery is taking place and that inflation has been subject to a very significant fall. If the honourable gentleman doubts that let me quote but one of the many authoritative spokesmen in the economic area throughout the Australian community. I quote from a section of the Syntec review from which the Prime Minister quoted yesterday. Syntec said this: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>We expect the medium to long term bond rate structure to move gradually towards 8 per cent through 1 978. We expect the rate of inflation to move sustainably below 8 per cent on a year-on-year basis from mid- 1978 onwards. </para>

          <para class="block">Having said that, Syntec went on to express two sharp qualifications to those forecasts. I think the people would be interested in the qualifications. Syntec said: </para>

          <para class="block">I am sure there is no chance whatsoever of this Government being defeated in the polls that lie ahead. The people recognise that the honourable ! gentleman who has just posed the question is a lonely voice when speaking about the economy. What he has put forward represents a direct reversion to the pump priming policies which put the Labor Government out of office in 1975. This Government can say without any shadow of doubt that 1978 will be the best year of economic performance in the course of the past five years. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member for Adelaide wants to trade growth figures, I remind him in the gentlest possible way, because I have no reason to offend someone who is rather quiet in the economic area, that in 1975, the last year of the Labor Administration, non-farm product increased by only 0.3 per cent. In 1976 under this Government the average rate of growth was 4.2 per cent. If we look forward to 1 978, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the increase in non-farm product is expected to be 5 per cent. The honourable gentleman's policies are discredited on the record and on that record the party that he represents will again be rejected on 10 December. </para>

          <para>- I briefly want to make some remarks about the report. Unfortunately we have not had time to read the contents of the report, but my understanding is that the recommendation of the committee of inquiry is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Toomer</inline> be transferred to Tullamarine as a quarantine officer. This in effect would mean that he has been demoted from a senior quarantine officer to a quarantine officer. It also, I think, means that the bureaucracy of the Department of Health has been upheld in its earlier decision to demote him and place him at Port Hedland. I do not want to enter into the merits of the case further because it is very difficult to comment on the findings contained in a report which has just been tabled and which at this stage I have not seen. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The case itself, I think, is one which is of historic importance and one of which the Parliament ought to take note. Firstly, the inquiry was set up- I should say that it spans a period of two governments, not only the period of the present Government; I want that clearly understoodonly after a royal commission into the Public Service recommended that a judicial inquiry should be held and it was found that because of some deficiencies in the law such an inquiry should not be held. Therefore an internal Public Service inquiry was held. </para>
        <para>My concern about this whole episode is that basically it commenced over disagreements between public servants with little or no experience in quarantine matters and a quarantine officer who I believe was conscientiously seeking to cany out his duties, whether or not over conscientiously, and I find it difficult to say that any quarantine officer could ever overreact in the area of quarantine because of the substantial importance of quarantine within Australia. I think it is unfortunate that the judicial inquiry could not have been held because of the circumstances, some of which have been the subject of questions, and one question to which I received a reply yesterday, about the inspection in Sydney of M.V. <inline font-style="italic">Vishna Kalyan,</inline> in which a member of the first inquiry into this area, the Director of the Department of Health in New South Wales, was in fact present. Whilst it may be that only inquiries were taking place on the methods of quarantine operations, there are other circumstances surrounding that inspection, one of which is still the subject of questions on the Notice Paper, regarding the captain being given a clearance by a non-quarantine officer, which have to lay as matters which could have influenced the course of the inquiry. I imagine- I think the experience of us all would suggest this- that where a member of a former committee which has in fact brought in a decision fully upholding the decisions of the Western Australian branch of the Department of Health, and an associated director of the Department of Health in another State is present at the time of such inquiry, he would be seeking to place the best possible interpretation on the decisions which were taken by the committee of which he himself was a member. </para>
        <para>I hope, irrespective of the findings of this committee of inquiry, that it does not close inquiries into the total quarantine service. I do not believe that the quarantine service should be judged on the sins, omissions or successes of one quarantine officer or the disputes which he may have had on personality or other grounds with officers of his department. I make that point quite clearly. I believe that there are very substantial pounds for some degree of inquiry into whether the quarantine service should be an independent service operating similar to the Bureau of Customs, if not in association with it, so that it is not subject to any departmental direction even though departmental umbrella structures may support it. I think it is important that inquiries m that area should take place and continue. The service is too important for any hint of interference, other than for purely quarantine or administrative reasons. </para>
        <para>The situation in Western Australia may or may not have improved. Certainly, from the early history of the Toomer case, it was less than satisfactory. I think that the persons who carried out the original inquiry did not get the full facts. I am certain that personality clashes in Western Australia acted to the detriment of the service and most likely created a far greater problem in the Toomer case than would have existed otherwise. I took this opportunity to speak without having studied the report. I will study the report with some interest. This is the last occasion on which we will be able to comment on it in this Parliament. This matter will be rather old news by the start of the next Parliament. I hope that this report will not preclude further inquiries into the structure and operations of Australia's quarantine service, which will become increasingly important as the number of persons and the types of transport coming into and going out of Australia increase. </para>

          <para>- I, too, want to speak very briefly on the report. I have taken a keen interest in the Toomer case. I speak as the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> spoke, in that I am not fully aware of the contents of, or the recommendations in, the report. It is very clear that lessons can be learned from this case in a number of areas. Firstly, the honourable member for Corio referred to deficiencies in quarantine. I am sure that the airing of this case to a large degree has allowed a number of those deficiencies in quarantine to be plugged or at least reviewed. I note that the Government, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has made a review of the whole administrative arrangements of the quarantine service. I think that this is a very good start. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> to follow the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration that its case study of the Toomer case be published. I note that the Minister has tabled the report of the inquiry by Temme and Perriman, but in no way has any effort been made to summarise the very substantial case study- it occupies more than 100 pages- which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro</inline> who was a member of that Royal Commission. I ask the Government to look at the possibility of following that recommendation. I think this whole case has indicated a degree of secrecy which is quite undesirable. I think frankness breeds confidence. One cannot have confidence in a quarantine service or a department of health which is very keen on hiding things. This whole case has been very secretive. It is essential that we have confidence in the quarantine service. That is the only way in which we will get full support from the public to ensure that there is proper quarantine enforcement. </para>
        <para>I am worried also about several aspects of the current inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temme</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Perriman.</inline> One of them has been referred to as the <inline font-style="italic">Vishna Kalyan</inline> episode. The episode has not been explained by the Department. The honourable member for Corio and I have questions on notice on this matter directed to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> I think it is desirable that they be answered. I note that a reply was received to question No. 1461 which deals with this matter. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I am satisfied that the conduct of Messrs Perriman and Temme while visiting the MV <inline font-style="italic">Vishna Kalyan</inline> was quite  proper, and has not in any way compromised the independence of the inquiry. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Without receiving a full report and answers from the Minister for Health, I have not quite the confidence that the Minister displayed in answering that question. I welcome the fact that a further report will be made to the Parliament on what has happened in this case. It is very clear that there has been a number of areas of administrative immorality. I hope that if these areas have been revealed in the report methods will be adopted to change the Public Service Act and Regulations to ensure that similar administrative immorality and personal vendettas cannot be exercised through the Public Service Act or under the guise of the Public Service Act. </para>

              <para>-by leave-In the absence of the leader of the Australian Branch Delegation, the Honourable Bert Kelly, I make a brief report on the Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held in Ottawa in October this year. One matter which received considerable publicity in Australia related to one of the Australian delegates, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> and to alleged criticisms by him of the Canadian hosts. I think that in fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> it is important that I report to the House on what I see as the circumstances surrounding that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was asked by a sensational newspaper whether he had seen any indigenous minority groups on his tours of Canada prior to the conference. He informed the journalist, who rang him late at night, that he had not. Subsequently the journalist said: 'Isn't that a pity'. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said: 'I suppose it is a shame'. A headline which appeared the next day in the newspaper which would be akin to some of our more sensational rags, intimated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> had said: 'Shame on the Canadian Government for not allowing visits to minority groups'. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The  Speaker  of the Parliament, who was the  President  of the Conference, indicated at the Conference that the Canadians had done everything they possibly could to meet the requests of delegates. I think that was a quite proper statement. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> and everyone else agreed with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelly</inline> indicated that the Australian Delegation was happy with the treatment it had received. There were some misunderstandings surrounding this case. I think they were unfortunate. I think it is important that the House be informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> in my opinion, was the victim of a beat-up story by a journalist. I think most honourable members in this House will understand what that is all about. </para>
          <para>The Conference adopted a new constitution for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which changes the arrangements with regard to the Executive General Council and other matters. These are set out in the report. I shall not go into them here. The one matter of substance that I think I ought to report on arising from the Conference was the organised manner in which delegates from the Malaysian area carried out a concerted attack on Australia relating to trade and other matters. All their speeches, I suggest, were prepared in advance before being delivered at the Conference. The honourable member for Indi, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holten,</inline> who was a member of the committee concerned, replied on behalf of Australia. But in the face of such an attack I think it will be necessary at future conferences for at least some members of delegations to international conferences from the parliamentary area to be provided with briefs from departments setting out exactly what the Australian Government s position has been, even if this information is provided only to the leader of the delegation. This Conference was used for the purpose of pursuing a line to the disadvantage of Australia. The information which was available to delegates was generally on the public record and I suggest, not sufficient to rebut the type of attack which was obviously derived from government departments, the delegation being led by a Minister. </para>
          <para>I think all delegates to the Conference would say that it was very successful and one at which discussions were on a far more intense and real level than some conferences one attends where there is piety and argument is avoided. This Conference I think discussed real questions well. I think the incident of the Press reports relating to one of the members of our delegation- I personally think he was blameless- was unfortunate. I think the delegation was well received in Canada and that the Canadians did a great job in presenting the Conference. </para>

            <para>- This amendment to the Trade Practices Act virtually covers three segments of that Act. The first part relates to the definition of price, and uses more exact terms. The second part relates to the question of the Minister having the ability to declare safety standards. The third part relates to the limitation of liability in respect of appliances or goods that have been sold. At the outset let me make it clear that the Opposition at this time will not be opposing the Bill but in fact will be opposing in principle clause 5 which relates to the ability of a supplier to mitigate liability for damages by having the opportunity, as a result of this clause, to exclude liability in a contract. The Opposition is saying that subject to that proviso we are not opposing the Bill but we have a very serious reservation about that clause. I think that on election to government we would restore that clause, in the interests of consumers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first clause to which I wish to refer is clause 3 which defines the question of what would be deemed to be the price. The House will recall a previous amendment to the Trade Practices Act by which section 4B gave a definition of a certain higher standard of warranty on goods supplied which cost less than $15,000. This method, which is contained in the earlier parts of the definition, is redefined to give a definition of prices. There is no objection to that. </para>
          <para>Clause 4 is an interesting clause. The reason given for its insertion is that it is a much more efficient and expedient way for the Minister to notify standards than to have to do so by proclamation. One wants at all times to praise expediency and efficiency, particularly where one is dealing with business and consumer affairs. However, one must look at the matter from the point of view of what would be called parliamentary procedures. The normal method would be for regulations to be prescribed. They, of course, can be subject to the review of Parliament. Parliament does not exercise its review role simply because of some peculiar quirk of any member of the Government or the Opposition. It is usually as a result of representations made by people in the commercial and business life, or even in the ordinary consumer life, who are anxious to say that the standards which have been proclaimed are wrong. So we get that surveillance. </para>
          <para>I think the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> is now saying that the Government wants to do that by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> The only qualification he has relates to the standards specified. The clause refers to standards prepared by the Standards Association of Australia or by a prescribed association or body. So the Minister is recognising the fact that there ought to be some other independent advice. The one qualification that the Opposition has in that respect is that consumers are not represented adequately or at all on the Standards Association or similar bodies. Consumers find it very difficult, because of a lack of funds, to participate in all discussions of bodies of this nature. They have no independent means of support. They have some limited government means of support which in no way enables them to be present or even members of various associations. So there is a weakness there. </para>
          <para>If the Minister wants to satisfy public opinion in this area he would need to guarantee that the appropriate representations of consumers or, to put it m another fashion, the recognised organisations of consumers, are represented on all associations at all times in respect of all products. Then there would be some guarantee that the standard set was in accordance with a determination properly and fairly made at which the consumers were fairly represented. I understand that this is not the position at present. </para>
          <para>We have some rather unhappy remarks to make about standards. I understand that there is a lot of discrepancy and disparity about standards which should have been applied in Australia and which are not being applied at present. I understand, for example, we have ailed to apply a national standard for children's clothing, particularly flammable clothing which could result in youngsters being burnt to death because of certain material used in the manufacture of their garments. I understand that such garments cannot be sold in New South Wales because, quite properly, the vigilant Government and Ministers in that State have taken action to see that those garments are not sold in New South Wales. They could be sold elsewhere in Australia. I understand that we have failed to set a safety standard in relation to safety helmets for motor cyclists. So people are suffering injury and are losing their lives, perhaps because of the lack of interest at the national level. Certain electronic slimming equipment is apparently a health hazard. There has been no proper national standard. </para>
          <para>These things should have been done. The Government cannot let things run along on the basis that it cannot interfere with somebody's profit motive or on the basis of some doubt about whether interference would affect a person's business. The issue is the safety of the consumer and the welfare of the community. Not the least, and probably the most serious, aspect is the amount of eye injuries caused by certain toys. Some States have taken adequate action to protect the consumer. At the national level we have weakened rather badly in this area. I would like the Minister to look at that matter, even in the dying stages of this Parliament. He could authorise his Department to see why something has not been done to protect the consumers in those fields. </para>
          <para>I turn to the most important aspect of the Bill, in the legal sense. It is clause S which states that there will be a limitation of liability in respect of goods supplied. We are really saying that the services relating to personal, domestic or household use will not be affected, but if there is any other use the question of damage or consequential damage which a person may suffer will have to be borne by that person. The clause flows no doubt from strong and violent representations by the multi-national computer company, IBM Australia Limited. It is not good enough for this country to have legislation that might suit some overseas combine which, having interpreted the new legislation, feels that it represents an open-ended commitment for it because it removes provisions which allow a consumer who buys one of its computers for less than $15,000 to recover a substantial amount of damages. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the legal principles involved. It is quite clear that, under the Act as it is, the consumer would have to show that he indicated that he intended to use the appliance for a specified purpose. In other words, he would have to show that he did not just buy the computer off the shelf without saying anything about what he intended to use it for. If he had done that and then used the appliance wrongly, he would not be able to recover damages. He would have to provide evidence that at the time of purchase he specified the purpose for which he wanted the appliance </para>
          <para class="block">Plenty of English decisions made under the Supply of Goods Act clearly show that suppliers are not expected to know the idiosyncrasies of the people who buy from them. A person who buys an appliance and misuses it or does not use it properly may not recover damages as a matter of course. Far from it. Evidence as to the specified purpose has to be considered. The purpose could have been specified by the supplier and it would have had to be specified by the consumer. Damages are not given automatically to someone who has bought an appliance. The purchaser has to follow the normal procedures of law and show that he has suffered damage because of a breach of warranty- an imPlied warranty or a specific warranty- relating to the purpose for which the goods may be used. </para>
          <para>IBM has ignored aU that. The British Government weakened its stand on what it thought was an appropriate Supply of Goods Act and eventually amended its legislation in 1973 to exclude liability in these cases. The British legislation set out the reasons for exclusion. The first referred to the strength of the bargaining position. An exact quotation from that provision is now proposed to be inserted in our legislation. The second concerns whether the buyer received an inducement. Again an exact quotation is proposed to be inserted in our legislation. The third consideration is whether the buyer knew or ought reasonably to have known. An exact quotation of that also is to be inserted in our legislation. What has happened is that, because an international combine has asked the Government to use the British Act as a model to protect it, the British Act is becoming the Australian law. </para>
          <para>We were pioneering the law on trade practices. Our legislation protected the consumer by providing that appliances costing less than $15,000 ought to have an implied warranty that they would meet the test of a specified purpose. This is to be thrown overboard because the Minister has succumbed to the pressures of an international group. I do not think manufacturers in Australia were very worried about the existing provision, but IBM engaged in a strong campaign against it. In fact, it wrote to me about a speech I had made. I had said that IBM had gone on strike against supplying the normal consumer in Australia. It was determined to stand over consumers in Australia. It said that it was going to have its way and that the legislation should be framed in the way the British had framed their legislation. It said that without such legislation a consumer might be able to sustain a case against it. </para>
          <para>Let us put the criteria in the right place. No consumer can recover anything unless he suffers damage. The result of the action of the Minister and the Government is that the consumer will suffer damage. He will have to bear the cost, and that is the end of the story. Is that fair and reasonable? All that the law normally asks is that a product which is bought should meet the purpose for which it is specified. That is the implied meaning of this division of the Trade Practices Act. It does not say that there is a complete and absolute liability in any sense of the word. It relates to the evidence about the nature of the transaction. Section 71 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where a corporation supplies . . . and the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the corporation . . . any particular purpose there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Section 74 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where a corporation supplies . . . and the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the corporation any particular purpose . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the overriding test. We just cannot say that IBM is responsible for all its appliances if a consumer misuses them. It is not. The natural result of this amendment is that, if a consumer buys an appliance which he says he wants for a specified purpose and it fails to do the job and he suffers consequential damages, he may not be able to recover because conditions presently required by the Act may be excluded from the contract. </para>
          <para>There was a stampede by a particular group to indicate to the Australian legislators that they had better not continue with what they had done. Because the Act was amended earlier this year to protect consumers, IBM decided to wage a campaign to get it altered. Unfortunately, and wrongly in my view, the Government has succumbed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moyes</inline> of IBM is no slouch at lobbying. He wrote to me about what he felt were unfair remarks I had made. I stand by those remarks. He wrote to me on 8 September, but I did not receive the letter until about 1 1 October. I do not know what happened to it. The background is that I understand that there was correspondence in the newspapers, particularly the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moyes</inline> said that he really was not certain what the Government was going to do. I very much doubt that. It appeared very clearly from the word go that IBM was determined that the Government had better do something. It should be noticed that this amendment is before us on the last day of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>We want the Government to look at the law on this point. When I replied to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Moyes</inline> I pointed out that the legislation did not mean that automatically IBM was responsible. The test of whether there had been a specified purpose had to be satisfied. It was known that the idosyncrasies of a consumer would be taken into account. There was much difficulty with the law concerning whether clauses of contracts were excludable. When the Suisse Atlantique case was discussed in the House of Lords, Lord Reid talked about this very problem. He said that we had to look at what was fair and reasonable and that we could not really expect the courts to do it. He said: . . . in the recent cases that the courts are to consider whether the exemption is fair in all the circumstances or is harsh and unconscionable or whether it was freely agreed by the customer. And it does not seem to me to be satisfactory that the decision must always go one way if, e.g., defects in a car or other goods are just sufficient to make the breach of contract a fundamental breach, but must always go the other way if the defects fall just short of that. </para>
          <para class="block">This is the particular point: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This is a complex problem which intimately affects millions of people and it appears to me that its solution should be left to Parliament. If your Lordships reject this new rule there will certainly be a need for urgent legislative action but that is not beyond reasonable expectation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The British ran away from taking appropriate legislative action. The Australian Government has succumbed to international pressure to do just what the British have done. The point I am making is that damage will be sustained by people who purchase goods under a contract with a clause that states they will not be able to recover damages because such contracts are excluded from the Trade Practices Act by this Bill. Under the existing Act it is appropriate for a person to say that he bought the goods for a specified purpose, that the supplier knew the purpose and that therefore he is entitled to recover damages- not penalty damages but actual damages. </para>
          <para>The Swanson Committee was very interested in this matter. It was a committee to which the Australian Labor Party did not give much praise in every respect. It recommended this protection for consumers and was strongly of the view that the definition of 'consumer' ought to be broadened to protect a number of business transactions, in particular those involving the small businessman. He is the man who will be most affected by this negation of liability. Is it not fair and reasonable that any small businessman who buys one of these appliances from IBM or the like should be entitled to recover damages, if he suffers damages, and should not have to face the issue, particularly in a monopoly field where, perhaps he needs this sort of hardware and has to buy it under a contract which says: 'If there is a problem in the sense that that machine does not stand up to what you will think it will do, it will not be our responsibility. You can take no action against us'.? He legally meets the defence that he had to sign a document which provided that he could not take action. </para>
          <para>The parties are not on equal terms- far from it. We have a massive international group with a monopoly on appliances selling those appliances to a customer who has nothing but a small business and who is not able to say: 'Well, I am on equal terms'. It is a take it or leave it proposition. I notice this same international group was also encouraging people in the elevator business to do the same sort of thing. They were working a little club amongst themselves to indicate clearly to the poor unfortunate customer 'Well, you are not always going to recover damages because we have a sort of monopoly on appliances that you must have. We will now persuade this Government to alter the Act so that you will not recover damages in certain circumstances'. </para>
          <para class="block">It is not good enough just to talk about the question of replacing the machine or repairing le goods. What about the damage the person suffers as a consequence of the failure of the machine or the failure to maintain the warranty? A consequential damage is involved. That person could go broke because of this sort of liability We do not see that happening in the international sphere. These people are unlikely to go broke. They have a multi-million dollar asset backing. I do not know of any outrageous claims having been made against them in recent months because of the amendments we passed. We do not see small businessmen running off to court, issuing writs on the basis that they are going to recover damages. In every case they have to substantiate the claim. </para>
          <para>It is quite wrong that the small business community in Australia has been so deprived of normal protection. The Swanson Committee was anxious to give them that protection. It was because of the Swanson Committee that this particular amendment was introduced. Now it is to be removed. Why? It is because of IBM and a few others who say that they do not like it; that they do not want Australia to be a pioneer in this field, that they had better sink back to where they are in Britain and other places. So the big man is always protected and the Utile man always suffers. </para>
          <para>We would have no objection if this were an equal footing proposition, but this is in no way an equal footing proposition. We are concerned to think that the Government has caved in, particularly in the dying minutes of a parliament, and is passing a law that will affect a number of people. </para>
          <para class="block">For that reason we oppose clause S. It is too late to talk about a redefinition of it. I have clearly outlined to the Minister the concern of the small business community. I am not at aU impressed with the representations made by IBM or the way in which it made them. Nor am I impressed with the other people IBM tried to inveigle into putting pressure on this Government. The law can certainly stand a much better amendment than that proposed here. It could clearly say: 'You cannot exclude the provisions in the contracts where it is clearly spelt out that the customer indicated the specified purpose'. Yet we have this weakness now that if there is to be a contest about it, perhaps a court can determine what is fair and reasonable. As was said by Lord Reid in the Suisse Atlantique case: 'There can be no such thing. It cannot be done. It is a matter for Parliament: What about the Government looking at that situation? It is for those reasons that whilst we do not oppose the Bill in the overall context, for the reasons I have mentioned, we certainly object strongly to the provisions of clause 5. </para>

            <para>-The attack by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> on the amendments is certainly something that could be regarded as predictable.  His  case falls to the ground and has no substantiation. It will be recalled that amendments to the Trade Practices Act have occurred on a number of occasions in the life of this Parliament. It is all directly related to an undertaking given. That was that imperfections, serious anomalies, would be reviewed and appropriate action taken when it was found reasonable so to do. That is exactly why these current amendments have been introduced. I do not propose to traverse them aU because they are clearly understood by those who want to apply themselves on a basis of fair judgment of the Government's action. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unfortunately the Opposition feels some disappoinment because its extreme approach in this matter a few years ago was designed quite clearly as a socialist approach. It was an approach which was summed up in the words of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith when he said that there had been pressure from an international combine, as he described it. He referred to multinationals and the like but failed to recognise the importance of balance between this and the field of commercial operation in this country. This was particularly so when he said that we should be taking action that differs from that taken in the United Kingdom and other places where greater experience has occurred and where, of course, there is a greater appreciation of the involvements. He suggested that we should be the pacesetters in some of these matters. How ridiculous! It astounds me to think that we could approach matters of this kind on the basis that the more limited business scope in this country is sufficient upon which to base judgment. But still that is the proposition that has been put. </para>
          <para>Quite clearly there is a lack of understanding, particularly of the import of clause 5. The difficulties that arose as a consequence of the provisions of clause 5 are very clear. What is proposed is to bring about a fairer situation, not just for large companies- the honourable member named IBM-but for the whole spectrum of those commercial operations that supply equipment up to a certain value. The assertion that it should be fair that damage should be entertained in the matter of losses that might occur is a very one-sided view. I say to the House that if that is the view in this matter, what about industrial disruption? What about damage that occurs then to the success of a commercial operation? It is a very different argument when that kind of thing is raised in this forum or in any other place by the Opposition. Therefore I repeat that the expressions by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith in this matter are predictable. Obviously a political judgment rather than a factual one has been made by the Opposition in looking at this particular issue. </para>
          <para>I said that I did not propose to traverse all the details. That is for the reason that there is a time limitation and also that it is not really necessary. What we want to be clear on is that the Government is honouring an undertaking to amend where there is justification so to do, when proper cases have been put as to the effect of the legislation in its original form. No doubt there will be further instances where there is a need to take action of this kind. It is very clear that the Government is seeking to free Australian commerce from unnecessary straitjackets imposed by the legislation and where there is unnecessary restrictiveness. Small business will be assisted to a very great extent by the amendments. In fact the interpretations that have sometimes been placed on the present legislation have been shown to be quite wrong. That is particularly evident in the attitude that was displayed by people commenting in financial columns and the like as to the effect of the amendments. This caused some real worry and concern for retailers when they were not going to be involved at all in the way that was described. It is a pity, when we want to have an effective trade practices measure, that there is distortion and that that distortion is so often strongly expressed on wrong premises. For that reason I commend the amendments contained in the Bill. Very clearly, they are aimed at assisting the consumer, and the supplier- indeed the whole spectrum of straight forward business in this country. </para>

            <para>-in reply-The honourable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ian Robinson)</inline> has answered very clearly, very well and in a complete way the concern that has been expressed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> on behalf of the Opposition, in regard to clause 5 of the Bill. I think I am right in saying that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has indicated general support for the rest of the measure that is before the House. However, because it is several days since I made my second reading speech on this subject, I think I should remind honourable members on both sides of the House that the Government, in arriving at its decision as expressed in clause 5 of this Bill, concluded that in the context of commercial dealings in commercial goods or services it is reasonable to allow, and I emphasise the word 'allow'- not to forceparties to a contract to negotiate their own arrangements regarding liability for consequential damages flowing from a breach of the contract. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me make it clear that the Trade Practices Act will continue to maintain a basic philosophy .that suppliers of goods or services should stand behind the quality and title of those goods or services in their dealings with business as well as with the public. Accordingly, the Bill does not allow liability for repair or replacement of faulty goods or services of for a breach of the undertakings in section 69 relating to title to be excluded. Further, the Bill does not allow relevant liability to be limited with total disregard to equity between the parties. The Government believes that the recent amendments to the law in the United Kingdom in this regard are appropriate to the Australian situation. Because of this a limitation of liability in a contract governed by the Trade Practices Act may be challenged on the ground that the limitation was not fair and reasonable between the parties. </para>
          <para>The only other point that I wish to make is in regard to the fact that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith singled out IBM Australia Ltd for criticism for the representations it made to the Government and, indeed, to the Opposition. I want to make it perfectly clear that representations were received from a large number of business organisations- not only from IBM- in regard to this matter and concern was expressed. It was because of this concern that the Government reviewed the definition of 'consumer' in the Trade Practices Act. Some time ago I made a public statement indicating that consideration was being given to amending the legislation in this regard. A large number of submissions were received not only from industry groups and commercial organisations but also from consumer groups. I am bound to say that, apart from the criticism levelled here today, I am not aware of any substantial criticism having been contained in the submissions I have received. In fact, I took the opportunity of discussing the matter with the Government's advisory group and, again, on that occasion there was general acceptance of the proposal that is now before the House. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition objects to clause S. But firstly I want to refer to what the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> said. He created the impression that the Government's decision had not been made as a result of the representations of one particular group, but that a number of other people had made representations. I accept that, but it is quite clear that the only organisations that seemed to be making all the noise- certainly to the Opposition and certainly to the Press- were IBM Australia Ltd and some of its affiliates. Whilst the Minister is entitled to refer to his Press statement I would like to refer to the last paragraph of his second reading speech where, talking about the intention of the Government in the future, he said that the Government intends to amend the Trade Practices Act with respect to manufacturers' warranties. He said that the Government will be dealing with that matter upon its return to office. Let me say that my parry will be dealing with it, because it expects to be in office. One wonders why the matter of manufacturers' warranties could not have been dealt with, with the same expertise and speed. That is not the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ian Robinson)</inline> made a rather strong attack on me on the basis that I had some peculiar problem in dealing with overseas international combines. I have no such problem. I would like the honourable member for Cowper to understand his own </para>
          <para class="block">Government's position. It was that Government- - not the Labor Government of which I was a member- that introduced the amendments to the Act which this Bill seeks to delete. Let me refresh the memory of the honourable member for Cowper. The amendments to the Trade Practices Act were foreshadowed a long time before they were introduced. Plenty of submissions could have been made- they were not made at that time- by IBM. I am aware that the Committee to review the Trade Practices Act, the Swanson Committee, stated that one of the amendments should be in relation to the definition of 'consumer' which adopted the basic notion of goods or services 'ordinarily acquired for private use or consumption' and then excluded certain transactions of a commercial nature. The Committee considered that the best approach to the definition would be by reference to the price paid by the consumer for the goods or services. The Committee recommended that the appropriate test should be a limit of $15,000 on the value of the goods or services. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Cowper has forgotten that it was the Swanson Committee that brought in this recommendation which forms part of the Government's recommendations. Why did the Swanson Committee do that? It was strongly of the view that the definition of a 'consumer' should be sufficiently broad to provide protection to a range of business transactions, particularly purchases by small businesses. The Committee considered that one important function of the consumer protection provisions of the Act is to redress, between supplier and customer, inequalities in the technical expertise required to recognise, and the bargaining power to negotiate, a fair bargain. These inequalities are not necessarily limited to 'traditional' consumers or to transactions involving what might be termed 'consumer' goods in a narrow sense. The Committee went on to talk about the possibility of an insurance company purchasing a wrong chair, or something of that nature. </para>
          <para>Again, the honourable member for Cowper seemed to overlook the fact that some Government Ministers were concerned that IBM was becoming upset. It first appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> which at that time seemed to be the appropriate mouthpiece for IBM, that the industry was grinding to a halt because the com- { niter group was upset. The managing director of BM informed all its clients by telex: </para>

          <para class="block">They were the only people mentioned in the Press. There was no suggestion by the Opposition that the Government had done the wrong thing. In fact, the Opposition was applauding the Government in this area. I am astounded by the ignorance of the honourable member for Cowper in this area. Then, on 7 July 1977 the Acting Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Macphee,</inline> was moved to comment that he found it surprising that industry had taken so long to examine the proposed new definition of 'consumer'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Macphee</inline> stated that it was surprising that in view of the long period over which the proposed definition of 'consumer' had been made public and in the light of the specific invitations which had been issued on a number of occasions by his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard,</inline> for interested persons to examine the Swanson Committee's recommendations, it had taken so long for somebody to talk about this matter. Senior Government officials were reported as saying: 'The principle is that if it is reasonable to protect the ordinary consumer, then is it not reasonable to protect the business man who is not expert in what he is buying for his own use- that is, not trading stock or raw materials'. Then we find <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline> saying that there was confusion. It reported: </para>

          <para class="block">I wish the honourable member for Cowper would talk to his colleagues. They are the words of the Government and other Ministers. What are they talking about? This is a high pressure campaign and whilst the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has said that there are other people who have been complaining, the real issue came from IBM and a few of its subsidiaries. I think the other one is the Otis Elevator Company. Neither are Australian owned in this sense. Let us not be hoodwinked by an attack on me. I can take it but the consumer cannot. That is the point the Opposition is making. I wish the honourable member for Cowper would understand also that the Government has amended the Act so that a trade union can be liable for damages if it causes a secondary boycott. He must have forgotten that legislation. It is good to see the honourable member for Cowper in the chair listening to this speech because I know he will learn from what I am saying.

            <para>- The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. The Bill contains a number of clauses but the consequential clause relates to the adoption of the Brussels definition of commercial value and the Opposition accepts that proposition. The biggest problem in respect of the Brussels definition always has been to indicate that the value ought to be the value placed on the goods or appliances or whatever it may be in the country of origin. There have been some circumventions in the past with a country of origin moving goods into another country with discount, that then affecting the question of the documentation price here. Amendments are proposed also to give greater flexibility to regulations governing the granting, operation and transfer of licences. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Clause 7 provides a restructuring of provisions setting out the general requirements in relation to exports to provide a basis for eliminating the need for export licences under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations by upgrading the export entry as a sole control document The other important matters deal with drug trafficking offences and the maximum penalties which can be provided. </para>
          <para>At the moment the issue of drug addiction is the most important issue in Australia. It is probably true, as the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare said recently, that it is not just limited to narcotics and amphetamines. It also includes alcohol and tobacco. We must put them in the right context. Nevertheless, the results are quite serious, no matter what drug we look at. They affect the health of people, particularly young people. Whilst we cannot pass laws to protect people from themselves, it is important to try to protect people from others. The purpose of this Bill is to impose very heavy penalties. The Opposition will not say any more about that aspect because the Government feels that that is the position. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has indicated that the national Parliament is interested, as it should be, in the question of drugs and their effect on Australia. Heroin, of course, is imported and therefore one would think that the Parliament, as a federal organisation, could prevent its importation. Of course, that is extremely difficult. In fact we are not preventing it because there are so many points of entry. It is well known, for example, that the use of heroin is prevented in Japan because the penalties are so great and the treatment is so harsh that people do not use it. They use other drugs, which is of great concern to the Japanese authorities. It follows I suppose, that because of the cessation of the hostilities in Vietnam, and certainly because Japan has prevented the importation of heroin, Australia has become the soft market, the easy market to penetrate. It is happening accordingly. </para>
          <para>The Opposition was anxious, when the Prime Minister set out the terms of reference of the Royal Commission into drugs, to see those terms extended to include criminal conduct arising from the use of narcotics and amphetaminesthat would include people peddling those drugs and making enormous amounts of money- and, most particularly, the treatment of offenders. The Opposition suggested at the time that those matters be considered because in many cases the unfortunate offender also is a peddler. He lives off the proceeds of peddling and keeps up the money supply for the person, in many cases an international criminal, who can provide the drugs and guarantee their penetration. Whilst we cannot get to all these people, the world is concerned because so many young people are affected. In this nation at the present time we have a false sense of security, believing that we are doing all we can to make penalties severe. We are punishing people with gaol sentences and big monetary penalties. Up to a point this applies to people who are not really affected or addicted but who are just interested in the money. They are the people who are preying on the system. They are the ones whom we would not mind going to gaol and being dealt with rather severely but for the unfortunate addict it is no solution; that is the other point. This has to be looked at as a problem in society in the same way as alcoholism and other problems are regarded. There has to be some understanding of how best we can help these people. They need support and they need treatment. Incarceration is not the solution. </para>
          <para>I am not going to delay the House, but every member who has a penitentiary in his electorate knows that imprisonment does not solve many of the problems of mankind. It does have some value in the sense perhaps of being a deterrent but in the main it does not do anything like what the public thinks it can do. It does not protect the public against crime. It does not rehabilitate offenders. I am referring to offenders guilty of what one could call serious crime such as bodily injury, threatened violence and matters of that nature. Drug offences are a different type of offence. It is more a self-inflicted wound type of offence. We have to look at the minds of the people to ascertain the problems that are upsetting them, how best they can enjoy their life and what are the worries and pressures that have caused them to become so addicted. In every case it will be found that there is a reason. It is probably due to some personality problem, the home environment or some other reason. The drug problem affects young people particularly. It is interesting to note that most people who are affected are under 23 years of age, so there is this identifiable factor of immaturity, if I can put it that way. </para>
          <para>The experience of living is a great thing and perhaps the older we get the more we are cushioned against the things that can destroy us. It is important now that we have legislation of this type not just to say: 'Look, we have got it covered because the penalties are pretty substantial'. This legislation provides penalties of up to $100,000 or imprisonment up to 25 years or both. Those are really tremendous penalties, but will they solve anything? The answer is: 'Not really'. It might be a great thing to catch some pedlar who has caused so much damage, but in supporting this Bui I would like the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> to use his good offices with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in these dying moments of the Parliament, and the Government, to say that the Government will alter the terms of reference of the royal commission to guarantee that we do not get a really intelligent appraisal of the situation. I think the Senate Committee report was a very good one. It looked at the problem probably with some medical expertise as well. We have to treat the patient. We have to get a solution and it can be done but it does need involvement with the community. This means that people will have to take an interest in each other. There is too much isolation in Australia today. Australians are too divided. They are isolated against each other. We have to encourage a better atmosphere. Perhaps we should start in the schools where the teachers and children are so involved and so interested in the future. The high pressures of society, the difficulties of unemployment and all these sorts of matters go towards causing this problem and it cannot be solved merely with the sort of penalties that are set out in this legislation. We support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- This Bill is of tremendous importance to the nation. I commend the Government for introducing it. It is a consequence of deliberations between Ministers from the respective States and the Federal Minister. It has been a matter of grave concern to all thinking Australians that the involvement of people in this country in high-powered trafficking in drugs has drawn us into the net of a world wide problem, and we of course regard this as a very serious imposition particularly on young people. It is essential that the penalties that applied in 1971 be updated. The difference between $4,000 and $100,000 and the increase in the comparatively light maximum imprisonment deterrent to 25 years were designed following careful consideration by State and Federal Ministers to bring about the required deterrent against the pusher. It is essential that this be done and I am sure that the action of the Government will be endorsed by the vast majority of the Australian people. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> did say that he doubted whether it would solve anything and he said that it would not really stop the problem. I remind him that this has not been the experience in other countries and I am sure that it will not be the experience here. Certainly the ramifications of the problem of drugs are very wide and whatever can be done by research, inquiries, royal commissions and the like should be done, but notwithstanding that we need to be vigilant. It is vital that this legislation in the dying hours of this Parliament should get on to the statute book. It is important that the Government should give a lead in the matter of deterrent penalties and punishment. There is no alternative if we are to toughen up on the people who are the exploiters in this field. I strongly support the measure. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> and the honourable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ian Robinson)</inline> for the support they have given to this measure. Indeed, it is heartening to see a measure of this nature supported so strongly from both sides of the House. In relation to the question raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith concerning the terms of reference of the National Royal Commission into Drugs, let me remind him and the House of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> at the time the terms of reference were announced. It was, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith had indicated, mentioned at the time that perhaps the terms of reference ought to be widened in one way or another, and the Prime Minister pointed out that in the interests of getting the commission started as quickly as possible he felt the best course was for the commission to proceed with the terms of reference as laid down and he gave a clear undertaking that if the royal commissioner felt inhibited in any way in relation to the terms of reference then the Government would very quickly and sympathetically consider any request from the royal commissioner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to make it abundantly clear to this House and to the nation as a whole that the Government is determined to do everything possible in this field to reduce the menace of the drug problem in Australia and particularly to bring to justice those people who are trading off the health of other people, those people who are trafficking in drugs and as a result destroying the lives of many Australians. </para>

            <para>-The legislation now before the chamber is legislation that could and should have been brought before the Parliament many years ago, at least in 1 973, but for me political bloody-mindedness of the Premier of Queensland, and in this respect I have to include the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> in that reference to the Premier of Queensland because they are colleagues in the same Party. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Australian Shipping Commission Act so as to enable the Australian National Line to provide an intrastate service to ports along the Queensland coast- a much needed service- and to make certain other amendments to the Act that would bring the style of operations and the presentation of accounts of the ANL more in keeping with current commercial practice. I will have more to say about that at a later stage. </para>
          <para>I just want to dwell for a moment on the many years that have passed in which the people of north Queensland have sought to have a service provided for their ports by the ANL. It is only in the current State election campaign in Queensland- and I suspect in the Federal election campaign that has now developed herethat there has been urgency finally to make a decision in response to the wishes of the people of north Queensland. In the current election campaign in Queensland a concerted effort has been mounted by candidates in the northern sections of Queensland to press the Queensland Parliament to legislate so that the ANL can operate into those Queensland ports on an intrastate basis. The present Minister, as I said, must share some responsibility for this, if only because he and the Premier of Queensland are members of the same party. </para>
          <para>All sorts of spurious excuses were given by the Premier of Queensland during the period of opposition to this legislation to allow the ANL to move into Queensland. Honourable members will recall that one of the first acts of the Whitlam Government early in 1973 was to ask the Queensland Government to come to an agreement with the national Government for an amendment to the Australian Shipping Commission Act so that intrastate shipping services could be provided for Queensland. At the time, and in subsequent periods right up until a few weeks ago, the Queensland Government maintained that the provision of an intrastate Queensland shipping service by the ANL would disadvantage existing surface transport employees and certainly would mean a reduction in the potential income of the Queensland railways and the laying off of large numbers of Queensland railway employees. That claim by the Queensland Premier had been refuted consistently and persistently by officials of the Australian Railways Union in Queensland. At least the Opposition welcomes now the belated appearance of this legislation. It is long overdue. His earlier entry has been prevented - </para>

              <para>-Thank you for your protection, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> We welcome the introduction of this legislation. Although it is belated and overdue, at least now we can set about the business of not only improving the efficiency of the ANL operations but also, and more importantly, giving to the people of north Queensland a better, more frequent and more economical freight service than they have had in the past. The attitude of the Queensland Government has been in line with that of the present Government, as evidenced by a letter a copy of which I have here. It was dated February 1976 and was addressed to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> A proposal was put that the Government should dispose of the four ANL bulk carriers. One determines from the letter that, when it was found that the loss that would be suffered would be greater than any capital investment that might be saved, the Government found that it had to proceed with the construction and purchase of the four bulk carriers from Sweden and Germany. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I cannot understand why those on the other side of the House, in this Parliament and outside it, make such consistent attacks upon the operations of the people's own transport enterprises. Frequently we see from those opposite and from their party organisations at State and Federal levels attacks on the operations of TransAustralia Airlines, the Australian National Railways, our shipping line or Qantas Airways Ltd. More recently the attacks have been on Qantas and TAA. I would have thought that, since these are publicly owned enterprises and are making profits for the Australian people, those who sit opposite- who, after all, are supposed to constitute the Government and who are responsible in the first place for the operations of the statutory authorities- would be welcoming the results and trying to induce from those statutory authorities a better quality of service and a better performance still. Instead of that, we see consistently the opposite. We hear that TAA ought to be disbanded and amalgamated with Qantas. There is a fair risk that there will be a substantial change to the two-airline agreement after the election is over, if this Government unfortunately is returned. Obviously changes are in mind. I will come back to that later in my comments, in relation to the McNeill Committee. </para><para>We are told that, under the guise of creating a regime of equal opportunity, several amendments have been made to the principal Act to place the ANL on a similar footing to private shipping companies. I do not understand what a regime of equal opportunity is. Maybe the Minister's speech writer one day will define it. I think it means all things to all men. I think it is true to say that the ANL has operated in the past in a generally competitive atmosphere in the market place. It has done its job well. It has a very good reputation both nationally and internationally. A minor amendment is being made to the principal Act to enable the General Manager of the Commission to also be a commissioner. I think that simply tidies up an arrangement for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reg</inline> Robin who is presently in that position. </para><para>Clause 7 is a key clause which provides for intrastate operations.

          </list><para class="block">I mentioned at the outset that complementary legislation went through the Queensland Parliament.

          </quote><para class="block">Naturally, section 6 relates to the termination of the agreement between the national Government and the State Government. Clause 8 of the Bill before the House is an important clause also. It provides that where a service is to be provided in the public interest an urgent public inquiry is to be conducted into the nature of the alternative shipping services or other modes of transport, including those which could be provided by private transport operators. In effect this means that, where it is felt that a shipping service ought to be provided and the Government wants to take a decision under section 17 of the principal Act, the Minister will be required to urgently order an inquiry into whether that service ought to be provided. If such a service ought to be provided, inquiries will be made into whether some other mode of transport, such as air, or whether a company other than the ANL or any other supplier of transport services could provide the service. I think, from the Minister's second reading speech and from the explanatory notes, that an opportunity is given for the private sector to come into the market and to participate in providing a subsidised service where the Minister has deemed that a service ought to be provided. I think it is possible that in the long term that may operate to the advantage of the ANL, but an assessment of that would depend upon the return on the funds invested or the capital invested in providing that service and the kind of return that the Government would see fit to pay. It is simply a reimbursement of losses incurred by the Line in providing that service; there is no profit content for the Line and capital will be invested without any return. Even though it seems to me that in the short term that amendment is intended to open up access to those services to the private sector, I think it is possible that in the long term it will have the opposite result for ANL in that it will enable ANL to be more selective in those areas of operation that it decides are profitable. </para><para>Clause 9 of the Bill provides for the Minister to set the dividend target. This is in line with his power in respect of Trans-Australia Airlines. There is nothing untoward about that other than that one could possibly see that as a device by which the Minister in setting the dividend target could set it unreasonably high. That would require the Commission to set rates to try to achieve that dividend target. If there were only one or two other operators in that service that would enable those operators to bring their prices up to those levels. So indirectly it could be interpreted as a freight rate maintenance scheme. It remains to be seen whether that will work out. In the same clause provision has been made for the supply of estimates at least half yearly, and possibly more frequently. I think that is a good move. I understand that they used to be supplied in the past in normal accounting methods. </para><para>Clause 10 provides for separate accounts for coastal operations and overseas operations. This again is a reversion to past practice. Again the Opposition thinks this will be of use in determining the operations and success of the Commission and in helping the Parliament to fine down the areas of improvement that should be looked at by the Parliament or by the Minister. Clause 1 1 deals with the implementation of new freight rates. It provides the Minister with a power to disapprove proposed rates within 60 days of notice. It also provides that if he does not disapprove of them the rates apply automatically, as I understand that clause. </para><para>The purpose of that, it seems, will be to remove some of the political opprobrium from the Minister or the Government as being seen to be directly responsible for increasing freight rates. Because freight rates to Tasmania had not been increased in even and frequent steps prior to the election in 1972 there was a build up of pressure for a price increase to try to recover losses being incurred. As a result of that the Whitlam Government had to increase rates in the 1972-75 period by 40 per cent. I think clause 11 will prevent that happening in the future. Clause 12 is only a machinery clause covering superannuation. Clause 13 ensures that funds intended as capital will be so identified by Parliament. I think again that this is to the advantage of ANL. It will clarify its position. In moneys transmitted from the Parliament to the Commission where capital is properly identified the Commission will be in a position to relate its accounts more accurately in the performance of its operations and to remove some of the doubt that has been spread from time to time by opponents of publicly owned transport enterprises. </para><para>Clause 14 deals with the power of the Minister to determine the dividend to be paid to the Commonwealth. Clause 15 puts ANL borrowings on the same basis as those of the private sector and provides that approvals for loans to be raised be required only from the Treasurer and not from the Minister for Transport as at present. Clause 17 gives the Minister power to determine disposal of the balance of ANL profits for the financial year. Clause 1 8 deals with taxation liability. It puts the Commission in the same position as private shipping companies. I do not think there is much difference at all in actual practice in the tax rates that are paid by the Commission or other charges that are applicable. As I understand it, if statutory authorities are not required to pay a local rate or charge they usually make an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment in respect of the cost anyway. But this provision puts the matter in a clear way. No doubt as a result of intrastate operations in Queensland following the passage of this legislation, State charges will become involved and that clause will clarify the position in that respect. </para><para>In the total multi-modal Australian transport system shipping has a major role to play in the future as in the past and the stronger emphasis on long distance bulk freight which has been developing recently is likely to continue. As sea transport is the most efficient of all forms of transport in energy terms, the rapid increase in energy costs means its importance will grow. The industry has seen rapid acceleration of technical change in the post-war years. New developments in ship designs have revolutionised the means of transporting cargoes by sea. Cargo trade has seen the arrival of bulk carriers and capital intensive unit cargo ships designed to carry general cargo in vehicular, container and barge loads. In addition, there have been roll-on roll-off ships, utilisation of cargo pallets, pre-slung loads, LASH ships and hybrid vessels. </para><para>These developments have meant that ships are no longer designed for one particular carriage function and consequently are no longer tied to its relative trading success. To meet these changes in shipping and cargo handling changes have to be made to modernise on-shore cargo handling. The planning of port development and re-development must increasingly respond to these changes in technology in shipping taking into account the movement of goods to other transport functions for movement on land. Whilst there have been rapid improvements in sea transport technology and rapid increases in the tonnage carried, improvements still need to be made in relation to the amounts carried in Australian ships. </para><para>The next Labor Government will expand the operations of the Australian Shipping Commission to ensure that an equitable share of our trade is carried in Australian-owned and manned vessels. To achieve this objective the Commission will be enabled to build, purchase or charter sufficient vessels to carry out that task. It will also seek to ensure that all coastal trade will be carried in Australian-owned and manned vessels. </para><para>Much has been said in recent times, particularly in relation to Utah, about the carriage of our bulk ores from Australia to their markets. I mentioned earlier the problems in delay of tins legislation because of the Queensland Government. I shall come back to that. I want to point out the kind of figures that we are dealing with when we are talking about bulk trades from Australia. In 1975-76 we shipped 62 million tonnes of ore to Japan and 6.5 million tonnes elsewhere. We shipped 25.5 million tonnes of coal to Japan and 5.7 million tonnes elsewhere. In total 87.5 million tonnes of ore and coal went to Japan and 12.2 million tonnes went elsewhere. A total of 99.7 million tonnes of ore and coal went from Australia. That was a decrease of 20.7 million tonnes on the previous year, 1974-75, due no doubt to the downturn in world steel production. </para><para>Currently the ANL vessels <inline font-style="italic">Australian Pioneer</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Australian Prospector</inline> are engaged in bulk ore trade to Japan. jointly they have a capacity to transport 5 per cent of the 1975-76 ore trade or 2.85 per cent of total bulk trade in 1975-76. We know that ANL has two other carriers on order and that they are due for delivery later during this financial year and that negotiations with the Japanese steel mills for the utilisation of those vessels will commence in early 1978. Australian flag vessels have 26 per cent of the northbound general cargo trade to Japan and 24 per cent of southbound cargoes. Under an agreement between members of the Australia- Japan Shipping Conference 30 per cent of cargo each way is expected to be carried in Australian flag vessels by 1979. Article X of the recent basic treaty of friendly relations between Japan and Australia which was signed in August of this year deals with shipping arrangements between Japan and Australia but unfortunately it seems that the Government to date has done little to fill out the guidelines and the detailed objectives of that article. I base that comment on an answer to a question on notice on this subject I received from the Minister recently. Australia is a significant trading nation and it is important to establish its own flag carriers so that it is not wholly dependent on foreign shipping companies. </para><para>I refer to what is happening in the United States of America at the moment. As I said earlier, a dispute has occurred in Queensland with Utah. Naturally seamen are looking to the contracting employment opportunities in Australia which have been projected from all arts of the economic spectrum and the possibility that employment will reduce rather than increase in the coming years. It is perfectly natural to expect people employed in an industry to look for job security and for an increasing opportunity for employment in the future. That is apart from any other aspects that are involved. As recently as a few days ago I received a letter which pointed out to me a statement which had been credited to Utah. The statement reads: </para><quote>
            <para>Utah will not employ Australian crews on their overseas vessels, but are prepared to charter the two Australian National Line bulk carriers in the trade. But unfortunately if Utah go ahead with this proposal, the Premier will increase the tax levy on the coal. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">The Premier referred to is the Premier of Queensland. I do not think there is any doubt about the veracity of the statement. In May of this year the Premier of Queensland told Utahthis is on record in a number of national journalsthat if Utah negotiated with the Seamen's Union of Australia on the utilisation of Australian seamen in the bulk ore traffic out of Australia, royalties on the company's coal production will be increased. That is a direct political threat. It is another example of what I have referred to on many occasions, both inside and outside this House- of attacks, by the National Country Party more particularly than by the Liberal Party, on the trade union movement, and particularly the unions involved in the transport industry, as a substitute for a political argument. It is the old story of bashing the unions. There may be some substance in some of the problems to which attention is drawn but that is not the way in which to go about it Bashing the transport unions costs the consumers of this country money; it costs the workers their wages, it costs companies a loss of profits, and it damages our trading reputation. </para><para>There is no doubt in my mind, having had discussions earlier in the year, that when this matter was raised originally the Seamen's Union would have been quite happy to open negotiations. Negotiations could have proceeded on the ultimate involvement of Australian traffic. But, after all, is it not reasonable and natural that Australians would want a greater share in the wealth which is derived from Australian resources? Are we not Australians? Or are some of the people who sit opposite temporary dwellers from another country who are more interested in disposing of the wealth of this country as quickly and as cheaply as possible, and in taking thenpro fits and getting out as quickly as they possibly can? </para><para>I turn now to the American situation. I understand that President Carter has a Bill before the Congress or the Senate- I think it is before the Senate- at the moment requiring that 9.5 per cent of oil imported into America be transported in American tankers. There are two reasons for that and they are set out in an article which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Newsweek</inline> of 17 October. One reason being advanced by the Assistant Sec- 'retary of the United States Commerce Department, Robert J. Blackwell, is this: </para><quote>
            <para>US-flag tankers manned by US citizens are likely to be more reliable (in national emergencies) than foreign-flag tankers. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">America is not an island, as is Australia. This brings us back to the importance and relevance of the Australian shipbuilding industry, as was recognised in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on that industry. We are an island continent. I think it would be completely irresponsible for any government, any political party, to plan the future transport policy for this country on the basis of placing the transportation of our export products and the transportation of our imports completely in the hands of foreign-owned vessels. That would mean that we would have no control over who makes shipping available and who will not make it available. </para><para>At the present time we are enjoying a luxury period. There is a surplus of world shipping. World shipping rates have dropped and spot shipping rates out of Australia are very cheap. That situation will not continue because ultimately the world economy will experience an upturn. When that occurs the whole shipping scene will change and once again Australia will be at the mercy of overseas shipping companies. The United States has recognised that fact. The second reason advanced by the Assistant Secretary, Robert J. Blackwell is this: </para><quote>
            <para>The fundamental justification for a limited level of cargo preference is to provide assured employment . . . </para>
          </quote><para class="block">He then went on to mention US-flag tankers. Again that situation is relevant to the Australian context. We have record unemployment. If a way can be found in which to provide greater job opportunities for Australians on Australiancontrolled vessels, we ought to be following that line. Instead of that, the Premier of Queensland is using the Seamen's Union and the other five maritime unions to try to create a political issue out of this matter for the State election. The community is divided. Instead of reasonable and factual arguments being advanced, we have political union bashing and political bluster. The result is that we are disadvantaged. Australia ought to be ensuring that in the long term we have adequate transport capacity to ship our goods overseas and to bring in our imports. </para><para>What I am saying is that we should be looking at this time at those areas of shipping activity that can be identified as being a potential market. We should be identifying those areas, identifying the kinds of vessels that could be used, and men going on to determine the manner in which those vessels could be purchased and the method by which they could be manned. Manning scales is the argument that is put up over and over again by the Minister for Transport- he is not present at the table but he ought to be present- and his party. I am quite satisfied that the matter of manning scales is negotiable. I am satisfied also that there is a downward trend in that regard. </para><para>In speaking of crewing costs, I want to refer to the latest report of the Australian Shipping Commission which runs the Australian National Line. It is the 1977 report. First of all, I congratulate the Commission on achieving in most difficult times a profit of $3.9m after exchange movements have been taken into account. I will not go into the detail of the report, but I wish to mention that much of that profit was derived from overseas trading by Australian-owned and Australianmanned vessels. We hear much criticism about the use of Australian crews on bulk ore carriers, but the people who make that criticism do not say anything about the cartels, the conference lines, which operate. In those cartels in which the ANL operates- I mentioned earlier the Australia- Japan conference line- the rates charged are standard rates and the Australian ships do very well, thank you very much. I refer to page 19 of the Commission's report which points out that crewing costs of the Line are down to 16 per cent. Those costs have decreased from about 21 per cent in 1974-75, 18.5 per cent in 1975-76, and 16 per cent in 1976-77. That shows that the reduction in crewing costs has been a continuing trend. There is no nice, simple way in which we can compare vessels. I have here a report prepared by the Parliamentary Library on stevedoring costs and shipping costs. It states: </para><quote>
            <para>There is a remarkable lack of published information on ship operating costs. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">It goes on to mention public inquiries which have had difficulty in obtaining information, including the Rochdale Committee of Inquiry into shipping conducted in England in 1970. It noted as follows: </para><quote>
            <para>In contrast to the extensive data on labour costs which is publicly available for many other industries, little is available for shipping. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I would like to reply to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> prior to the suspension of the sitting. He sought to blame politics for the Australian Shipping Commission Amendment Bill now going through the House. He said also that the matter had been handled recently in the Queensland Parliament. He did not give any credit to anyone in this Government for being sympathetic towards people who live in faraway places. We saw examples of this lack of thought during the term of office of the Labor Government. Since the shadow Minister for Transport took it upon himself to stress that this is a political measure, I think I would be quite entitled to speak similarly on the subject. If it is a political measure, the people who should receive the credit are the honourable member for Leichhardt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> and the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> for the work that they have done in convincing the Federal Government and, needless to say, the State Government to put through legislation to assist people in their part of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I noticed that the honourable member for Shortland seemed to assume that all members of the Government parties attack government transport instrumentalities, organisations or operations. I can assure him that people who live in faraway places get on well with the Australian National Line, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian National Railways. They are the vital links between our part of the country and the businesses in cities further to the south. In that regard I also mention Qantas Airways Ltd. There was a time in Darwin when it appeared that TAA would take over the operations of Qantas. That was just after the tragic cyclone in 1974. 1 was very much opposed to that move because I think Qantas is a very well organised and a very fine operator. I think all Australians should be proud of Qantas as our flag carrier. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Shortland also said that Labor would do certain things. He is assuming that Labor will win the election. I will not go into that matter because I know it will not. He said that Labor would provide help here and help there. This Bill provides assistance to north Queensland in that it allows the ANL to operate interstate. We must remember that the Labor Party when it was in office acted against places such as north Queensland and the Northern Territory by implementing the Coombs report, just to mention one thing. That report did more damage than any other document to enterprise, development, business and faith in the primary industries of our hinterland. So I feel that he was just politicking because of the Queensland election which is to be held at the end of this week. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Shortland accused members on our side of the Parliament of union bashing. He blithely overlooked the militant unionism in recent happenings which cost hundreds of millions of dollars and which put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. Because we in government do not take very lightly to this sort of behaviour by the militant unions we are accused of union bashing. It really should be called public or private citizen bashing. </para>
          <para>While on the subject of the ANL, I remind the honourable member that it was a brainchild of the former great leader of this Party and  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen. He decided that Australia had to get into the business of overseas shipping. In those days we were at the mercy, to a great extent, of overseas shipping cartels. At that time the Australian Government considered that it should find out, from practical experience, the operations and management of shipping services. That is some of the background. </para>
          <para>The main thrust of the Bill is to give the ANL the right to carry on interstate services and to enable it, in the interests of people in north Queensland, up and down the Queensland coast and the far north, to get into operation as soon as possible. Now that the Queensland Government has legislated in this direction the ANL can get in on this trade and can provide a service to people who live in remote areas, although they are on the coast. In this case, as in others, where the State considers it necessary, there shall be equal competition. The Bill provides that the ANL will not gain any advantage over the private shipping companies. There will be equal opportunity. The Bill seeks to expand section  17  of the Act to entitle the Australian Shipping Commission, if it is directed to operate a certain service for the public and if such a service is run at a loss, to have that loss made good. This privilege is not available to the private shipping services. The Minister is obliged to inquire into alternative services, whether they are other shipping services or air services. In many cases they could not be road services. The substitute form of service may need assistance. </para>
          <para>In spite of that proviso being written into the Act, I am concerned that this operation could- I reservedly say 'could'- be used to push private shipowners out of business. This opinion is in direct contrast with the opinion of the honourable member for Shortland who argued that the private shipowners could, under this Act, be used by the Minister to raise costs so that ANL would have to follow the private shipowners and would be hard put to run an economic service. That is the way he sees it, and this is the way I see it. I am a private enterprise supporter, and of course he is all for government ownership or socialism generally. I am concerned, and I would like someone to assure me on that point. No doubt the honourable member would like an assurance also. </para>
          <para>I notice that under proposed section  17a  the Commission will be required to operate in a similar fashion to private shipping services in that it will be required to pay dividends, to pay interest on moneys borrowed and to pay taxes. Although the residents of north Queensland will benefit from this ANL service, I have a shadow of a doubt in my mind about whether it will operate to the detriment of the part of the world from which I come. The ANL vessel <inline font-style="italic">Darwin Trader</inline> serves the port of Darwin on a regular basis. I trust that the implementation of this legislation will not affect detrimentally the operations of that ship and that Line to that part of Australia. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) Bill 1977 is to cover the payment of financial assistance to the States for transport planning and research. The appropriation of 8m for disbursement to the States is provided by Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1977-78. The Bill continues financial assistance to the States on a $2 for $ 1 basis for the current financial year only. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> stated m his second reading speech that funding would be on a dollar for dollar basis in 1978-79 and 1979-80. No mention is made of this change in the Bill. Once again this represents a reduction in Federal assistance to the States, particularly in respect of planning and research. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The $8m provided in the 1976-77 Budget for transport planning and research represented a fall in cash terms of $700,000 on the amount provided in 1975-76- a fall in real terms of 16 per cent. The Fraser Government's 1977-78 allocation of $8m is in effect a 12 per cent fall in real terms on the 1976-77 figure. So one can say that there has been a substantial reduction in real terms in the level of funding by the Federal Government for the purposes provided for under this legislation between 1975-76 and the current financial year. The Whitlam Government provided the States with $26m over the triennium from 1974-75 to 1976-77 for transport research. The Fraser Government has provided $24m for the next triennium, maybe. I will return to that a little later in my remarks, in the analysis of the level of funds that may be provided in 1978-79 and 1979-80. A comparison of the amounts provided in this triennium with the amount provided by the Whitlam Government in the first three years that the legislation operated shows a fall in real terms of the order of 50 per cent. </para>
          <para>The Bill essentially continues the arrangements provided in the Transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974. It also is designed to refine certain administrative aspects of the Act to take account of minor alterations which needed to be made following the successful first triennium of the Act. In introducing the 1974 legislation the </para>
          <para class="block">Minister for Transport at the time, the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is a major need for more sophisticated planning and research in Australia in regard to all transport modes. The provision of assistance under this Act will be directed towards developing in the States more comprehensive processes than hitherto existed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Whitlam Government's Transport (Planning and Research) Act was the first significant move by an Australian government towards assessing Australia's transport research potential, towards collecting and exchanging information between the authorities undertaking research and organisations involved in transport planning, and towards improving the coordination and efficiency of Australia s transport research and planning capabilities. Consequently, the Act recognised the range of transport resources existing in Australia at both State and Federal levels in government departments and authorities and in tertiary institutions. It also recognised the need not only to achieve co-ordination between these sources of information but also to identify the many areas of common interest and to establish objectives for future transport research. </para>
          <para>The research and planning program allows transport planners to draw on the skills of a range of associated disciplines such as sociology economics and environmental science. The Act was aimed at encouraging and ensuring that Australia's transport is developed to take account of the technical and social changes taking place in the Australian community. The program's continued success and effectiveness are dependent on continued co-operation and coordination between the States and the Australian Government. On 24 August 1976 the Minister for Transport tabled the report on the first 18 months of the operation of the 1974 Act. The report detailed 500 projects covering a broad range of items, including traffic management, cycle safety and planning, motor vehicle design, transport provisions for handicapped travellers, school bus safety, and public transport noise, freight and management. </para>
          <para>Under the Whitlam Labor Government's legislation, financial assistance was provided to the States for research into road safety. This allocation was in recognition of the important role the States had to play in this area. The Australian Labor Party Government established a road safety authority to foster research into this important area, to advance consumer protection in relation to motor vehicles, and to promote road safety issues. By contrast, in the first six months of the Fraser Government the authority was abolished and the Government undertook to establish an office of road safety. I understand that to the moment the office of road safety has not been established because of wrangling within the Department and wrangling between the Department and the Government over the manning of the office of road safety. </para>
          <para>The substantial reduction in funds provided for in this legislation is a further indication of the low priority accorded to road safety issues by the present Government. One intention of the Labor Government's legislation was to broaden the scope of transport research so as to consider each transport mode in relation to other modes as a part of the entire transport task. To obtain the optimum results we need to achieve an optimum inter-modal mix of all transport modes, and particularly roads and urban public transport. To this end, Labor's transport research legislation ensured that urban public transport projects were considered in relation to road projects. The Bill before the House continues this approach and extends the provisions of the legislation so as to include planning and research into all land transport modes as well as the inter-relationship between land and other transport functions. In addition, the planning and research programs allows adequate consideration of options before a proposal requiring major public investment is undertaken. It also allows for reappraisal or modification of a program before its completion. </para>
          <para>Research which will be funded under this Bill when it becomes an Act in areas such as urban public transport may produce projects which could be funded under the Urban Public Transport Agreement of 1974. It also may provide areas which could be funded under the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program under a section of the States Grants (Roads) Act 1977. In assessing a program to be funded under this Act, continued emphasis needs to be given to projects which identify and assess the future allocation of transport resources in Australia and developments in policy that impinge on transport planning. This involves the continuing changes that are taking place in Australia's population, the changes that are taking place in the way Australians want to live and also where they want to live, the interdependence of transport modes, the declining sources of fossil fuels, the increasing need to seek out alternative sources of energy and alternative forms of transport, and the resource requirements of time, space, loss of life and damage caused by pollution. The research and planning program needs to continue to assist in overcoming the problems associated with harmonising State and Federal transport undertakings to give proper consideration to the difficulties arising in transport issues and to help to make adequate plans for future transport policymaking. </para>
          <para>As I said, the Bill is in essence a continuation of the original Act, the Transport and Planning Research Act 1974, introduced by the Whitlam Government and by the then Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charles</inline> Jones. The amendments to it in terms of simplification of administrative arrangements and expansion to take in research into all land transport modes the Opposition believes are desirable and it does not oppose the Bill. </para>
          <para>I do, however, want to offer criticism of the level of funding provided under the Bill. I refer to the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport. Unless one reads closely the concluding sentence of that speech, one is very apt to misunderstand the real meaning of the sentence. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We recognise that continuity of funding is very important in a program like this and we have already told the States that for 1978-79 and 1979-80 we are prepared to contribute our share on a dollar for dollar basis of a total program - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the words 'total program'- maintained at the 1977-78 level in real terms. </para>
          <para class="block">One would think at first sight that that meant that since $8m has been provided this year, the subsequent vote under this Act, in each of the following two years, would be $8m in real terms at 1977 prices and expressed in whatever amount that equals in 1978-79 or 1979-80. But that is not the case. We need to remember that the Minister stated also that the funding for this year was on a $2 for $1 basis. So on a two for one basis this year, the Federal Government is providing $8m. The States ' share would be $4m. So the total program of funding for planning and research, State and Federal combined, in the current year is $12m. We recall that the Minister also mentioned in his speech- and it is mentioned in the Bill- that funding for the next two years will be on a dollar for dollar basis. This means then that since $ 12m is the total program for this year, the Federal Government's share of that total program- the maximum limit to it- will be $6m in each of the years 1978-79 and 1979-80. If we take those two years together, the total maximum commitment of $6m for each of those two years is $12m. Adding to that amount the $8m for this year, the total amount is $20m. So the triennium funding expressed in 1977 prices is $20m compared with the sum of $26m provided in the triennium 1974-77 under the Whitlam program. Quite clearly this is further evidence of the phasing out of safety aspects, and more particularly of research and planning. </para>
          <para>The Bill is a major step in a phasing out of Federal Government commitment to transport and planning research. In the first instance there is the reduction of funding from a $2 for $1 basis to a $1 for $1 basis. </para>

          <para>I should like to mention at the same time another area of activity in the Department of Transport that in a way relates to that, that is, the Bureau of Roads. Here again is an organisation carrying out research activities in many ways into Australia's road needs and recommending to government the level of financial assistance that ought to be given to the States for the construction, upgrading and maintenance of roads. Linked to that is the Government's decision, which I mentioned earlier, to abolish the independent authority known as the Road Safety and Standards Authority. Activities under the Transport and Planning Research Act, the Bureau of Roads and the Road Safety and Standards Authority are all related in that they deal in the main with roads, the use of roads, and the use of associated transport facilities, particularly passenger transport. In each of those three areas there has been a substantial downgrading by the present Government in terms of funding and of priority. I take this opportunity to assure the House that the next Labor Government would be acting quite promptly to restore to road safety and to road transport planning and research the proper financial priority to which safety measures, particularly roads, are entitled. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">Morris), the Bill before the House- the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) Bill 1977- is a further clear demonstration of the Fraser Government's commitment to provide an effective transport system for the Australian people, and particularly of its commitment to overcome the problems of urban transport in developing outer suburbs such as are found in the southern half of the Kingston electorate. This commitment to solving urban transport problems has been evident in the last two Budgets presented by the Fraser Government. Funds provided for urban public transport in those two Budgets give the lie to claims by the Australian Labor Party for partisan political purposes in a pamphlet which it circulated recently in the southern areas of the Kingston electorate. </para>
          <para>This Bill is a further demonstration of the Fraser Government's concern for urban transport. It continues and extends arrangements for section 96 grants to the States for land transport planning and research and provides $8m for the 1977-78 financial year for various projects undertaken by State governments. That funding is provided on a two for one basis, with $2 being provided by the Commonwealth for every $1 provided by the State government involved in such a project. The Bill broadens the scope of assistance to cover all forms of land transport and the relationship of land transport to other modes of transport. In accord with the Government's commitment to federalism, the legislation gives the States greater flexibility in implementing and managing their planning and research projects. The Commonwealth Government will approve and provide funds for a total State program rather than for each individual project. The States will have the power to allocate funds between the various individual projects. Hence power and responsibility are being handed back to the level of government closest to the people. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Government will continue to provide co-ordination to ensure the elimination of duplication of research and will establish a forum for discussion and comparison of programs. A key role of the Commonwealth Government will be the dissemination of information obtained under the program through annual progress reports and final project reports and combination of this information with information also provided by its own authorities and information gained from related international research programs. Programs of transport planning and research have thus far been a successful co-operative effort between Commonwealth and State governments. Advantages have accrued to both sides which would not have been possible otherwise. I refer to several projects conducted in South Australia which indicate the benefits flowing to the community from this allocation of Federal Government funds. A project of major significance, which has been given number one priority by the South Australian Government in its applications for funds and which draws the major proportion of funds, has been the joint North-east Area Public Transport Review and the Modbury Corridor Technology Evaluation. A primary objective of this study, which began some 18 months ago, is to determine the public transport investment required to form part of the total transport system for the north eastern suburbs of Adelaide to fulfil their needs in the next decade, and also to provide a planning basis for the next 20 to 30 years. </para>
          <para>According to the South Australian Department of Transport, when it launched this project in March 1976 it had no preconceived notions of the correct answer to public transport investment in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. The State Government promised the highest level of public participation in the decision-making process ever attempted by planners in Australia. According to this proposal, planners have been seeking active involvement of the people for whom the planning has been undertaken. This is regarded as a revolutionary approach to transport planning. NEAPTR has involved a whole range of detailed research projects. These include population trends, movement patterns and land use. Public meetings have been held to obtain the views of the public with regard to their own needs, explain alternative proposals and to seek the views of the public on them. Considerable publicity in the media has been engendered throughout the development of this project. </para>
          <para>Part of the function of the project in determining the best way of fulfilling the transport needs of the people of the north-eastern suburbs has been to assess and balance the disadvantages caused to one group of residents by the benefits given to another group- for example, the effect of the extra noise in suburbs Uke Walkerville and St Peters caused by the extra and faster traffic flow needed by residents of the outerlying suburbs of Tea Tree Gully or the conflict between residents confronted with a new bus route redirected down their street and residents in the next street who benefit from that new service. This study is supposed to have been based on the principle that much of the information which is relevant to any decision is not held by experts but by ordinary people in the community. It is local people who understand local problems, their own specific needs and how their own community works. </para>
          <para>Notwithstanding these claims, significant criticism has been made of the NEAPTR project. The State Government owns much of the land along the possible high speed Modbury Corridor, providing a compelling financial reason for the final decision concerning transport for the area to favour that route. The critics believe that the public outcry which accompanied the original acquisition program for this corridor would be repeated if a different route is chosen. Hence NEAPTR has been condemned as a mere public relations operations, with the results of the inquiry a foregone conclusion and private consultants having been engaged to present the inquiry to the community. Apparently public meetings called by NEAPTR, supposedly to engender public discussion, have been poorly advertised and cancelled at short notice. Critics have condemned the State Government and NEAPTR as dishonest in their investigations and presentation of material. </para>
          <para>Personally, I do not have sufficiently detailed knowledge of the project to adjudicate these criticisms. However, some of the conclusions of the study which have recently received publicity may give some substance to them. Certainly it appears that the Modbury Corridor will be used to establish an express busway or tramway. Also of concern is the proposal to reserve a traffic lane on the Main North-east Road for buses in peak hour traffic. Even the State Minister of Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> admits that this may have a detrimental effect on the traffic flow of motor vehicles. Whatever initiatives occur in the expansion of public transport faculties, the motor car will remain the preferred means of transport for the great bulk of the community. A squeezeoutthemotorist campaign through withdrawing access to traffic lanes will only compound rather than solve our current transport problems. </para>
          <para>In view of the fact that two-thirds of the funds for this project-that is, some $356,462 out of a total cost of $534,754- since its inception have been provided by the Commonwealth Government, I believe that the Commonwealth Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> should investigate these criticisms to ensure that these significant sums of Commonwealth money are being spent wisely for the benefit of the community. Despite these criticisms, I believe that the information gleaned by the NEAPTR research is of great value in planning effectively for the transport needs of the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. This is particularly so with regard to the need for cross-suburban transport routes in Adelaide, an issue which I have raised previously in this House. </para>
          <para>One criticism which I believe has some validity is that top priority in transport research should have been given to the southern areas within the Marion and Noarlunga council areas instead of to the north-eastern suburbs. No doubt the State Labor Government has ignored the transport needs of the people of these areas, and the residents of the Kingston electorate, for political purposes. Negligence of the southern areas by the State Government is confirmed by the fact that it is conducting this NEAPTR research project in preference to research into overcoming the transport problems of suburbs such as O'Halloran Hill, Morphett Vale, Reynella, Christies Beach and Port Noarlunga. </para>

              <para>- This is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> again. As I said a moment ago, no doubt there are political motivations behind the decision to conduct research in the north-eastern suburbs rather than in the southern areas. Whilst the north-eastern residents will have the luxury of a full transport program established on the basis of detailed research, the residents of the south will be left lamenting with a few cosmetic changes which were hastily introduced before the last State election. </para>

              <para>- As the honourable member for Mitchell says, it is a shame. Two other projects in South Australia which have been funded under this Commonwealth legislation are research into the viability of an electrically powered vehicle and also a steam powered vehicle. In an era of declining energy resources, particularly declining liquid hydrocarbon fuels, these two projects are of great significance to our future transport requirements. The Commonwealth has provided $2 1 ,642 out of a total cost of $32,662 for the electric car project and $12,826 out of a total cost of $19,241 for the steam car project. One thing that concerns me is that further funds for these two projects have not been provided this year. The South Australian Government did not see fit to give them sufficiently high priority in its list of projects submitted to the Commonwealth Government for funding to obtain an allocation of funds for them. Of even greater concern is the attempt by the State Labor Government to blame the Commonwealth Government for the lack of continued funding for these projects. The plain fact is that the State Government placed these projects way down on its list of priorities so that even with the very generous funds provided by the Commonwealth Government they did not get a guernsey. By contrast, the NEAPTR project has been given number 1 priority in submissions and therefore funding has continued. These are three rejects of nearly one hundred conducted in South Australia with Commonwealth funds under the terms of the previous legislation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Bill now before the House will continue that program and that funding. The Commonwealth Government in this way is making a very significant contribution to fulfilling the transport needs of South Australians but the South Australian Labor Government and the Minister of Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> stand condemned for one aspect of their use of these funds. Each of the projects which I have mentioned in some detail has received considerable media publicity in South Australia initiated by the State Government. NEAPTR in particular has been publicised in special lift-out features in several of Adelaide's newspapers, in particular the two major daily newspapers in that city, but the only mention of the Commonwealth Government has been the misrepresentation about the funding of the electric and steam cars and the criticism of the Commonwealth Government associated with that misrepresentation. I note that the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> is nodding his head. Obviously he is aware of that misrepresentation. </para>
          <para>In not one of the many statements on these projects which have been used in the great wad of newspaper articles, some of which I have here, has any mention been made of the Commonwealth Government and the fact that two-thirds of the money for these projects has been provided by the Commonwealth Government. Publicity has been used purely for the purpose of self- aggrandisement of the State Labor Government and the State Minister of Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo. Mr Virgo</inline> has been ever ready to misrepresent the Fraser Government. It is about time he gave some credit where it is due. As I mentioned, a moment ago, the plain fact is that the Commonwealth Government has provided $356,462 out of $534,754 spent on NEAPTR; $21,642 out of $32,662 spent on the electric car and $12,826 out of $19,241 spent on the steam car, as well as two-thirds of the cost of the many other projects, which, as I mentioned, number nearly one hundred. </para>
          <para>It is the Commonwealth Government which has made these projects possible through its generous provision of funds, not the Dunstan Labor Government on its own, as it would attempt to have us believe through media publicity. The South Australian people should be aware of this in view of the barrage of misrepresentations that have been initiated by the Dunstan Government about the Commonwealth Government over the last two years. The transport planning and research program has provided a good example of CommonwealthState co-operation. Let that co-operation and the major Commonwealth involvement in it be acknowledged at the State level, as it is here. This Bill will enable that co-operation to continue and ensure the effective use of resources. It is about time that the State Government, and also the Labor Party in this place, recognised the contribution that is being made by the Fraser Government to public transport projects. </para>
          <para>I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that a leaflet had been distributed recently in the southern part of the Kingston electorate which misrepresented the situation in regard to Commonwealth funding for urban transport. </para>

              <para>- Yes. They do it all the time. This year urban public transport will benefit through the provision of $51m, as against $58m last year. The pamphlet was designed to convince the electors of Kingston that there had been a massive slashing of funds by the Commonwealth Government. The pamphlet listed as an achievement of the Fraser Liberal Government the fact that less money had been provided to the States for programs such as public transport programs. The funding which I mentioned a moment ago, $51m, is in fact a minor reduction of some 12 per cent in the 1977-78 Budget over the 1976-77 Budget, not the 21 per cent which was claimed in the heading on that pamphlet which was distributed. </para>

              <para>-The way they misrepresent the Commonwealth Government's funding of projects in that State is a scandal. Given the need to restrain government spending, which has stemmed from the previous Labor Government's extravagance, this is a commendable effort. As I said, it shows that the Fraser Government still gives a high priority to urban public transport needs. The slight reduction m the Budget this year is in comparison with the Fraser Government's Budget of the year before. The inference in that pamphlet is that the Fraser Government has slashed spending on urban public transport in comparison with the previous </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Labor Government. The heading of that pamphlet is therefore grossly misleading. Add.tionally, the assertion in the pamphlet that the Fraser Government is providing less money for urban public transport is a downright lie. The $5 8m provided in the 1976-77 Budget was nearly twice as much money for urban public transport as that provided in the last Labor Budget of the year before. Fortunately for all Australians that will be the last Budget the Labor Party has a chance to bring down in this place for many years to come. </para>
          <para>As I have mentioned already, a further $51m has been provided for these transport projects in the current Budget. This includes $5m specifically committed as the Commonwealth Government's contribution to new projects in 1977-78. It should be noted that this is the first allocation of Commonwealth funds for new works under this scheme since 1974. It is also the only money allocated to new projects of any type over the whole range of government expenditure in the 1977-78 Budget. This initiation of new projects contrasts with the Labor Party's performance in government in 1975 and the misleading claims about which I have spoken. It shows that the Liberal-National Country Party Government cares about people who are dependent on public transport. Hence in two years in office the Liberal-National Country Party Government has provided $109m for urban public transport. This is 40 per cent more than the previous Labor Government provided in three years. This point should be emphasised. The $109m provided by the Fraser Government in two years is 40 per cent more than the Labor Government provided in three years. This shows how the Fraser Government has given a higher priority to this area than the previous Labor Government. During a period of necessary restraint on government spending and cutbacks in spending m many areas of spending the Government has increased funding in areas of real need such as urban public transport. It is providing much more money at a time of restraint than Labor saw fit to give in its era of free, easy and uncontrolled government spending which caused our economic problems. Whether one looks at the Bill now before the House or at the overall Budget allocation for urban public transport, one sees that the Government is definite in its commitments and has provided the funds for the States to get on with the job. Certainly this piece of legislation, the Transport Planning and Research (Financial Assistance) Bill, will continue that funding in a very special area and will continue the opportunity for the </para>
          <para class="block">States to conduct research on a two for one basis next year and on a 50/50 funding basis thereafter. I commend the Bill to the House and urge its speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-This Bill is to be supported because it is quite certain that the Australian transport system needs replanning and research for replanning. There has been a good deal of talk in the past and I think it is unfortunate that so little practical result has emerged from it. I wish to speak on one or two things which could and should be done. Let me remind the House, firstly, that Australia is a country of great distances and where transport costs are very heavy. Secondly, Australia along with other countries shortly is going to face a crisis in liquid fuel. Thirdly, Australia has at the present moment unused resources of labour and materials which could be used now to provide the economies in fuel for the future. In other words, what we are doing now in failing to use our resources of men and materials- these years of the locust can never be recovered- does prevent us in the future redressing our balance on current account difficulties through the costs of importing liquid fuels and the difficulties of buying oil abroad. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me come firstly to railways. At the outset we must do something about the SydneyMelbourne line. Considering the volume of traffic that it carries and could carry, that line is a national disgrace. I refer to the section between Junee and Kapooka. Honourable members will recall that between Sydney and Junee there is a double line but at Kapooka this contracts to a single line to Albury- a single line which has to carry not only interstate traffic but also a good deal of local traffic for the Wagga-Albury district. That line is made more difficult by the fact that it has the nasty descent to the Murrumbidgee River which the line crosses at Wagga, and of course the line has to go up again after crossing the river. So the first thing to look at surely is that section from Junee to Kapooka- 20 or 30 miles. This single line should be duplicated in such a way that the uphill grades are eased. This can be done, of course, by using the new line one way up and one way down and using the old line in the same way. Then there is the section from </para>
          <para class="block">Kapooka to Albury. This is a relatively flat and easy section. I am not certain at this present moment whether it would be better to duplicate that or whether it would be better to put in a centralised train control. I am inclined to think that the former is the better, considering the volume of traffic which can and should be carried on it. </para>
          <para>The next piece of alignment to be considered is in Sydney itself. Honourable members will recall how that southern line snakes out and follows a winding course to Liverpool. The southern line should go out via East Hills and cross the George's River twice and rejoin the existing main line at about Macquarie Fields. There is only about five or six miles in it. There are two bridges over the George's River. This would save an immense amount of trouble and bring quite tremendous economies. I have talked about the route of that line. It should also be considered not only in respect of horizontal curves and grades but in respect of vertical curves also. This used not to be important when short trains were running, but when long trains are running the vertical curves and a change in grade are of quite significant technical importance. That line needs looking at. </para>
          <para>That line carries only a small proportion of the goods traffic between Sydney and Melbourne. When I was in England recently I was talking to experts on road-rail traffic and when I told them that there was 600 miles of line between Melbourne and Sydney but still well over half of the goods traffic went by road they could not believe it. It seemed to them utterly incredible because even in England where there is the long haul from London to Glasgow- I think it is of the order of 400 miles- the predominant traffic still goes by rail, not by road although there are the freeways and all the advantages that the roads in England have over the roads here. It is absolutely incredible that so much of the goods traffic between Melbourne and Sydney still goes by road. It is an indictment on the efficiency of our railways. </para>
          <para>Then one thinks particularly of the terminals and the way in which containers and other goods are handled at these terminals. I know that one company- Thomas Nationwide Transport Pty Ltd- has made some effort to deal with this. It is, I think, the only company and its efforts are by no means commensurate with the need to get the railways working efficiently. It is not just a question of the physical layout of the terminal; it is also a question of the handling of trains and trucks at the terminal and the co-ordination of the two. Again when I was in Europe recently I had a careful look at what was being done there and I can assure the House that the Australian practices are years and years out of date. </para>
          <para>Let me come to the next point about railwayselectrification. When we changed from coal to diesel locomotives we did it for very good reason, namely, that diesel was much more economical. At that time we did not know what the Arabs were going to do to us about oil prices and supplies, but still we made the change and it is paying off but we should be going back to using indigenous fuel, and that means the electrification of main railway lines. </para>
          <para>Let me speak particularly of New South Wales where the first priority is the line between Sydney and Melbourne. That line is already electrified between Sydney and Campbelltown. Electrification of that line should be extended as far as Albury. Of course the Sydney to Brisbane line, which is already electrified as far as Gosford, should go via Maitland to pick up the Newcastle links, and the Newcastle system itself should be electrified. Another line which certainly is overdue for electrification is the line from Maitland to Werris Creek. I put this to the House because electrification is particularly desirable where a line has either heavy traffic or heavy grades, or both, because the electric locomotive running on an outside power source is the ideal animal to deal with the heavy grades. If that line is electrified over the hills into Werris Creek it would deal with the main needs of that area as far as efficient rail transport is concerned. Of course we have to think of the Hunter Valley and we have to think of the new systems which are going to go in by reason of the very great increase in coal development in that area, and this proposal that I make will serve them. </para>
          <para>Let me turn to the line from Lithgow to Parkes. The line is electrified over the Blue Mountains where there are compensating grades, I think, still of one-m-thirty three- one of the heaviest main line grades in the world. Between Lithgow and Parkes the line gets down on to flat country and there are some very bad grades on that line which carries heavy traffic and it is worth electrification. Finally, the little loop from Sutherland to Wollongong and up to Moss Vale which still carries heavy steel traffic and heavy suburban traffic is one line where electrification obviously is overdue. This is something which could be done now. We are wasting resources and wasting the future. We have idle manpower and idle factories that could produce the equipment. We will need these things in the future. </para>
          <para>The years of the locust can never be recovered. This is the time to take action. To fail to do so now because of some obsession about a deficit is really beyond human understanding. We need these things now. We can never recover the time lost in the periods during which factories are idle. It will be gone. Let us get on with the job and do now the things that we shall need in order to cut down our dependence upon imported oil in the near future. In only seven, eight or nine years time Australia 's oil supplies will start to constrict. We may find more oil on the North West Shelf. We have not found it yet. It may well be there. Even if oil is discovered now, it will be many years before it is in economic production. </para>
          <para>In regard to railways, we must fix up the main Melbourne line and carry out some electrification. We must concentrate on our main lines. In particular, we must think of the terminals and the way in which traffic is handled. People who know something of the signal system in Sydney know how vastly and unnecessarily complicated the system is. Railways are out of date in their thinking very often because they are still bound to a position where there was no real motor transport. They do not think in new terms. The trouble about a train, of course, is that it runs on rails and is hard to shunt. When one starts to break up a line of trucks and reform them one loses a lot of time and incurs a lot of cost. We have to think in terms of complete rakes of trucks which are never broken up. That is the economic way of doing things. If we do this we can slash freight rates. A massive reduction in rail freights for rural areas is long overdue. There has to be some reassessment of our handling of livestock on rail. By comparing our trucks and the way in which they are marshalled and handled here with what is being done in some countries overseas we see how far out of date the Australian system is and how much we could help our graziers and the whole rural industry if we would reorganise our way of handling livestock on rail. We must get the freight costs down. We should make it possible, when the varied seasons give a drought in one area and rich pastures somewhere else, to move stock about with reasonable facility and at low cost. </para>
          <para>I have spoken of rail and I have spoken of goods. I speak now of passengers. The concept of a high speed passenger rail service in Australia probably has little application because we do not have the population concentrations which make it so economical in places such as Great Britain and Japan. Let me talk of our suburban railways. In the cities we have to cut down our use of liquid fuel. This can be done partly by helping public transport to become efficient I do not mean that this should be done by penalising the motorist or making the motorist uncomfortable. I believe that we should do this by giving a better and cheaper alternative. I wish I had time to speak more on this matter. I just indicate to the House briefly that the development of the underground rail system in the cities obviously is called for. We have, here again, to get the costs down. I wonder whether we have taken sufficient note of the possibility of using small buses or whether we have yet appreciated the full impact of having suburban transport on which no fares are collected. The costs of collecting fares are sometimes more than the fares collected. In inner city operations fare collection shows a net loss. We would get a better service and lose less money if we did not collect fares. </para>
          <para>I am sorry that the Labor Government in New South Wales is ditching the inner city freeways. It is a most retrograde decision and one which I think can be made only in complete ignorance or with some kind of malicious idea of slugging the motorist. I do not know which it is. In the cities we have to think of proper freeways which, in a sense, will save fuel but also will make it possible for the motorist to use his car to real advantage. We have to save fuel. But what about the liquefied petroleum gas that we waste? Where are the plans for conversion of government vehicles on a major scale from petrol to LPG? Where are the plans to get rid of all excise and other charges on LPG and the corresponding difficulties of using LPG? Where are the plans to organise new outlets for LPG so that motorists can have the convenience of a bowser? Where are the plans to cut down the registration costs on vehicles which are equipped for LPG and which by using that fuel not only reduce our oil bill but in addition reduce- not eliminate- the pollution in cities. This, of course, is only a temporary alleviation. We have to think further of electric vehicles for city and commuter use. They are not, at present, as economic as they should be; but they are improving. The Government should be spending more money on them and showing much more interest in electric vehicles, particularly the small vehicles and the vehicles which can be mass produced and which can give a special service m cities as commuter vehicles. </para>
          <para>I am coming to the end of my time not only in this speech but also in speaking in this House. I have been able to put before the House some of the things which I intend to urge when I take my place in the Senate next year. These are some of the things which I believe are the proper concern of a House of review which can look at the overall plans and by so doing hope to improve the efficiency of an Australian transport system which remains, for all our planning, a national disgrace. </para>

            <para>-The Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1977 seeks authority for the Treasurer to give a guarantee on behalf of the Australian Government for loans to be raised by Ansett Transport Industries to enable the company to finance the purchase of its eighth Boeing 727-200 series passenger aircraft. It is in line with previous Bills of a similar nature which have been passed by the House on earlier occasions when Ansett Transport Industries has purchased aircraft for its fleet. The Bill is a routine measure and as such the Opposition does not oppose it </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In his second reading speech the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> canvassed a wide range of matters pertaining to the aviation industry. I shall address my remarks to some of the issues that the Minister raised. One of the great problems facing the aviation industry is the selection of aircraft, and the facilities available at airports and the capacities of airports. One of the best documents to which honourable members could refer would be the recent publication of statistics of domestic scheduled airline performance for the year ended 30 September 1977. I wish to draw attention to some of the figures that are shown in relation to three aspects: Firstly, passengers; secondly, freight; and thirdly, mail. In the year ending September 1977 Trans-Australia Airlines flew 3.2 per cent more hours but carried 7 per cent more passengers, a 11.6 per cent increase in freight and a 12 per cent increase in mail on what was carried in the previous year. Similarly, Ansett Transport Industries with a 0.3 per cent increase in hours flown carried 2.7 per cent more passengers, 2.5 per cent more freight and 3.3 per cent more mail. </para>
          <para>Without going into the details of the other internal airlines shown in the document, such as Airlines of New South Wales, East West Airlines, MacRobertson-Miller Airline Services, Connair, Qantas and Airlines of South Australia, I want to remark on the total figures for the industry for the year ended September. Looking at the total hours flown we find that there has been a decrease of 1.1 per cent in that year. But the number of passengers carried rose by 4.6 per cent. The domestic airlines carried 9,690 million passengers in the year ending September. As I said that was a 4.6 per cent increase. There was a 5.2 per cent increase in freight and a 5.7 per cent increase in mail carried. I have mentioned those figures to show evidence of increased utilisation of aircraft. Much is said about lower air fares and airport capacities but there is a basic equation as I see it to lower air fares; that is, higher load factors equal lower air fares. The better utilisation and the more people in aircraft on trips the greater the possibilities of lowering the fare for that journey. Those figures show what is happening. </para>
          <para>At the same time when we come to the figures for our perennial problem of Mascot they show a reduction in hours flown and an increase in passengers carried. In the year ended September 1977 at Mascot there were 82,138 aircraft movements, a reduction of 0.5 per cent on the figures for the previous year. But 4.983 million passengers were moved through Mascot. That is an increase of 5.5 per cent. So there was very little reduction in the number of aircraft movements but a substantial increase in the number of passengers. Probably the use of larger aircraft would be a factor as also would be better load factors and better utilisation of facilities. </para>
          <para>Turning to Brisbane, we find that Brisbane airport had 34,799 aircraft movements which carried 2. 144 million passengers. An increase in aircraft movements of 1.4 per cent was more than countered by an increase in passengers of 4.4 per cent. It is the same story. Melbourne is probably the best example. In that same period Tullamarine airport had 66,662 aircraft movements and handled 4.295 million passengers. There was a reduction in aircraft movements at the airport of 2.2 per cent but an increase in the number of people handled of 5.2 per cent. That brings us back to the basic equation that lower air fares, in the main, equal higher load factors and better utilisation of the industry's facilities. </para>
          <para>Much criticism is made from time to time by our political opponents about what happened at Mascot or Brisbane or at other airports. But the simple fact is that for 25 out of the past 28 years -almost for the total period of the development of major civil aircraft operations in Australiathe conservatives who now sit opposite have been responsible. They have been the administrators. Whatever shortcomings exist in our aircraft industry the responsibility lies at their feet. In its relationship with the government the industry sees a problem of uncertainty as to what are the Government's intentions and what should be the guidelines for the industry. I can best evidence this by quoting from <inline font-style="italic">Aircraft</inline> magazine of October 1977 which reports a statement of the  chairman  of the Australian National Airlines Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vial.</inline> The magazine states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Sydney airport's serious problem of traffic congestion and increasing noise annoyance could reasonably be met only by early introduction of wide-bodied jet aircraft on domestic air services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viall</inline> has warned. 'But the airlines cannot be expected to place orders for larger, more efficient, but capital intensive new equipment in a situation characterised by falling or stagnant traffic growth, and faced with the prospect of ever-increasing government imposts leading inevitably to still more daunting fare increases,' he said. 'To do so would be an act of financial irresponsibility.' </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viall</inline>was certainly referring to the conditions as they were. In recent times conditions have improved in terms of passenger growth but I think his statement points out the uncertainty that faces the industry in relation to what are the Government's intentions. </para>
          <para>In relation to Mascot I now refer to the publication put out by the <inline font-weight="bold">Major Airport</inline> Needs of </para>
          <para class="block">Sydney committee. Again we run into the problem of knowing what the Government wants to do. It does not want to discuss it publicly. Friction has developed, as I understand it, between the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government in regard to the activities of the MANS committee. On page 5 of the report it states: </para>
          <para class="block">Traffic Management Schemes </para>
          <para>This study looked at ways of more effectively using Kingsford-Smith airport without building additional runways. It also considered excluding some types of air-traffic, and reducing some services. </para>
          <para>Consideration is being given to the implementation of some of these measures in the near future. </para>
          <para class="block">I want to go on from that to deal with the dilemma that is facing the operators of commuter aircraft in Australia at the moment, but particularly in New South Wales. Quite a campaign has been developing around that problem. The Minister recently, as I recall his statement as accurately as I can, said that there is to be no discrimination, or no discrimination against commuter aircraft, that there is no move to shift commuter aircraft out of Mascot, but a system of priority based on weight has been developed. I put it to the Parliament that that, is exactly a means of forcing the commuter operators out of Mascot. The effect is the same. The larger the aircraft, the higher the priority it has. It means that commuter aircraft have to circle for longer periods than commercial aircraft. That increases their fuel consumption. It causes a delay in their time- tabling and they cannot maintain their services and connections. So they have either to put up with providing that kind of service or to move out. On page 9 of its report the MANS Committee states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>For example, the governments may decide to introduce certain operational procedures immediately, and to accept in principle the concept of a second airport at a particular site. However, it may be decided that the initial planning stages should not commence for a number of years, or until the demand for air travel exceeds a certain number of passengers or aircraft. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then, more significantly on page 1 1, it continues to say in relation to commuter aircraft: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Over the years, measures have been proposed which could lead to more efficient use of existing faculties at Kingsford Smith. These have included: </para>
            <para>Excluding certain classes of traffic, such as general aviation, commuter services and some nights within New South Wales. At present 25 per cent of all aircraft movements at Kingsford-Smith are general aviation (mostly small aircraft). </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A later suggestion is the placing of a surcharge on aircraft movements at Kingsford-Smith. That surcharge would be passed on as higher air fares which may reduce the demand for air travel. In effect, those charges would be punitive. Their purpose would be to discourage aircraft from using the airport. That brings us back to the claim that is being made by the commuter operators. I know that the commuter operators, in their discussions and in their concern about what the Government has in mind, have displayed deep concern about a discussion which took place between themselves and some officers associated with a review of the operation of Kingsford-Smith. In that discussion the Federal officers are reported to have put a very strong line for the exclusion of commuter aircraft from Kingsford-Smith Airport. I know that the Minister has said that the commuter aircraft industry is over-reacting. I put it to the Parliament once again that there is very good evidence to support the view that the commuter operators are taking, and that is the verbal exchanges which took place in relation to commuter aircraft. Those exchanges are not on record, as I understand it, but certainly a discussion took place. </para>
          <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 26 October reports a decision made by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. That Association queried the separation times at Mascot for lighter aircraft. Again this is a matter that needs to be taken into account. As was mentioned at the Association's meeting- I raised this point earlier- the separation standards and the associated delays caused unnecessary loss of time and waste of fuel without enhancing safety. One of the inter-city air services, Aero-Pelican Inter City Commuter Air Services Pty Ltd on which I often travel, said that if graded landing priorities were introduced to Mascot it would be the end of small commuter air services. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hilder,</inline> the manager, was commenting on the proposal of the Department of Transport to place the small commuter services at the bottom of the landing priority scale. He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If we are given a 'D' priority, they are actually telling us that the people of New South Wales do not have as much right to use their own airport as the people of another State do. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So there are good and genuine grounds for the fears of the commuter operators about their future and their access to the airport. The responsibility lies with the Minister and with the Department. In matters such as this more good is achieved by the people responsible coming out into the open and putting the facts on the table in front of the people concerned than by leaving them to be dealt with by departmental memos, exchanges between governments, secret documents and secret reports. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the relationship between the aviation industry and the Minister. From reports I have received from within the industry and from the unions, I doubt whether the relationship between the Department of Transport and the industry has ever been at a lower level than it is at present. The industry's disenchantment with government stems from the failure of the Minister to implement the promises he made in the 197S election campaign. At the time he said he would recreate a separate Department of Air. He has not done that. Instead, he has confirmed the role of the expanded Department of Transport which he inherited. He said there would be a halt to increased air navigation charges. Instead, he increased them by 30 per cent within the first 12 months of coming to office. He said that increases in the industry's costs needed to be stabilised. Yet he endorsed a Budget decision to increase the excise on Avtur, thus bringing about an increase of almost 3 per cent in domestic air fares and the prospect of further heavy increases in the price of Avtur under his Government's energy pricing policy and policies which have been supported by him, as a senior Cabinet Minister, m the Cabinet room. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>attempt to introduce new regulatory charges for services provided to aviation industry personnel sparked off a protest campaign against himself such as has not been seen in Australia previously. He has postponed the introduction of the new charges, but obviously he hopes to introduce them after 10 December if, regrettably, this Government should be returned to office. It is no wonder that the industry is disenchanted with his performance. I do not believe that any other Minister has taken unto himself the power that this Minister has in the management of his Department. </para>
          <para>Since December 1975 we have seen a plethora of secret inquiries into transport, particularly aviation. Let me list just a few of them. The Aviation Industry Review Committee, chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lennox</inline> Hewitt, was appointed in March 1976 to examine cost recovery in the aviation industry. No report has been presented to Parliament. I shall come back to that matter later. I refer also to the scandalous McNeil Committee of Inquiry into Australian Government transport undertakings. That was an inquiry conducted by competitors of, clients of and suppliers to the Australian Government transport enterprises. No report has been presented to Parliament, despite repeated requests to the Minister to do so. I refer also to the interdepartmental committee which inquired into the provision of Northern Territory aerial services, with particular reference to Connair Pry </para>
          <para>Ltd. I have asked the Minister to table the report, but the best answer I have received is that which he gave to question No. 1 805, when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The decisions of the Government, which are based to some extent on the report - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is the report of the interdepartmental committee- and the recommendations contained therein, are open to parliamentary scrutiny and judgment. </para>
          <para class="block">In other words, the Minister is saying: 'We will have a look at the report; we will get the facts; we will make a decision; you can argue about whether the decision is right or wrong, but you cannot have the information'. It is interesting to note that on page 8 of the Minister's second reading speech he says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I myself had a number of quite frank discussions with the  Chairman  of Connair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr £.</inline><inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> Connellan. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is not good enough. Parliament needs to be told the facts and the factors involved. It needs to be told whether there is justification for the action which the Government is taking so that the matter can be examined publicly. It could well be- I emphasise this- that Connair is being disadvantaged by the course of action which the Government, and the Minister in particular, is following. We do not know the facts. I do not have access to the information. I am sure that the Parliament does not have that access. But if the information was laid on the table where it could be discussed and assessed in the public view, it may well be discovered that Connair and the people of the Northern Territory are entitled to a better level of air services than they are receiving under this Government </para>
          <para>I refer now to the Domestic Aviation Policy Review Committee. Again, the report of that Committee is privy to the Minister. The report brought down following the Review of International Civil Aviation Policy again is privy to the Minister. People and organisations could make a submission to that Review and if the person or organisation concerned published that submission it would be available for scrutiny. But we have the ludicrous situation of two separate review committees looking at the same subject and their terms of inquiry overlapping. That creates waste and extravagance. No report has been presented to Parliament and no public hearings were conducted. All I can say is: More power to the Minister, more opportunity for back room deals. That is the only conclusion that one can draw when a government does not want to bring information related to the aviation industry out into the open. It must have something to hide. The question is: What? The Minister is left with more power and is in the position to negotiate, to give out largesse. That may not be the situation, but one cannot blame people for taking that view. </para>
          <para>We in the Opposition have been saying that there is a need for a full scale public inquiry into civil aviation. Until that happens, air travellers in Australia will continue to be disadvantaged. Their needs and wants and the industry's answers should be dealt with in a public forum. As I have said, air travellers will continue to be disadvantaged in terms of frequency of services, level of fares and quality of travel. I come back to this basic equation: Lower fares equal higher load factors. How do we achieve that result and how do we at the same time meet the community's needs in terms of services? </para>
          <para>Those 3 million migrants in Australia who were not born here have a special interest in the lowering of air fares. They are the people who would like to put a submission to a public inquiry. But that will not happen under this Government; no way. Such inquiries have to be conducted behind closed doors, and the Minister will feed out what he thinks we are entitled to see. But migrants are getting the same kind of second and third class treatment in this area of lower air fares as they are getting from the Government in other areas such as migrant education. At least what the Government is doing in this area is in line with its performance in other areas. </para>
          <para>The aviation industry needs to know what the guidelines are and where it is going, especially because of the high capital investment involved and the long lead-in time required in purchasing suitable aircraft and equipment. With the present Minister for Transport and this dilatory government, it is no wonder that the industry is perplexed. I have not been able to get from the Minister a copy of the report of the Hewitt Committee but I have here what is probably part of the conclusions of that report. I will tell the Parliament the reason the Minister will not table this report. The  Chairman  is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt. </para>

I informed him yesterday. I am prompted to raise it because I saw on the Australian Broadcasting Commission a few weeks ago a film of a person who was wearing a short sleeve striped shirt and sunglasses screaming out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> when he was being arrested in Brisbane: 'I am a member of the House of Representatives, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. It was the honourable member for Brisbane. That was on the ABC news on a Saturday screening. It was screened several times. No doubt millions of Australians saw it On 18 October I received a telephone call from a distressed lady complaining about the honourable member for Brisbane. Honourable members may recall that that was the day the Lufthansa captain was murdered at Mogadishu airport and there was revulsion throughout the world at the whole subject of hijacking. The lady said that all of us- I agree with her- as members of parliament have a responsibility to set an example by our behaviour to the law and our services to and requirements in the community, particularly in relation to security checks at airports. </para>

              <para>-If the honourable member for Bendigo checks with Ansett Airlines of Australia he will find that a long series of complaints have been made about the activities of the gentleman concerned at the airport. I do not want to say any more than that because the honourable member for Bendigo might not like what else I say. The member of the public had a perfectly good reason for bringing this matter to my attention. She rang me as shadow Minister for Transport and she complained, in fact demanded, that I do something about it. I have brought the facts to the attention of the Parliament. It is up to the Minister for Transport to make up his mind on what he wants to do. </para>

          </continue><para>The other matter on air safety which I want to mention relates to the fire at Mascot a few weeks ago. That fire was the result of a tragic accident in which a petroleum tanker overturned. Flaming spirit poured down the drains outside the airport, travelled underground for some hundreds of yards and surfaced between No. 5 and No. 6 passenger bays and the aerobridges of TAA, in the Qantas power house, in a Qantas hanger and in a TAA hanger. I drew attention to the danger. In good airport design external drains do not flow under airports. It is a safety requirement a basic requirement of airport design that drains from outside an airport should not flow under an airport. The position at Mascot is that the drains in the nearby streets flow under the airport, under the buildings, into a pond in the inner part of the airport environs, across to Alexandria Canal and into Cook's River. When I drew attention to the danger, the Minister's response was that it was a unique accident. </para><para>I again put to the Minister and to the Government that the situation is very serious. It was just plain good luck that nobody other than the unfortunate person in the motor accident was hurt. The situation exists and the Government is aware of it. If anything happens, the Government is responsible. There is one facet which I have not mentioned previously. During the period of tension in the course of the delay after this incident occurred, TAA aircraft could not unload. Aircraft were on the tarmac. Flames had surfaced between No. 5 and No. 6 aerobridges and at other places. There were not sufficient fire engines to deal with a Jumbo crash or anything above a Fokker crash during the major part of this crisis. </para><para>I wish to inform the House of what happened in one aircraft that was waiting to unload at one of the aerobridges. This is a perfectly human side of what happens in these situations. During that period a passenger became very concerned because the aircraft had landed and the passengers were not being unloaded. Apparently, from what </para><para class="block">I can gather, the passengers did not know what was happening. The aircraft were waiting on the tarmac. As honourable members know, the airline companies are very happy to serve alcohol on aircraft. I understand that in this case some kind of sedative had probably been imbibed during the course of the journey. The passenger became excited and broke into the flight deck of the aircraft and demanded to know what was going on. This is the kind of thing that happens. In this case the aircraft was stationary and no injury or further damage was caused. The unfortunate passenger, for his pains, was arrested and charged. Who is responsible in a situation such as this? </para><para>For the Minister to regard lightly the Mascot incident, the drainage problem there and the lowering of standards of fire fighting appliances is just not good enough. To say that it was a unique accident is not good enough. We are extremely lucky that something far more serious did not occur. An aircraft could have been between No. 5 and No. 6 aerobridges. There were not sufficient engines present. There could have been an incident in aircraft which were waiting on the tarmac because they could not unload their passengers. The Opposition has a commitment to restore aircraft safety standards to those that prevailed prior to the change in government. The next Labor govemmment will give top financial priority to ensuring that aircraft have the proper standards of safety and that the aviation industry has clear guidelines. </para></speech>

            <para>-The debate on the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill has been very wide ranging. The purpose of the Bill is to seek authority for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to guarantee a loan raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to purchase its new Boeing 727 200 series aircraft. Both Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines are moving into the purchase of this new equipment. TAA has indicated that it will be financing its aircraft from its own funds. This is just a mechanical Bill, but because the debate has been so wide ranging there are some points that should be answered and some observations that should be made about civil aviation in Australia at the moment. It is interesting to see that the airlines have faith in the future. They have enjoyed a 4 per cent growth rate in the first three quarters of this year. In fact, some extraordinary growth rate figures have been produced on a month to month oasis. Reports that the airlines in one month experienced a <inline font-style="italic">\9Vi</inline> per cent growth rate emphasise the problems they are having in providing the scheduled services. It is good to see that they have confidence in the future of civil aviation and are prepared to invest in their new Boeing 727 200 series aircraft. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Civil aviation in Australia is at a very interesting stage. As the industry moves into the 1980s the call on new equipment and facilities will become greater and greater. In some respects it is interesting to observe that the airlines at this stage have moved into the Boeing 727 rather than looking at some of the bigger equipment. If one criticism can be levelled at the two major domestic operators in Australia, perhaps it is that sometimes they have been a little conservative in their forward estimates of their equipment demands. Airlines in South Africa, Thailand, Iran and some of the smaller nations in Europe have taken the risk and moved into the big Airbus equipment, the 250-seat aircraft. There has been quite a deal of debate suggesting that perhaps the Australian domestic carriers should be looking right now at moving into the Airbus or the DC 10, which has been put up as a second option for the wide-bodied aircraft to operate on the domestic routes in Australia </para>
          <para>Certainly much of the jet equipment operating in Australia at the moment is becoming quite old. When I say that, it is not to say that safety is being impaired at aU. When we consider that both fleets contain DC9s that have operated for some 24,000 flying hours in the last 10 years or so and when we do a quick mental calculation that would indicate that those DC9s have been in the air non-stop for about three years, we can see the point made by the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> about the utilisation of aircraft in Australia. Obviously the airlines must be looking very hard at re-equipping their fleets, and indeed they should. In a report released overseas recently it was indicated that a Fokker Friendship aircraft operating in Australia was the oldest in the world. Obviously the airline fleets must be kept up to the rigid safety standards that operate in Australia but obviously the time is coming when some major re-equipment purchases will have to be made by the domestic airlines. </para>
          <para>I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Shortland regarding the major airport needs of Sydney study at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. What he said is very true. Kingsford-Smith Airport is probably the greatest headache besetting Australia at the moment. I was interested to hear that he had some doubt about the priorities of the commuter operators. The commuter operators play a most vital part in providing airline services to those areas of New South Wales which they serve. The whole Kingsford-Smith Airport operation should be looked at in its true perspective. Many members of Parliament do not speak to the men who really know the true position. In many cases they would be the domestic airline pilots. They tell us some rather frightening stones about some of the things that happen. </para>
          <para>It is an established fact that the early flight that leaves Brisbane at 7 a.m., or 6 a.m. during daylight saving, for Sydney, is one service that is not particularly affected. It is established that the first aircraft to leave Brisbane for Sydney probably will arrive on time, but the second is invariably 20 minute's late because of the bank-up at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Late last Sunday afternoon I was coming to Canberra. The aircraft was delayed 20 minutes, and so was the one behind. Another aircraft was holding to the west of Sydney and another to the south of Sydney. So much of this bank-up time is being caused by the small aircraft using Kingsford-Smith Airport. We talk about the cost factor involved in the operation of light aircraft. Having a Boeing 727 or a DC9 holding outside Sydney for up to 20 minutes is very costly for the domestic carriers. If we are looking at how we can bring down the cost of fares, aU these things must be considered. I am certainly not a pilot, but on my rather amateurish estimations I would say that to hold a Boeing 727 aircraft outside Sydney for 20 minutes would cost the price of 400 lb of fuel. That is not an inconsiderable amount of money. On Sunday afternoon, when four Boeing 727 aircraft were holding, the added sum would have been appreciable indeed. </para>
          <para>A number of other factors concerning Sydney are certainly well worth looking at. A number of airline pilots have expressed to me concern at the instrument landing system operating on runway 16, the southern runway. To put it in airline jargon, the centreline beam on that instrument landing system has bends in it. In fact the pilots do not have the capacity to line up their aircraft exactly to come in on that main south runway, runway 16. The glidescope which the pilots use to make their landings on that runway also is causing them some headaches. In fact, according to the Department of Transport, the problem is caused by industrial interference from the facilities surrounding Kingsford-Smith Airport. Sure, the aircraft pilots can overcome those problems and they do overcome them very well but, if we are looking at maximum safety and maximum efficiency, these are the areas that must come under investigation and must be upgraded continually. </para>
          <para>If something can be done about keeping the light aircraft- not the commuter aircraft, but the general aviation aircraft- out of Kingsford Smith Airport, we can allow the heavy commercial equipment which may be carrying up to 400 passengers the right to land on schedule with the required safety separation between aircraft, which they certainly are not enjoying at the moment. Three or four aircraft could be coming in on a flight path and a light aircraft going at a very slow speed could be holding up a Boeing 747 or a DC10 behind it on its final approach. </para>
          <para class="block">Apparently the system is that those major aircraft have to slow down their approach to make way for the light one, rather than priority being given to the heavy aircraft to make their landing at Sydney. </para>
          <para>As I said a little earlier, the civil aviation industry, going into the 1980s, has a very bright future; but it is a future in which obviously the concern of all governments, State and Federal, must be shown. I understand that the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> will be speaking a little later about the Brisbane Airport. We know the situation in regard to the Kingsford Smith Airport and that there is a problem with the length of the runway at the Adelaide Airport. So in years to come the cost to government is going to be very considerable indeed One would hate to think of the amount of expenditure that will have to be spent on airport facilities over the next 10 years, but it must be spent if Australia is to maintain its safety standards. </para>
          <para>I was interested to read the comments of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> in his second reading speech and the confidence he put in the aviation review. Indeed many people in Australia are interested in seeing the outcome of the recommendations that will flow from that aviation review, not only in the domestic sphere but also in the international sphere. The two airline policy has served Australia very well during the past 20 or 30 years. However, the time must come when a full review is carried out to make sure that the service that is being provided to the people is the most efficient and the least costly. After all, the whole business of civil aviation is people. Even the freight services relate to people. The safety of those people certainly must be taken into consideration, as must be price. If there is a possibility of reducing domestic airline fares, whether it be through the dropping of some air navigation charges or fuel tax or the higher utilisation of aircraft, every effort must be made to provide the cheapest possible form of travelling to the Australian public. With the bringing in of wide-bodied aircraft as soon as possible, one wonders whether or not some of these objectives can be achieved. In regard to the Airbus or a DC 10, we have, as the honourable member for Shortland mentioned, a situation at the moment in which, although in some cases the number of aircraft movements are down and the number of passengers handled is up, perhaps some of the congestion at places like SydneySydney is a problem and will be for some timecan be relieved. Certainly that has been the exercise in South Africa and it has been the exercise in some other cases around the world where the </para>
          <para class="block">Airbus has come into service in the last six to 12 months or so. </para>
          <para>I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Shortland about the migrant population. I have mentioned three or four times in this House the specific worry of the people in my electorate, those of the Finnish and Danish communities, who at this stage have no access whatsoever to excursion fares to take them home or indeed to reverse traffic to bring their relatives from places like Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland to Australia to visit them. It was one of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism that this aspect of international air travel be looked at. One would hope that in the civil aviation review we will get a very fair approach to it by the Department and that the Department will not be snowed by Qantas. It is interesting to speak to people who work with the domestic operators, and some of the international carriers too, who claim that Qantas does have too much say over the civil aviation policies of Australia. The criticism is made, quite regularly, that when the Department of Transport has to make a decision on some aspect of civil aviation policy, whether it be landing rights or something else, what Qantas says goes. Nobody is denying that we must protect our national carrier and that we must provide the best possible operating circumstances for that carrier; but I think there have been examples in past years where perhaps the national carrier has had far too much say in the way the aviation policy should go. So one hopes that this review will be a fair one, that it will be an objective one and that we will see some very real recommendations coming from it to help the people of Australia achieve what I believe should be the aim of our civil aviation policythe cheapest possible fares for the Australian travelling public. </para>
          <para>As I say, this has been a wide ranging debate, when we consider that the prime purpose of the Bill is to guarantee the provision of money from the Commonwealth Government on behalf of Ansett to purchase a new Boeing 727. It is an area which should be of vital concern to all of us. Never before, I believe, in the history of Australia has there been so much interest amongst the general public as to which way civil aviation in this country is to head over the next 10 years. It will be interesting to see just what results and recommendations come out of those reviews. It is an industry in which Australia has a very proud record around the world. It is an industry in which we enjoy a safety record which is probably comparable to that of no other country. It is interesting to see that the three airlines- Ansett, TAA and Qantas- are amongst the top ten airlines of the world in relation to air safety. I believe that two of those airlines are in the top three. I think the record speaks for itself. </para>
          <para>This is an industry which must be in our consideration at all times. It is an industry in which there will be major changes in coming years. It is an industry where technical development is going along at a tremendously rapid pace. It is an industry which must be under constant review. The new navigation equipment that is coming into so many of the new aircraft, and the Omega navigation system that is going to be used by domestic aircraft around the world, must be kept in mind too. Obviously there will ultimately be room for big cost savings to be made in what services the Department of Transport itself provides. I do not think it will be too long before the domestic carriers and the internationals will be complaining about the amount of money they are being charged for some of these services when sophisticated computerised navigation equipment in modern jet aircraft will be able to provide most of the information they need. So we look forward to continued expansion in civil aviation in Australia in the next 10 years. This Bill is helping that expansion by bringing a modern Boeing 727 aircraft into Australia on behalf of Ansett. Another is to come for TAA. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-A little piece of history is always useful when looking at the development of airports. There has been a growing concern over the Brisbane Airport. It has manifested itself in this place and it is certainly manifesting itself in my own State. Brisbane Airport is the most neglected in Australia and it is the worst airport in any mainland capital city. The anger and the concern that have developed are well exemplified by a newspaper article in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> dated Saturday, 4 November 1967. The article contains a list of promises in relation to the Brisbane Airport. These promises have now extended well over 10 years. This is merely a record of the last decade. If one were to reach back into the early 1960s, one could peruse the promises made then. I shall read certain excerpts from this article and from the statement of the then Minister for Civil Aviation to indicate just what has not occurred. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The then Minister for Civil Aviation indicated at that time that Brisbane was expected to become Australia's No. 2 international airport under Federal plans to develop it. The Sydney </para>
          <para>Airport was to be brought up to an equal standard. The article said, and this is the important point: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Civil Aviation Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swartz,</inline> in Brisbane yesterday confirmed that the Civil Aviation Department had accepted 12,500 feet as the necessary runway length for nonrestricted operations of the Boeing 747. He indicated that Sydney Airport had two runways of 7,900 feet and 5,500 feet in length and that Tullamarine, Melbourne's new $45m airport - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is in 1967 dollars- due to become fully operational in 1969 will carry only limited jumbo jet traffic and will not be extended to become a major port for them. Tullamarine's main runway will be 8,500 feet. Jumbos using it will do so with restricted loads because of the runway conditions. </para>
          <para class="block">The article then described the Darwin Airport and the Perth Airport. The plain fact is that there has been development and extension at every one of those airports within the past decade. There has been none at Brisbane, and Brisbane is the third airport in Australia. It is also the third international airport in Australia. That is why the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail,</inline> in a magnificent editorial last Friday, made it perfectly clear that it expected something to be done in relation to Brisbane airport. I have not seen such a forthright editorial in that newspaper for a long time. There is a growing and real concern. Let me make it quite clear that the runway at Brisbane airport, in terms of both domestic and international traffic, is the most inadequate runway at any capital city airport in Australia. I say that it is not right that that should be so and I say that it is not a fair go. So the members from Queensland are concerned. </para>
          <para>The second reason why they are concerned is simply this: If an airport is stunted the development of a region will be stunted. In some ways airports have become the modern equivalent of seaports. In the past, nations, regions, and states, were built up around their ability to have ocean and sea traffic. That still obtains but airports are a modern counterpart to that position. If an airport is stunted demand and activity through that region will be reduced. That is what is happening with respect to Queensland and that is certainly what is happening quite precisely with respect to Brisbane and south east Queensland today. The plain fact is that the growth of traffic at Brisbane airport has been in excess of the original estimate of the needs of the airport. I am referring to the totality of the traffic, the larger volumes of traffic mentioned by the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris).</inline> I am referring to international traffic, commuter traffic, general aviation traffic and domestic mainline traffic. I am taking them all together. Commuters and other services have as much right to use capital city airports as to other lines. They fulfil a very necessary purpose. </para>
          <para>From 1969 to 1976, which included three years of recession, the growth of traffic movement at Brisbane airport was over 6 per cent per year. The growth this year is well in excess of the 6 per cent per year for 1976, and is well in excess of 7 per cent per year. So that airport will reach its full capacity and queuing will have to occur many years earlier than was envisaged in the Brisbane Airport Transport Survey made some years ago. The data on which the survey was based is seriously out of line and seriously out of focus. Therefore we have to look at the proposals in respect of Brisbane airport. Again I look at the long history of promises that have been made in relation to Brisbane airport, so well exemplified by the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron).</inline> Recently, one of the members of the board of Qantas Airways Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Egerton, who also happens to be an inhabitant of my electorate, pointed out that there were some plans for the immediate development of Brisbane airport which would cost over $200m. These plans which were made public, were for some runway realignment, terminal development, et cetera. As <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Egerton indicated, that is a very large expenditure to contemplate. I suggest that that expenditure is totally unrealistic. </para>
          <para class="block">As I have pointed out and as Queensland member have made clear, we do not want the development of that airport to be a miniature Snowy Mountains scheme. We do not want anything like that. The realistic program for expenditure for what is required between now and well into the 1990s, towards the end of this century, is one-third of the amount which is being talked about. Some of the programs in respect of runways, I suspect- I cannot obtain all the details of them- are unrealistically elaborate and luxurious. They are unrealistic as to what is required for Brisbane airport. I suspect, and I say this quite frankly, that some of these costs have been so loaded as to make the program unfeasible, to make it quite unrealistic. I suggest that an expenditure of $60m to $70 would satisfy what has been promised in relation to Brisbane airport till the end of this century. What are required are two features in terms of public expenditure: A realigned runway, and sufficient fill for the replacement of terminals. Most of the other expenditures that are required- other expenditures are required- lie within the private enterprise field. We do not want a Taj Mahal. We say that a Taj Mahal is being suggested and worked on in order to make it unrealistic and unattainable. It has the effect of making the financial barrier so high that it cannot possibly be hurdled. We are suggesting modest proposals that are realistic and capable of being fulfilled. </para>
          <para>I want to say this: The people in Queensland are becoming increasingly concerned about the airport. Pieces of quite serious misinformation have been conveyed. For example, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> who is a very talented Minister, has indicated to the Australian National Travel Association in Queensland that in respect of Brisbane airport there are no real restrictions imposed on international movements at that airport by either the runway or the recently completed international terminal facilities. That is an incorrect statement and the Department of Transport, which is responsible for the operation of the airport in Brisbane, knows that it is incorrect. It knows that international carriers fully loaded- we are talking about economic operations fully loaded- are unable, under the temperatures and the conditions operating, to reach the nearest Asian port. From there planes are required to drop down at Darwin. British Airways planes travel from Brisbane to Sydney and then to Singapore. They have the pleasure of watching planes from Tullamarine airport flying overhead not only on their way to Singapore but also on their way to Hong Kong, Manila and so on. That position is not sufficiently good. It is not a fair position and it is not one that would intend or would be able to defend. </para>
          <para>These things have to be pointed out. There are realistic programs which can be put into operation. We ask only that the people who are responsible for the engineering in this area and the consultants responsible for drainage and engineering requirements in Brisbane and in other Queensland areas be consulted, but that the airport not be designed at an unrealistically luxurious level such as we find in Melbourne or some other southern capital. Brisbane airport must have something done to it. Above all we say that any proposal to extend the runway is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for a whole host of reasons. It has also been declared to be unacceptable by the State Government and by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. That proposal has also been declared to be unacceptable by the Liberal Party of Queensland and by the Federal Council of the Liberal Party, by a unanimous vote in both instances. What is required at Brisbane airport is a realigned runway and fill for the establishment of terminals and those other facilities in an appropriate direction. Basically that is all that is required until the turn of this century. Unless that is done, queuing will begin to occur at that airport much earlier in the 1980s than was originally foreseen. Most tragically, unless something is done to develop an adequate airport, promises made in 1967 will be shown to have been promises of straw. But above all, an inadequate airport indicates that a region can be kept back in an unrealistic manner. </para>
          <para>Let me make one further comment. The economic conditions under which a development occurs are also important. There can be attitudes towards capital development programs that will occur as a particular stage of an economic cycle. It has been part of the Government's program to have capital works programs restricted more than they would be otherwise . If we accept that fact, it is nonsense to suggest that over the long period that is required for the development of an airport, similar restrictions on capital works programs are going to persist. Is anybody in this House going to suggest that similar restrictions over capital works programs will occur over the next five, six, seven or eight years? The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has indicated that 1978 will be a year of far more substantial economic growth than we have experienced in the immediate past. We welcome that statement. If 1979, 1980 and the early 1980s are going to be years of substantial economic growth, that is the period of time over which a modest capital works program in relation to an airport can be organised and sustained. So the economic circumstances will enable something to be done. In fact, the economic circumstances could encourage that a capital works program be initiated during the next Parliament with respect to Brisbane airport. I suggest that the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> editorial has given a magnificent lead to the people of Australia and the people of Queensland. I believe that that lead will be taken. </para>

          <para>-by leave- On 27 October, during a discussion of the electoral redistribution for New South Wales, I sought and obtained leave to incorporate at page 2543 <inline font-style="italic">of Hansard</inline> a paper prepared by the Parliamentary Library which detailed the changes in the political allegiances of the various seats in this House since the 1966 election. The document prepared by the Parliamentary Library contained some errors. The errors no doubt were caused by the rush with which it was prepared following the short notice I gave. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a document which corrects the errors. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to replace the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974. This Act referred only to land purchases and in 1976 it was amended to include all programs concerned with nature conservation. The present Bill extends the purpose of the amended Act to include all environmental programs. The Bill has very wide ramifications. It deals with all the Government's conservation and environmental programs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is regrettable that environmental matters have been very low on this Government's priorities. I refer for example to the first report of the Australian Heritage Commission which was tabled in the Parliament today. This is one of the few programs in this area which have not been completely scrapped by the Fraser Government. The Australian Heritage Commission in fact was set up by the previous Government. However there is not much moral or financial support given to environmental and conservation programs. An example is the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, which probably is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament. It has wide ramifications. Two studies were undertaken under the terms of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. One was the Fraser Island inquiry and the other, or course, was the Ranger inquiry into uranium. They had wide ramifications and it is very interesting to note that although both reports were brought down during the last two years, no proposal has been referred to the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act by the Fraser Government. This Government has moved back to the old bulldozer mentality. The Minister for National Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair, both Country Party Ministers, have had an enormous influence in this area. The area represented by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman)</inline> probably has one of the Government's lowest priorities. That is regrettable. </para>
          <para>With regard to the mining of uranium, as I said earlier, both the first and second reports of the Ranger inquiry were brought down under the terms of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development did not make all the recommendations; they were made by the Minister for National Resources. That brings the priorities of this Government into question. </para>
          <para>This Government is superficially concerned with environmental and human justice issues. I will deal briefly with the environmental aspects of uranium mining. The Alligator River region is a very delicate area of Australia. It is proposed that in due course-I hope that the area is not ruptured in the meantime- the Kakadu national park will be set up there. Recently I was in the area and I saw how beautiful, delicate, and fragile it is. The feelings and attitudes of the Aboriginal people also will be an extremely delicate situation to handle. The sad thing is that this Government is so superficial even with regard to the environmental proposals put forward by the Ranger inquiry. It has accepted the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to control uranium mining in the Alligator River area and the Kakadu national park area. This Act will supersede the Ranger report. The Ranger report argued very strongly against using the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, both for environmental reasons and reasons associated with civil liberties. </para>
          <para>The operation of the Atomic Energy Act allows no other consideration. It does not allow environmental considerations to disturb its provisions. This means that environmental impact legislation is irrelevant and has no force on uranium mining in the Alligator River region. The Government has only a moral obligation, not a legal obligation, to recognise the environmental safeguards recommended in the second Ranger report. The Atomic Energy Act also overrides the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. Section 41 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act requires, in effect, that m respect of Aboriginal land, a mining interest shall not be granted unless either both the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Lands Council consent or the Governor-General declares that the national interest requires that the interest be granted. But because authority has been granted to Ranger under the Atomic Energy Act the 'mining interest' provisions of the Land Rights Act do not apply. I stress that point. Therefore the Northern Land Council consent will not be necessary in respect of the Ranger project even if it becomes Aboriginal land under the land rights claim. Therefore, Aborignals have no right over the Kakadu, the Mudginberri and the Munmarlary pastoral leases and the eventual disposal of these lands. </para>
          <para>This is of great significance environmentally in this area. Members of my staff last week visited Jabiluka and Jabiru areas to see what the situation was. They saw large areas covered with plastic sheeting which had been used for aerial surveys, and now there were rotten pieces blowing about the bush. There were grid tracks made by motor trucks all over the bush, cut through the bush yet this was an ecologically fragile area. These mining tracks of savage erosion will occur during the wet season. This Government's concern for the environment is subordinate to its championing of the uranium miners rights. The Aboriginals, the people best fitted to protect our unique inheritance in the Arnhem Land escarpment, also have had their interests overridden. The environment is in fact subordinate to this Government's priorities. That is the whole issue. </para>
          <para>They are just a few comments on a sad situation that will occur under this Government on the priorities that do exist. There are other comments to be made on the environmental impact statements. There are comments in the report of the Australian Heritage Commission, which was tabled today, dealing with the "woodchip industry but this Government has shown hide concern about this aspect. It has been said that arrangements have been entered into between State governments and overseas concerns in respect of the wood chip industry, but we know that this Government has certain powers under the Customs Act which enable it to restrict the devastation which is being caused to our forests and protect the natural areas that are being raped in Australia today. The report of the Heritage Commission tabled today warns all Australians about the wood chip situation. It says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia is not rich in forested land. Since white settlement, the area of forest has been halved, and now occupies less than 6 per cent of the continent. In the earlier years of timber cutting, the forests were not viewed as a renewable resource. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The sad situation of course is that just as people are raping our natural mineral resources today, our forest lands were raped in the past and of course this is still going on. The report of the Heritage Commission gives this warning: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Since 1970 the export trade in wood-chips has called for more and more timber. Clear felling has denuded large areas of forest. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One has only to go to Eden on the south coast of New South Wales to see how badly the region has been raped by the wood chip industry. The Australian Government will have to exert control if the State governments will not control this very delicate part of our environment. The report of the Heritage Commission continues. </para>
          <para>Many environmentalists do not object to the idea of 'tree farms' or to the preference for imported species of trees. They do object, however, to clear felling in environmentally sensitive lands. There also seem to be special opportunities for woodchip harvesting in the large areas of cleared, neglected land which are available for reafforestation. </para>
          <para>The State Forests have long been seen as 'landscaped national parks' which quietly serve a variety of needs. They serve the logging industry, people interested in wildlife, and tourists seeking grand scenery or satisfying their feeling for solitude. Unless very well managed the woodchip industry can wreck that traditional compromise. </para>
          <para class="block">I think that is a warning. I hope that the Government will use the powers that it has over export to make sure that the State governments take some heed of this warning. Frankly, I am pleased that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKelllar)</inline> in his second reading speech did stress that if we are going to control our environment the only way we can control it is by a spirit of co-operation. I think that cooperation has to occur between the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Government, State governments and local governments and even between governments and the private sector. We cannot go on as we did particularly between the years 1950 to 1972 in which the bulldozer mentality existed. In that time many of the beautiful buddings that were created by man were destroyed because of greed and stupidity and of course because of that bulldozer mentality. It was only after the Labor Government set up the Hope inquiry into the National Estate that there was any real change in the attitude to preserving some of our national heritage whether man-made or by nature. I think that this understanding that we have to work together if we want to preserve our national heritage is starting to grow in the community. </para>
          <para>The sad situation which has occurred is that although the National Estate program is now underway it needs financial support, it needs financial muscle. I am not saying that the Federal Government can produce everything from its Pandora's box to solve the financial problems of State and local governments, but many of these problems can be solved only if the Federal Government is prepared to give financial supportfinancial muscle- to back up the planning proposals. It has been said that whereas the abor Government in its three years in office spent in excess of some $ 1 5m, less than $ 1 m or at the very most $1.5m might have been spent in the last two years under the Liberal Government. That is the sad situation that has occurred. The Government, in saying that it has to wait until the national register is prepared, is simply postponing the matter. We know from the recommendations in the Hope report and from the reports and requests from the respective State governments that there is ample work available and so much that can be done and much of the work is labour intensive. I hope that the Federal Government will do more in the years ahead towards making a real contribution towards protecting our national heritage and protecting our National Estate, to ensure that the rare species are protected, whether they be flora or fauna. </para>
          <para>The whole basis of my criticism of this Bill is that on the environmental front and the conservation front this Government has such very low priorities. It has failed. Wherever the interests of growth or wealth appear to be, this Government sides with them just as it sided with the uranium mining interests in that very delicate area of the Alligator River in Arnhem Land. Instead of accepting the proposition, as reported, that there should be sequential development of uranium mining in the areas and that only the Ranger mine should go ahead first to ascertain what problems would be created in this delicate environmental area- that would have been bad enough- the Government rejected it. But what was done? The Government even cancelled the proposition of sequential development of the Ranger mine and the Pancontinental mine. The simultaneous development of those two mines not only will have a grave effect on that delicate environment but also will have a grave effect on the environment of the human beings in that area, that is, the Aboriginal people. That is the extremely sad situation. Therefore, whilst not opposing the Bill, the Opposition criticises and in some cases condemns the priority given to environmental and conservation matters of protecting our national heritage. </para>

            <para>History has recorded in its pages many instances of complete destruction when people have challenged nature. It also has recorded that when people have worked with nature they have lived to enjoy the benefits of that co-operation. I was most interested in the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline> I feel a certain sympathy with the points he enumerated. It is true that for too long we in Australia did not really appreciate the environment. If one can be critical of the previous era, one has to say that much of the development by the early settlers in this country was carried out without any significance being attached to the environment and the preservation of our great natural resources for the use of the generations that would follow. I join with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in paying a tribute to the previous Government for sparking off an interest m the environment as far as Australia as a nation is concerned. I hope that the small acorn that was planted will grow into a great tree so that the environment will be protected, so that we will not challenge nature and so that future generations will be able to enjoy the benefits of what nature can provide. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill is the stepping stone to greater achievement in the years to come. One can criticise it for not spreading its umbrella widely enough or not gathering into its fold aU the things in which environmentalists are interested; but it is a start. It gives statutory outline to a cooperative effort between the Commonwealth Government and the States. Let us not forget that this type of legislation will act as a catalyst to encourage private individuals and organisations to play their part in the preservation of the environment and particularly the National Estate. I want to comment later on a few private organisations which I believe deserve encouragement. Their efforts deserve to be recorded in this national Parliament </para>
          <para>The Bill indicates to the States that the Commonwealth seeks to be a partner with them. We do not seek to take over. We do not wish to manipulate. Rather, we want to work with the States so that man can live with the environment and does not become a victim of his own misuse of it. I believe that one or two things are worthy of comment. In this year's Budget, due to the efforts of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> $2.55m was allocated for the National Estate. I understand that certain grants have been announced for Tasmania. We aU know how hard the Minister works and how very interested he is in the National Estate. We hope that he can hurry up the announcements of the grants for the other States. Many organisations and people currently are waiting to hear whether their particular enterprise has been granted some financial assistance. If those announcements could be made in the near future it would allow these people and organisations to plan ahead with some sense of security and with the definite knowledge that their efforts will be reinforced by a financial contribution from the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>One of the projects in which I am particularly interested is called the Jondaryan woolshed. The Jondaryan area will be represented in the next Parliament by my good friend, the honourable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Corbett).</inline> The Jondaryan woolshed is a great monument to the ability of the men of last century to erect a building which in effect can withstand the exigencies of time. It was, in its heyday, the largest woolshed in Australia. I understand that at f resent it is the oldest woolshed still in operation, was most heartened in the days of the Labor Administration by the keen interest that was displayed in this project by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> He, as an ex-shearer, wanted to join with me and the people of the Jondaryan district in preserving the woolshed as a memorial not only to the AUS.tralian pastoral industry but also to the shearing industry. No pontics were involved. The honourable member came into this Parliament from the shearing sheds and shared my infectious enthusiasm for having a fitting memorial to the industry in aU spheres, from the bottom up. </para>
          <para>I believe that if the honourable member for Hindmarsh had not been removed from his office we would have seen a rather generous allocation of funds to the Jondaryan woolshed for the purpose of recording that at that woolshed the first grains of the shearers strike were sown. That is all part of Australian history. It is part of the National Estate. Irrespective of the side of politics to which one belongs, that is Australia. That is how Australia grew. That is how Australia became one of the great free nations of the world. These things are worthy of recording. I refer to my interest in agriculture and the interest of the honourable member for Hindmarsh in the shearing industry. There cannot be an industry unless we have all facets- the worker, the pastoralist and all the transport activities. These people, through unrelenting application and a great deal of personal sacrifice, have done a lot to restore that woolshed. It is now a most fitting memorial to the early pioneers of that district. There even is employed there a man who can recreate the old transport buggies, make wheels and carry out that wonderful old trade of blacksmithing. </para>
          <para>I hope that when grants are allocated the Jondaryan woolshed is among the recipients. It deserves to be among the recipients because it represents the industry. It does not represent just one section of the industry; it represents the whole industry. I am delighted that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has come into the chamber. It gives me an opportunity to pay a personal tribute to him for the encouragement he gave to me when we were trying to get the memorial off the ground. </para>

              <para>-We are very fair about it, as the honourable member for Maranoa said. The other point about which I want to talk is that there is a need for a co-operative effort on the part of the Government and private enterprise. We have, again in the enlarged electorate of Maranoa, a wonderful display which represents the interests of a man in gathering together native flora and fauna. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lance</inline> Cockburn of Brookvale Park, outside Oakey. There is there an area of land growing all the well known trees and many of the shrubs of Australia, gathered personally by him when he and other people interested in the project crossed Australia from east to west. That is a fitting memorial. No words of mine are necessary to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lance</inline> Cockburn. In his heart he sees recreated before him, each day as the dawn comes, something of himself. But more importantly, he has another project, that is, to collect together and to house a national orchid collection. This is a mammoth exercise which will require an injection of considerable funds. I hope that that idea receives encouragement with finance and gifts of orchids. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It grieves me to think that here in Australia where orchids grow in the bush- a profusion of different types, delicate shades all reflecting beauty- we do not have housed in one area a national orchid collection. That is what concern for the environment is all about, the preservation for those who come after us of typical Australian things. In that way, not only we who have seen them in the bush and have enjoyed them, have had the time to breathe away from the many pressures that are being exerted upon us and ave taken the time off to go into these areas, with some feeling of a sense of belonging, a sense of getting away from it all, but others also will be able to enjoy them. </para>
          <para>I suppose many of us have been disappointed that we have to plead guilty to the charge of being negligent in regard to soil conservation. It is not for me to criticise the old pioneers. Probably if a little of their spirit of hard work was still present we would be a lot better nation. The old timers- honourable members on both sides of this House can claim them as their mums and dads; it is not the prerogative of any one sidewent out into the scrub with an axe, a sugar bag full of corned meat over their shoulders, tamed the scrub and made Australia great. But I believe that their farming methods were such that they have led to a rapid decline in the fertility of the soil and the loss of thousands of tons of soil from what were fertile highlands. </para>
          <para>I have been most impressed by the efforts of some of the State governments to come to grips with the problem, to wrestle afresh with the fact that unless something is done we will have pollution of our streams and topsoils will be washed away, never to be replaced. Let us be critical and say that many thousands of acres of soil that have been cultivated should never have been cultivated; the land should have been left with trees and undergrass for pasture purposes and not used for the growing of crops. That was not done. Unfortunately we cannot turn the clock back, but let us hope that the Federal Government, particularly through tax incentives, can give encouragement to the farmers to preserve the soil, either by rotation of crops or by construction of contour banks or other appropriate measures. </para>
          <para>We have allocated $200,000. 1 know that the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development will use his considerable persuasive powers to get the Cabinet and the State governments to agree to a massive onslaught on the problem. Each day that passes makes the action an extra day too late. As well as the decline of fertility, there is the associated problem of clogging up the streams. I have listened here to people like the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King)</inline> and the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fisher)</inline> talk about what has happened in the last 20 or 30 years. They used to be able to get in a boat and row up the river but now those rivers are clogged up. The water holes are filled up because of the silt that has been washed down from the highlands. A lot of damage has already been done. Let us ensure that what has been done will not be repeated. </para>
          <para>This Bill seeks to bring out national policies in two ways, not only in the manner of spending money, about which I have been commenting, but also in the matter of overseeing the importation of chemicals. It is both distressing and displeasing to note that man has wrought great damage by the indiscriminate use of chemicals. When I hear of a person being afflicted by some unknown disease I often wonder whether this can be traced back to the fact that he has absorbed through the pores of his skin pesticide and weedicide sprays, used by people aimlessly and without any idea of responsibility. I know that in the irrigation areas of Queensland, cotton worth thousands of dollars has been destroyed because of drift of chemicals from people who have been using weedicides in a windy situation and who have not exercised responsibility. </para>
          <para>Therefore it is good to see in the Minister's second reading speech- I compliment him on the fact- that the Government, through the Aus.tralian Environmental Council, will move positively towards comprehensive and co-ordinated regulations for the export and import of environmentally hazardous chemicals. I believe that that is an excellent initiative. Damage done by chemicals cannot be measured in absolute terms. In the final analysis it is the cause of much sickness and much loss of income. The National Country Party and all Government supporters fully support this legislation. We agree with the criticism that has been advanced that it does not go far enough. But viewed against the background of a government moving in the right direction with great financial restrictions placed on it on account of the state of the economy, this is a positive proof to the Australian people that we are serious about the environment. </para>
          <para>We are concerned about the problems of air pollution and land pollution. We are concerned that unless something is done to overcome the clogging up of the roads and to rid us of the fumes that are being exhausted into the air by uncontrolled transport, man will reach a situation where in effect he will be suffocated by the things he has created. For far too long people who live in cities have had to put up with unrelenting and unremitting noise. That must jar on the nerves of people who have emotional problems, people beset with the problems of rearing a family in a modern day and age with all amounts of pressures being exerted on them from economy, science and philosophy. They cannot even have time to sit down in peace and quietness and take a few minutes off without someone starting up with the whirr of the lawn mower, or a truck goes past with a broken muffler and there is the intrusion of noise. These are aU problems that we have to tackle. This Bill indicates that this Government is serious about attacking those problems. Unless the Government does something about this matter in association with the States it will not be possible for people who live in metropolitan Australia to enjoy a peaceful Sunday afternoon outing in the bush where the kids can run up and down the rocks, run down into the gulleys and climb the trees. I am delighted to note that the Minister commented in his second reading speech on park lands where people, no matter whether they are the richest or the poorest in the land, can go to enjoy the privileges of the countryside, where they can get away from it all, where they can sit down under the shade of the tree and listen to the beautiful sounds and the murmurings of the birds. </para>

            <para>- I will not talk for very long. I begin by congratulating the honourable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McVeigh)</inline> on the excellent speech that he just delivered. It surprised me, and I am sure it surprised everybody in the Par.liament, to learn that he can speak with such eloquence and common sense on a matter such as this. What I liked about his speech was the fact that he did not read a single word of it. It aU came from the heart. My advice to him, which I offer in the kindliest of ways, is that from now on he should continue to speak from the heart- he has proved himself to have a heart- and not to read and rant from papers written to him by the Australian Cattlemen's Union or whoever used to write his speeches. The honourable gentlemen is improving rapidly and I am sure that in the dim, distant future, when his side comes to office again, we will see him in this place as a Minister. I hope that one day he is made a Minister. He is worthy of it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to deal mainly with the point that the honourable member for Darling Downs made about Jondaryan Station. He is entitled to a great deal of praise for what he has done to foster this wonderful historic relic of Australian history. Not only is it a relic of the pastoral industry; it also is a relic- a very important relic- of labour history and the industrial history of Australia. I remember so well the honourable member coming to me, when I was Minister for Labour and Immigration and in charge of the Regional Employment Development scheme, and asking for support for the restoration of that magnificent old building. I approved his request and gave my support to it. I am sorry that I was dismissed from the ministry before I was able to see it restored. Of all the projects Labor carried out under the RED scheme- many very fine projects were carried out under that scheme- none was more deserving of support than the restoration of Jondaryan Station </para>
          <para>Jondaryan is the station where the Australian Workers Union first secured agreement from the pastorialists of Queensland for an all-union shop. It was agreed with the late Spence and Macdonnell that in the shearing season of the following year all of the workers there would be union members. Spence made the mistake-it turned out to be a mistake later but at that time, in the short term it was not- of threatening the owners of Jondaryan. He said that if they did not agree to a union shop, as it was called- to work according to agreement rates- the waterside workers would refuse to load the wool onto the ships. I have studied the history of the AWU and I have documentation to prove that Spence was never given authority by the Australian Waterside Workers Federation to make that threat against the owners of Jondaryan. That fact has not been previously recorded in any of the official history books but it will be recorded in my history of the AWU. He made that threat as a bluff, something for which he was notorious. The owners of Jondaryan caved in. When the waterside workers heard about the situation they took umbrage at the fact that their name had been used without consultation in the course of an industrial dispute. However, because Jondaryan eventually agreed to the union demand, the waterside workers were quick to turn around and claim credit for a threat that was made in their name. </para>
          <para>History shows that the settlement of the Jondaryan dispute sowed the seeds of the great maritime strike. When the ships officers were refused the right by the ship owners to affiliate with the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, the ships officers, in conjunction with the waterside workers, made the same threat which had been so effective against the owners of Jondaryan. However, the ships officers and waterside workers lost and one of the biggest strikes ever recorded came into being.  </para>
          <para>Jondaryan is an important part of Australian labour history. It has the biggest shed ever built in Australia and perhaps anywhere in the world. It is fitting and proper that it should be restored. I hope that the parties now in office will support the party which will be in office after 10 December in giving a substantial donation for the purpose of restoring Jondaryan so that we can proudly show it to people from overseas and, perhaps more importantly, to the people who live here. </para>

            <para>- I want to spend a few moments this afternoon in supporting the Environment (Financial Assistance) Bill which was presented to the House by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman).</inline> I do so on three grounds: Firstly, I have found that almost every Australian now is at heart a conservationist. Secondly, there is major national concern about the fact that some of our most treasured buildings have been lost. Thirdly, there is major concern because some of Australia's rare species of wildlife are so likely to be lost in the next 20 years unless we take very great care. In my view there should be no monopoly- and no particular party is entitled to the monopoly- of concern for conservation. It is the concern of us all. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is sometimes said that those people who first came to this country ravaged the country and did a lot of damage. In certain cases that may be so but I do not think we should look upon the whole problem of conservation with a feeling of guilt. Certainly, we ought not to look upon it with the gloom which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> always asks us to adopt. I prefer to look upon it with the charm, grace and elegance of the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> Honourable members should look at the wonderful buildings in Robe. They should look at the history of Robe. They should look at the wonderful areas in Australia. </para>
          <para>I wish to make a few comments about conservation. The next problem we have to face is education in conservation. Are we teaching the children in our schools how to use the equipment they take with them when they go into the wildlife areas? How many rivers have I found full of spinners because people or children did not know how to use their tackle? What a tragedy it is, when fishing in the Falls Creek area and watching the evening sun go down, to have to stand on glass bottles or cans. The first lesson in conservation must be taught and understood by all those who go into the countryside. Let us take an example of one person in the last century who made a very fine contribution towards conservation. I refer to the work of Carlo Catani. If honourable members looked from the Dandenongs straight down to Westernport they would realise what a wonderful operation it was to clear the whole of the area and to make it some of the most fertile and most valuable land in Australia. The black soil around Kooweerup is well known to anybody with an understanding of farming. </para>
          <para>Those who understand must appreciate how difficult it is for people to work out conservation plans when two authorities are involved. Take, for example, the Shire of Cranbourne. There are two authorities involved- the Westernport Regional Council and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. A third authority deals with all the effluent which goes into Westernport Bay. There must be a genuine cooperation between all these authorities. I say that it would be tragic if we lose the use of Westernport Bay because development of industry in that area. The development must be done with the greatest possible care. The revision of the boundaries of Holt have given me the wide areas towards the bay. I consider that conservation is one of the most important things to which every member of this House should devote his attention in the next 10 or IS years. Industries are developing in this area. They must be developed carefully and with sound sense. </para>
          <para>I do not want to take up too much time of the House - </para>

            <para>- I certainly will not take up too much time. As has been acknowledged, this Bill is an interesting one. It opens an area of contemplation that is very important to Australia and the people of this country. I want to summarise the financial aspects of the Government's approach to environmental matters. Although I do not regard the Bill as a major controversy for the House, I must say that quite consistent with the inability of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> to sustain expenditure in other areas for which he is responsible, there has been this heavy decline in funding of environmental activities. I refer especially to special grants which have been cut back very significantly indeed. The grants for conservation organisations in the last three budgets have been $450,000, $391,500 and $300,000. In three years they have come down from $450,000 to $300,000. 1 am told that there have been no curtailments at all to grants in aid generally if they apply to boy scouts, girl guides or surf life saving clubs. The curtailment in grants to conservation organisations has been of very serious proportions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer now to the grants to the environmental centres. The Labor Government of course made available direct grants, not matching grants. In recent times this Government has introduced the principle of matching grants- a $2 for $ 1 subsidy arrangement for 1976, and the $1 for $1 subsidy arrangement for 1977. We are told that some centres will be closing as a result of this arrangement. One can imagine the mining people and those industrial people with vandalistic tendencies rubbing their hands together with glee when the policemen- the people who alert the country and the governments to environmental destructionare put out of business. I think that is a very sad thing to happen. </para>
          <para>Let me mention briefly the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. I am told that no inquiry has been conducted under that Act since 1975. Of course there were issues which could have justified inquiries- the Concorde coming to Australia, the wood chip industry on the South Coast of New South Wales, the nuclear powered warship or submarine coining to Australian waters and the Omega base in Victoria. None of these matters has been the subject of any inquiry under that Act. The Environmental impact allocation for public hearings is down from $694,300 in 1975-76, to $507,268 in 1976-77, to $65,000 in 1977-78. That is a drop of $629,000 in three years. That is in regard to environmental impact statements. I know that we were promised an inquiry in respect of the Concorde aircraft, but the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> apparently took unilateral action. </para>
          <para class="block">He made his own decision. The aircraft came flying in. The Act was totally disregarded. The Government promised in its election policy on environment and conservation a public inquiry on the wood chip industry. That promise has been dishonoured. </para>
          <para>The air pollution monitoring program has been cut from $275,000 in 1975-76 to $75,000 in 1977-78. 1 think a matter of concern is that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development has allowed his Department to be whittled away. The staff ceilings have affected the environmental area quite considerably. We hope that the next Minister responsible for these matters will fight and will be more successful in trying to maintain adequate staff for the purpose. I probably should pack up at that point. I am being very co-operative because of the time restraint, as I understand it. </para>
          <para>I think a lot more could be done about marine pollution. I would have liked to have said quite a bit about this subject. It is a very serious matter. In New South Wales waters alone there have been more than 40 incidents involving oil pollution from ships in the last 12 months. There has been no reduction in the number of spillages in the last 12 months. It is as plain as a pikestaff that greater resources and greater effort must be put into this. I am grateful for the opportunity to have spoken. I feel tempted to say a little more. I am getting the nod from the Government Whip that I have had a fair crack of the whip so I am prepared to leave it at that and convey my ap- preciation for the attentive audience that I have ad. I wish all my parliamentary opponents a vigorous fight in the forthcoming election. I can assure them that when the Labor Government is elected we will certainly be giving to environmental matters the kind of attention that they would like to see given. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I will not speak for long, but I think I must respond to some of the half truths and exaggerations that were trotted out as usual by the two old faithfuls from the Opposition, the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline> If their concern for the truth half matched their concern for the environment, I think they would be a lot better off. Let me put the facts on this matter of the Government's concern for the environment and conservation. This Government's record in these matters is impeccable. We have a record of concern. We have a record of action. We have a record which shows a practical application of a range of programs and policies. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me go through them quickly. We have continued to subscribe in a very vigorous way to and have provided leadership for two councilsthe Australian Environmental Council and the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers. We have continued programs on air quality. We have continued programs on soil conservation. We have introduced new programs detailing the hazards of chemicals. The honourable member for Hughes, typically, has no concern for the voluntary organisations that run environmental centres for the conservation groups around the countryside. The arrangement for sharing, which I think is perfectly reasonable, will continue on the same basis as last year. For every $ 1 that they raise, we will give them $2. We are not reverting to the dollar for dollar basis, as the honourable member for Hughes suggested. It is also wrong to say that we will be going down to $300,000 this year. We will maintain the same level of programs as last year- $400,000. In addition to continuing support for those voluntary organisations, we have continued under the States grants legislation to provide money for those States which wish to acquire land for national 1 larks and so on. We have amended that legislation so that we can help the States with management facilities. We are doing that in Tasmania in the wilderness area known as the South West National Park. </para>
          <para>The statutory bodies have a magnificent record. Again it is a vigorous record. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is surging ahead. I hope that in the near future we will be able to declare the first zone in that magnificent area in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The Australian Heritage Commission has proceeded to put thousands of places on the national list. It has been very helpful also in making recommendations, for example, about the national conservation voluntary groups and those who will be funded under the Australian Heritage Commission Act. In that respect we have increased the figures this year, not to the $ 1 .5m about which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking, but to $2.55m which will keep the Australian Heritage Commission Act moving along so that areas and places that need help will continue to receive it. </para>
          <para>We come to the linchpin of our policies, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The honourable member for Hughes is either ignorant or just being provocative in this place, because the things he said are totally untrue. We began our inquiries with the Fraser </para>
          <para class="block">Island issue. We acted decisively, with determination and with courage. That island will become part not only of Australia's heritage but also of the world heritage. The honourable member for Hughes implied that by not putting money into the Budget allocation we therefore would not be looking at any public inquiries. There has not been a need for a public inquiry. I am sure the honourable member for Hughes knows that if there were a need money would be provided out of the advance to the Treasurer. It is as simple as that. The honourable member for Hughes claimed that there should have been inquiries into other matters. We have acted under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, whether the matter in question was the Concorde aircraft or wood chipping on the south coast of New South Wales. There is no question about that. Let me educate him a little about the Act, because obviously he does not know it. Under the Act there are two alternativeseither a public inquiry or administrative procedures with an environmental impact statement. I chose the environmental impact statement. That was legitimate and it was certainly the correct thing to do in those matters. </para>
          <para>I will finish on the question of uranium in the Northern Territory. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried to pretend that the Government was going to ignore the environmental promises it had made in regard to the development of uranium mining in the Northern Territory and the declaration of the Kakadu National Park. He brought in the red herring of the Australian Atomic Energy Act. The Act has absolutely no bearing on this argument. We have made our position quite clear. I will go through those procedures again. We will declare the Kakadu National Park as soon as we can. There has been a delay because the matter has to be arranged so that the Aboriginals may get their land rights established and lease the land back to us. Already the Acting Supervising Scientist is working with a committee of specialists and the Northern Territory Administration on establishing the monitoring requirements that will precede the establishment of mines in the area. </para>
          <para>In summary, let there be no mistake either in this House or among the people who may be listening to this broadcast. This Government is concerned with the environment and conservation issues. We can point to a history of action in the last 22 months. It is a record of action that was not matched by the Opposition when it was in government and had a chance to do some of the things about which Opposition members have been talking in this place this afternoon. </para>

              <para>- In a way I suppose that they introduced some of it, but this is one of the more interesting pieces of legislation of this Parliament in the long haul to obtain reasonable retirement provisions for the people in the defence services. There has been a continuous struggle by people on both sides of the House and people outside the House to remove some of the anomalies between the Public Service superannuation schemes and schemes such as this one. The liberalisation in this legislation covers the spouse who is widowed after the retirement of the serviceman and who remarries, and the spouse who married the pensioner after the pensioner attained the age of 60 years. It is interesting that it has always been difficult to have such reforms accepted as reasonable social security projects. Ever since I entered this Parliament we have had discussions of this nature. I do not know why it has taken 20 years to liberalise these matters. I recall 1 7 or 1 8 years ago having a discussion with the Commonwealth Actuary, on behalf of a committee outside of this to which I belonged, in which I raised the case of the widow of a serviceman who remarried after the servicemen's retirement. The horror that the Actuary brought to the discussion when it was suggested that we ought to disregard the peculiarity of her situation and bestow the normal benefit was almost incredible. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I hope that the Bill is gratefully received throughout the system. I think the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> has had something to do with recent developments in this field. A former member for La Trobe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Jess, and a committee of this Parliament had a good deal to do with updating the scheme. If I remember rightly- I would hate to introduce politics at this stage of this Parliament- it was the Labor Government which implemented most of that committee's recommendations and started things on their way. So we all have had a part in it, but we all have been a part also of the illiberal interpretations of the system. </para>
          <para>This afternoon 1 remind honourable members and the people responsible for drafting this legislation and for the examination of the scheme of the situation of those officers who retired, I think, prior to 1962. 1 am open to correction, but from a glance at the speech I think we have not brought servicemen up to date with the people who retired post-1962. </para>

              <para>- That is correct, 1972. I know servicemen of long and distinguished service who were gravely disadvantaged by this failure to introduce what might be called 'catch-up ' provisions. I know of one soldier who graduated from Duntroon towards the end of the First World War, went overseas, served in the regular Army continuously during the period of peace, was in Europe at the beginning of the Second World War, formed a battalion and carried it through to battlefields and who rose to the rank, I think, of brigadier and ultimately retired as a lieutenant-general. I do not know exactly what his pension is, but I would guess that it is very low down in the system. It is probably not much better than the pension of a person who served for 10 or 12 years, who may have seen no active service at all and who retired as a lieutenant or a warrant officer or something of that order. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>Some years ago when we first started to discuss this matter only 7,000 or 8,000 people were involved. There is an incredible meanness in the system when we come to discuss matters such as this in relation to pensions, whether they be pensions of servicemen or other folk. Such meanness was reflected in the Act governing parliamentary pensions. There were certain restrictions on the widow's pension if the member had married after a certain age <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> within a certain period before his retirement. I do not think those things are justifiable. </para>
          <para>I was saying here this afternoon, as I have said on a lot of occasions in this place, that when we are speaking about people who put on the uniform to serve in the armed Services, they accept a totally different responsibility from that of any of us who do not do so. It may well be that a person will serve for 20 years and will not move far from headquarters or from barracks. It may well be that a person enlists in the Services and within a few months he is in some totally unexpected situation such as Vietnam and his life or his health is forfeited. It is a totally different quality of service. Therefore it cannot be evaluated in any way in terms of money. So this afternoon I am grateful, on behalf of those people in my electorate who will benefit from this legislation, for the fact that something more has happened. I hope that in the not too distant future we will be in a position to take up all the anomalies and iron them out. That ought to apply to other systems too. This is one of those cases in which the superannuation scheme for public servants has been a trendsetter. </para>
          <para>This afternoon in the last few minutes of this Parliament I am grateful for the opportunity to speak uninterrupted. I noted that as I rose to speak an increasing number of people, including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> came into the chamber to listen. It has been one of my great sorrows that the right honourable gentle.man who was elected to this Parliament at the same time as myself and who made his maiden speech on the same night as I did, has refused to benefit from the continual advice I have given him about his political views. However, he is still not too old to be corrected. As I make what I suppose is going to be one of the last speeches of this Parliament, I remind the House that I made one of the first speeches of the Parliament on the day we elected the  Speaker.  Honourable members will be interested to note that, having spoken for what amounted to about a third of a column in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> the present right honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who represents that constituency for the time being, had the question put and I was gagged. I hope that this afternoon we will depart from this Parliament with some sense of responsibility for the parliamentary system. </para>
          <para>One is critical of the short time allotted for this debate. This is a very lengthly piece of legislation; it has 51 clauses; it is a very complicated piece of legislation. But we have no time to deate it. The sheer arithmetic of this Parliament means that we will not have time to debate legislation such as this in the future either. If 80 or 90 pieces of legislation such as this are brought down and we try to fit them in end to end during the parliamentary year, there is no way in which that can be done. Therefore there has to be a legislative committee system. I hope that we will get round to that so that we can start to feel more as though we are in a participating parliamentary democracy. </para>
          <para>I shall refrain from speaking during the adjournment debate this afternoon but will express my thoughts now. I do not know what one wishes honourable members opposite on an occasion such as this. I will be going out into electorates to try to entice the people to see otherwise than do honourable members opposite and to encourage them to return people who represent the forces of progress and justice as do members on my side of the House. I have no doubt that vigorous campaigns will be conducted by honourable members opposite in the electorate of Wills to try to remove me. At least they will drive through the electorate on occasions, but I suppose they will not stop. On the whole, one can only say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that under your benign guidance and the way in which you conducted the affairs of the House- and you have improved through 22 years' association with me- the House has overcome many great difficulties and troubles that come from the tensions that arise in it. On the whole, one finds that most members are personable, that they are easy to get along with when travelling interstate or overseas on parliamentary committees. I hope that the spirit of good sense, good judgment and bonhomie we bring to occasions such as this will eventually extend to the consideration of social legislation such as that now before the House and that, instead of taking 20 years to drift and trudge through the liberalising of matters, we will get on with it from day one and will do things properly from the very beginning. </para>

            <para>- I shall take only a moment of the time of the House to mention this legislation. Firstly, I thank the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> for allowing the legislation to come before the House today. With the pressure of business there was some risk earlier that we might not have been able to fit it in. This legislation, of course, is terribly important to a large number of people throughout Australia, particularly to ex-servicemen in the Australian Capital Territory whom I represent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should like to touch upon the two most important parts of the legislation. The first is the non-cessation in future of the spouse's pension on remarriage. This is a very important piece of progress, not only for ex-servicemen in general, ut also for women in particular. The second most important part of the legislation is the nondetriment provisions to protect certain late entrant officers transferring to the new scheme against any possible diminution of their pension entitlement for which they were contributing at the time of transfer. The amendment is to be effective from the date of commencement of the present scheme, namely, 1 October 1972. Other parts of the legislation are aimed at overcoming anomalies and technical defects in the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation. I commend the legislation to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This is the end of the Thirtieth Parliament Members of the House and half the Senate will submit themselves to the will of the people, and it will be my pleasure early in the new year to see the opening of the Thirty-first Parliament, again from this side of the House. Before we depart, before the House is dissolved, I should like to pay a tribute to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the way in which you have discharged the dudes of your high office. It is your task to maintain the dignity of this place, and you have done so in the best traditions of your predecessors, with moderation and with humour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> if I may say so, you have not always been given the entire assistance which you should have been given by members of the House. </para>
          <para>Assisting you have been the  Chairman  of Committees, the  Clerk  and his officers in this place. We are likewise indebted to them for the effective operation of the Parliament. You will know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that there are many others who work in the House and who contribute in many ways to the comfort and convenience of all honourable members. We are grateful to them all. Among them I would like to mention the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff for their unfailing attention to their duties and for their general efforts to improve the quality of our language and the way in which it reads for posterity. I can remember an occasion when a former member for Bonython, who had a habit of stringing his sentences together, complained about the manner in which <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> had altered his language and, in part, had altered his meaning. He asked that he be reported precisely and exactly as he spoke. I am referring to an earlier member for Bonython, going back some considerable time. On the next occasion on which he made a 30-minute speech he was reported precisely as he spoke- in one sentence without end. Let that be a warning to honourable gentlemen who complain about the way in which <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> sometimes improves thengrammar. To be reported exactly as one speaks is not always to one 's advantage. </para>
          <para>The staff of the Parliamentary Library are always ready to help honourable members with inquiries and research. I think the manner in which that Department has been established and expanded in recent times has added greatly to the capacity for work of honourable members. I would like to thank Roger Webb, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, who has done so much to see that there is smooth working in this building. I thank those who work in the refreshment rooms and who look after us during the long hours that we are in this building; the attendants for their cheerful courtesy to each of us as we come and go about our work; those who order cars and vehicles to make sure that honourable members get here on time and that they get to wherever they are staying at night; and lastly those who arrange our travel to and from Canberra at the beginning and end of each week. We are all indebted to them for their efficient service. Without any one aspect of their activities the Parliament would not function as an efficient and proper place. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>this Government came to office at a time of some difficulty for Australia. On the ministry has fallen a heavy burden of responsibility. So on this occasion I want to place on record my personal appreciation for the Ministers' dedicated work and for the way in which they have worked as a team. Behind the ministry are the hard working members and their staffs, and also those in Government departments who work beyond and out of sight but whose labours contribute in a very real way to the successful continuance of executive government. I believe that Australia is very well served by the quality of its public servants, by their dedication to the service of Australia and by their apolitical approach to the problems that confront them. It is cardinal in our system that the Public Service be able to support a government of this complexion or a government of another complexion and do it so that Ministers and Prime Ministers can have complete and absolute confidence in the quality of its advice, in its integrity and in the way in which it goes about its business. The Australian Public Service stands high amongst the public services of the world. I believe that this country can be grateful for it. Ministers particularly, and former Ministers, know of the dedication and efficiency of public servants. I am sure that all of us mark it with appreciation. </para>
          <para>It is appropriate in a speech at the end of a parliamentary session for me to say a special word about my colleague the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who has had the difficult task of making sure that the program of government business is managed smoothly and effectively. I believe he has done so in a way that has generally found acceptance on all sides of the House. He has used the gag and the guillotine a good deal less than some of his predecessors used it, and there has been proper and useful time for debate on matters of importance. So I express my thanks to him and to the Government Whips for their work in making sure that honourable members are where they ought to be at the appropriate time. </para>
          <para>The Government and this House owe a special debt to the First Parliamentary Counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Quayle,</inline> and to his staff. These officers have unfailingly given the Parliament Bills of consistently high excellence even when the time has been short or the urgency pressing. The quality of their work is not only a tribute to then: profession, it is also a tribute to Australia. The quality of the Acts of this Parliament, the laws which we are sent here to make, is testimony to their fine work. </para>
          <para>I also express my appreciation to my colleagues on this side of the House. They have co-operated wholeheartedly with the Government and have contributed to the debates and the proceedings of this place, and to the formation of policy to their own and to the Government's credit. Tins Parliament has seen some important reforms in the scope of its own operations. Chief among them is the introduction of the Expenditure Committee. That Committee has been in operation scarcely a year but the value of its work is already being seen. I believe that the very fact of its existence tends to make departments more careful of their expenditures. I extend the Government's appreciation to the first  chairman  and to the present  chairman  of the Committee for their important pioneering work. I hope that early in the next Parliament a move can be made for the establishment of legislation committees, in which I know you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have a keen interest but which the pressure of buiness unfortunately led to be put aside over the course of this year. </para>
          <para>Finally, some of our colleagues have already signified their intention not to stand again for election to this House. Others will be seeking their fortunes elsewhere by nominating for another House- by nominating for the Senate. To each of those who are resolved not to return we extend our best wishes for the future. Firstly there is the present father of the House and indeed father of the Parliament the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley).</inline> He was first elected in 194S and since then has given long and honourable service to this House, to his electors and to this nation. I believe that he is one of those to whom Australia owes a debt for the long and dedicated service to his Party and to Australia. He was a distinguished Minister for Education in the former Government. We wish him health, happiness and good fortune in his retirement. </para>
          <para>Two more honourable gentlemen who were Ministers of the previous Government will be retiring. I refer to the honourable member for Lalor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean.</inline> I am sure that every member of this House wishes them both well for the future. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is in the chamber at the present time. He too has been in the Parliament for a very long while, acting out of a sense of dedication and a sense of those things in which he believes to the service of his party and to the service of Australia. May I say that the Parliament will be a worse place for his departure. I am sure that aU of us wish them well for the future. </para>
          <para>Four honourable gentlemen are retiring to seek election to greener pastures, in the Senate. I suppose that, after considering the colour of the chairs, I should have said 'redder pastures' in the Senate. I refer to the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> Perhaps the change of colour will not suite him. I refer also to the honourable member for Hotham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp),</inline> the honourable member for Tangney <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Richardson)</inline> and the honourable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer).</inline> I wish the honourable member for Isaacs well. Among the members of the Government parties may I mention the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> and the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King).</inline> I join with all their colleagues in extending my best wishes to them for the future. The honourable member for Herbert in particular has given a great deal of attention to the problems of ex-servicemen. I am certain that they recognise that and are grateful for it, as I am and as this Parliament is. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Wimmera and I, holding adjoining seats, have been neighbours in politics for a very long while. I believe that even when, at times, there has been little warmth between our organisations, as sometimes occurs in the best of families, there has always been the best of relations between Bob King and myself. I could not wish for a better neighbour in a neighbouring electorate than Bob King. I thank him very much for his friendship in the years in which we have held adjoining electorates. I know that he will be living not quite in my electorate but in an electorate just to the north and I am sure he will be around for a long while to come. As Leader of the Government I thank both the honourable member for Wimmera and Duke Bonnett for their loyalty and hard work over many years. I would also like to mention the good work of the honourable member for Evans, John Abel.  His  time here has been aU to brief. It was cut short through the decision of the Distribution Commissioners. I am confident that he will return as a member of this House on some future occasion. Unfortunately, Distribution Commissioners happen to be one of the hazards that members of Parliament have to run. That can be said with feeling by many people in different places from time to time. I believe that one of the merits of this Parliament is that it has had an electoral system which has, by and large, resulted in a fair distribution of seats in the Par.liament, much more than in some Parliaments. I think it is to the credit of the Commonwealth Parliament that this is so. </para>
          <para>We are fast coming to the end of this Parliament. Over the last two years we have had before us a heavy program of legislation and other parliamentary business. We have sat for a total of 1,400 hours- I did not collect the statistics so I hope somebody is right- and more than 360 Bills have been passed. That seems a very great number. Honourable members have placed more than 4,000 questions on notice. As I have said, there was much to be done and much remains to be done. The Government is going to the people confident that it has achieved the first stage of new policies and new directions for the welfare of Australia. It looks forward to taking up the task again after the elections. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>of all the rituals of this House the one we are engaged in at present has fallen into the longest disuse. Not since October 1972 have we taken the opportunity to make valedictories of this kind. The Parliaments in April 1974 and November 1975 adjourned rather too hurriedly for us to make these remarks. Accordingly, I shall keep my remarks very brief. I realise that many people outside the Parliament are unkind enough to think that if we say something unpleasant on these occasions we are being provocative and if we say something pleasant we are being insincere. </para>

          <para>May I therefore support the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his tributes to those many hundreds of men and women- up to about 1,000-who work in this building. This is one of the most industrious office blocks or factories or plants in the country. Nobody works a 40 hour week here. It would be impossible for us to do our jobs but for the assistance of a very great number of skilled, good humoured and dedicated servants of the Parliament and, through it, of the country. I also support the Prime Minister in the references he has made to those of us who have announced that we will not again be standing for Parliament. Three of them have been Ministers of mine. The honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> the father of the Parliament, entered this House in August 1945. He was only 27 years of age. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> entered the Parliament in 195 1 but had served in two parliaments in Victoria before that. The honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> has served in the Parliament for 22 years. The honourable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garrick)</inline> has served here for eight years but before that had given long public service in local government as a mayor and for nine years as a member of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. </para>
          <para>There are two members of the Government parties who have announced that they will not be standing for Parliament again. One is the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King),</inline> apparently the last person so to be described in this House. The other is the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett).</inline> I can say with complete sincerity that I have been to Herbert on very many occasions and to Wimmera on some occasions. On all those occasions in both electorates I have enjoyed the company of these men. They are very good representatives of their electorates. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I do not propose to single out any other persons for reference. We live an extraordinarily arduous and competitive lifestyle here. I suppose we can take some wry satisfaction from the fact that hundreds of people try at elections to serve in this arduous and competitive environment. I hope that the public benefits from that. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>it would not be proper for me to conclude my remarks on this occasion without referring to yourself. I had some qualms recently when you went to South Korea because the last  Speaker  who took time off to go there did not survive the ensuing election. I can say, I believe with complete truth, that you are the only member of your Party who has enhanced his reputation in this Parliament in the eyes of both those who sit on your right and those who sit on your left. May I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> when we next assemble and I change sides on this table I look forward, as I said last week, to scrutinising you once again in your proper position of Leader of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- In my role as Leader of the House and also on behalf of my leader, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> who cannot be here this afternoon, I too would like to say a few words, again on my own behalf and also on behalf of members of the National Country Parry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to you, your  Deputy,  the  Deputy  Chairmen, the  Clerk,  the  Deputy Clerk,  the  Deputy  Serjeant-at-Arms, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> people, the Table Office, the Parliamentary Librarian, to all those who service us behind this chamber, I would like to extend the thanks of those who sit with me on the National Country Party benches. On behalf of them all I would say that it is through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that each one of those people is able to exercise his responsibility in this place and we thank you for the distinction which you have given to the position which you now occupy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To two people who assist me particularly in my duties as Leader of the House, I would like also to extend my thanks. I think that all members of this House owe a particular debt of gratitude to Arthur Dyster who was Parliamentary Liaison Officer, and then to Roger Webb. As honourable members will recall, Arthur Dyster was with my predecessor, the former member for Grayndler, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fred</inline> Daly, for the whole period when the Labor Party was in government. He then served in that capacity with us. He was replaced during this Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roger</inline> Webb. Both men in their way have served this Parliament extraordinarily well and effectively. Not one of those statistics that have been read this afternoon would have been possible if it had not been for the manner and efficacy of the operation of those two gentlemen. Behind them, of course, are the members of the Australian Public Service who, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> so rightly said, serve the people of Australia far better than many of those people frequently acknowledge. They are frequently not heard of and their merits are unsung. Frequently we as parliamentarians criticise them. Yet they serve very effectively the whole of the Parliament and, I believe, the people of Australia. As those of us who are Ministers and those who have been Ministers know only too well, the business of the Government and of the Parliament would be quite impossible were it not for the many hours of devotion they render. </para>
          <para>The attendants, in this place, the members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, aU serve the Parliament. They have aU made this Thirtieth Parliament effective and operative. To my counterpart in the Opposition, the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> I also would like to extend my thanks. I believe this Parliament has worked well. It is extraordinarily difficult, in either the role that he fills or the role I for the time being occupy, to ensure a reasonable opportunity for the members of this Parliament to speak on issues on which they feel deeply and yet enable reasonable time for the passage of Legislation necessary for the conclusion of Government business. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gordon</inline> Scholes I would like to extend my particular thanks. </para>
          <para>There are, as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam' have said, a number of members who are leaving this place. I too would like to join in extending to each of them both my own and my Party's best wishes for a long and happy retirement. To the father of the Parliament the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley),</inline> and to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)-</inline> both long serving and very distinguished members of the Opposition-I would like to extend my own personal best wishes, and of course in their own Party there are members such as the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> and others who may well not come back. </para>
          <para>In the ranks of my own Party, to the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King)</inline> I would like to extend particular mention. He has served in an area that has not been easy to hold over the years.  His  record in standing for eight elections and coming back on each occasion effectively is, I think, a tribute to the man and his representation. There is no doubt that the difficulties of the holder of the wheat seats during those years of 1960s needs to be recalled by those of us who have been associated with the agricultural industry perhaps more than those others in this place. The wheat seats have always been fairly active in their support for their own particular cause and the man who has been able to hold the support of those who sometimes are advocating differing causes, I believe deserves particular mention. To the honourable member for Wimmera, I do wish a long and happy retirement. I do not doubt that he will be back about the place in other ways at other times. </para>
          <para>To other members of the Government parties who also are stepping down- the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett),</inline> the honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Abel)</inline> and the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> all of whom in different ways have served this place in a most effective way. I again would like to extend my best wishes for success in whichever endeavour they pursue and to say to them that, like many other members of this place, I have enjoyed a particular association with them. </para>
          <para>We all are about to embark on a particularly arduous round. I am glad that this session of paying compliments to those who have made the running of this place possible has returned. It is interesting that it should have been in October 1 972 when it last transpired. I trust that when the next Parliament rises three years hence a similar occasion might well again be repeated and that we from this side of the House might be expressing similar sentiments. </para>

            <para>-I would like to add a few words to those already uttered by the party leaders. In particular to my colleagues the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> the honourable member for Lalor, <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> and to two close friends I have on the Government side, the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> and the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King)</inline> and to other members, I wish them well in their retirement or in their attempts to come back to Parliament. I particularly want to add something to the careers of and the esteem in which members on this side of the House hold the three retiring Labor members. It has been for me as a young man in Parliament a great privilege to have had the benefit of eight years of the company and companionship of the honourable member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Lalor. When you come to Parliament as a young man you always seek to gather experience quickly, but that is something that comes to you over a long period of time and the only way of short-circuiting the system is to take the advice and have the camaraderie of other men. This I have done with the three members I have mentioned and I have listened and learned a great deal from them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the thing that has to be admired in the three of them is that they have maintained their sense of equilibrium and sanity throughout 23 years in opposition in Federal Parliament. It is a sad commentary, I think, on the Westminster system that the talent, commitment and dedication of those three members have been denied to the Australian people because of the vagaries and the structure of this political system in that they had been left languishing for 23 years in opposition before they got an opportunity to display any administrative finesse or to make any commitment to the Australian people. In the bad years of Labor when there was division in the Party and in those many years in Opposition, they managed to stand by their principles and then to take an active part in the Whitlam Administration with a clarity of purpose which I think was obvious to aU observers. </para>
          <para>In respect of the honourable member for Fremantle, his commitment to Australian education and the fact that he removed it from the political football field will stand to his everlasting testament. For most of his 23 years in Parliament the honourable member for Melbourne Ports stood where I am standing now, enunciating the principles of Labor on the economic front and his commitment as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. These years will stand him in good stead. My friend the honourable member for Lalor whose valiant fight against those on the other side of the House m terms of the war in Vietnam and other unpopular issues, also stands in high esteem in the eyes of this nation. These are three men who came to Parliament with principles and I hope that in the years that follow the young men who come- and they aU come as young men- to Canberra do not come here just to take a seat in the Parliament, but to make a contribution based on principles which they have developed over the years and with which they stay. I just hope that they will not go away disillusioned, as these three men could have gone away, when they saw the system that they persisted with for 23 years ripped from underneath them by the actions of the Queen's representative. That did nothing for the standing of Parliament. It did nothing for those on this side of the House who believe in the parliamentary institution, and it was poor testament to three people who maintained their principles when they got the chance which they won at election to administer the poliCies of this nation that it was denied to them. </para>
          <para>So I join in saying on behalf of some of the younger men in the Parliament that I have enjoyed their company immensely and the right to have served with them in the Labor Party in the House of Representatives. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-I thank the honourable members who have made reference to my service in this place over recent years. Some 19 years ago I stood in this place a very nervous but proud man to make my maiden speech as a representative of the well known seat of Wimmera in Victoria. Today with only a few minutes at my disposal I think I can say that this a rather sad occasion as it is my final address to this chamber- not because I want to leave this place; not because I want to leave my constituents; not because my constituents want me to leave. The reason is a decision of the Parliament to redistribute the boundaries of the Australian electorates, and I do not dispute this. It hurts me because of the fact that I am losing direct contact with my constituents. The result is that for the first time since 1 90 1 there will be no seat of Wimmera. Nineteen years ago I spoke proudly of the importance of that well known area in western Victoria. Today I wish to say just a few words about other issues. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>First and foremost I want to say with all the sincerity I possess how much I have appreciated the great support and the confidence of the people in the electorate of Wimmera in selecting me as their representative for a period of 19 years less 12 days. I am very proud of the fact that I am the longest serving member for that area since 1901. 1 also am very proud of another issue. Without boasting may I say that the worst vote I ever received was on my first election, my best vote percentagewise ever recorded was on my last election. There is only one consolation, that is, that I am handing over my seat to four very capable members-my colleague and very close friend, Peter Fisher, John Bourchier, Jim Short and no less a man than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I know that they all are the types of representatives who are acceptable and that unless further redistributions affect thennew electorates I would expect all four to remain in this place until they wish to retire gracefully. </para>
          <para>I take this opportunity to thank many members of this Parliament- I include members of all three parties; but naturally I make particular reference to the members of my own party, including its leader, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)-</inline> for their great assistance and cooperation over the years. I have made many friends in this place. I only hope that from time to time I can come back and renew old acquaintances. I thank all the officers and staff for their great assistance, as without it life in this place certainly would be much more difficult. I make special reference to one man who I believe stands out in particular, and that is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gordon</inline> Pike. To use an old Australian cliche, he is a real white man. Nothing is too difficult for him. He is always pleasant, obliging and most efficient. I am sure that when that man retires he will be missed greatly. </para>
          <para>I pay a tribute to the many members of the various departments who have been very cooperative over the years. I refer particularly to officers in the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. I do not exclude my own personal staff over these 19 years. I have always received the highest co-operation possible from them which, I believe, helps to create great harmony between officers, members and the public. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and aU your predecessors and your supporting colleagues for the continued tolerance of me and no doubt of other members of this place. </para>
          <para>I regret one thing as a result of leaving this place, one might say, a year early. I refer to the numerous issues that were commenced but not finalised because of lack of time. I do not wish to spell them out at this late hour, but one particular case stands out in my mind. It is an immigration case that should have been finalised long before this. It has been running for 3V4 years. I refer to the case known as the Chui Kwok Chui case. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> knows the story. I hope that he can clear up this matter in the very near future. It is an instance which involves no fault of Australian officers. It relates to a lack of co-operation, I believe, in the country in which this gentleman resides. I wish the Prime Minister every success in the forthcoming weeks. I am sure that, if the people judge him on his performance, his pohcies and his desire to return Australia to where it was on the world standards of a few years ago, he will be returned on 10 December in a resounding victory. </para>

            <para>-I propose to be very brief, but the references that have been made to me have been so gracious that I must acknowledge them. I must say that I looked up apprehensively to see my halo, but I did not discover one there. Haloes have a habit of getting battered in election campaigns; so if I have one it W111 not be battered over the next few weeks. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> did yourself less than justice when you said last night that I had administered a father of a hiding to you in an election in which we were opponents. You actually reduced my majority enormously in the election of 1949. Unlike the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King),</inline> who said that he had his lowest vote when he first came into Parliament and his highest at his last election, I had my highest vote at the second election in which I participated and my lowest vote at the last election, in December 1975. I come to the depressing conclusion that either there are great swings of opinion or I have retired in time because the electorate was beginning to find me out. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>first of all, I thank you for the grace and impartiality with which you have occupied that chair. It is a very difficult position in our Parliament. It is not so difficult in the House of Commons because of the acceptance of the  Speaker  there. You have fulfilled the office with great grace. You are beginning to be a  Speaker  whose words appear in the sayings of the week, and they are very wise sayings. Let me give you one of your predecessors utterances to me. The late Archie Cameron gave me a definition that really deserves a place in every Australian textbook on politiCS. He said to me: 'A referendum, my dear Beazley, is an appeal from those who know or ought to know to those who don't know and can't be bothered finding out'. He told me that that is what I would find over the years about referenda. I am not quite sure that that is what I found. I also thank the <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr Pettifer,</inline> and his assistants who on many occasions have given me very valuable help. He is one of a procession of Clerks as far as I am concerned. Frank Green was the  Clerk  when I came here. There was then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tregear, Sir Alan</inline> Turner and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes,</inline> and now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pettifer,</inline> all of whom were great forces for my education. Frank Green always used to say either that he was going to ring up  His  Holiness, which meant that he was going to take VAT 69, or that he was going to pay his respects to the British Royal Family, which meant that he was going for a George IV. I remember these utterances from when I was first elected. </para>
          <para>When I was first elected we had a Whip who, when the bells rang, would go out into the lobby on the Government side- we were the Government at that time- and in a stentorian voice roar down the passage: 'Factory whistle. Say those Protestant prayers'. I offer that to the Government Whip <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier).</inline> We then were obliged to hurry into the House. Those are memories. If I look at the benches there is a procession in the mist of many members, many of them dead, who really served the Australian people very well. I know that that sounds like a cliche, but they really did. If I look back over my 32 years, I think that the Australian community has got a very high quality of representation. If it has, of course, that is what it deserves. </para>
          <para>I think that some things are going wrong with Parliament. I have said that on various occasions. I do not propose to dwell on them now. I hope that all honourable members who are going to the election campaign will be able to battle well and to keep to the real issues. Bernard Shaw once said that an election was a moral horror like a war, only without the bloodshed. I do not think it is necessary for an election to be fought that way. I think that we sometimes become quite childish in this Parliament and think that everything marvellous originated on our side and everything disastrous originated on the other side. I do not think that is true. I have not been in the Parliamentary Labor Party, most of the time, in what might be called one of its lucky periods. The Labor movement has going through it all the tides of conflict that develop in the community. I have tremendous gratitude for all the colleagues I have had, including those with whom I have disagreed. I have tremendous respect for the new younger members. When I saw my colleague, the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program last weekend, I thought his analytical style was superb. I believe that that method will take him a long way in politics. He was very briefly a Cabinet colleague of mine, before our careers in Cabinet were terminated somewhat abruptly. I say to the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that, if we did not observe this custom of paying aU these gracious tributes, it was not exactly our choice; it was as a result of the abrupt termination of Parliament </para>
          <para>I thank my colleagues in the Parliamentary Labor Party for the confidence that they showed in me. I believe that their numbers will be augmented greatly in this election. I will not go into these controversies. I am now becoming a non.political figure in one sense. I wish them all the very best of luck. To all those who will be in the next Parliament let me say that I hope that it will be a fruitful and creative 31st Parliament. My first Parliament I think was the 17th and my last is the 30th. I can honestly say that in tumult or in comparative calm I have enjoyed them all. </para>

            <para>-I appreciate the opportunity to address the House for a few minutes. As previous speakers have mentioned, for health reasons I am not seeking re-endorsement for my seat of Herbert. This will be the last time that I can enjoy the honour and the privilege of speaking in this famous chamber. I have been very conscious of the privilege extended to me by the people in the federal seat of Herbert, in electing me in the last S elections which have covered 1 1 years. To be their representative has been a privilege of which I have been extremely proud. During those 1 1 years I have enjoyed the friendship of honourable members on both sides of this House and in the Senate, and your friendship, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I should like to stress how much I have appreciated those friendships. I should like to think that we can continue them in the future. </para>

I have appreciated their constant courtesy and their willingness to assist me at all times more than mere words can describe. To the various Ministers' staffs and the departmental officials and the staff of the whips' offices over the 1 1 years that I have been worrying them with my famous maul a Minister day that used to happen once a fortnight, I say thank you kindly for your valuable assistance to me and my electorate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> and members of the chamber, I wish you aU the best of luck in the forthcoming election, but more importantly I wish you all the best of health in the coming years. I have always regarded it as a great honour to serve in the Federal Parliament of this great country, an honour that comes to relatively few men among our Australian people. I sincerely thank you all once again. </para>

            <para>-I thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> for what he said about my going into the Senate. In regard to the red seats, if I can say what Shakespeare should have written, I hope I will be making the red one green. It is said that at this time all one's life passes before one. This would not be credible if people had not survived to tell it. I hope that now in a flash of time my recollection of what has happened in this Parliament presages nothing for me. Anyway, honourable members can be certain that I do not go gentle into that good night. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I came to this Parliament in 1949 with one thing primarily in my mind. It was not something which I meant to do but which I hoped would be done and in which I would play a tiny part in getting it done. It was not done. I wanted to see that the world would sieze the opportunity for nuclear disarmament before proliferation. I believed then that that was the time for it to be done and that if it were not done then the world would be a worse place from then on. Now we wait for the hatching of that dreadful nuclear egg and we wonder what will come out of it. I fear that I was right then. I regret more than ever not my failing, because I could play only the tiniest part, but I regret this ambition failing. </para>
          <para>Now I have had to leave my party. I did this not just because I felt that what was being done here on the economic scene was wrong; I did it also because I believed that what was being done here was part of something on a world scene which was being done wrong and that the establishment, by its restrictive policies, by its failure to understand the real nature of the economic process, was precipitating the world again into 1929. It is to me a relief that in the last few months there has been some indication that the world is drawing back from this, that there is some greater sense now in the economists overseas. </para>
          <para>I hope that when I am in the Senate it will not be too hard for me to get a change in the present Government's policies-I believe it will be returnedbecause overall world policy on which it has been based and of which it is an imitation is now changing. What I want I think will happen by the course of events. I go into the Senate hoping to do something about unfinished business. I am not going to detail it here but from what I have said in this House over nearly 28 years now- honourable members know how many loose ends I hope to ravel up, the things that I want to get done. I go into the Senate with the intention of getting those things done and knowing that I have something still to do and something I can still give to Australia. Tomorrow, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to fresh woods and pastures new. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>this is the last occasion that you will have the opportunity of calling the honourable member for Evans. I regret personally that the name of Evans has been removed from the list of electorates in New South Wales. But I, like my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King),</inline> accept the fact that redistribution was necessary, and that my seat had to suffer. Last night in a fair fight I lost Liberal Party preselection for the new seat of Lowe, which now contains 41 per cent of the electors from my old seat of Evans that was, as I have just said, recently abolished. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMahon, the right honourable member for Lowe who won the pre-selection, has my total support as the endorsed Liberal candidate for that seat. I wish him every success in the election on 10 December so that our policies and our legislative program may continue to have community acceptance. I shall be giving all my energies to his campaign. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> will be fortunate indeed to have the loyal and active support of so many of my constituents. With my team we will be working hard to ensure that Lowe remains Liberal with our former Prime Minister as the member. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in the federal Parliament. It is an opportunity, a privilege and an honour that is afforded to but few. Many seek to serve in this place but few succeed. I have enjoyed serving at both the policy level and through the parliamentary and Liberal Party committees. But my greatest thrill has come from living and working with my constituents, most of whom are either veterans, young people, migrants or, may I say elderly Australians. Despite the ruggedness of politics there is a special kind of friendship here. I say in all sincerity that it is on both sides of the House. I have made many friends from all walks of life, of all political calibres, and I am sure that my leaving this place will not in any way endanger those friendships. To all of you I should like to say thank you for your help, assistance and friendship. To the hundreds, if not thousands, of Australian- like one family, the Campisi family- in my electorate who have worked for me in more ways than I shall ever know. I want them to know how grateful I am for their support. </para>
          <para>In no way has my devotion to liberalism been diminished. The fight is still very much on. I look forward to returning to Parliament shortly to continue my duty and my career and to serve the Australian people. The kind of nation we should have, as I see it, has been spelt out in my earlier speeches in this place, the questions I have asked and the commentaries that I have given to the media- It would be remiss of me if I did not express my grateful thanks and gratitude to the  Clerk,  his assistants, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, the staff of the parliamenary refreshment rooms who have looked after us, to Gordon Pike and his drivers and workers, the attendants, and even our friends in the Press Gallery. To all those people who are employed in Parliament House and who have assisted me in one way or people I say: Thank you. </para>
          <para>I come now to those people who on 13 December 1975 saw fit to allow me to serve the electorate of Evans. I want to thank them for affording me the honour of serving them for two brief years. My staff, who have been loyal and faithful, have my gratitude. Regrettably, they will be looking for greener pastures. That is a matter which the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> has just mentioned. To my wife and my children, I say thank you. Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline></para>

            <para>-First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I say that you have surprised me as a  Speaker.  I think you have been a great success. You have been a good  Speaker.  I am also surprised somewhat by the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> I think that underneath he must be a believer in slow torture if, after spending so long in this place, he hopes to go to the other place. Candidly, I hope he does not get there. I think that the fewer independents there are in the Senate the better. The realisation that it is one's last day in the Parliament is a somewhat eerie experience. I suppose that there are some honourable members here who hope that it is not their last day. They may not be as blessed as they think. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not want to have to thank a long catalogue of people. There are too many people to thank. Perhaps I should thank the electors of Melbourne Ports. That electorate has had, I think, only three representatives in the whole of its history, and I have served it longer than anybody else. At least I am grateful for having had that opportunity. </para>
          <para>There is one other thing I would like to say, and perhaps it is the final comment I will be making. There is a lot of talk in Australia at the moment about the necessity for constitutional reform. I believe there is a great need for institutional reform, and one of the institutions which needs to begin to reform itself is this chamber. Like other honourable members, I count it a privilege to have been among the one hundredodd members of Parliament who at any one time make up the numbers in this place. I believe that the Parliament could be far more efficient than it has been in the utilisation of the talents of its members. Immediately Question Time has concluded, on most occasions, this chamber becomes almost empty of members. That is not a very good state of affairs for a parliament. Committees endeavour to meet while the Parliament is sitting. It is a very difficult situation indeed. I believe that much of the more important work of this Parliament, and of this House in particular, has to be carried out to an increasing extent by committees rather than in this chamber. </para>
          <para>So I leave, as I say, with a rather sweet and sour feeling about my last day in this place. I value the experience I have gamed here. I must say that I have been moved by the number of people from both sides of this House, and the number of people who work in and around the parliament, who have told me that they will miss me. I do not want to be sentimental and talk about my family but at least they will see a little more of me in the future. Whether they will thank me for my decision remains to be seen. </para>

            <para>-For a few brief minutes I would like to endorse some of the comments that have been made in this chamber tonight. First of all, I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the courtesy you have shown me and for the courtesy you have shown to the House. I think the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> summed up my feelings on the matter. Some who know more than I say that you are perhaps the greatest  Speaker  the House has known. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have enjoyed serving with the honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Abel)</inline> both on the back bench and particularly on the government members industry and commerce committee of which he was secretary. He served the back bench well, his constituents well, and that committee well. A great tribute has been paid to the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett),</inline> and I endorse it. I wish to pay tribute also to two members of the Opposition. In this day and age too few Australians realise the things that members on both sides of the chamber have in common. Some people have a vested interest in pointing out our differences. I have had the privilege of serving on two parliamentary committees with the honourable member for Fremantle- the father of the House. They were the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I have enjoyed learning from his experience. I have enormous respect for him. I regard him as a distinguished and great Australian. I made that remark on one occasion at the opening ceremony of a building in my electorate, to which he was properly invited. Many people found it strange that an honourable member on this side of the House would pay a compliment to an honourable member on the other side of the House. As has been demonstrated tonight, there is much more in common between us than perhaps the community realises. </para>
          <para>The other honourable member of the House to whom I pay a tribute is an electoral neighbour of mine, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean).</inline> He is a man who understands the needs, the problems and the aspirations of the people of the City of Prahran which we have served jointly. I have never had an argument with him about matters concerned with the electorate. I have received the greatest degree of cooperation from him. He has served his people well and he has served the people of Prahran well. Apart from our differences m political policy and philosophy, the thing that saddens me most is our disagreement about <inline font-style="italic">The Glugs of Gosh</inline> by C. J. Dennis. Perhaps we can sort out that disagreement in the future. </para>
          <para>I also pay a tribute tonight to one of the attendants who has served this House for approximately 14 years. I refer to Harry Ryan who has been an attendant in the public gallery for that period of time. He is a World War I veteran of Gallipoli. He recently returned to Europe on a holiday and, as one of his colleagues said, he picked up a few medals which he was meant to get when he was there the first time. People like Harry Ryan have served this Parliament well. Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for giving me the opportunity to speak. </para>

            <para>-I rise only because, with the departure of the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> I am the longest serving member of the Opposition. I have served with three of the four retiring Labor members during the whole of the period that I have been in the Parliament and for most of the period that they have been here. Mr Beazley - I hope I Will be permitted to break the Standing Orders to call him by name- is without doubt one of the most able debaters this Parliament has ever seen. He has an analytical mind. We will miss him. He will go down in the annals of the parliamentary records as being one of the parliament's greatest debaters. The same comment can be made of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> who was also a great debater with an analytical mind. I wish him and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline> a happy retirement. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In my view, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> was the best qualified Treasurer and the best Treasurer this country has seen over the past generation. He was a magnificent Treasurer. He was too much of a gentle.man I think, for the people with whom he was dealing. He should have been tougher but it was not in his nature to be as tough as he should have been on the type of people with whom he was dealing. He was too much of a gentleman for that. I will always remember him as a great elder of the church of which I am a member. He has been a great companion of mine. I wish him a happy retirement. I know he will relish the opportunity of spending more time with his wife, Mary, than it has been possible for him to do in the past. </para>
          <para>I come now to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> Of aU the people who trampled on the Standing Orders when they were in opposition, I know no one who erred as often and with such relish as you seemed to do. When you were Leader of the Opposition it did not seem to occur to you that you had to get the call before you could rise and start talking. I thought you knew no different. I took pity on you. I felt sorry for you. I thought: 'He is a nice chap. He is a lawyer. He is a Q.C. He is very clever in aU things except the Standing Orders'. I thought you had a sort of mental blockage with regard to the Standing Orders, until you became  Speaker  when I found that you were most meticulous in pointing out to members that they had no right to rise and start talking; they had to wait until they got the call. You seemed to hold it against me for the best part of the last two years that I was the one who constantly drew  Speaker  Cope's attention to your shortcomings. I did not think you had noticed it at the time but after your appointment I was sure you had noticed it and were determined to make me pay for it. In recent months, I am pleased to say, you seem to have forgiven me. I now get the call occasionally at Question Time; not very often. </para>
          <para>In my view, you have proven to be one of the very best Speakers under whom I have served. You have an extraordinary quality about you as Speaker. I have not seen it in anyone else. You know when to be firm. You can be firm without standing and shouting your head off. You can be firm in a voice that is barely audible. You look firm. I think I would look as firm if I had that wig. You are able to defuse periods of great tension. I pay you a very sincere compliment. I have told you this privately, but failed to produce the results for which I was hoping. Now that it cannot be said that I am looking for further favours from you, I say it to you publicly: You are a very great Speaker. </para>
          <para>I shall be very sorry to see the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> leave. I hope he is elected to the Senate. The Senate deserves him. We have had to put up with him for 28 years and I think it is only proper that the Senate should have its stint now and have him for six or 12 years. To the electors of New South Wales, to those who are to the extreme Right, to those Liberals who have some doubt about where the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> stands, as to whether he might be veering deep down in his heart towards socialism, let me say this: If they want to be absolutely certain of having a senator who will never show the slightest sign of weakness towards the Left or even towards the centre, or even to those who are bad enough to be just right of centre, they can do no better than to vote for the honourable member for Mackellar for the Senate because he will never betray them. He will never betray their most conservative wishes, thoughts and aspirations. He will always be there slogging it out for them, saying all the things that they would like to say in the Melbourne Club, Tattersall's Club and the other places where their ilk meet. </para>
          <para>I regret that time and the Standing Orders have not permitted me to point out to the new members, who unfortunately will not be present to hear it in the next Parliament, something about the escapades for which the honourable member for Mackellar is so famous. I refer to the blowing up of the Cronulla Bridge, the capture and holding incommunicado in the Blue Mountains of Sir Thomas Blamey, the presenting of the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> cup to that dangerous communist Roche, and the way in which he took possession of the Redfern police station by dressing up all his members of the home guard as trammies just as the tramway people were changing their shifts, and instead of taking over the trams he took over the police station to make the point that Australia was in a defenceless state, that was not in a position to defend itself. I think that other members have missed something by not having heard me give what until now has been a ritualistic kind of diatribe, as he called it, to let members know what a magnificent man we have with us. The greatest of all W. C. Wentworths is about to depart this Parliament. I am sorry for that. </para>
          <para>I am sorry for the others who are leaving. Altogether 13 members of this Parliament know that they will not be back because they are retiring voluntarily or involuntarily, but they are retiring for certain. Many more will retire involuntarily. We do not know how many. I have made a calculation and I know that there will be at least 24 fewer members on the other side and that there will be 24 new members on this side. The thing about which I am saddened is that out of 27 Federal Ministers in 1975 only 10 remain. Since I became a member of this Parliament I think more than 500 members and senators have come and gone. I think it is very sad to see so many bright young men from the government back benches opposite who have been condemned to sit there for these two years knowing that they could never make it- people who have been unable or unwilling to crawl their way into the Prime Minister's favour so that they could serve in the Cabinet. I mention only some of them: The honourable member for Diamond Valley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Brown),</inline> the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil),</inline> the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly),</inline> the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock),</inline> the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baillieu),</inline> the honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sainsbury),</inline> the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Edwards),</inline> the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman),</inline> the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd)</inline> and the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> who, I think, will be defeated in the pre-selection for Wakefield by Bert Kelly. All of these men are men of very great talent. If there had been an election for Cabinet by the democratic means which the Labor Party follows in the selection of Cabinet, most of them would have been in the Cabinet and some of the no-hopers who are front benchers now would be back where they belong. </para>

            <para>-I was one of the 38 newcomers to this House in 1975. We were elected by the people of Australia. Tonight I heard some comment that perhaps the Queen's representative elected us. I can assure anyone listening that the people of Australia elected us when they gave this Government a record majority. It exceeded by six, I believe, the previous record of 32 in 1966, if one leaves aside the occasion on which the size of the Parliament was greatly increased immediately after the war. We have been called many things. One of the things which we have been called is, of course, oncers. That appellation will be put to the test shortly. There is no doubt, of course, that there is very little job security in this industry. Some of us, I imagine, will find out about that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, the reason I have risen tonight is that on behalf of the 38 newcomers of 1975 I would like to thank the older and, if I may say, in most cases much wiser heads on both sides of the House for the guidance and assistance that they have given to us in these two years. I also mention some people who no longer are involved in the running of this House-the former SerjeantatArms, Don Piper, and his assistant, Lynn Berts. </para>
          <para>I, too, have suffered at the hands of the distribution commissioners in an electoral redistribution which I find illogical and insupportable. One of the consequences of that redistribution is that about 28,000 people are being taken from my electorate and given to Werriwa. In future these people will have the privilege of having the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> looking after them. I wish them luck. Whether I return here or whether any of us in this chamber return here, of course, depends on the judgment of the electorate. I hope for only one thing- that the people judge us fairly. </para>

I place on record my respect for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean).</inline> I agree with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton).</inline> I also represent an electorate that adjoins Melbourne Ports. Frank Crean has cooperated with me in all respects in the City of St Kilda, as he has with my colleague in the City of Prahran. It was my privilege to know Frank Crean well before I came into this place. We served together on the Council of Adult Education in Victoria, when he was  Chairman.  He was  Chairman  for 20 years. I know him to be a most worthy citizen. It is my hope that future governments, Federal and State, will make use of his great talents, because he is too young to retire from active duty on behalf of the Australian community. He has great experience. I believe that in this Parliament he has raised some very good questions. He has helped to point us a little along the way to finding some of the answers to those almost intractable questions. I, for one, look forward to hearing him express his opinions from time to time. I hope that a number of us are able to give him opportunities to do that </para>

          <para>The retiring Government members and the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> know of my respect for them, and I need not amplify that. I have not had the privilege of knowing the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley),</inline> but I believe that what my colleague the honourable member for Higgins has said is widely held. I, from my position, respect him also. I believe that he also still can make a contribution similar to that which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports can make. In conclusion I join with those who have congratulated you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on the way in which you have handled the difficult occasions in this Parliament. They erupt quickly and without warning. I believe that you have drawn upon your industrial relations background in conciliating and in defusing situations which someone less wise, less calm and with less sense of humour would have found getting out of hand. I congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline></para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Speaker,</inline>in rising on this occasion I should like to pass a few remarks about the unsung heroes of this Parliament. They are the attendants around the Parliament. They are at our beck and call if that is the right phrase to use. They mother us; they look after us. They are respectful to us. Quite frankly, I think there are many times when we are not deserving of that respect. My appreciation must go to the Clerks and the whole of the Parliamentary staff, without whose help this place could not function as an efficient institution. I have heard it said- I do not believe it to be completely truethat the Parliament is a charade. If I thought that were true, I would not waste my time fighting to come back here. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to pay my respects to the retiring members. I will lead off with the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> I think he is dedicated. He is dedicated to his own cause. I do not agree with him most of the time- nearly aU the time- but I do not deny him the right to fight for the cause in which he believes in the manner in which he does it Quite frankly, on the Opposition side of the Parliament we do the same thing. We believe in a cause. We fight for that cause in the manner in which we feel it can best be served. </para>
          <para>I pay a tribute also to the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley).</inline> Honestly, when I compare him with some of the past leaders of the Australian Labor Party, I think he should have been leader. I think that had he been leader we would have got into government much earner than 1972. 1 mean that certainly as no reflection on my present leader- none at aU. In my view, the honourable member for Fremantle has the ability and the clearness of mind to portray the real issues which are resolved in this Parliament. In addition, he is a highly moral man. He fought for the cause of Moral Rearmament. He even made me drink apple cider at various dinners to which he invited me. I must admit that on those occasions I enjoyed the apple cider, even though I probably would rather have had a pale ale. </para>
          <para>I class the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> as my mentor. We both served in a very worthy institution, the Taxation Office. The people who serve there are not beloved by everybody. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports left the Taxation Office in 1945. When I came into this Parliament in 1969 he took me under his wing. I say to him that I ap- preciate it The thing I admire about Frank Crean is his humility. He is a true Christian. He is an elder of the Presbyterian Church and I am a practising Catholic. There was no difference of opinion between us on true Christian principles. He played a leading part in an organisation about which very Utile is known outside this Parliament- the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. He was a fine example to many people in this Parliament, with his attitude of true Christianity. </para>
          <para>When I speak of his humility I do not have to go back so very long ago to find an example. Frank Crean had served in very high office. He was Deputy Prime Minister of this country. He was Treasurer, and in my view the best Treasurer we had between 1972 and 1975. He did not consider it a lowering of his prestige to serve as a member of the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament when he was asked to do so. The Public Accounts Committee is one of the lesser recognised but most able bodies that do the work within the Parliament. Frank Crean was most assiduous and most capable, and, to my knowledge, he never missed a meeting and was always on time. </para>
          <para>To you, Frank, on behalf of aU those members of the earlier Public Accounts Committees I say thank you. I note that the honourable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Graham)</inline> is sitting in the chamber. He served as a  chairman  of those PubUc Accounts Committees with you. On behalf of the present  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly)</inline> I convey our thanks to you for the work you have done not only on that Committee but also on the Standing Committee on Expenditure. I think Frank has had only one disappointment in his parliamentary career. I know that he would have loved to have his son </para>
          <para class="block">Simon follow him here, but that was not to be. However, I have no doubt that in the not too distant future there Will be another Crean in this Parliament doing just as good a job as his father did. </para>

          <para>I should like to pay my own tribute to my  Deputy,  the honourable member for Lyne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Philip</inline> Lucock, who has been an outstanding  Chairman  of Committees. He has served me immensely well. I take this opportunity to pay a public tribute to him and to all the other deputiesMr Armitage, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bonnett, Mr Drummond, Mr Giles, Mr Jarman, Dr Jenkins, Mr Martin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Robinson. I pay a tribute to the Leader of the House, for I have occupied that position and know something of its difficulties. I ay a tribute to him for the manner in which he as performed his duties. I pay a tribute to the Manager of Opposition Business without whose co-operation the Leader of the House could not have discharged his duties. </para>
          <para>I often hear complaints that on occasions the Parliament makes noises which people wished they did not hear. I can only say that members are elected here who hold beliefs passionately and when the occasion occurs they express them passionately. This is the place for them to express those beliefs- in the national forum, the fulcrum of parliamentary democracy. If they cannot be expressed here, they will be expressed elsewhere. This is the place for debate, not the streets. </para>
          <para>I hear complaints that we ought to behave better. I have seen parliaments in which everybody behaves perfectly, but it is not a parliamentary democracy. Because people are elected here to speak fearlessly, without nope of favour, without threat, we must expect the Parliament to be what it is- a live organism, an institution of which we can be proud, but which nevertheless needs some institutional reform, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said. </para>
          <para>I have had occasions in the House when I have wondered just what would happen next. Literacy on all occasions I found that honourable members have understood their position in the Parliament and the dignity which they must lend to it. So any tribute paid to me is really only a tribute paid collectively to all of you. I thank you for the privilege I have had to serve you. That is what a Speaker is for- to serve the members of the Parliament Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

            <para>The Statistician has advised that when the preliminary January production statistics were released, the seasonal adjustment factors being used did not properly reflect the introduction of an extra week's annual leave in January 1975. Those originally published seasonally adjusted production figures for January 1977 have since been revised. The new figures provide a better indication of production of the published items because they have been calculated following an annual re-analysis of the data on which the seasonally adjusted series are based. The re-analysis takes into account aU recent apparent changes in the pattern of production including the changes caused by the general introduction of an extra week's leave in January 197S. </para>
            <para>The revised estimates show that production of IS, not 8 as originally estimated, of the 32 items for which seasonally adjusted figures are available rose in January 1977. For the same number, production was higher in January 1977 than in January 1976. </para>

No quarantine ship inspection as such was undertaken while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Perriman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temme</inline> were on the ship. Rather, the visit was a demonstration of the parts of a vessel that would normally be examined in such an inspection, and of the nature of the work of a Quarantine Inspector or a Quarantine Assistant. </para>

              <para>No. The statement on this matter which I tabled in the House of Representatives on 1 June 1977 <inline font-style="italic">{Hansard,</inline> page 228 1 ) indicated that the legal position was that an inquiry as envisaged by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration could not be properly conducted unless the body conducting the inquiry was vested with powers to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and unless that body, and persons appearing before it, had protection from liability for defamation. The statement further indicated that, apart from a Royal Commission (whose formal processes were considered to be quite inappropriate for an inquiry concerned with evaluation of personnel and administrative issues) there was no body independent of the Public Service which had such powers. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The inquiry was accordingly established through delegation to Messrs Perriman and Temme by the Public Service Board of its powers under section 19 of the Public Service Act Through this process, the gentlemen (who are senior officers from outside the Board with no prior involvement in the case) have powers to summons any persons, take evidence on oath or affirmation, and require the production of documents, and they are not subject to direction by the Board in any way while exercising their delegated powers. Also, as indicated in the statement tabled in the House, it is intended that a report of the inquiry, incorporating recommendations, opinions and comments made by Messrs Perriman and Temme, and details of any action taken as a result, will be tabled in Parliament. </para>
          <para>I am satisfied that the conduct of Messrs Perriman and Temme while visiting the M.V. <inline font-style="italic">Vishna Kalyan</inline> was quite proper, and has not in any way compromised the independence of the inquiry. </para>

        <para>National support for political parties amounts to 115,000 SKr annually per seat in the Riksdag. </para>
        <para>Staff support consists of basic support and additional support. The basic support amounts to 2,025,000 SKr annually to each political party represented in the Riksdag that has received 4 per cent of the votes cast in the latest election.

As indicated in the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to in ( 1) above, the interdepartmental committee that recommended amendments to the Passports Act also recommended further examination of other measures to meet the problem raised by the honourable member.

Sections 68 and 69 enable Australia to implement arrangements with other countries for reciprocal enforcement of custody orders. The Government is actively pursuing the possibility of such arrangements with a number of overseas countries with a view to concluding such arrangements. In view of these provisions and the provisions of the Migration Act to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred in his statement (see answer to ( 1 ) above), there are no plans to make other amendments to the Family Law Act pending any recommendations as a result of the further examination referred to in ( 3 ) above. </para>

              <para>and (3) The interdepartmental committee on air links in the area currently served by Connair Pry Ltd was established by the Government to look into the demand for air services in the area served by Connair and to recommend to me how that demand might best be satisfied. This the committee did, and its report to me was most comprehensive, providing a useful basis for the decisions in regard to future air services in the area which the Government has subsequently taken. </para>

          <para>The honourable member will know that those decisions secure the continued existence of Connair through the grant of substantial Commonwealth financial assistance, so that it may continue as a viable enterprise to cater to the needs of the area it serves. He will know that the Government is also looking at the provision of alternative air services to those communities from which, for reasons of economy Connair may find it necessary to withdraw, and the provision by operators other than Connair of services which are not now operated but for which demand is apparent </para>
          <para>It has, of course, been the Government's position that the people of remote areas of Australia should enjoy the best possible air services while keeping the cost to the taxpayer of subsidies at a reasonable level. The decisions which the Government has taken are consistent with that position and are designed to give it practical effect The report of the interdepartmental committee was a report to me, and I do not intend to table it in the Parliament The decisions of the Government, which are based to some extent on the report and the recommendations contained therein, are open to parliamentary scrutiny and judgment </para>

            <para>The Australian Government, in co-operation with the Turkish Government and the State governments of Victoria and New South Wales, entered into an arrangement in 1974 for five Turkish teachers employed by the Turkish Government to come to Australia to teach the Turkish language and culture to Turkish children in some schools in those States. Arrangements are currently being made for another three Turkish teachers to come to Australia, on contracts they have with the Turkish Government, to continue this work in Victorian Government schools. Turkish children also are able to learn Turkish in ethnic schools established by the ethnic community. The survey of ethnic schools conducted by the Committee on the Teaching of Migrant Languages in Schools produced a response from two Turkish schools, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales. </para>

                <para>As indicated above, the material from the symposium has proved to be of interest and value in a number of areas. In respect to the establishment of a natural disaster insurance scheme, however, expertise is required on a longer-term basis than that provided by the symposium and concentrating on matters specifically related to the development of a scheme. This includes the compilation and analysis of particular information on present and prospective policies and procedures (such as risk assessment, land use planning and building codes) which can affect either exposure to risk or the damages from natural hazards.

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) As at 30 June 1977, 144 Australia based staff as well as 419 locally engaged staff were employed at offices of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs overseas. The locally engaged staff are, in fact, employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The table below lists staffing by posts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some posts have responsibility for migration matters for two or more countries. The numbers of arrivals shown in the table are related to settler arrivals from the country in which any post is located and from any other countries for which it has responsibility. These figures include arrivals of nominated persons and of direct applicants. However, the workload involved in handling nominations from Australia is not reflected in the numbers of inquiries listed in the table. </para>
          <para>The 'numbers of inquiries' relate to aU countries within a post's jurisdiction. Such levels, however, are not indicators of the actual workloads since figures are maintained overseas only in respect of first migration inquiries. They do not, for instance, cover subsequent inquiries or the very extensive work related to applications for entry to Australia for visits or temporary residence. </para>

(3), (4) and (5) The Government is not yet committed to any form of beef stabilisation scheme. A working party has been set up by the Australian Agricultural Council to make a comprehensive assessment of all domestic and export price support proposals and I have requested that study be made of stabilisation arrangements of a buffer fund character. Until such time that there is agreement on a specific stabilisation scheme it is not possible to say what quantity of beef might be covered or what levels of financial assistance from the Commonwealth might be involved. Certainly the State governments and the beef industry will be consulted before any stabilisation proposal is finalised. I announced on 22 September that the Commonwealth will provide up to $6m towards the establishment and capital costs of implementing carcass classification in beef cattle chains. </para>

            <para>In pursuance of my public statements of 1 and 8 April 1976 on foreign investment matters, the Board has had the question of statutory backing for its operations under notice since its establishment. Following advice given by the Board, I have agreed that this matter should be considered as part of the broader task of examining the need for and scope of more comprehensive legislation in respect of foreign investment. The question of such broader legislation has to be considered in the light of experience with the administration of foreign investment policy under present arrangements. </para>

          <para>The block grant makes a contribution towards the recurrent costs of pre-school services and for 1977-78 the Commonwealth has provided the States with funds which will maintain a contribution equal to that which was provided in 1976-77. In addition, the Commonwealth makes general funds available which the States can allocate according to their own priorities. Through its tax sharing legislation, the Federal Government has provided the States and local government authorities with predictable and reasonable shares of national revenues and freedom to order their own priorities. </para>
          <para>The total funds available to New South Wales for expenditure in 1976-77 was S8.67m. The funds available for New South Wales from the 1977-78 Budget together with the advance for 1977-78 that has already been paid total $8.80m. </para>

              <para>1 ) The estimates of the proportion of net private investment expenditure funded by overseas investment in Australia shown in the following table have been derived using the methodology established in the Treasury Economic Paper No. 1 of May 1972 entitled 'Overseas Investment in Australia'. The figures presented are consequently subject to the same Qualifications as were set out on pages 45-48 of that paper. It should also be noted that the figures do not equate with the contribution to net capital expenditure o£ foreign owned or controlled companies operating in Australia. The figures derive from a comparison of net capital inflow into companies with net private investment expenditure and as such exclude locally raised funds raised by foreign controlled companies and include overseas borrowings raised by Australian controlled companies. No aggregate figures are available for the proportion of net private investment expenditure met by foreign controlled companies operating in Australia. </para>

Hence the reliability of the estimates shown in this table is severely limited, both as regards absolute levels and year to year movements, by the lack of consistency on an industry basis, between the income payable (and paid) overseas series and the total company income series, and by the assumptions and approximations involved. </para>

              <para>1 ) Estimates of the levels of taxable incomes of beef producers in 1977-78 are not available. The closest approximations are measures of net cash incomes estimated from recent survey of the Australian grazing industry undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Latest BAE figures indicate that in 1977-78 some 14,000 specialist beef producers win have net cash incomes of between zero and $5,000. A further 5,600 beef specialists will have net cash incomes between $5,000 and $ 10,000. </para>

              <para>Under the tax scales to apply from 1 February 1978 the standard rate of tax payable by taxpayers generally is to be 32c in the dollar and is to apply to the part of a taxpayer's taxable income between $3,750 and $16,000. Under the 1977-78 pre-Budget scale the rate of tax on the part of a taxpayer's taxable income between $2,506 and $6,266 was 27 per cent. The increase in the marginal rate of tax on the part of the taxable income between $3,750 and $6,266 will be more than off-set by the substitution of a nil rate of tax on the first $3,750 of taxable income for the existing rates of 20 per cent and 27 per cent and the general concessional rebate of $676 as indexed for 1977-78. </para>

          <para>For primary producers (including beef producers) who are., subject to averaging, the new rates of tax including the nil rate on the first $3,750 are to apply in calculating the average rate of tax appropriate to the average income. The increase in the marginal rate applicable to the part of the average income between $3,750 and $6,266 will be more than off-set by the application of the nil rate to the first $3,750 of the average income. Where a primary producer's taxable income is greater than his average income this will confer a substantial benefit as under pre-Budget arrangements the general concessional rebate was not taken into account in the average rate calculation but was deducted only after the average rate was applied to the taxable income. A primary producer whose taxable income is less than his average income will be taxed at ordinary rates of tax. </para>

              <para>1 ) The honourable gentleman will recall that, because his Government sought at every turn to cover up its attempts to borrow through unorthodox channels billions of dollars from overseas, many people provided information to the then Opposition, including a number who were themselves negotiating certain loan raising propositions with the former Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bracey</inline> was one such person. I met with him in Sydney as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition on 4 June 1 975 in the company of my Principal Private Secretary. </para>

          <para>On 21 January 1976, the First Assistant Secretary, Revenue, Loans and Investment Division, Department of the Treasury, telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bracey</inline> at the request of my Principal Private Secretary and advised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bracey</inline> of my Press statement of 17 December 1975 and of the Government's guidelines in relation to unsolicited loan proposals.

          <para>The foregoing is in marked contrast to what occurred under the former Government and no doubt the honourable gentlemen will recall sacking two of his Ministers for their role in the 1975 'loans scandal', thereby making them scapegoats for his own complicity. I remind him of what I said in answering one of his previous questions on notice: namely that the network of intermediaries and conmen that was involved in his Government's clandestine attempts to borrow massive amounts of money from overseas was built up, not only because of the desire of his Government to deceive the Australian public, but also because the administrative arrangements which were then in force were not being observed by Ministers. </para>

This transaction was in no way connected with land purchased by the Victorian Housing Commission and currently subject to inquiry in Victoria. The land in question has always been privately owned- never at any time purchased by any statutory authority-and was, in fact, subdivided as long ago as 1922.

        <para>St Mary's School, Inverell, operated partly in a church. This part has reverted to the church and the remainder is used as a teachers' centre. The library bookstock was transferred to the Holy Trinity School, Inverell. </para>

        <para>Argyle School, Goulburn, was purchased by the New South Wales Department of Technical Education. The school is still being used for educational purposes. </para>

The preschool still operates and the junior infants school children transferred to Kinross- Wolaroi College, Orange.

        <para>Our Lady of Victories School, Wembley, has amalgamated with St Joseph's School. Both sites are still used even though the schools operate under the one board and principal. </para>
        <para>Presentation School, Corrigin, and St Patrick's School, West Perth, have closed and their bookstock has been distributed by the Western Australian Catholic Education Office to those Catholic schools which were high on the priority list for bookstock upgrading, resulting in smaller grants being needed in the future to bring these schools to acceptable bookstock levels. </para>
        <para class="block">New South Wales (amalgamation) </para>
        <para>St Ursula's College, Armidale, has amalgamated with De La Salle College and equipment and bookstock has been transferred. </para>
        <para>All these schools received grants under legislation enacted prior to 1 976. That legislation did not contain provisions that enabled a condition to be imposed on a grantee school that facilities provided with the assistance of grant moneys must not be sold or otherwise disposed of without prior consultation with the Commonwealth Government. From 1974 the grant offer sought to impose this condition. However, advice received from the Attorney-General's Department in 1975 was that a condition imposed in this way did not enable the Government to recover moneys. Legislation was accordingly enacted during 1976 which included a provision that payment of grant moneys will not be made by the State unless the school agrees with the State to be bound by conditions specified in the approval of the project by the Minister. The condition referred to earlier has applied to grants made under this legislation and has been made more explicit in the legislation for grants in 1978 now before the Parliament. </para>

              <para>and (2) The answer to question No. 1239 carried no implications with regard to the matter of whether or not there are differences between the policies and practices enunciated by the Government of the People 's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China. The assurance given to the Prime Minister when he visited China last year is a matter of public record and is best assessed by examining China's record in the area of foreign policy. Such examination suggests that party-to-party relations have not been allowed to impinge on state-to-state relations. </para>

We recognise as a fact that the Chinese Government has historical links with some of the insurgency movements of South East Asia. We do not approve of these links, but we recognise that for the Chinese Government they involve various accumulated obligations, commitments and political investments. We hope, for the sake of the stability of the region, that these links will be broken, but we do not think it would be realistic to expect this to happen suddenly. We also recognise that whether party-to-party relations impinge on state-to-state relations is not a matter which the Chinese leaders alone can decide: the views of other states on this matter may differ from their own. Nevertheless, taking all this into account, the impression we were given, both by the particular statement made and by the general concern expressed about stability, was that the Chinese leaders will be concerned to conduct party-to-party relations in ways which will not damage the efforts to develop good relations with the countries of the region; that a clear priority is given to the latter. This is clearly a matter of considerable interest for Australia which attaches great importance to the stability and development of South East Asia. ' </para>

              <para>Since the introduction of the new fare package for travel between Australia and the United Kingdom, there has been an average increase in the number of passengers carried on Qantas in both directions of 17 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. The number of passengers travelling from Australia to the United Kingdom has increased by 1 S per cent for the period April to October 1977 compared with the same period in 1976. The comparable figure for passengers travelling in the other direction was 19 percent. </para>

          <para>I am informed that Qantas believes that it is still too early for the company to make a final evaluation of the extent of the success of the new fares package. However, the results to date, together with current forward booking patterns, are most encouraging and Qantas considers that the new fares package has certainly stimulated the travel market between Australia and the United Kingdom. </para>

However, a comparison can be given of the total number of passengers carried by Qantas on its AustraliaUnited Kingdom services over seven comparable periods in 1976 and 1977. </para>

            <para>Air fares are generally constructed in accordance with the principle, which I consider to be fair and reasonable, that passengers travelling anywhere in Australia over the same distance pay the same fares, after allowing for the class of travel and the type of aircraft used. In fact, in the report of the commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania initiated by the previous Government and presented in March 1976, Commissioner J. F. Nimmo, C.B.E. stated that 'The air fare formula used by Ansett and TAA is standard throughout Australia for all routes. Thus Tasmania suffers no disability so far as comparative air passenger charges are concerned '. </para>
            <para>The tourist industry in Tasmania is favourably served by the large discounts extended by the airlines in the form of package tours from the mainland, some of which are as high as 30 percent. </para>
            <para>In addition there are off peak fares available at substantial discounts such as the newly introduced APEX fares. </para>

            <para>Advertising by the Department of Education is undertaken for the most part to draw the attention of interested institutions and persons to grants, benefits, scholarships and other forms of assistance under the programs for which it is responsible. Some advertising is also used for employment vacancies. In the ACT and Northern Territory advertising is also used to inform prospective students of courses at Technical and Further Education Institutions and to indicate the availability of course to migrants. The use of advertising, in the case of grants and similar programs is closely related to an annual timetable of processing of applications related to the academic or school year. These processes are an integral part of program administration and cannot properly be described as 'campaigns'. </para>
            <para>Advertising by the Department is placed through the Australian Government Advertising Service. </para>
            <para>Information on expenditure for some of the specific periods listed is not readily available. Expenditure on advertising by the Department for the financial years 1975-76, 1976-77 and the estimate for the year 1977-78 is shown below: </para>

            <para>It remains the case, as pointed out in answer to question 1345 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> 16 November 1976, page 2746), that there is no general practice with regard to determining the relative seniority at an Australian overseas mission of officers from different Government Departments. However, in addition to three females serving in charge of a mission, there are currently five other female officers of my Department serving as  Deputy  Head of Mission; they would normally take charge of the mission in the absence of the Head of Mission. In overall terms there are (in addition to the female officers serving as Ambassador to Denmark, High Commissioner in Nauru and Acting High Commissioner in Cyprus) two female officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs currently serving as Counsellors, six as First Secretaries, five as Second </para>
            <para>Secretaries, fourteen as Third Secretaries and one each as Attache and Vice-Consul. </para>
            <para>Other Government departments, according to records held in my Department, currently have overseas a total of twenty-one female officers with the designation of Counsellor, First Secretary, Second Secretary, Attache or ViceConsul. </para>

          <para>In Victoria, however, because of the high ratio of staffing required by State Health Authorities, private nursing homes tend to accommodate almost exclusively extensive care patients.

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Report of the Committee on Contributions of the United Nations (Supplement No. 11 (A/23/11) ) dated 26 August 1977 and the Addendum thereto dated 1 September 1977. The addendum lists both the assessed and voluntary financial contributions paid by member States in each of the calendar years 1975 and 1976. </para>
            <para>Concerning the second and third of the honourable member's questions, contributions to the United Nations are based essentially on national income. Having established on the basis of comparative national income what proportion of its overall budget each member should pay, members are billed for an amount Thus Australia in 1976, paying 1.52 per cent contributed SA4.4 million. It is agreed that least developed countries and most seriously affected countries should pay 0.02 per cent and also that the low per capita national income countries (below $1800) should receive a deduction. The relationship between contributions and national income in the least developed, most seriously affected and low per capita income countries is thus different to that of the high per capita income countries. </para>
            <para>Paragraphs 26-34 and 45-53 of the Committee's Report set out problems in comparing GNPs Until the 1978-79 period the calculation of contributions has been based on a three year base period. For 1 978-79 a seven year base period (1969-1975) will be used. This method of calculations avoids wide fluctuations in contributions and gives some recognition to the concept of national wealth, which is of course difficult to measure. </para>
            <para>The Committee's report was adopted last month by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly and will be considered in plenary session in December. </para>

            <para>The Government has consistently followed policies on whaling directed towards the conservation of all whales on a global basis. I understand that at its recent meeting the Federal Council of the Liberal Party of Australia resolved that Australia should support a ten year moratorium on commercial whaling. This overlooks the fact that moratoria on right, Gray and bowhead whales have been in force for over 30 years, on blue whales for 14 years and on humpbacks for 12 years. Selective moratoria have been applied to various other stocks which are not at satisfactory levels and these moratoria will apply for whatever period is necessary to restore the stocks, whether it is 10 years or more. The question of a 10 year moratorium has not been on the International Whaling Commission (IWC) agenda since 1974 as the present management regime overcomes the necessity to introduce a blanket moratorium. The Government's policy is based on the advice of the IWC Scientific Committee which comprises the world's leading whale biologists and population dynamicists. The Scientific Committee does not consider there is any scientific justification for a blanket moratorium in view of the stringent and conservative management measures now adopted by the IWC. </para>
