        <para>That this growing problem could be effectively dealt with by granting taxation concessions to volunteer firemen in the State of New South Wales similar to those being received by members of the Citizens Military Forces. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to review the Taxation Act to exempt the earnings of volunteer firemen in the State of New South Wales from income tax, or give consideration to separate assessment of earnings and so protect the future of the volunteer fire service in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>The places of one half of the members of the Senate will become vacant on 30 June next. If their places are to be filled by 1 July 1978, an election to fill them must be held no later than May. Under the second paragraph of section 13 of the Constitution an election to fill vacant Senate places may be held within one year before the places become vacant. Members of this House were elected on 13 December 1975. Their term expires on 16 February 1979. However, section 28 of the Constitution enables the House of Representatives to be dissolved before then. It was the general practice prior to 1963 to hold elections for the House of Representatives and for half the Senate at the same time. Indeed, in 1955 the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Slim, on the advice of the then Prime Minister, dissolved the House of Representatives much earlier than its three-year term to synchronise the elections for the two Houses. In that case the election for both Houses was held some 18 months after the previous election for the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>In May this year the Government put to the people a referendum proposal which was intended to ensure that elections for both Houses would have to be held simultaneously. The proposal was supported by all political parties in the Parliament and the arguments in favour of it were widely canvassed. It was approved by a significant majority- 62 per cent- of all voters and by a majority of voters in three States. It is the view of the Government that at the next election for half the Senate an election should also be held for the House of Representatives. This clearly accords with the view of the majority of the Australian people as reflected in the referendum vote. It is a view shared by the Opposition. Indeed, on a <inline font-style="italic">Monday Conference</inline> interview on 1 November 1976 the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> thought that it would be entirely appropriate to have a combined half Senate and House of Representatives election at the end of 1977. 1 quote the words he uttered almost exactly a year ago: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In a year&#39;s time, which I would think would be about the earliest that there could be an election, although quite a likely time for the election, it would be a perfectly reasonable time to have a half Senate election and one could have the whole of the House of Representatives at the same time to synchronise the elections. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition. If the elections are not held together it will mean that there must be an election for half the Senate at least by May 1978, an election for the House of Representatives before April 1979, another election for half the Senate before July 1981 and so on- a major Federal election every one or two years. A situation in which a government is constantly concerned with the holding of elections is not conducive to sound government and hence is not in the public interest. If the elections for both Houses are to be synchronised, the question arises as to when they should be held. In practical terms this means: Should they be held in December this year, or before the end of May next year? The Government has come to the conclusion that the elections for both Houses should be held in December 1977, and I have recommended accordingly to  His Excellency. </para>

            <para>- It is appropriate that I should tell the House what considerations have led the Government to this decision. At the time the Government was elected in December 1975 Australia was in a state of severe depression marked by rapid inflation, rapidly rising unemployment and declining output. Since that election the Government has pursued policies designed to correct the situation. These policies have required steady and resolute action. There are now encouraging signs that they are succeeding. The economy is strengthening, there is now indisputable evidence that we are winning the fight against inflation. Interest rates are falling for the first time in years. Investment is rising and confidence is returning. </para>

          <para>The conditions under which real economic growth can proceed are being restored and the Government takes much satisfaction from these encouraging developments. Nevertheless, there is still much to be done. The reduction in the rate of inflation, the achievement of real economic growth and the progressive reduction of unemployment, which is a vital part of the Government&#39;s objective, can be sustained only by the continuation of these policies. A fundamental requirement for their success is an atmosphere of certainty and confidence in the Australian community. We have acted firmly to make sure that that confidence continues to return. To have further progress Australians must be convinced that the current economic recovery will continue, not just for months but for a number of years ahead. While uncertainty as to an election persists, investment is likely to be held back, confidence could be eroded, and a significant growth in employment opportunities is unlikely. All this is highly undesirable at a time when school leavers will shortly be seeking to enter the work force. An election in December will provide an early opportunity to end election speculation and the resulting uncertainty as to the policies that will be followed after that election. It will enable the Government to seek from the people an expression of their will. </para>
          <para>Let me also make it clear that an election in December would be in keeping with the pattern over many years for elections to be held for half the Senate in the latter months of the calendar year. In fact, December would be the usual time for a Senate election to take place. Since 1949, and leaving aside double dissolutions, elections for half the Senate have been held in November or December on seven occasions and in May on only one occasion. For the reasons I have stated, there is ample justification for both elections to be held together at this time. The timetable I have proposed to His Excellency is as follows: </para>
          <para>Issue of writs- 10 November 1977 </para>
          <para>Close of nominations- 1 8 November 1 977 </para>
          <para>Polling date- 10 December 1977 </para>
          <para>Return of writs- on or before 8 February 1978. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">His Excellency</inline>has agreed to communicate this timetable to State Governors with a view to adopting it for elections for senators in each of the States. When replies have been received from the States, I shall inform the House. </para>

            <para>- by leave- At last the farce has ended. Since August, when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> told the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that he might &#39;spring an election&#39;- interpreted by that gentleman as a Spring electionthe Australian economy and the Australian political system have been needlessly subjected to the stresses and uncertainty deliberately created by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister himself and his office, acting under his authority, have deliberately fuelled the speculation and deepened the uncertainty. What a charade it has been! The weeks of rumour and speculation culminated in the Nareen spectacular last Sunday. There was an urgent summons to the inner seven and heartburning amongst the senior Ministers for whom the bell did not toll- the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock),</inline> the Minister for Defence (MrKillen) - </para>

              <para>- You were spending your time better. Also excluded was the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife</inline> ), the self-proclaimed senior member for New South Wales. There were dramatic dashes across the continent at the taxpayers&#39; expense, not in VIP aircraft but in aircraft specially chartered with, of course, government warrants, all converging on the western district of Victoria, a natural habitat. In characteristic fashion the lord of the manor lorded it over the serfs. As a result we have had this week the ultimate refinement in election rumour mongering. There has been speculation not just on the election date but speculation on the date the election date would be announced. The uncertainty deliberately created by the Prime Minister by his pathetic cat and mouse game has been economically damaging and damaging to sound and stable administration. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>No public service can operate effectively in the atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty which has now prevailed for more than a month. The Prime Minister could have ended it with a sentence, to use his own words when, for the first time, he stabbed the Leader of his Party in the back six years ago. He chose rather to continue his cat and mouse game. It was a game played not against his political opponents; he was playing cat and mouse with the Australian community, not least with his Party&#39;s traditional supporters in the business community. All that the Prime Minister has achieved so far as the Labor Party is concerned is to get us off to a flying start. He created an immediacy, and urgency, for the organisation of a campaign which could not have been achieved in a normal mid-term year. We thank the Prime Minister for it. His childish charade has damaged the Australian community; it has not damaged the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>The Australian people will place only one interpretation on the Prime Minister&#39;s decision. When all the confusion created by the Prime Minister is swept aside, it becomes clear that there is one reason and one reason only for wanting an election now rather than at the proper time- nearer the term which the Prime Minister demanded from the Australian people less than two years ago. The reason is that next year the economy will deteriorate even further. One of the Government&#39;s own economic advisers, Professor Warren Hogan, has predicted half a million unemployed by the middle of next year. The most optimistic forecast puts unemployment next year no lower than 450,000. The appalling prospects for 100,000 school leavers will have become not just a threat but a grim reality- scores of thousands of young Australians with their career opportunities dashed at the very outset of their working lives. Production will decline even further. The false dawn of the September quarter consumer price index figures will have faded. </para>
          <para>In an address to the convocation of the Australian National University a week ago Professor Warren Hogan pointed out that far from being won, the battle against inflation, or rather the Government&#39;s policies, had inflicted profound, perhaps permanent, damage on the economy, and that far from the September CPI figures being a sign of recovery they are the proof of deep economic sickness. The September figures are not a tonic; they are a symptom of disease. </para>
          <para>It will indeed be seen that the Government&#39;s economic policies are working- they are working to put further thousands of Australians out of work and to delay further any hopes of economic recovery. The desire for a premature election is the most complete and open admission there could possibly be that the Government has failed and that it knows it has failed. If the Prime Minister believed for a minute that his economic policies were working properly, why on earth would he want to risk all now to place 30 or 40 of his supine supporters in jeopardy? Obviously if he believed that the economy was recovering, if he believed he had really beaten inflation, he would have waited till the proper time and reaped the political rewards. </para>
          <para>It is all too transparent. Blind Freddie can see it. And the people of Australia will certainly see through it and make their judgment accordingly. To seek a renewed mandate in December is the clearest possible admission that this Government has failed utterly to carry out the mandate for recovery which it claimed less than two years ago. And now it seeks a mandate for even higher unemployment. It has already achieved a rise of 32 per cent in unemployment since it was installed in office. It now seeks a mandate for an even deeper recession. </para>
          <para>The justification for a December election rather than a May election given by the Prime Minister now and hinted for some weeks past is that he is heeding the call by the majority of the Australian people last May for simultaneous elections. Last May 62 per cent of Australian electors supported the proposal that whenever there was an election for the House of Representatives there should also be an election for half the Senate. This great majority showed that the electors wanted not only the elections for both Federal Houses to be held at the same time, but also the terms of both Houses to commence at the same time. </para>
          <para>That is the great difference from the times when Menzies used to have elections for the House of Representatives in December and for half of the Senate, although half of the Senate would not take office until the following July. The position has been changed in the most convincing and authentic way- by the people. Some 62 per cent of the people have said that they want not only elections to be simultaneous but also that they want the Houses of Parliament to be contemporary. </para>
          <para>The result of the Prime Minister&#39;s rush to judgment before next year&#39;s jobs crisis and economic decline is that the incoming government will, for the first seven months of its term, face a Senate elected two years ago. When the new Senate is seated it will be a Senate reflecting a view already seven months old. The only proper time for an election which would give expression to the people&#39;s demand for both simultaneous elections and a contemporary Parliament is May next. The people will clearly see why the Prime Minister is flouting their wish for the Houses as well as the elections to be synchronised. It is a desperate attempt to get in before the crunch next year. </para>
          <para>The people will not be hoodwinked this time. In particular this time they will subject the Prime Minister&#39;s policy speech to the closest scrutiny, a scrutiny which they were unable to give to his policy speech last time. They now know the worth of a promise from this Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister who said in his policy speech two years ago: &#39;Only under a LiberalNational Country Party Government will there be jobs for all who want to work&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who said in his policy speech two years ago: &#39;We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity&#39;, and who said: &#39;Spending on essential education, health and welfare programs will be maintained&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who declared: &#39;We will maintain Medibank&#39;, and who said: &#39;We will continue urban programs&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who promised: &#39;We will work positively in cooperation with trade unionists&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who promised: &#39;The Government will support wage indexation&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who promised: &#39;We will be generous to those who cannot get a job&#39;. This is the Prime Minister who said: &#39;A Liberal National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for migrants &#39;; who said: &#39;We will maintain present levels of assistance to Aborigines&#39;; who said: &#39;We shall ensure no person is denied legal aid because of lack of means&#39;; and who said: &#39;Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be a return to business confidence&#39;. </para>
          <para>As a result of this decision Australia is to have its fourth House of Representatives election in five years. This is symptomatic of a political system in a deepening sense of crisis. These intolerable stresses to the stability of parliamentary democracy have been imposed entirely by the action of conservatives, the self-proclaimed upholders of stability, the self-ordained champions of the system. The largest single cause of this instability, the chief architect of the collapse of the system has been throughout that periodall those five years- and still remains the present Prime Minister. Not the least important task of the Labor Party is to stop this man breaking up our nation, a man who by his obsessions and his schoolboy prejudices and obsessive psychology has divided this country class against class, section against section, region against region in a way never before attempted in Australia&#39;s history. </para>

              <para>-No. I do not intend to join the Australian Democrats but obviously a lot of people in the Liberal Party have joined the Australian Democrats, as one can see from the polls that have taken place. I think a lot of those honourable members opposite who will lose their seats could well end up in the Australian Democrats. I can see no reason for this chamber to refuse to allow a person who is recognised as the leader of his own political party the right to speak on the subject of an election which is being called 12 months before it is due. A significant decision has been made by the Prime Minister. Obviously, the reasons he has given the House are misleading. Obviously, the issues on which the election will be fought are of significance to the Australian Democrats as well as to the Liberal and National Country Parties and to the Australian Labor Party. The reason for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> refusing the right to the honourable member for Hotham to make a statement has not been given to the House. Leave was merely refused. One of the reasons, of course, that an election has been called for the House of Representatives and half the Senate is that an attempt is being made to silence the Australian Democrats. That is the whole purpose of this early election. The election has been called so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> can conclude the coup of getting rid of the clique which perhaps was opposed to his coming to the leadership of the Liberal Party. In that case, one of the people involved was the present  Speaker  - </para>

              <para>-I direct a question to the Minister for Productivity in his capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General. I ask: Has the Government ascertained or will it inquire how soon the Justices of the High Court will hand down their judgments in the challenges by the Government of Queensland to the right of citizens in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory to have representatives in the Senate and by the Government of Western Australia to the right of citizens in those Territories to have full representation in the House of Representatives? I point out that the Court reserved judgment on 6 May last and that in earlier such challenges in 1975 by the governments of Western Australia and Queensland, and the former government of New South Wales supported by the government of Victoria, judgment was reserved on 22 May and given on 10 October- a much shorter period than has elapsed in the present challenge. </para>

        <para class="block">From 1962 to 1972 the average rate of inflation in Australia was 3.4 per cent. In Germany it was 3.2 per cent, in the United States of America 3.3 per cent, in Japan 5.7 per cent, in France 4.4 per cent and the total for the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was 3.9 per cent. It should be noted that, when the present Government parties were in office, we maintained a respectable relationship to other advanced countries. In 1975, as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition- his own colleagues said that he was not in charge of the country, and clearly he was not- Australia&#39;s inflation was 15.1 per cent. Inflation in Germany was 6 per cent, in the United States 7 per cent, in Japan 1 1.8 per cent, in France 1 1.7 per cent and the average for the OECD countries was 10.6 per cent. The figure for Australia was very much worse than all those other figures. I think it ought to be noted that in one particular area the honourable gentleman accepted in part responsibility for these matters. Sometimes he blamed overseas events; sometimes he blamed Treasurers, whom he sacked very rapidly; and sometimes he blamed wages. But in January 1975 he said: </para>

            <para>-Has the Treasurer noted that most outside commentators, including business groups such as the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce, are calling for the adoption of the Australian Labor Party&#39;s short term economic policy of job creation through selective stimulatory government spending? Has he noted from a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey that more than 65,000 people in Australia who want a job stop looking for one because of continual discouragement, which means that the present unprecedented and disastrous unemployment figures are an under-estimate? Now that we are to have an election in just over six weeks, will the Government do a somersault and announce soon increased government spending including spending on job creation programs? </para>

            <para>- I certainly reject completely what the honourable gentleman has suggested. There will be no deviation from the Budget policy announced in the Budget Speech and in documents attached to the Budget. I reject any suggestion by the honourable gentleman that senior business groups have in some strange way embraced the discredited policies which the honourable gentleman and his colleagues on the other side of the House have been putting forward. In all the discussions that the Government has had with senior business groups in the course of recent months- they have been very comprehensive and quite extensive discussions- one solid point has been put consistently to the Government and that is that the Government must stick to its economic policies because there is widespread recognition throughout the Australian community that those policies are now working and that their success is a matter of very clear and incontrovertible record. The honourable gentleman should look back at the comments on economic policy made by him, by the Leader of the Opposition and by the honourable member for Oxley. I note, in passing, that the honourable member for Oxley has been unceremoniously dumped from the position of economic spokesman by the Leader of the Opposition for reasons which this House well understands. I would welcome questions on that at a later stage. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member for Adelaide looks back at what the Australian Labor Party has been saying he will see that it is a lurch back to the policy errors of the past. The Labor Party&#39;s policy in this election campaign has been clearly enunciated in recent months. It is a policy of more expansionary spending, higher deficits and greater pressure on an upward movement of interest rates. In regard to unemployment, the honourable gentleman and his colleagues created the major problem of the wage distortion in 1974-75. At that stage they </para>

That distortion now is being corrected but it will, of course, take further time before the impact of increased economic activity and a lower rate of inflation feeds through into the area of unemployment. Let the honourable gentleman be under no misapprehension: What he is putting forward now is no more than a repetition of the discredited errors of the past. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> said after the Leader of the Opposition had brought down his reply to the Budget, it is more of the same old bungling and the Australian community will be very much aware of that. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Treasurer, by reminding him that on 20 September I drew attention to the fact that many Australian subsidiaries of trans-national companies were shifting assets out of this country because of the feared devaluation. Is the Treasurer aware that a large trans-national corporation, the Utah Development Co., declared dividends of $60m in the September quarter on earnings of $32m, a rate of 187 per cent? Were most of these dividends repatriated to the United States parent company without payment of withholding tax in Australia? Have the actions of large trans-nationals such as Utah contributed to the outflow of $635m from Australia in the last five weeks? Has the outflow continued despite an addition of $8 16m to international reserves through official overseas borrowings and a gold revaluation during this period? </para>

            <para>- The honourable gentleman and his colleagues did nothing about this situation when they were in government. I believe that any suggestions of the type put forward by the honourable gentleman ought to be seen very much in that context. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I do not speak specifically about the profit or tax position of the Utah Development Co. or its shareholders, because you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> the honourable gentleman should be very much aware that this is something about which I have no knowledge.

          <para>Speaking generally on the point raised by the honourable gentleman, I say that it has long been a feature of income tax law, unchanged by the honourable gentleman and his colleagues, that if a foreign company operates in Australia through a branch rather than an Australian resident subsidiary, Australia collects company tax on that company&#39;s Australian profits but no tax on overseas profit remittances or on dividends paid to overseas shareholders out of the Australian profits. Because I think it is worthy of repetition, I repeat that, unlike the honourable gentleman and his colleagues when they were in government, this Government is looking at the position. I have asked the taxation branch of the Treasury Department to bring forward papers which can be analysed by myself and senior Ministers. </para>
          <para>So far as the exchange rate is concerned, because the honourable gentleman finished on that point, I think I have made it perfectly clear to the honourable gentleman that questions from the Opposition side of the House on this matter are very unhelpful with regard to speculation. I want to state again in the strongest possible terms, taking the point of national interest which the honourable gentleman seeks conveniently to overlook for petty party political purposes, that the honourable gentleman should know full well that these are not matters which ought to be subject to question and answer in the House day after day. I deplore such action.

The honourable gentleman recognises, by reference to the figure of 3,000 employees, the number of jobs which has been provided to Australians by that very significant company. Through the tax system this company makes an equally significant contribution to this country&#39;s receipts. With regard to the specifics of what the honourable gentleman has posed, I rest on what I said when I responded to an earlier question, that is, when Opposition gentlemen were in government the policy position remained untouched and unexamined. At the present time the matter is under examination and I have called for papers on the particular point that has been raised today. </para>

            <para>- I must say that I read with some surprise yesterday a letter which has been circulated to local government authorities throughout New South Wales urging them to make representations to me because commuter services to Sydney Airport are about to be eliminated. I understand that letter was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gruzman.</inline> I must say that there is absolutely no substance to the allegation. I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gruzman</inline> did not check either with me or with my Department before being silly enough to alarm so many local government authorities throughout New South Wales. There is a review going on of the usage of Sydney Airport. At critical periods Sydney Airport is close to full capacity. At times of full capacity priority has to be given to certain aircraft such as commuter aircraft, for which provision has been properly made, the major domestic airlines and international airlines. In the review we are putting privately owned and singly flown aircraft at the bottom of the ladder. But I make it quite clear to all local government authorities in New South Wales that there is no substance in the allegation because proper provision is being made for commuter services. </para>

          <para>The allegations about lack of fire fighting services were made in this House by the honourable member for Shortland and they were rather deplorable in light of the facts. The facts are that in the budgets brought down by the LiberalNational Country Party Government in the three years up to 1972, $2.4m was made available for the purchase and provisions of fire fighting services. In the three years under Labor, from 1972 to 1975, only $600,000 was made available for that purpose. In the two years we have been back in office we have stepped up expenditure to $2m. So if there are to be any allegations about a shortage of fire tenders at the Sydney airport, those allegations ought to be directed against the Labor Party. The fact is that since coming back into office we have ordered another 19 ultralarge fire tenders and another nine interventionist fire tenders. We have done that simply because of the neglect by the Labor Party when it was in office m not carrying out its proper responsibilities in this matter. </para>

              <para>- The honourable gentleman asked a question yesterday. It was out of order on two grounds. One was that an implication could be read into it about the named person and therefore it should go on the notice paper. So it was out of order in terms of questions without notice. The honourable gentleman then submitted a question on notice and when I had more time to reflect on the question on notice it became apparent to me that it was out of order for the second reason- the one that I have given this morning, that is, that I have steadfastly refused to allow members of this Parliament to ask these questions, no matter which party is in government. I think it is wrong for Ministers in this House to be answerable for the actions of the party organisation. That is a practice that has been followed by my predecessors. It has been followed by me. I. intend to follow it on this occasion. </para>

              <para>- Further to the point of order, I would like to point out that the question is not directed to the party organisation. There is a big difference between the party organisation raising funds and the person who is a candidate in a specific electorate raising them. The candidate would well know the ins and outs of raising funds in the one electorate as against the party organisation raising funds. From the nod that was given by the Treasurer on the other side of the House, yesterday he objected and said &#39;put on notice&#39; but today he has indicated that he is quite prepared to answer the question. </para>

              <para>- I can see what the honourable gentleman&#39;s tactic in this question is and I certainly do not want to join him in that. Could I say two things? The honourable gentleman should be very much aware that matters of finance raising on this side of the House are not the responsibility of members of Parliament nor, in fact, the responsibility of endorsed candidates. The responsibility rests with the finance committees in the various electorates. The matter was checked by me yesterday with the  chairman  of the Flinders finance committee who has the responsibility in these matters, not me. The details are not known to me. The  chairman  of the Flinders finance committee has issued or will shortly issue a Press statement and as I recall the text of that statement, the answer which has been provided by the  chairman  of that finance committee is &#39;No&#39;. I suggest that the honourable gentleman should not raise questions of this type in this House because of the implication behind them; he should place them on notice. </para>

            <para>- I am concerned that such reports have already been issued because I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope went into these matters with a great deal of care and a greaf deal of concern for the civil liberties of Australians, as one would expect, and I would believe that was one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition, in his time, in government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope to examine Australia&#39;s security intelligence services- not just ASIO but the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Division. Apparently the head of the Australian Labor Party rejects the findings and recommendations of the royal commissioner appointed by the party that he, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> heads in its organisational structure. I believe that is most regrettable because these recommendations have been made by  His  Honour himself against the assessment of the threat to Australia to make sure that Australia&#39;s intelligence services are relevant to Australia&#39;s present day needs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It needs to be emphasised that in the fourth report concerning ASIO <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s basic finding was that Australia needs and should have a security intelligence service to investigate and provide intelligence about threats to the internal security of the nation.  His  Honour stated: </para>

          <para>But on the other hand perhaps it is not surprising that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> as  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, is sensitive about more effective ASIO operations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope in his report on this area of subversion said: ... the two main communist parties, the Communist Party of Australia and the Socialist Party of Australia, have strong influence in some unions. They exercise a power greatly in excess of that which their numbers would justify, among other reasons because they often strongly support the interests of trade unionists and put their full force behind industrial issues. </para>

          <para class="block">I added the words &#39;that is communist&#39; because the judge was talking of the communist parties. The Government has no doubt that a more effective and efficient ASIO is of fundamental importance to Australia&#39;s internal security just as it has no doubt that it needs ASIS and the Defence Signals Division, as the judge also strongly recommended. We praise and thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope for his great concern to strike a proper balance between the need to respond decisively to threat to Australia&#39;s security and to preserve individual freedom. I believe that the Government&#39;s decisions on these matters and the various appeal tribunals will achieve that end. </para>
          <para>I was gratified to see, as I understand it, that the Leader of the Opposition has been reported as having defended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s report. He suggested that there ought to be a bi-partisan approach to these matters. I hope that that can be achieved. I believe these matters are of fundamental importance to Australia now and in the future. There are one or two things that the honourable gentleman did for which I suppose one would need to give him some credit. One was appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope to undertake this inquiry. The second was appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward to head ASIO. I have great confidence in both honourable gentlemen. I hope that the Australian Labor Party, in its totality, can have the same attitude. But it has been made quite plain that that is not so, since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has bitterly attacked the findings of  His  Honour. This is one of the things about which people are left in some bewilderment. They never really know which of the Labor Party spokesmen are enunciating policy which will be followed at any one time. Therefore there is the question as to whether some future Labor Administration- if the Labor Party ever had an opportunity to be in government- would accept those findings or do what some of its members want to do, that is destroy the security intelligence services which Australia so sorely needs. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I am, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. I</inline> have previously drawn to your attention that the matters which the right honourable gentleman is now raising are the subject of court actions. They are sub judice. I informed you earlier that there was such a case. The first was to come on in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory on Monday of this week. The Court was informed that the matter had been settled. I expect it will be mentioned in the Court tomorrow. A payment will be made and an apology will be read. It is quite out of order, I submit, in those circumstances for the Prime Minister to say under privilege here things that anybody can, with impunity, quote outside, when, where there has been an opportunity to litigate these matters, the persons against whom the action has been taken have decided to settle. I also assure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that there are other related matters which have not come before the Court yet because only one judge has been operating. A reference has also been made to the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. He also has matters waiting to be heard in the same Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I put it to you quite seriously that it is out of order for the Prime Minister, and previously of course for the Government Whip, to say things about matters which are sub judice. The first matter was to come on and was settled. Others would have come on if there had been more than one judge. The ploy is quite obviously to say things under privilege in the Parliament which can be quoted outside. </para>

The purpose of the sub judice rule is to prevent any prejudice. If a matter has been settled, whether or not the formal settlement has been made, there can be no possibility of prejudice. I further draw your attention to the principles set down by the House of Commons in relauon to the sub judice rule.

It committed his Government going into partnership in the mining, development and export of uranium with certain commercial companies.

The document contains terms which indicate that the agreement is subject to the Ranger environmental report. That was not included in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. Therefore, I ask that the full text of the agreement be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that the whole truth and not selected items of the truth, which are misleading, can be put to the Parliament. </para>

The way in which the Prime Minister used that term previously was not in the sense of an allegation against the Leader of the Opposition but it was a conclusion drawn out of the facts. Whether the allegation will stand up will depend upon an examination of the documents. A request has been made that the document <inline font-style="italic">Memorandum of Understanding</inline> be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The Prime Minister has already indicated that he would be prepared to do that.

This morning one or two things seemed to be happening in the course of that procedure. I overlooked calling a member from the Country Party to ask the fourth question from that side. In fact only four questions were asked from the Government side. It was an error on my part. I noticed, however, that the proceedings were not actually being televised at the time. I will make.it up next week. </para>

He drew attention to the fact that prior to 1972 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government had spent a certain amount of money on airports when he was Minister. He was not the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> was, if I remember rightly. The Minister also said that during our term of office we spent a certain amount of money and that since then this Government has spent a certain amount of money. I draw attention to the fact that during my time as Minister no safety facilities were neglected or in any way not taken into consideration when departmental reports were brought to my attention. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that a decision, as best I recall, was taken by me as Minister on the relocation of the fire-fighting services and facilities at Mascot Airport to bring them into line with international standards. That decision was taken. As at this time, almost two years after the decision was taken, that facility has not been brought up to international standard, as required. </para>

            <para>-A11 right, I will not blow it. It clearly indicates that the Government is severely cutting back as far as those facilities are concerned. The Labor Government set up the Road Safety and Standards Authority. This Government dismantled it, with no regard whatever to the thousands of people who are killed and maimed on the roads. That toll could be reduced. I have requested the setting up of a transport accident investigation authority. There has been no move by the Minister in any of these areas. I completely reject the statement that safety in any form was in any way neglected by me as Minister for Transport. </para>

            <para>-On 2 June 1977 I raised in this Parliament an immigration fee racket which was being practiced by a Sydney solicitor, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> P. Khoury who practices under the name of Benjamin and Khoury at 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point. The amount involved was $1,100 which he extracted from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sums</inline> Pal Narayan, a Fijian of Indian origin. No mention was made of this matter in the Australian Press. No mention was made of the racket being practised by this rapacious solicitor. Fortunately the Fiji <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 15 June 1977 gave it front page treatment. So that our parliamentary record may be complete I ask for leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the matters which I raised in the Parliament on 2 June, namely letters from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> P. Khoury, Solicitor, of 1 February 1977 and 10 February 1977, a receipt for $300 dated 16 February 1977, and a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Narayan</inline> of 20 April 1977 seeking a further $500. I have made all these documents available to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> who has agreed to their being incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I seek leave to have them incorporated. </para>

            <para>-As a result of my raising the facts in Parliament on 2 June 1 977 the facts relating to other cases have come forward. They indicate the extent of the racket which is being practised by this solicitor. I am informed by reliable sources in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that this solicitor has extracted similar amounts of money from more than 600 unfortunate people who are seeking to become residents of Australia and has done absolutely nothing for any of them. Multiply 600 by $ 1 , 000. It comes to a somewhat staggering figure of $600,000. 1 would like to read out some information which I have received subsequent to my speech in this Parliament on 2 June 1977. 1 have statutory declarations.

			<para>Sir,</para>
			<para>I am a Fiji born Indian. My wife and I visited Australia on 28 Nov. 1 976 for a month. After visiting so many places, that place impressed us so much that we thought of applying for permanent residency. After inquiring with some of my friends who are already the citizens of your country I was directed to a lawyer by the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury.</inline> After telling my interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> &#39;s clerk, Michael Tindale, he advised me to pay a fee of $300 straight away, which I did and he asked me to leave our passports and tickets with him. He then gave me a letter and a card and told me if any immigration people came to me and asked me any question, show them the letter and that exactly happened on 24 of March at 9.15 pm. 3 immigration people came to me and asked for our passports, I gave them the letter and they asked me how much I had paid the lawyer. I told them the amount I had paid. They took me alone to the immigration office to check if my lawyer had applied for my permanent residency. After inquiring and checking for half an hour they found out that my lawyer had done nothing for us. He didn&#39; t even apply for me or send my application to immigration. So 1 had to spend that night in Custody. Next morning 25-3-77 the immigration officers brought me to their office and asked me if I wanted to ring my lawyer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr wife</inline> came to the immigration office at 9.30 am ana I told her to go and get my lawyer. She came back with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> at 2.15 pm. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> said to me not a good place to see you. I said <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, You</inline> didn&#39;t even apply for me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> said, what shall we do. I told him my case was at 4.30 pm this afternoon and I want you to attend the Court for me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> said I am very busy today and can attend on Monday. I told him if you wont attend today, I still will have to stay in Custody till Monday. After a while he told me to go back and I will still light for your permanent residency. I said its too late now, please refund my money and I am going back to Fiji. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> said alright I will ring my clerk up and advise him to pay me. Since I had to come to Fiji I gave my address to post the money, photos and my references. I waited for more than a week and yesterday I got his reply I am attaching his reply. </para>

          <para>- I suggest that all of the matters I have raised today should be investigated fully not only by the Law Society of New South Wales but also by the Law Reform Commission which was set up by the New South Wales Government and, if need be, by the Law Reform Commission which was set up by the Australian Government. To me it seems that there is an open and shut case of false pretences against Khoury. I also suggest that the legal aspects be investigated by the New South Wales Police Department with a view to a charge of false pretences being laid against Khoury. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I raise one other matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khoury</inline> is not alone in the treatment which he hands out to intending migrants who come to Australia. The New Settlers Federation of Australia, the Secretary of which is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baltinos,</inline> is also in on the racket. It charges $ 150-1 grant anyone that it is cheap by Khoury standards- plus $25 membership fee for doing absolutely nothing except exploiting would-be migrants to Australia. In this instance they are mainly Tongans, but Fijians are also included. I know that this matter is in the mind of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar),</inline> but unfortunately it appears that even he can do very little. In conclusion, I say that people such as these solicitors- Khoury is not the only one- are a disgrace to Australia and a disgrace to their profession. They should be exposed and the full processes of the law should be invoked against them. </para>

          <para>- I should like to raise some aspects of the role of the Defence Force, by pointing out something I have pointed out before in this House. Like a famous admiral, I believe in conviction through reiteration. In this case what I want to say is that in my view our defence forces must be organised,- structured and designed to do the things that they will have to do on their own. This requires the Department of Defence to create realistic scenarios of the sorts of things we might have to do on our own- what types of operations, against what level of opposition and what external supply we can expect during such operations. This is very difficult and requires some complex assessments, but we must do it if we wish to have a coherent design for our defence forces. It is difficult, but risks must be run in peace time as well as in war. If we design our defence forces in that manner and if we become involved in wider operations that we are not capable of dealing with on our own and we are operating with allies, our defence forces might not be ideal but they will still be a useful contribution. At least they will be designed to do the things that we have to do on our own. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One thing that we will have to do on our own is conduct surveillance of our surroundings and our approaches. The impending adoption of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone adds an area for surveillance almost the size of continental Australia. This is a major task for our defence forces and for our nation. I should point out one thing about surveillance. There is a distinction between that and reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is what occurs when one is looking for something specifically. If our intelligence is good, we should do a great deal of reconnaissance and very little general surveillance. Surveillance by its nature is extremely wasteful. </para>
        <para>Of course, surveillance is only one part of the problem. Ideally we should have a system by which all aircraft and ship targets in the surroundings of Australia are noted, identified and, where appropriate, arrested. This is extremely difficult. I should like to point out some of the problems involved. One suggestion frequently made is that we should use satellites. This is far from being as easy as it seems. One type of satellite, the geostationary satellite- one that is frequently used for communications- by the nature of the problem, must be over the equator and must be at a height of 36,000 kilometres. At that height resolution of targets with existing techniques is quite out of the question. The only way it would be possible would be if the target were prepared to co-operate by continuously transmitting. That does not seem very likely. For military or surveillance purposes a geostationary satellite at the present level of technology is not a reasonable option. </para>
        <para>An alternative is to have non-synchronous satellites. They typically are at heights of between 200 and 1,000 kilometres with a rotation period of about 90 minutes. In practice they &#39;see&#39; a strip of the earth about 1,000 kilometres wide beneath their track. With them we could use opticalvisual or infra-red systems or radar. They too have very considerable problems. We would need to have six satellites in phased orbit to cover the approaches to Australia. They would have a life of only one year because of the drag at that height. Finally, resolution-using television is not good. Photography would give better results, but there is the problem of recovering the photographs after they have been taken. The cost of such a system would be about $350m a year, which is more than the Defence Force spends on its total capital program at the moment. So I suggest that satellites as a method of surveillance are not a practical proposition for Australia at the present level of technology. </para>
        <para>An alternative is to use over-the-horizon radar in which Australia is in the van of technology in the world. Jindalee, which is operating in Central Australia now on an experimental basis, gives some hope of long-range detection. It operates at high frequencies and bounces its beam off the ionosphere. The trouble is that the ionosphere is not a perfect reflecting surface. In any case, it changes in altitude at different times of the day. Therefore there are problems in identification of targets and the tracking of them. It seems that Jindalee, when developed in a few years time, will give a good long-range capability against aircraft, even low flying aircraft, and may have some capability against small surface craft. In the meantime we are faced with a problem that if the Services are to contribute they have to do so with their existing types of equipment. Therefore I welcome the decision to order new, bigger and longer-range patrol boats as an important contribution to this. </para>
        <para>The problem with the Defence Force being involved in surveillance is, firstly, that its operations tend to be uneconomic. Its equipment is far too complex for the relatively simple role of picking up infiltrating fishing boats and so on. It is an uneconomic way of doing it. On the other hand, if the Defence Force acquired simple aircraft, simple patrol craft capable of domg the role economically, such equipment would be very unsatisfactory in a military role. It is a dilemma for which there is no simple solution. The second point of concern is that surveillance of this type in peace time is not an official role of the Defence Force. If the Defence Force is to be used with special equipment for such a role as fishery surveillance, then I think it would be appropriate for that to be charged to the votes of the relevant departments. We are distorting our defence effort if we acquire special equipment for nonmilitary purposes. We may delude ourselves that it is something to do with defence but in fact it has nothing to do with defence. </para>
        <para>The third problem is a legal one. If the Defence Force is used for fishery protection, we will run into the constitutional problem that the Commonwealth fisheries Act is applicable only outside the 3-mile limit At least, so far that is all that has been applied. State fisheries legislation applies inside the 3-mile limit and the States, except in the case of Western Australia, have not given the necessary authority to the Commonwealth officers and the Navy to implement the State laws. What we badly need, I think, is a referral particularly by Queensland, for the necessary authority for the Navy to implement the State fisheries Act inside the 3-mile limit. </para>
        <para>The final point is that magistrates&#39; hearings are wasting a great deal of the time of the people who have to arrest and tow a fishing boat in and wait for a hearing. That patrol boat and its crew are not employed on their proper tasks while they are waiting for the legal processes to grind on. We should look very carefully at how we can expedite the handling of such cases. These are all matters which must be cleared up. There is no doubt that the Defence Force must make a contribution to the proper surveillance of the surroundings of this country, but have to see that they are used in the most economic and effective way and not to the detriment of their prime role, which is the defence of this country. </para>

          <para>-The whole of Australia is aware of last weekend&#39;s great rallies against uranium mining in Australia. They also know the fate of the anti-uranium rally in Queensland. The key factor that made the Brisbane rally different from rallies everywhere else in Australia was the so-called law that is the work of one man, the Premier of Queensland. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is important that all people of goodwill and especially those in Queensland reflect upon what is now happening in that State. We must all weigh the consequences of ignoring the Queensland Premier&#39;s abuse ofhis powers to make laws. I recall the words of Martin Luther King in his letter to his fellow clergymen who questioned whether his action of demonstrating in Birmingham against an unjust law was unwise and untimely&#39;. He said in part: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I am cognizant of the inter-relatedness of all communities and States. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Throughout history there have always been courageous people who have been prepared to oppose unjust laws- Socrates, Spartacus, Christ, Mahatma Ghandi, Pastor Niemoller in Hitler&#39;s Germany, and Martin Luther King, to name a few. We must draw on the same dedication to freedom today to resist the growth of oppression and abuse of power in our community. </para>
        <para>I am deeply concerned about what has happened to the Queensland citizens who rallied to oppose uranium mining. People who oppose uranium mining and export are people of peace and of community. They are people who can see the dangers to their society and mankind that are the consequences of fuelling the nuclear industry and nuclear war. I am especially concerned about the arrest and detention of over 400 people because they were trying to do what every citizen in every other State and Territory of Australia has a right to do. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people outside Queensland exercised that right without incident. The people in Queensland were denied that right. In Queensland last weekend the people had two reasons to make a public protest. One was the uranium issue; the other was their loss of freedom. They rallied to oppose an unjust law. They rallied in the defence of freedom not only for themselves but for us all. I say &#39;us all&#39; because I am very much concerned that the leadership of this present Government will move down the same path as the Premier of Queensland. They will follow the trail that he has set. Once the first step is taken it is hard to stop; it is hard to turn back. The same erosion of established rights that is occurring in Queensland is going on in a more subtle way right across the nation. We cannot ignore what is happening in Queensland because, as Martin Luther King spelt out to us, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. </para>

              <para>- by leave-The report which has been tabled is the third report from the Standing Committee on Expenditure. Unlike the two previous reports which were on specific programs or activities, this report entitled &#39;A Year&#39;s Experience&#39; describes and reviews the work of the Committee since its establishment on 29 April 1976. Whilst the report contains recommendations, they are not central to it and consequently appear only in the body of the report. They are separate from the reports on accommodation for married servicemen and overseas representation which were tabled earlier this year. Central to this report is the Committee&#39;s view on its role and functions. After more than a year&#39;s experience it is possible to distinguish three broad types of functions: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Firstly, the examination and evaluation of the processes used in the planning, management and control of expenditure; secondly, the evaluation of programs to find out, amongst other things, whether there are alternative ways of obtaining policy objectives more efficiently or at lower cost; and thirdly, examination of programs and activities to see whether they are being administered with economy and efficiency. </para>
          <para>At this stage of the Committee&#39;s evolution it is difficult to say which of these functions will be more important. However, it appears that, commencing with the Budget Estimates inquiry, the Committee will be placing greater emphasis on evaluation of the processes used in the planning, management and control of expenditure. Taken together, those three functions represent a totally unique opportunity for a parliamentary committee to examine government expenditure. At the moment the full Committee is inquiring into the Budget Estimates, their formulation and use. One sub-committee is inquiring into the expenditure of the Commonwealth Department of Health and another sub-committee is investigating the defence services homes scheme, its efficiency as well as alternative methods of delivery of the loan benefit either through equivalent cash grants or second mortgages. In the report the Committee has attempted to relate its functions to those of other parliamentary committees of financial scrutiny. We have found that there is sufficient work for many parliamentary committees and that there have not been any problems in relation to the duplication of inquiries. Our close contact with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and informal contacts with other committees should ensure a continued smooth working relationship for the future. </para>
          <para>In general the Committee has found the Public Service to be fairly co-operative. However, there is one matter on which we have been obliged to report to the House, particularly as it raises the question of the right of Parliament to receive information from statutory bodies. When inquiring into the activity of a particular statutory body the Committee was told that it had no jurisdiction to do so because the Act which established that body gave its management entire control over its affairs and concerns. The Committee sought the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> on this matter but, soon after this, it received another letter, this time signed by the permanent head himself, asking the Committee to disregard the earlier communication. Co-operation was promised and was forthcoming. It should continue to be so. Because the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the Committee the Department will not be identified. We recall the same experience of Senate Estimates Committee B in 1971 in relation to the Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
          <para>As mentioned before, the important principle is the right of the Parliament to receive information relating to expenditure that Parliament has authorised. Using section 29(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 as its guide, the Committee has recommended that Bills that establish statutory bodies or that amend the functions of existing bodies contain a clause requiring that body to furnish information on its performance to either House of the Parliament or to any parliamentary committee. The contribution that the Committee has made and can make to public scrutiny is in very large part due to members of all three political parties working towards this common goal. The excellent attendance figure at Committee meetings reflects the keenness of both Government and Opposition members. I express special thanks to the  Deputy Chairman,  the Honourable Frank Stewart, who has helped both the former  Chairman  and me. The Committee will continue to present general reports of the type just tabled as the occasion demands. We believe that this report should make a significant contribution to exarnination of the work and the worth of financial committees of the Parliament. I commend the report to the House. </para>

            <para>-This report deals with the electronics industry and is tabled as the remaining chapter to the interim report tabled by me in the House on 2 June 1977 and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack in the Senate on 3 June 1977. 1 draw the attention of the House to two minor factual amendments the Committee wishes to make to the interim report. These arise from information or queries received after the interim report was tabled. They are, firstly, to substitute in paragraph 5.73 the words &#39;and experience in the field of unmanned flight&#39; for the words &#39;in the remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) field&#39;., and in the same paragraph substitute &#39;This background would have considerable relevance to design and development of a remotely piloted vehicle.&#39; for the words &#39;This experience would be very relevant to the design and development of a cruise type missile.&#39;; and, secondly, to substitute in paragraph 7.12 the words &#39;The boilers and turbines for the main engines in all three Daring destroyers were made at Cockatoo although some forgings and castings for the machinery were imported because at that time suitable capacity to produce these materials did not exist in Australia. The gearboxes were made at the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. All of the armament (i.e. guns, torpedo tubes and anti-submarine mortars) was manufactured in Australia, also at Bendigo.&#39; for the words &#39;but also some of the armament as well as the engines for the Daring Class ships.&#39; As I said, these are solely matters of fact or clarification brought to the Committee&#39;s attention after the tabling of the interim report. </para>

        <para>In regard to the electronics industry, the subject of the report tabled today, the Committee noted a substantial decline in recent years not only in size but also in range of capabilities. The Committee has now been led to conclude that Australia is now more heavily dependent on overseas sources for supply of its defence, electronic, electro-mechanical equipment and supporting spares than at any time since World War II. A large proportion of the more sophisticated equipment in modern weapons systems, such as aircraft, ships or tanks, is of a multi-disciplinary nature. Avionics equipment is an example. The electronics industry has had only limited exposure to the design, production or maintenance of this typg of equipment and has had little opportunity to gain experience in the integration of such equipment into more extensive systems. </para>
        <para class="block">In some areas where expertise has been developed over the years, particularly in the communications field, there are now definite signs of waning competence. The components section of the industry has suffered a major cutback in its capabilities. Together with a severe reduction in the size of the consumer products industry, this has resulted in a substantial loss of professional, sub-professional and skilled trades personnel. Also it has discouraged young people from training into the industry. </para>
        <para>It seems to the Committee that, in the course of Industries Assistance Commission inquiries into electronics equipment, there has been completely inadequate recognition given to the considerable defence importance of the electronics industry. The resultant recommendations, which appear to have been based on purely theoretical grounds and presumably on the assumption that Australia will have continuing access to overseas sources of supply, have greatly weakened the industry&#39;s base and its ability to expand effectively in an emergency when those sources may no longer be available. The Committee is firmly of the view that there is not now the capability in the industry to perform the range of tasks seen by the Department of Defence as being the rriinimum necessary and that there is not sufficient defence use being made of the industry to allow it to achieve even that minimum level. It considers this to be an untenable position and recommends that an examination be undertaken as a matter of urgency by the Defence (Industrial) Committee into the present shortcomings of the industry, the range of electronic and allied technologies in which, from the defence viewpoint, it should be involved and the actions required to ensure the achievement and sustenance of an adequate level of competence and capacity. The Committee has concluded that there is need for consistency of government policy so that decisions by industry concerning urgently required long term investment in upgrading facilities and manufacturing techniques can be taken with confidence. </para>
        <para>In dealing with the aerospace industry, the Committee concluded that skills already acquired in the pilotless aircraft field should be built on and recommended that the design and development of a cruise type missile should be undertaken. I should make it clear that there are many cruise type missiles, not all as complicated as the new United States strategic cruise missile. That is the purpose of the amendment I suggested earlier. <inline font-style="italic">Ikara,</inline> for instance, is an example of a cruise type missile. The Committee recommended also in the earlier report that in respect of major new aerospace equipment programs under investigation, particularly the TFF project, Australian industry participation should be m those areas conferring continuing support capability, technology gain and skill enhancement, with special attention being given to work related to the engines and the avionics equipment. The Committee repeats these recommendations as being of equal importance in the potential to run a substantial work load of defence significance in the electronics industry. </para>
        <para>With regard to the matter of tendering for offset work, the Committee has noted the concern of the industry with the high costs in which it can become involved. It strongly maintains that reasonable assistance in meeting these costs should be given by the Department of Defence because frequently the industry has had to put a lot of effort, much of it wasted, into meeting the tendering requirements of several potential overseas suppliers for a particular item when only one supplier can ultimately succeed in obtaining the order. The Committee has concluded that, as a means of increasing its competence, the electronics industry should be given greater exposure to more up-to-date defence electronic and avionic-type equipment by a larger input of appropriate maintenance work by the Services. The Committee cannot conclude its consideration of this industry without expressing its deep concern at the present seriously inadequate state of defence capability in general, particularly its quite limited competence in design, manufacture and support of multi-discipline type equipment that plays such a major part in current weapons systems. Electronics in one form or another is the key to the Defence Forces&#39; ability to deploy and to fight. </para>
        <para>This report on the electronics industry completes the Committee&#39;s survey of the key areas of the Australian defence industry. The Committee has made a large number of specific recommendations to improve the situation. I think that I should make it clear to the House that these were not made lightly and the Committee would not be satisfied to see them brushed aside lightly. The Government must govern but we, the legislature- the Parliament- have the right to inquire into government actions, to ask questions and to require answers. I make it clear that the Committee will not be satisfied until it receives answers from the Government on all the recommendations it has made, answers which satisfy the Committee that its recommendations have been considered honestly. I hope I have made it clear that the Committee will not be satisfied with a patronising pat on the head and a pigeonholed report. It would be exaggerating to suggest that the Committee was impressed with the reply to its interim report by the Defence Department. In this, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> said, in effect, that the report was worthy but, as it was based on a strategic assessment his Department did not accept, he did not propose to do anything about it. It is true that the Committee set out clearly the strategic assumptions on which its recommendations were based and that these included an examination of the consequences of this country being isolated from overseas supply. This is a remote but not impossible contingency for which support comes from a recent statement by Admiral Zumwalt, a former member of the United States Chiefs of Staff that, in the event of a global war, the United States Navy would be forced to abandon the Western Pacific. </para>
        <para>Personally I would be happier about the Defence Department&#39;s rejection of the Committee&#39;s strategic assumptions if I believed that it had some strategic assumptions, perhaps necessarily secret, of its own. But I am far from sure that this is so. I do not argue that we should endeavour to identify a particular enemy. By the time such an enemy is identifiable it is probably too late to prepare. But what we do need is a concept of what sort of operations we might have to undertake, against what level of opposition, with what warning time, and with what possibility of overseas support or supply. Without such clear assumptions, proper planning is impossible. Of course this is difficult but it is essential that such assessments should be made. Risks must be run in peace as in war. If one does not have a coherent defence planning framework, the whole defence machine wobbles off in meaningless disarray. </para>
        <para>We have provided such a framework and have made many suggestions as to the consequences of such a framework on defence industry. We wish to see a proper response to our suggestions from the Department of Defence. A further concern is that we have not been satisfied that the past submissions from the Department of Defence to the IAC have properly represented the needs of the defence industry, perhaps because the Department feared that if it was too persuasive it would find the cost of that assistance charged to the Defence vote. But an accounting procedure introduced during the reign of Charles II must not be permitted to destroy our defence industries. The Committee intends to monitor future Defence Department submissions to the IAC on key defence industries and if it is not satisfied with the submission it will make its own. That will be an interesting precedent. </para>
        <para>I would like before I conclude to thank the members of the sub-committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil),</inline> the honourable member for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short),</inline> the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman),</inline> the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> and the staff members <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hills, Mr Barton, Mrs Quinn</inline> and the adviser <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fleming.</inline> They have all worked long hours in the preparation of this report. It is, I think, a valuable report, the most comprehensive on this subject ever presented to the Parliament. Its implementation is important to this nation and as it is a unanimous report by members from both sides of the House if it is not implemented during the term of this Parliament I am sure we will all take action to ensure that it is implemented in the term of the next Parliament. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I want to remind the House of the importance of the report presented a few minutes ago. As my friend the honourable member for Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer)</inline> has pointed out it is certainly the most comprehensive examination of the defence industry carried out in this country by a parliamentary committee and it is probably the most searching one that any committee associated with the defence industry has brought down. Today&#39;s report is of course about the electronics industry and the keynote of that is the continuing decline in the capacity of that industry to support Australian defence services right across the board. I think it is part of the intellectual challenge to the people of Australia that they recognise the need to support such an industry. As the honourable member for Isaacs has pointed out, we have no specific guidelines, one might say, as to what defence is about. Therefore we have to decide at this stage, until we have decided on other terms for a defence system, that we will aim at selfsufficiency in the defence industrial area. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has worked very hard. Its members visited innumerable workshops, airfields and shipyards. They crawled through submarines, walked up and down ships under construction and so on. They talked to shipyard people. It has been a very thorough examination indeed and there is an immense body of information contained in the evidence placed before the Committee. We are confident that a lot of other factors are concerned with this industry apart from those concerned simply with defence because there is the intellectual spin-off from the work that is done by our defence scientists. We underrate the capacity of the Australian science industry, if we can call it that, to produce work up to the standards produced in the rest of the world and in fact in some areas work which surpasses those standards. I hope that all members of this House will make a careful study of this document because I think this is one of the prerequisites for their continued employment in this place and that the suggestions that the honourable member for Isaacs, who was the  chairman  of the subcommittee, has placed before the House will be pursued with tenacity in the new parliament so that whoever is the Minister for Defence, and, of course, it will be one of my colleagues after the elections, will at least know that there are people in this place who are concerned to ensure that the work of this Committee is carried through. </para>
        <para>I would like to thank those members of the Committee who worked with me. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Isaacs particularly in relation to the staff and also in relation to all those people who appeared before the Committee, many of whom were circumscribed by proscriptions imposed upon them by government departments and so on. In particular I would like to say thanks to the officers of the South Australian departments who for all sorts of reasons, some of them I presume flowing from the kind of government that exists in that State but perhaps from some internal history of the South Australian system, always seem to be frank, much more candid and co-operative before committees on which I sit than any other government officers in Australia. </para>

          <para>-The debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department gives an opportunity in a very short space of time to raise a number of very important matters. The most important from the point of view of people in Australia would be legal aid and whether the funds which are provided are adequate. I have a statement from the Attorney-General indicating that he feels that sufficient funds have been made available. In the course of that statement he clearly indicates that the commitment to the profession has been increased from $12m to $ 12.6m. My submission would be that $0.6m is not a sufficient increase to meet the needs of legal aid. If one were to look at this in the context of the inflationary situation one would see that the increase falls well below the inflationary level. The important consideration is that people who need legal aid cannot afford to wait. If they have problems in litigation or advice on matters generally. They are entitled to get legal aid. The imposition of a means test and other matters seriously prejudice the rights of people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have in front of me a letter written by Pike and Pike, solicitors of Sydney on behalf of a client whose name I will not mention. This firm says that is has a client who is an invalid pensioner aged 62 and his only assets are a house, which is his home, and a very old motor car. That is the extent of his assets. He desperately needs legal aid, as the firm says. He has a major problem.  His  solicitors sought legal aid and were alarmed to find that it is considered that this gentleman does not meet the criteria on the basis of need. The firm makes the point: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We find the decision incomprehensible and alarming. If an applicant such as our client - </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is, an invalid pensioner- cannot succeed in an application for legal aid, may we ask who would? </para>
        <para class="block">That is the present problem in Australia. Who would qualify if the means test is to be so rigidly applied? It is a complete contradiction of the statement made by the Attorney-General that the guidelines that are operating will enable some discretion in certain cases where applicants may be outside the monetary limits. This is an exact example of applications for legal aid being denied where the need is great. I do not think anybody in Australia would believe that a person in receipt of a social security pension of any type and who would have already had to meet a means test to qualify for a pension, would fail in the means test for legal aid. That is the direct position here. This is an important matter. If we are to deal with legal aid, it must be dealt with on the basis of need. Legal aid denied is justice denied, and there is no opportunity to correct it later. The Treasury dominance of the situation should not be allowed to continue. </para>
        <para>We want to adopt the Sackville report which says that there ought to be an independent commission which is not married to the profession as such but which has on it representatives of the people and of the consumers who can advise the Government as to the amount of legal aid that should be given. We then would get the independence of the people and the opportunity to give advice to the Government on the specific issue that people have a need in a legal area. People do not go and seek legal aid on the basis that they want a trial run on any matter. I am concerned with real issues of need. I would like the Government to have another serious look at the allocation that has been made. </para>
        <para>Another most important matter which is very topical in Queensland at present is the question of human rights. Human rights do not exist in Queensland. That is the first thing to say. The Human Rights Commission Bill introduced into this House does nothing to protect the rights of people in Queensland. We nave seen in recent days, and particularly last week, examples of where people were not entitled to exercise their rights in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that is, the right to demonstrate on any issue that they thought was proper as long as they did it in a peaceful fashion. The people concerned did that. Four hundred of these people were arrested and charged. I draw attention to the fact that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has in it a number of articles which set out the rights of people. These articles recognise the dignity of the human person. The covenant also has in it a number of measures which guarantee these rights. Article 2 is one of them. It states that if a person feels his rights have been interfered with in any way the question should be dealt with by a competent judicial tribunal. We do not see that happening in Queensland. The question of holding a march is left to the Police Commissioner. No judicial tribunal is involved. Let us look at some of the other articles in the International Covenant. We see that everyone is entitled to the right of thought, conscience and freedom. People have the right to hold opinions without interference. Article 21 provides: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognised. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Article 22 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Not one of those rights can be maintained in Queensland at present. The legislation introduced into this Parliament which has not yet been debated will do nothing to protect people&#39;s rights in Queensland. The legislation virtually establishes a commission which will investigate matters. The best it could do on the question of State law in Queensland would be to examine the legislation and perhaps make a report to a Federal Minister; that is as far as it could go. </para>
        <para>I have been given the transcript of the Premiers Conference held in April this year. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> together with the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eflicott,</inline> were anxious to introduce legislation on human rights. At that time it might well be said that they were trying to introduce legislation which would encompass State law. That is most essential. What do we find? I find, reading from the transcript the Premier of Queensland saying that he will not have a bar of it. The expression he used was: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We will not be in it </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He went on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This is like the environment. We have the Commonwealth butting in and telling us what we can do and what we cannot do. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Premier of Queensland would not agree. He said that it would not be long before Ministers like Viner and Newman were going to Queensland and trying to tell that State what to do. He said that his State had had enough of them. Unfortunately for the people of Australia that sort of nonsense, that sort of mental thuggery and that sort of suggestion that the people of Queensland will have to put up with what that Premier wants, prevailed. Instead of having effective legislation providing for uniformity throughout the nation, along with an effective piece of legal rights legislation in accordance with the International Covenant, we have nothing except an advisory commission or a commission that can only examine. </para>
        <para>The problems that arose in Queensland last week will increase fourfold. People will not be mtimidated by a Premier who does not adhere to the principles of human dignity and will not give people their rights. Let us look at the clerics in Queensland. They are well meaning people who understand the rights of others. Some 16 of them from all the churches objected strongly to the Queen about the actions that the police used in Brisbane last week. What sort of abuse did they get? The Premier comes out and says that they are communists and atheists. This is the extraordinary gentleman who claims to have the title of a democratic leader. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that a Bill of Rights has an advantage. It allows the diffusing of political grievances as they arise. Improper laws and practices only encourage violence. That should be recognised by the Premier of Queensland. </para>
        <para>Finally I make the point in respect of litigation at present- I am not talking about the litigation; I am talking about the question of it- proceeded with by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey.</inline> I wrote to the Prime Minister asking whether an inquiry should be made as to where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> was getting his funds to prosecute former Ministers of the Labor Government. I said that it was worthwhile reporting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> &#39;s solicitor, who is in Canberra, virtually acknowledged that he had received substantial sums of money to pay the costs already incurred by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey.</inline> The amount could be as high as $100,000. The question of maintenance arises. If somebody is mamtaining an action- in other words providing the funds to Sankey- they are liable to be guilty of a criminal act. I asked the Prime Minister to investigate. I received a letter in reply stating that he had been advised that there was no concern because there was no offence against Commonwealth law. That is ridiculous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> &#39;s solicitors are in Canberra, quite within the federal jurisdiction. It is proper that the source of those funds should be investigated. It could well be that a malicious person is putting up substantial sums of money to affect people on this side of the House. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>-I just want to speak in relation to some of the matters that the honourable member for KingsfordSmith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> has mentioned. He referred to legal aid. The fact is that the amounts appropriated for legal aid under this Government increased from something like $12m in 1975-76 to, I think, $20.2m this year. That is an increase of more than 50 per cent. Last year the amount expended was $ 17.1m. This year it has gone up by a couple of million dollars. In other words, this Government has honoured its election promise. It has, in fact, increased the moneys available for legal aid around this country. From the time the Government came to power it is quite clear that very lengthy discussions took place with the States for the purpose of establishing a rationalised legal aid system in this country. These discussions have gone on assiduously so far as the Commonwealth is concerned since early last year. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>At this stage legal aid commissions are about to commence in Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and probably in South Australia. Those legal aid commissions will, we believe, add considerably to the amount of legal aid funds available to the community. The effect of the rationalisation of the institutions that exist in the various States with the Australian Legal Aid Office will be that more funds will flow to the public. It is true that the means test was regulated m March last year, but that means test has applied ever since. It has, in a satisfactory way, meant that people who are really in need of legal aid have been getting it. We know that legal aid, in proportional terms, has basically gone to people who are involved in family law matters. I think that more than 80 per cent of the legal aid vote in fact goes to family law cases. I and others have said that there is a great need to work out in this area some sort of lump sum fee that will, in effect, mean that the legal aid vote for family law will be spread amongst more people in need. I know that this matter has been looked at by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department with a view to ensuring that instead of there being a bottomless pit for legal aid- this often occurs in custody and maintenance cases that are defended- in future a lump sum fee will be made available. . The person who is legally aided will have to face die same situation as a non-legally aided personnamely, a limited amount of funds will be available. As regards the honourable member&#39;s reference to the form of the legal aid commission, I remind honourable members that the legal aid ordinance that was prepared for the Australian Capital Territory, and is now in operation, provides for a broad span of community interest. It is not only lawyers who are involved in the Commission. Others from the social service and consumer areas are involved. The salaried lawyers made submissions that they should be on the Commission and an undertaking was given to them that within time that would be reconsidered. But basically, what the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith mentionednamely, a broadly based commission- is proposed for the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
        <para>He also mentioned the Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission Bill 1977 was introduced on 1 June this year. That Bill followed discussions which took place between the Commonwealth and the State Attorneys General with a view to ensuring that there would be a system of human rights that would, in effect, cover all law within this country. The honourable member well knows that, and he well knows that it was the Government&#39;s desire that, if possible, there should be a broadly based commission. However, we cannot force the States into institutions that they do not want to go into. It is not only Queensland that does not want to be part of this Commission. Indeed, the Labor States of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, do not want to go with the Commonwealth into a human rights commission which would be broadly based. However, they agreed to sit down with the Commonwealth and discuss further the legislation. This agreement came out at the Premiers Conference to which the honourable member for KingsfordSmith referred. There are currently in train arrangements for discussions to take place one hopes in the reasonably near future that will lead to a more broadly based approach to human rights in this country. </para>
        <para>I think there is one aspect at which we should be looking, and that is whether there could be evolved a declaration of human rights that could be adopted by this Parliament and also by every other parliament in the country. Honourable members will know that in Canada there is a declaration of human rights. It is, in effect, part of Canada&#39;s constitutional documents. It would be a good thing in this country if we were able to use the covenant on civil and political rights to formulate legislation which formed the basis of a declaration of human rights in this country. It could then act as a guide to legislation in this Parliament and in every other parliament in the country. It could, in effect, be a broadly based, broadly stated document. It could, in effect, be almost a constitutional document although one would have to agree it could be amended by parliaments or it could be departed from. At least it would be a step- a very significant step- towards getting a broadly based system in this country. </para>
        <para>The other purpose for which such a document could be used is as a guide to human rights committees or commissions which would hear applications from members of the public who claimed that in some way their human rights were being infringed. For instance, if somebody said that he was discriminated against in his employment or in some other way- even on a racial or sexist basis- he would be able to go to a commission and put the matter before the commission. The commission could look at it and make a decision. If the decision was one that was capable of being enforced by some order which could be registered, say, in the Federal court or some State court, a human rights system could be evolved in this country which would be broadly based and effective. May I say, however, that this system could not operate unless there was full cooperation between certainly some of the States and the Commonwealth. I have in mind that there could be a human rights committee, for instance, established under State legislation in New South Wales- just to take an examplewhich could have jurisdiction conferred on it by a Federal Act. That committee could administer a State Act and a Federal Act relating to human rights. By that method there could, as I say, be a broadly based situation where human rights could be enforced across the board. As I have said, reference was made to legal aid and also to human rghts. One other matter relating to costs has been raised but I will leave that to other honourable members to deal with. </para>

          <para>-The matter that was raised by the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> concerning human rights interests me because the fact is that the former Attorney-General committed the Government to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission by 1 July. A Bill has been introduced but, of course, not yet debated. It is possible that here again we might have another broken promise. The former Attorney-General who preceded me in this debate had the original intention of involving the States in the preparation of this Human Rights Commission and matters associated with it But it is a fact that the Premier of Queensland scotched this idea at the April Premiers Conference when he told the Prime Minister and, I think, the former AttorneyGeneral, that he would &#39;not have a bar of the Commission&#39;. Of course, in the light of the current erosion of civil liberties in Queensland one can understand the motivation for the Premier&#39;s action. This Human Rights Commission is to be based on the International Covenant on Civil and Policy Rights of 1 966 which was signed by the Labor Government 16 days after taking office in December 1972. As I understand it, the matter has still not been ratified by the present Government. I suppose there are many Australians and many members of Parliament from both sides of the House who are concerned at the breaches of these principles. At least five Articles of the Covenant appear to have been breached by the Queensland Government. Article 2 which relates to discrimination has certainly been breached in my view so far as the treatment of Aboriginals and women are concerned. The Queensland Government stands in breach of Article 19, which states: . . . everyone shall have the right to hold opinions and the right to freedom of expression. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Similarly, Article 2 1 has been disregarded. That Article provides for the right of peaceful assembly. Article 22 deals with freedom of association and Article 25 deals with the right to universal and equal suffrage. Clearly, the Queensland Government is in breach of that proposal when we have regard to the incredible gerrymander that operates in that State where the government of the day is elected on about 24 per cent of the votes. It is certainly not part of the so-called free world. As I see it, there is a need for human rights to be uniform throughout Australia. There must be power to invoke judicial remedies for breaches. It is clear that this Government puts States rights before human rights. I think it has to be acknowledged that there has been some neglect, some lack of example and lack of leadership on the part of the Fraser Government in bringing die States to the point of meeting the requirements of that international objective. </para>
        <para>I want to say something about the legal aid issue, which has been raised by the honourable member for Kingsford -Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> and by the honourable member for Wentworth who preceded me in the debate. As I understand it, the Budget allocation for legal aid in 1977-78 is $ 19.2m, plus an additional $600,000 which was thrown in subsequently as a pre-election announcement and which no doubt is designed to win back some of those private practitioners who rely on government funds to supplement the income they receive from their practice. The allocation is made up of $ 15.3m, plus additional unspecified payments to the States. Those payments are to be made only to the extent that the States are prepared to establish legal aid commissions. There is a degree of option, and the extent to which provision for legal aid will be made, will vary from Sate to State. I believe that is a very unfortunate situation. As is the case with all social welfare programs since 1975, this allocation is reduced in real terms. It is true that the amount of money allocated is greater than it has been previously &#39; but, in real terms, having regard to inflation, the amount is effectively reduced. Plans for the expansion of the program into country areas and outlying suburbs where such a service is desperately needed have obviously gone down the dram. </para>
        <para>The legal aid commissions which the Government is seeking to impose upon the States are to be dominated by the profession; community groups and representatives of organisations which deal with recipients of legal aid on a daytoday basis are not to be represented. I believe that that is very unfortunate. It is a departure from the principles and the concepts which the former Labor Government initiated. There is a real risk that any legal aid scheme controlled by the profession will concentrate heavily on those areas of legal work which the profession is used to handling, which can provide a quick turnover and which bring in maximum financial rewards. With the support of government nominees, many people in the profession, in my view, will endeavour to avoid law reform and community development work. Attempts to devote resources to environmental, Aboriginal and other minority group problems for litigation, submission and representation at inquiries will continue to be ignored. A case in pomt is the Budget allocation for meeting the cost of public hearings on environmental matters. The allocation to cover the cost of such public hearings has been reduced to $65,000 this year compared with $507,268 last year, a 78 per cent reduction. Much could be said about the cuts in expenditure in that area. </para>
        <para>I believe that any system of legal aid should have funds to devote to law reform and preventative law, through working arrangements with social welfare agencies of the shop front style of legal aid to bridge the gap between those who understand the maze which is the legal system and those whom the system abuses and ignores. For too long the law has been cloistered and the prerogative of the articulate and the better educated. The Australian Legal Aid Office was created to serve the people who need legal aid the most, those who know little about the benefits and rewards which the legal system can confer on those who understand. As a result of the Government&#39;s outdated guidelines and restrictive means test, many people who now recognise the benefits of using the legal system are still excluded from doing so. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith made reference to a case in point. I mention another one. It involves a person whose only asset was a home valued at $25,500 and who had less than $25 in the bank. He owned a 1967 Holden and his total income which amounted to $47.10 a week was derived from an invalid pension. He was refused legal aid as his adjusted income exceeded the allowable limit by $3. As bis solicitor pointed out in a letter to the then Attorney-General, such a decision is both incomprehensible and alarming. It raises the question of just who is entitled to legal aid under the management of this Government. </para>
        <para>It is true that legal aid has been sent off in specialised directions and that many people who have ordinary cases of litigation are excluded from receiving it if they are not covered by such provisions as the Family Law Act. So, I believe that the Government has broken a promise in this regard. There are people throughout the country who are waiting for the return of a Labor government so that the principles associated with a decent legal aid system can be reinstituted. </para>

          <para>- I rise to speak on the estimates for the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department to counter some of the arguments that were put forward by the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> who preceded me and also to speak on the Australian Legal Aid Office and some aspects of legal aid. First of all, the Queensland Government comes in for quite a deal of criticism, unfairly at the best of times, about some of the legislation that it introduces. I simply wish to rebuff some of the arguments that have been used previously. No doubt the law gives all humans the right to peaceful assembly. I believe that under the law everybody should have the same rights as those people who wish to demonstrate. Obviously the reference made to that aspect of the legislation which deals with the rights of individuals in Queensland and which prevents peaceful assembly is not correct. People can assemble peacefully in the State of Queensland but they should ensure that it is not at the inconvenience of the travelling public. Our roads are meant for motor traffic and not for pedestrians who would like to sprawl themselves all over the roads and thereby hold up the normal activities of the law abiding people. They have the right to assemble, that point was not made previously. </para>

            <para>- It does not make it right; I will confirm that. The experience of three years of Labor Government would confirm that because Labor does something it does not make it right. I think that the Australian people would indicate that the honourable member is correct in his assertion that what Labor says is not necessarily right. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I rise on these estimates because I get a little sickened by this continued reference to Queensland. The last census shows that there has been a transfer of population to that northern State from the southern States; so there must be something up there that appeals to those people. It certainly is not a Labor Parliament or a Labor Government. So perhaps it would not be a bad idea for the learned gentleman or others to ponder on that fact that that is the situation. </para>
        <para>Having defended, and I think quite capably, our own Queensland Government, I wish to deal now with the important matter of the Legal Aid Office. We have heard that all that the Labor Government did was not right. I believe that when the Legal Aid Office was established it was viewed with suspicion at the outset not only by the public but also by the legal fraternity. I am happy to say that it has now found acceptance within the Australian community. It fulfils a very real need for those people who do not have access to other legal advice or representation. In Queensland, this program is associated with people who are dedicated to providing high quality legal advice and representation. The legal aid officers throughout Queensland would be a good example of this. Whilst the program was viewed at first with suspicion, this impression has now been corrected. It has the compensating effect of more people requiring those services and that aid. I am not sure whether the number of officers in those branches is sufficient at this stage to do justice to the requirements now made of the service. </para>
        <para>The mobile service which is operated in conjunction with the Legal Aid Office could, I believe, also be expanded, particularly in those States that have vast areas and scattered populations. I do not see why those scattered populations should be denied access to advice which is offered in a provincial or capital city. I know that this matter is under consideration. Certainly in Queensland moves have been made to make sure that these services are extended. Unfortunately it is not always possible to get the number of people required to service properly these areas. The service has started. I hope it will go forward. </para>
        <para>Under the new federalism scheme the Legal Aid Office which is gradually coming under the care or attention of the States has, I believe, a few problems at which we must look very carefully. We must make sure that these services are adopted by the States without the effects and auahty of the service presently being given by te Australian Legal Aid Office being adulterated. I believe this could be a tendency, particularly where legal aid was also offered by the State concerned. Perhaps certain bias and preconceptions could lead to a lessening of the quality of the service. I would not like to see that. I would like the Commonwealth to retain some oversight, at least in the interim, until the proper transfer has been effected. </para>
        <para>It has been suggested that in Queensland the Legal Aid Office should be taken over by the Public Curator Office. I think this would be very dangerous and would not be in the interest of members of the public who would need the service. The Public Curator Office would not only give advice. to those people who need it but cannot get it ordinarily but also provide a service for which the public pays. I believe there could be a real conflict of interest. I hope that as the legal fraternity in Queensland has accepted the proposal the service could be absorbed by the State to make sure that the high quality of service is maintained and continued. I pay tribute to employees of the Australian Legal Aid Office, particularly those in Queensland, who are currently giving this service. </para>
        <para>I believe it is also necessary to mention briefly the Aboriginal Legal Services, although they are not administered by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. There is a thought abroad, not only among the white population but also the coloured population, that the Services in some directions can be a very divisive instrument. They are dividing and not bringing together the various groups in Australia. The suggestion has been offered to me on more than one occasion that perhaps there should be only one legal aid service available to everybody, irrespective of colour, creed, religion or politics. I think the suggestion could be taken into account. It would lessen costs and would make available a more effective service for everybody. </para>
        <para>Could I also suggest that the attitude to marriage celebrants be closely examined by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack).</inline> These people are not always available to the small townships, areas and communities throughout outback Australia on the same per capita basis as apparently has been the basis of their appointment in the past Certainly the need is as desperate in the outback as it is in other places. For example, one person is allocated to two mining townships which are more than 60 miles apart. This person is not capable of giving the service that is required. I believe that in cases such as this the vast areas and the conditions of appointment should be looked at afresh, with a view to giving the best representation and the best availability of such services to all people throughout outback Australia. </para>

          <para>-My contribution to the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department relates to two factors. One relates to the deception of the Government in respect of Bills and issues such as human rights. The second relates to the quality of the judiciary which presides over courts, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, and the necessity for justice to be done not only in the passing of sentence on persons who are found guilty but in respect of persons who are charged and kept in custody for months waiting for those charges to be heard. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We on this side of the chamber have become accustomed to a long series of Bills from the Government which turn out to be simply elaborate window-dressing and which do not achieve anything. One of the first signs of the deception to which I referred was the insertion of a section in the Human Rights Commission Act which provided that the law would come into force on a date to be proclaimed. I want the Committee to remember those words. Those dates of proclamation always seem to be a long way off. The Acts are held in reserve, as it were, for a suitable public relations exercise. The Government can then take the credit for initiating far-reaching and proper legislation, without actually doing anything about it. If, and only if, another embarassment arises does the Government take the final step of proclaiming the law. When the finished product is far from the stated intention the deception is even worse. </para>
        <para>I refer to one Bill that passed both Houses in June- the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill. It passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate during June of this year. It has not yet been proclaimed. That position is much better than the position in regard to the Human Rights Commission Bill. The Commission has not yet hit the light of day. That is only the first step of course. What can happen after that is that the destiny of the Commission, which is set up by a very fine Bill, is enshrined in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill. It was a credit to the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> that the Bill allowed some area of appeal, particularly on issues in which I have been involved during the last 12 months in regard to the antiquated migration Act. At last some relief, some joy, has been given to a person who had been treated badly, and who now has recourse to the courts of this country to argue the merits of his case. He is no longer at the mercy of an individual- the Minister- who has great power over a deportee in such circumstances. </para>
        <para>I point out that this Bill is a famous piece of window-dressing and is an example of grandstanding. On the fundamental position in regard to an area of appeal in relation to human rights the Government grandstands, gets the legislation through, makes a great song and dance about it, passes one Bill through both Houses, then proceeds not to proclaim it. It has not been proclaimed to this day. What has happened to the Human Rights Commission Bill? The whole thing was a farce. As one proceeds to read the clauses of it one finds that they give the next way out. Instead of the Government putting its position on the line by introducing legislation that had been promised and that had been drafted, it is going to the people without that legislation being proclaimed. </para>
        <para>I turn to the second point that I want to raise, and that is the quality of the judiciary. I want to deal with both ends of the spectrum. The first one deals with people who are charged and left rotting in gaols for lengthy periods because we do not have sufficient judges to hear their cases. Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox as an ambassador at large. There is a lack of judges in the Australian Capital Territory. This prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> to ask this question of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack):</inline></para>
        <quote>
          <para>I ask the Attorney-General whether he is aware of the hardship and injustice arising from long delays currently experienced by liugants in the Australian Capital Territory Su- g rente Court. Does he know, for example, that as of 17 ictober 1977, 75 civil cases were ready for hearing but had not been given a hearing date in that Court? Does he know that persons have spent up to four months in custody before being brought to trial? what steps has he taken, or will he take, to amend the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act . . . </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">He went on to say that the problem had been brought about by a combination of factors, one in particular being that the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, had been acting for a considerable period in the Ranger inquiry. It was stated by the Prime Minister, who issued the Press release about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, that two new judges would be appointed in the Australian Capital Territory. The Attorney-General said that one of the existing judges, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Joske, would postpone his retirement for three months and that it would take time to find a replacement for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox. The Bill appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox as ambassador makes provision for preserving his status, whether he resigns or not. If he does not resign there will be no room for an extra judge without amendment of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act. Unless another judge is appointed the people referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan&#39;s</inline> question will be in precisely the same situation as they are now. </para>
        <para>Recently the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act was changed. Instead of requiring that a person appointed as judge should have practised law for at least five years, it now requires only that he should have had his name on the roll for five years. What does that mean? Does that mean that if there are people in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department whom the Government wants to move sideways for some reason or other can be made a judge of the Family Court? Are there any grounds for believing that they are adequately equipped to become judges or can suddenly emerge as people capable of carrying out a judicial role in society if they are moved out of their present area? Surely the analogy is a surgeon who claims to be an expert after he has passed his course. Any appointment to the bench has to be a practical man. He has to be someone who has practised in the area in which he is to operate. It is a tragedy to think that people who put themselves at the mercy of the courts could appear before someone not suitably qualified. The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> is not paying any attention to me. He is more interested in discussing with an honourable member who will not be here after the election something that is probably irrelevant to what we are talking about now. </para>
        <para>The Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court enjoys a high reputation. That reputation is diminishing because of the intolerable delays that have occurred, as I have indicated. The Attorney-General&#39;s answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> indicates one more broken promise by the Prime Minister. It is not good enough to suggest that the situation will be corrected by one of the existing judges postponing his retirement. That will simply prevent the situation from becoming even worse. I think it will become worse. I hope that the Attorney-General acts swiftly to make a new appointment and to preserve the level of esteem in which the Court is held in the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that the new appointee will be appointed also to the Federal Court, as are all other judges of the territorial courts. That means that the selection should be a person who could take his place on the Supreme Court of any State in Australia with pride and be accepted by the legal profession and the people who will be at his mercy. I would not want to see the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court downgraded by the introduction of a judge of a lesser status than all the other territorial Supreme Court judges. </para>
        <para>Whilst I recognise the difficulties that face the Attorney-General in finding someone of the necessary calibre, that difficulty does not seem to present any reason why the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act should not be amended to provide for two judges as promised by the Prime Minister. There should not be a long delay in appointing top-line practising lawyers to nil these important posts. It is simply not good enough when persons can be in custody for over four months before they are brought to trial. It is disgusting and degrading. It is another reason why the people will reject these individuals who have broken promises galore. This is another classic example. </para>

          <para>-The matters which I wish to raise concerning the Family Law Act are of the utmost national importance. Whilst the criticisms I intend to make of the working of the Act are very damning and worrying and ought to be of the gravest public concern, they are m no way a reflection upon the present Government or upon the administration of the Family Law Act by the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> or his predecessor. It has to be acknowledged that some fundamental mistakes were made when this Parliament passed the Family Law Act in its present form. There is no doubt in my mind that while the Family Law Act remains in its present form with all the imperfections that can occur in the adrninistration of justice, some very tragic miscarriages of justice are likely to occur simply because of the way in which the Act was ultimately passed and because of the lack of consideration of some of the points that were made in the debate on the legislation when it was before Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The point I wish to make relates to the separation of the question of divorce from the other questions that have to be decided when a marriage is dissolved. Under the Act as it is framed a court can grant a decree very quickly to dissolve a marriage, but as has now become clear courts become bogged down often without very good reason and it can be a considerable time before a court is able to dispose of matters relating to property, maintenance and custody of children. I do not believe many honourable members were aware of the consequences that could flow from the separation of these two questions. The consequences that worry me are considerable. They have become much clearer with the considerable delay that is being occasioned in New South Wales in particular as a result of the large number of cases that have to be dealt with and the propensity of litigants in family law matters still to want to have the questions of custody, maintenance and distribution of property dealt with. </para>
        <para>The problem that has not been considered is the problem that can arise when a wife seeks a divorce and the husband, who has all of the property in his name, dies after the granting of a decree but before the distribution of property has been dealt with. The action of the wife to gain access to some of the property from his estate for her and the maintenance of the children would abate and the cause of action that the wife might have had otherwise would be lost. What is not readily realised is that under State law the wife has a method of obtaining redress. In New South Wales she has that right under the Testators Family Maintenance Act. That redress resides only with the children of the marriage or the wife. It does not reside with the divorcee. The divorce may have been dealt with promptly, but because of delays in dealing with ancillary matters tragic circumstances could occur. The matrimonial nome, for instance, could be lost to a wife and her children because there would be no way by which a court could give redress. </para>
        <para>I recommend very strongly to all legal practitioners and to all litigants who are at present exercising their rights under the Family Law Act that parties be not prepared to accept a decree of dissolution of their marriage until a court is also able to hear the ancillary questions of maintenance, custody and the distribution of property. Unless the wife makes the decision, she could very easily find herself in a most difficult situation. Of course this problem would be overcome if a large number of judges were appointed and if expensive courts were established, whether or not we were able to use them in the long term, and we simply speeded up the process. But as a practical matter, I do not believe the problem can be overcome in that way. </para>
        <para>Of course the problem has been exacerbated by our writing out of the family law system in Australia the courts of petty sessions which have so expeditiously dealt with so many matters that are now ranting before the family law courts. </para>
        <para class="block">That matter might be helped if we were able to amend the Family Law Act to give courts of petty sessions jurisdiction to handle these matters. Whilst the Attorney-General has today made additional appointments to the family law courts in Australia I do not believe this will overcome the problem I am speaking of. That problem is particularly marked in rural communities where courts are not frequently held and to which judges have not been going on circuit a sufficient number of times to enable delays to be dealt with. I am told that in some rural communitie the delays could be up to two years. When we appreciate that there could be a delay of up to two years between the granting of a decree for dissolution of a marriage and the dealing with ancillary matters, we see how much the odds are in favour of a number of cases arising where divorcees will lose rights they would otherwise have had to the matrimonial home and property to enable them to maintain themselves and the children of the marriage. </para>
        <para>I believe this question has to be looked at as a matter of urgency. I believe it has to be looked at in the context of the Family Law Act. Until it is dealt with, my recommendation that a wife who is seeking a divorce should not seek a final decree of dissolution of her marriage until the ancillary matters are dealt with, is, I believe, good advice in all the circumstances. </para>
        <para>Having regard to those comments, which are certainly critical of the Act but I do not believe critical of the present Government, I think I ought to acknowledge the very progressive approach that has been taken by this Government to law reform. In this debate I emphasise the constructive approach- the co-operative approach- of the Government in relation to legal aid. It has involved State governments in its effort to develop a total and integrated scheme which will not have first and second class legal aid of the sort we had available in the past. I commend the Attorney-General who introduced the human rights Commission Bill which is presently before the House for consideration and the freedom of information legislation which will shortly be before the House. That legislation is a consequence of lengthy studies undertaken by interdepartmental committees to arrive at a final document. There are also the reforms in relation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Ombudsman. A new federal court structure has been established. The Criminal Investigation Bill is presently before the Parliament and available for comment. Then there is the important evidence amendment Act which is also a law reform of considerable consequence. There are also important references to the Law Reform Commission, particularly those on customary law, human transplants and defamation law. This shows the very law reforming zeal of our two Attorneys-General during this Government&#39;s term in office. I believe congratulations are due to both of the gentlemen who have held that position during the two years we have had as a government. </para>

            <para>-This Bill refers to capital works in the Budget. The capital works program in the Budget is said in this Bill to amount to only $ 1,329m, but actually the capital works program in the Budget <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> an amount much greater than that. I refer the House to an answer to a question on 18 October by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> At page 2127 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the Treasurer said that the capital works program in this Budget amounted to $3,598m. Since the so-called deficit is only $2,2 17m, this means, in effect, that there is a surplus in the Budget, not a deficit. There is a surplus of $ 1 ,38 1 m. It is perfectly true that there still remains the necessity to finance a little over $3,500m worth of capital works. Because one has changed the accounting, one does not in any way change the necessity to find that finance. I am not arguing that for the moment. What I am arguing is that there is in this Budget not a deficit but a real surplus. That surplus should have made it possible, indeed should have made it desirable, for the Government to approach the financial problems in quite a different fashion. It seems to me that there would be no difficulty in raising this money without any increase in interest rates. The Treasurer has already raised over $2,000m of it overseas without any augmentation of Australian interest rates at all. He has already raised overseas almost the whole of what he describes as his deficit. He has said - </para>

              <para>- I am not outside the terms of the third reading motion at all. I am saying this: We are talking about the ways in which finance for capital works should be raised and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) does in point of fact deal with the raising of money for financing capital works. This is what it is all about. I am pointing out to the House that already the Treasurer has borrowed overseas enough virtually to cover the whole of what he calls his deficit but not enough as yet to cover the whole of the capital works proposed expenditure set out in the schedule which the Treasurer has told me in his answer on 18 October is $3,598m. The Treasurer also has said that he will find no difficulty in raising, if he wants to, further sums overseas. Let us look at our capital works in this form. I am wondering whether it would not be better to extend a little the schedule of our capital works in order to cut down the unemployment and particularly youth unemployment which is having such a corrosive effect in our community. I do not advocate any extravagant expansion. I do advocate a little prudent growth in this matter and I believe that this Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which deals with this matter does not to a proper extent take account of the economic circumstances of the country. </para>

          <para>I believe these things so strongly that I have been motivated after some 28 years as a member of Parliament to leave the Liberal Party. Although I think that Party is in so many ways the better party it is necessary for its economic policy to be changed. I am hoping that when I am elected to the Senate it will be a signal to the Government that the country does want a change of economic policy even though it does not want a change of government. I also am hoping that when I get into the Senate I will be able to see and monitor that this change goes through because it is necessary for the health of the Australian people and indeed for the continuance and maintenance of the anti-socialist and anticommunist cause that there should be a change of policy of this character. </para>
          <para>Let me just go to a much more fundamental point economically, if I may. What is happening m this country and in the developed countries overseas is that the personal savings which people make are going rancid because they are unused. It is therefore highly imprudent to tax people in order to finance capital works. This is the height of financial imprudence because virtually it guarantees the continuance of unemployment. What we should be doing is reducing taxes. We should be using some of our real surplus to reduce taxes and we should be financing at least the whole of our capital works by loan funds. People are making savings and because they are making them they withdraw consumer f ower. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser) very rightly are asking consumers to spend more but by taxing them to pay for capital works and reducing savings they are virtually guaranteeing over the long term, whatever may be the short term result, the failure of their own financial policy. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative framework within which the Government will implement its decision to provide assistance to the States for water resources projects under its national water resources program was outlined in my statement in the House on 17 August. Projects or activities for which the Commonwealth will be enabled to provide assistance have been defined as broadly as possible in clause 3 of the Bill. They encompass all aspects of water resources management for which Commonwealth assistance would be appropriateconservation works, water quality management, desalinisation of agricultural land, flood mitigation and flood plain management, and studies or investigations relating to all aspects of the assessment and utilisation of water resources and flood management. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for the Minister to make agreements with the States on the terms and conditions of financial assistance for water projects and for copies of these agreements to be tabled in the House within 15 days after the agreement has been made. It also provides for future appropriations of funds by Parliament to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s commitments under these agreements. Clause 7 of the Bill provides an appropriation out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of $lm. This will be used to provide assistance to New South Wales to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s commitment for urgent flood mitigation works on the coastal rivers during 1977-78. I should point out that since 1964-65 the Commonwealth has provided $ 17m in grant funds to New South Wales to implement the coastal rivers flood mitigation program on a 2:2: 1 funding basis- Commonwealth, State and local government authorities respectively. The Commonwealth has always accepted a contingent commitment in respect of flood disasters, and this particular program has without any doubt considerably reduced the destructive effects of these recurring natural hazards. It also has contributed significantly to the security of life in flood prone areas. </para>
          <para>This Bill marks a significant departure in respect of enabling legislation for Commonwealth assistance to the States for water projects. It is our view that a continuing legislative vehicle of this nature is more appropriate to the requirements of a long-term program than single purpose Acts as has been past practice. The proposed Act will reduce the legislative load in the House without in any way restricting the flow of information or opportunities for debate regarding Commonwealth commitments to the States for the assessment, planning, development and management of the nation&#39;s water resources. I was very heartened to hear in the course of a recent debate in the House of widespread concern regarding the Commonwealth&#39;s role in the development of our water resources. I would sum up the essence of the debate as being bipartisan support for a more active Commonwealth role. The Bill before the House is the first requirement towards this objective and the continuing nature of the proposed Act lends itself eminently to sustained initiatives by the Commonwealth to ensure the most effective utilisation of Australia&#39;s water resources. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is twofold. In the first place, an amendment is proposed to section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to repeal sub-section (4). The second purpose is to put beyond question the validity of the existing redistribution procedures insofar as they affect the current redistribution of the State of Western Australia. Honourable members may recall that section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides for a redistribution when the Chief Australian Electoral Officer&#39;s determination has resulted in an alteration in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for a State. It also authorises a redistribution whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of a State the number of electors differs from the quota by one-tenth more or by one-tenth less; and at such other times as the Governor-General thinks fit. </para>
          <para>Sub-section (4) provides that after a redistribution has been put into effect in a State a period of seven years must elapse before a further redistribution can be made by virtue of the one-fourth and one-tenth circumstance to which I have just referred. The current redistribution in relation to Western Australia has proceeded on the basis that section 25 (4) would not prevent a redistribution within the sevenyear period if there were other reasons for doing so such as that redistributions were in hand in all other States. A legal challenge has now been made to the validity of the current redistribution of Western Australia. Broadly, it appears to be claimed that in the factual situation as it applied in Western Australia, where one-fourth of the divisions differed from the quota by one-tenth or more, it was not possible for the GovernorGeneral to direct a redistribution in 1977 because, as there had been a redistribution in Western Australia in 1974, the seven-year barrier must apply. </para>
          <para>It was made perfectly clear during the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill in February this year that the intention was that the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Executive Government, would reserve the option of proclaiming a redistribution at any time he thought fit despite the seven-year provision. Nevertheless it does appear that there may be some doubt as to whether the legislation as currently drafted reflects this intention. Our advice is that the most appropriate way to overcome any problem which may exist is to repeal the seven-year provision contained in subsection (4). This would place the issue beyond doubt for the future. At the same time action also needs to be taken to ensure the validity of the current redistribution process in Western Australia in respect of which the report of the Distribution Commissioners has already been tabled. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">Last July, the Government took a major initiative in the international trade sphere with the appointment of a Minister for Special Trade Negotiations to be responsible for high level trade negotiations with the European Economic Community. The new arrangements envisaged that the Minister would lead a small negotiating team, consisting primarily of officers seconded from other departments. However, the requirements of section 64 of the Constitution and of the Public Service Act are such that it was necessary to formally create a Department of the Special Trade Negotiator and a position of Secretary to that Department. In recognition of the special relationship between the new Department and the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary of the latter Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> H. McKay, O.B.E., has been also acting as Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. </para>
          <para>After the selection procedures in section- 54A of the Public Service Act had been followed, it was determined that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McKay-</inline> who is an &#39;established candidate&#39; in relation to the vacancy, within the meaning of section 54 of the Public Service Act-should be permanently appointed to the new office in addition to continuing to hold office as Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade. It is considered desirable that there should be express legislative backing for this course of action, m order that the legal position is beyond doubt. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the person for the time being holding the office of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade may also hold or act in the office of Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator, and for a person acting in the office of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade to also act in the office of the Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. Provision is also made that, while a person is holding or acting in both offices, no remuneration will be payable m respect of the second office, and that if a person who holds both offices ceases to hold the first office, that person also ceases to hold the second office.

          <para class="block">The Bill now before the House continues and extends arrangements for the provision of assistance to the States for land transport planning and research. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has included a sum of $8m in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) for transport planning and research assistance in 1977-78. The Bill now before the House provides standing legislation specifying the conditions and arrangements covering the use of these funds and funds to be appropriated in subsequent years. </para>
          <para>At the Australian Transport Advisory Council the future arrangements concerning the planning and research program have been discussed with my State colleagues. There has been unanimous support for the continuation of the program and the structure of the arrangements proposed has been influenced by the views of the States. Some general introductory comments are appropriate. The Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969 provided assistance for road research. The transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974 extended assistance to urban public transport as well as roads. The present Bill further extends assistance to cover planning and research into all forms of land transport as well as into areas involved in the relationship of land transport and other modes. </para>
          <para>The transport planning and research program has achieved its objectives through effective Commonwealth-State co-operation. It has promoted an integrated approach to planning and research, to the sharing of results and to avoidance of duplication. Commonwealth assistance to more than 500 projects has totalled over $23m since 1974. Examples include large studies such as the south west area study in Western Australia, the north east area transport study in South Australia, the Koonung Creek corridor study in Victoria and the Newcastle, GosfordWyong and Wollongong urban studies. There are also many smaller projects such as area control of traffic in Hobart and crew rostering by computer in Queensland which are directed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing facilities and infrastructure. With regard to the Bill itself, I should say that several changes from previous legislation have been introduced to simplify administrative arrangements while preserving the essential features of a CommonwealthState co-operative program which has developed successfully to this time. A change from former arrangements is that State programs will now be approved rather than individual projects. This is to allow States greater flexibility in implementing and managing their planning and research programs and at the same time further encourage the development of balanced programs. </para>
          <para>I turn now to financial aspects. In 1977-78 the Government has proposed an appropriation of $8m for transport planning and research and the Schedule to the Bill indicates the assistance to be given for each State. The 1977-78 grants will be provided on a matching basis of two Commonwealth dollars to one State dollar in line with previous legislation. However, after 1977-78 the Government proposes to contribute to the program on a dollar for dollar basis. We recognise that continuity of funding is very important in a rogram like this and we have already told the tates that for 1978-79 and 1979-80 we are prepared to contribute our share on a dollar for dollar basis of a total program maintained at the 1977-78 level in real terms. </para>
          <para>The explanatory notes I have circulated describe the main features of the Bill and I do not propose to deal with individual clauses in detail. The important points covered by the Bill include definitions, arrangements for approval, details of grant entitlement in 1977-78 and in later years, provision to cover planning and research projects carried out for the States by research organisations and details of financial administration and provisions for delegation. Honourable members will recall that on 24 August 1976 and 3 May 1977 1 tabled reports of progress on projects under the Transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974. The Bill now before the House provides for continued communication of results through annual progress reports and final project reports. The transport planning and research program to date has provided a good example of Commonwealth-State co-operation. This Bill will enable this co-operation to continue and ensure effective use of resources. It will encourage planning and research relating to land transport, will allow for emphasis on new initiaties and for the avoidance of unnecessary duplication. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to seek authority for the Treasurer to guarantee on behalf of the Australian Government, loans raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd to finance the purchase of one Boeing 727-200 series aircraft. This will be the eighth aircraft of its type in the Ansett fleet. The company also operates four Boeing 727-100s and twelve DC9s. The Australian National Airlines Commission, Trans-Australia Airlines, which operates the same number of aircraft of each type as Ansett, has informed me that it intends to finance its eighth Boeing 727-200 from its own internal resources. The need by both Ansett and the Commission to seek additional aircraft to incorporate into their fleets, is to meet the strong growth in traffic that has been evident throughout most of this year. The industry is optimistic that these trends will continue through 1978. </para>
          <para>During 1976 both carriers experienced relatively depressed market conditions with a situation of no growth in some areas and only marginal gains in traffic being made in other areas. By comparison to 1975, when very high rates of growth were achieved, 1976 was indeed a most difficult time for both airlines. However, statistics indicate that for the first three quarters of 1977, the number of passengers carried was 4 per cent higher than for the comparable period in 1976. Average load factors, or the number of seats occupied compared to those available, have also improved. Aircraft utilisation, or the number of hours flown by each aircraft in the fleet, has also increased. Ansett and TAA have achieved levels of utilisation which are amongst the highest in the world. This facet must be considered as one of the more beneficial features of Australia&#39;s two-airline policy. The achievement of such levels of utilisation ensures that the aircraft are flown to their fullest capacity, of course within the strict margins dictated by safety. This in turn assists to keep fares down by avoiding the cost of surplus capacity within the fleet. </para>
          <para>Earlier this year both airlines introduced two new routes on to their network. For the first time there is now a weekly direct jet service between Canberra and Adelaide. Similarly, there is a weekly service offered between Sydney and Alice </para>
          <para class="block">Springs. On this route, the service is provided by each of the airlines on alternate weeks. These developments, I believe, reflect the airlines initiative and their willingness to explore new markets and break new ground. Apart from these factors which are contributing to a tightening of available capacity within the fleets, there is another matter which also should be mentioned. For some years now both operators have been going through a process of upgrading their fleets. As I mentioned earlier, in addition to the Boeing 727-200s and the DC9s that each airline operate they also have four Boeing 727- 100s. This particular aircraft was first introduced onto the domestic network in 1964 and in fact was the first jet aircraft type to operate regular services in Australia. </para>
          <para>During 1976, both airlines sold two of the Boeing 727- 100s overseas and I understand that they intend to continue the retirement program over the next few years for the remaining umts of this aircraft type in their fleet. The decision to retire these aircraft is based not only on age, but also on the fact that this aircraft is somewhat smaller and relatively noisier than the Boeing 727-200s. On the general question of fleet expansion, the domestic operators have been watching with interest the experience of overseas operators with the new generation of a wide-bodied aircraft. Of course, it would be some years yet before their introduction could be expected on the domestic network. Network expansion and fleet re-equipment are matters most pertinent to Australia&#39;s two-airline policy. Indeed, I think it can be said that most forms of air transport in this country are to some extent influenced by this policy. </para>
          <para>Whilst the policy has both its supporters and protagonists, I do not believe it can be denied that it has nurtured Australian aviation through its relative infancy of the early 1950s, to its present position. In fact, it has enabled Australia to develop a first class internal aviation transport system which has been the envy of many nations. Nevertheless, even though the two-airline system has served Australia well, we should from time to time review and test that policy to ensure it still meets the community&#39;s needs to the fullest. Accordingly, I announced m July of this year that a review of domestic air transport policy is being conducted and being directed by a steering committee of senior officers from my Department. The terms of reference are expansive and will include such topics as: The role of the Commonwealth and the States in the licensing of air services; the possibility of improving the Commonwealth air service licensing arrangements; the possibility of up-dating the two-airline policy arrangements; seeking to clarify the role of the smaller airlines and commuters; and the dual scheduling arrangements engaged in by the two major operators on trunk routes. </para>
          <para>All interested parties from both private and government sectors together with the aviation industry and major users have been invited to forward submissions to the study group. These views, where appropriate, will of course be taken into consideration in preparing future policy. Similarly in the field of international aviation I have also directed my Department to undertake a major review of air pohcy. Like the domestic review it will be a comprehensive study of all factors affecting international air travel. </para>
          <para>At the present time, there is considerable interest in the possibility of lower international air fares to and from Australia. While such fares would benefit certain sectors of the public and the tourist industry, the effect on the level and frequency of schedule services must also be taken into account. It is essential that the Government&#39;s regulatory policies do not prevent such benefits being available to Australia. At the same time, however, the Government must ensure that our air links with other countries are not placed in jeopardy by those who may only wish to &#39;cream the trade &#39;. </para>
          <para>Further, this study of the international situation will assist the Government in making a proper contribution to the work of the International Civil Aviation Organisation which will be preparing studies over the next three years to help the world aeronautical community to find solutions to the problems affecting the industry. I am sure that the outcome of both of these studies will offer sound and positive guidelines for the continued development of both Australia&#39;s domestic and international air transport system. </para>
          <para>While on the general issue of developing future guidelines for air transport, it seems appropriate that I mention the present study m progress on the planning of future aviation facilities in the Sydney area, namely the MANS Study. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is not only the centre of Australia&#39;s domestic air transport network, but it is also the major international airport in Australia. In the last seven years the number of persons moving through Sydney Airport has increased by 16 per cent, from 4,214,322 to the year ended June 1970, to an estimated 4,869,000 for the year to June 1977. It is expected in future years that the number of passengers handled at Sydney Airport will continue to increase at a substantial rate. </para>
          <para>In a joint statement, in October 1976, the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier announced the establishment of a committee of senior Commonwealth and State officials to recommend a suitable strategy to cater for the future aviation demand in the Sydney area. My Department, and I understand other departments, including those within the New South Wales Government, are making a considerable manpower commitment to the study to ensure that the optimal solution in every sense, is achieved. In the long term the outcome of studies such as this, involves the sinking of capital into aviation facilities and infrastructure. Of course this raises the thorny issue of who should pay. One would be foolish to deny the contribution that aviation makes to our economy; yet this can also be said of other forms of transport. We would all like to see air fares kept as low as possible; however it must be borne in mind that this can only be achieved at considerable cost to the taxpayer. </para>
          <para>As I have said in the past, it is the Government&#39;s objective to ensure that Australia&#39;s overall transport system is the most efficient possible. The general issue of cost recovery in the aviation field is certainly not new. In fact, in the Airlines Agreement Act of 1961 it was stated that the Commonwealth would implement a policy of full recovery of the cost of facilities properly attributable to civil air transport. Of course, the policy received notoriety under the previous Government when it announced its intention to increase the level of recovery for the costs of civil aviation to 80 per cent across the board by 1978-79. 1 believe the Government has taken a responsible decision by deferring the very harsh line of the previous Government until the industry has been properly consulted on the levels of costs, revenues and services. These discussions are continuing and proving to be a most fruitful exercise. </para>
          <para>Deferral has also been made to facilitate proper studies and comparisons of cost recovery programs of other transport modes to be made. These studies are being carried out by the Bureau of Transport Economics and are now well advanced. Estimates by my Department for the year ended June 1977 show a total outlay of $2 12m on civil aviation in this country including both capital works and overheads. Revenue estimates for the same period show a return of approximately $124m. Of this $124m, half is contributed by air navigation charges, 20 per cent by aviation fuel tax, the balance being made up by airport rentals and concessions. This gives an overall recovery position of 59 per cent. When it is considered that, for the year ended June 1969, the percentage of revenues covering costs was only 44 per cent, this is a considerable achievement. </para>
          <para>Considering the same estimates to the year ended June 1977, a clearer picture emerges when the overall recovery position is looked at on a sector basis. For international operations full recovery of costs is being achieved. For domestic trunk operations, namely those routes over which Ansett and TAA operate, the recovery position is approximately 76 per cent. For the remaining sectors, rural airlines and general aviation, the recovery situation is somewhat less. Although this situation is recognised, the ability of the industry to pay has to be considered. There are also the needs of persons in remote areas of Australia who rely almost entirely upon air transport to meet their everyday needs. </para>
          <para>I would now like to mention a number of announcements the Government has recently made on this general theme, in respect of subsidies for air services in remote areas of Australia. Honourable members will know that it has been the Government&#39;s position that the people in outlying areas of Australia should enjoy the best possible air services while at the same time keeping the cost to the taxpayer, of subsidies, to a reasonable level. </para>
          <para>To this end, the Government last year established an inter-departmental committee to assess the demand for air services in the area served by the Northern Territory airline, Connair Pty Ltd, and to recommend to me how that demand might best be satisfied. The Committee comprised representatives of the Department&#39;s of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal Affairs, Finance and my own Department of Transport. The Committee placed considerable importance on conducting its inquiries on the spot and sought to obtain the widest possible range of comment and opinion from all sections of the community. </para>
          <para>The decisions recently taken by the Government were not solely based on the recommendations of the Committee. I myself had a number of ?uite frank discussions with the  Chairman  of lonnair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> J. Connellan. The proposals which are now to be implemented were to some extent developed during the course of these discussions. These recent decisions by the Government provide for the continued operation of Connair Pty Ltd as a viable enterprise. The airline will continue to meet the air transport needs of the people in the area who depend so much upon it. </para>
          <para>The Committee also made a number of recommendations in respect of certain new initiatives, which the Government has implemented or will implement shortly. These too will assist in catering for the air transport needs of the people in the area, in the most efficient manner possible. In considering the general question of subsidies to operators serving remote areas, the Government did have the benefit of similar studies concerning northern Western Australia and northern Queensland. These studies were undertaken by the State Government authorities in conjunction with my own Department. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will appreciate from this brief resume of the aviation industry that the responsible attitude taken by the present Government has been an influencing factor upon the re-establishment of a stable climate within which confidence is being restored, and which is enabling industry growth. The reviews which are at present underway will enable the Government to continue to be well advised and to respond to the needs of the people of Australia in the rational development of air services which are so vital to our general well being. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill will provide legislative authority for two double taxation agreements entered into with other countries. One is with Greece and applies only to profits derived from international air transport. The other is with Belgium and deals with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and Belgium. Neither of the agreements can enter into force until all necessary legislative processes have been completed by both Australia and the other country. </para>
          <para>The limited agreement with Greece is of a now familiar kind and provides that each country is to exempt from its tax profits derived from international air transport by the other country&#39;s international airline. In effect, each country will have the sole right to tax profits from international traffic derived by its international airline in the other country. </para>
          <para>The agreement with Belgium was signed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> earlier in the month and is along the lines of Australia&#39;s modern agreements, that is, those seven agreements negotiated or renegotiated since 1967. That being so, I think that I need not detain the House with an exposition of the purposes that are served by comprehensive double taxation agreements. Suffice it to say that the agreements provide in ordered ways for the two contracting countries to share in the revenue that is generated from income flowing between them. Under the agreement with Belgium, Australia is to reduce its withholding tax on dividends flowing to Belgian residents from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the dividends. Conversely, Belgium is to reduce its rate of withholding tax on dividends- currently 20 per cent- to 1 5 per cent. </para>
          <para>I mention that profits out of which dividends are distributed by Australian companies to foreign shareholders now bear a company tax rate of 46 per cent so that, with withholding tax at the rate of 1 5 per cent, that total Australian tax on each $ 100 of distributed profits is a not insubstantial $54.10. The agreement specifies a limit of 10 per cent on each country&#39;s tax on interest and royalties flowing to the other. For Australia this will mean no reduction in our interest withholding tax of 10 per cent. For royalties flowing to Belgium, the Australian tax limit of 10 per cent of gross payments may operate to reduce the ordinary tax at general rates of net royalties. Belgium will reduce its withholding tax rate on interest and royalties from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. </para>
          <para>The agreement contains measures for the formal relief by the country of residence of double taxation of income that would otherwise be taxed by both countries. These measures supplement the relief that is available under the ordinary domestic law of each country. Generally, income which is taxed in full in the country of source will be exempt from tax by the country of residence while, in the case of income that is taxed at reduced rates in the country of sourcedividends, interest and royalties- the country of residence will tax the income and allow credit for the tax of the country of source. </para>
          <para>Apart from the provisions I have mentioned, the agreement with Belgium contains the usual provisions- common to double taxation agreements- relating to the taxation of business profits, visiting businessmen and employees, public entertainers, students and pensioners and so on. These and other aspects of the arrangements with Belgium are explained in an explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill is to provide certain complementary legislative provisions to overcome technical problems encountered in the legislation for statutory authorities established by Territory ordinances. During the drafting of the Darwin Community College Ordinance 1973, it became apparent that provisions for the payment of budget appropriations, which are normally included in Acts constituting Commonwealth authorities, were beyond the power of a Territory ordinance. The Territory Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act 1973 was therefore enacted as complementary legislation to make </para>
          <para class="block">E revision to overcome this deficiency for the col:ge and for any other Territory authority established by ordinance in the future. </para>
          <para>Since then it has become apparent that certain other provisions concerning loans and taxation normally included in Commonwealth authorities&#39; Acts are also beyond the powers of an ordinance. Accordingly, this Bill will re-enact the 1973 Act with additional provisions to allow the Treasurer to determine the terms and conditions of Commonwealth loans to prescribed Territory authorities, and to enable him to give Commonwealth guarantees on other borrowings by prescribed authorities. </para>
          <para>Clause 8 of the Bill provides that certain noncommercial Territory authorities sepcified in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Act are exempt from Commonwealth and State taxation, unless regulations under the Act make a particular authority subject to a specified tax. Clause 9 provides that certain commercial Territory authorities specified in Part II of the Schedule are subject to taxation under the laws of the Commonwealth, but not subject to taxation under any law of a State unless the regulations make a particular authority liable to a specified state tax. The taxation provisions are in terms similar to those included in Acts constituting Commonwealth authorities passed by this Parliament. Because of the importance of taxation, provision has been made for the schedule of authorities to which the taxation provisions apply to be amended only by subsequent amendment of the Act. </para>
          <para>Specific provision is also made in the Bill for the Canberra Commercial Development Authority to be liable for income tax and sales tax, in order to comply with the intention when the Authority was established in 1974 that it should be liable to all taxes and charges normally applicable to private commercial enterprises. The Authority is to be made subject to income tax retrospectively from the date of its establishment so that it may benefit by offsetting any trading losses incurred in its early years against future taxable income, in the same way as a private developer. Because of administrative difficulties that would be involved in attempting to impose sales tax on past transactions, the authority will be subject to sales tax from the date of commencement of this Act. </para>
          <para>In view of the Government&#39;s decision last July concerning the advance toward self-government for the Northern Territory, there will be full consultation with the Northern Territory Executive before any Northern Territory authority is prescribed under this Act.

              <para>- Yes. The point is, without my trying to help my ministerial opponent, we will not oppose the other motions. Whilst we accept the proposed redistributions in respect of the other states, we believe that there are minor objections to them. I deal firstly with the proposed redistribution for Western Australia. What I want to say about that matter is this: I think it is a clear illustration of people being denied their rights to object to electoral redistributions, in the light of what happened today. The Government rushed into this House a Bill validating a proclamation relating to a subdivision in Western Australia because a citizen in Kalgoorlie wanted to exercise his rights. He did so by instituting proceedings in the High Court. The legislation rushed into this House this afternoon will deny him the right to pursue that matter. This shows the incompetence and bungling of this Government. The distribution in Western Australia is obviously illegal. It should never have been allowed. When a citizen of Kalgoorlie, who has the right to protest, commences an action in the High Court, the Government uses the whole process of the law to rush into the Parliament today a Bill saying the distribution before the House will be validated. It is an insult to the House. It has certainly denied the rights of a person in Kalgoorlie. Why was he not allowed to pursue the matter and perhaps show that the law was invalid and incompetent and did not give him his rights because he had another ground. </para>

          <para>The number of people who will come within the Kalgoorlie electorate has been increased. The electorate has been enlarged. It is about the largest electorate in the world now, and it has been increased in size again. Aboriginal people in the Kalgoorlie electorate do not always enrol. That does not alter the fact that they exist there and that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has a responsibility towards them. No consideration has been given to that fact. If they were to enrol, as they may, before the writs are issued for the forthcoming election, the Kalgoorlie electorate would be out of all proportion to what would be deemed fair and reasonable. The Distribution Commissioners have analysed this situation in a manner to suit the political concepts of the present Government. The permissible maximum number of people in a Western Australian electorate is 67,387. Everybody knows that the population of the Kalgoorlie electorate entitled to vote together with the Aboriginals there would be in excess of that number. </para>
          <para>A private citizen challenged the report of the Western Australian Distribution Commissioners because it was made in accordance with a proclamation which he says is invalid. He is to be denied his right to sustain that challenge. He is entitled to sustain the challenge. He argues that if the existing divisions are adhered to, the Kalgoorlie division would be smaller and that the position would not be as it will be as a result of the validating legislation introduced today. One wonders how in the name of fortune the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> was able to convince  His Excellency  the Governor-General that he should grant a dissolution of Parliament when the proposed new electoral divisions of the nation have not been approved by the Parliament. One is the subject of a challenge in the High Court. What happens if it transpires that we do not approve the report in respect of the divisions applying to Western Australia? As it is perfectly entitled to do, this House could disap- </para>
          <para class="block">Erove of the report, but a dissolution of the Parament has been granted already because the Prime Minister asked for it. Are we to run a democracy in this nation on the basis that whatever the Prime Minister wants is granted whenever he wants it irrespective of the matters before the Parliament? Why are the rights of a citizen in Kalgoorlie being denied and interrupted by urgent legislation from an incompetent Government? It is for these reasons that the Opposition proposes to oppose the report of the Commissioners in respect of the Western Australian divisions. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with another matter which is just as serious and important- the proposed redistribution in New South Wales. As a result of objections when the first maps were published, the divisions have been substantially altered to suit the political advantages of the Liberal Party. No other point of view could be expressed. I make this point very clearly indeed. The report on New South Wales deals with the suggestions and objections lodged following the publication of the first maps. Pages 220 and 22 1 set out a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carlton,</inline> the General Secretary of the Liberal Party, clearly stating out what he thinks should happen. Speaking about Lowe, he said: &#39;We do not want the division that has been foreshadowed. It is not in accordance with what we think is reasonable&#39;. He forgot to add: &#39;It is not in accordance with what we think is politically advantageous&#39;. He said: &#39;We object to it and we want the Commissioners to do something about it&#39;. The Commissioners have done something about it. We have the incredible situation that what has now been put forward as an appropriate division for Lowe is virtually the same as what was put forward by the Liberal Party when it first made its submissions. What transpired that convinced the Commissioners that they should agree all of a sudden with the Liberal Party&#39;s submission that was made before the issue of the first maps? The Commissioners took three or four months to examine those submissions. They made a valid determination. The only thing standing against their determination was an objection from the Liberal Party in the seat of Lowe. We now get the result, without anybody else being consulted, that Lowe is virtually the same as what the Liberal Party first submitted. I very much doubt whether anyone can say that the Commissioners were not subject to influence as to what should be the decision in that area. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some other factors. Objections were lodged by the right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William McMahon).</inline> Fine. He was entitled to object. Following the publication of the maps, he made the point that he would object. Press reports state that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carlton</inline> described the propositions as foreshadowed unacceptable to the Liberal Party and outrageous. There was another interesting action by the Liberal Party. Before the objections had been considered and the decision of the Commissioners announced the Liberal Party called for nominations for preselection but did not call for nominations for the seat of Lowe. That was on 1 1 October. On 1 8 October, still before the distribution results were announced, the Liberal Party said that it was calling for nominations for the seat of Lowe. What transpired in the mind of the Liberal Party between 1 1 October and 18 October to convince it that it could then go ahead and call for nominations for the seat of Lowe? Did it know that the proposed distribution was to be the same as that they had asked for in the first place? It looks very much like it. </para>
          <para>If one looks at other matters I have mentioned one can see again a partisanship towards the Liberal Party submissions. One sees it in the division of Macarthur, where the question of the Mulgoa sub-division was raised. Lo and behold, because an objection was raised that objection was sustained and the sub-division of Mulgoa is to go into the division of Lawson, which of course will suit the honourable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gillard).</inline> This is the problem. Talk about the Commissioners making an impartial decision. Why is it that when the Liberal Party first submitted that Mulgoa should be in the division of Lawson the submission was not agreed to. It was only after the first maps were published, objections were invited and objections were received from the Liberal Party that the objection was acceded to. If we look at the preliminary position of map 5, that is the Liberal Party&#39;s own proposals we find that after objections have been dealt with the Commissioners are in agreement with the Liberal Party&#39;s original proposals. It smells to high heaven of political corruption. There is nothing worse. </para>

          <para>I come to my own division of Kingsford-Smith and the sub-divisions of Kensington. Under section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the matters to be taken into consideration by the Distribution Commissioners include community of interest, including economics, social and regional interests. What happened in the case of Kingsford-Smith? Firstly, the Liberal Party submitted that the subdivision of Kensington should be incorporated in the division of Wentworth. That submission was not sustained. As a matter of interest, the subdivision of Kensington was put into the division of Phillip, another Liberal seat. The honourable member for Phillip <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Birney)</inline> objected saying: &#39;I do not want the subdivision of Kensington. It should be given to somebody else&#39;. He was partially successful. Half the subdivision has been taken out of the proposed electorate of Phillip and given to the electorate of Wentworth. I now represent these people. Can any Government supporter imagine saying: &#39;Well, on one side of the street you are going to be in an electorate which is 5 miles away. There is no transport, there are no schools and there is no community of interest&#39;? </para>

              <para>-Hansard might record the laughter but let them record the facts. If these people want to find their local member they have to cross that distance I have mentioned. But the people on the other side of the road are in a different electorate. The facts are that the people on the northern part of the subdivision vote Labor. That is the position. There was no submission that the subdivision should be split in half. I do not know too many cases where a subdivision has been split in half to suit the convenience of the Liberal Party. Here we find Kensington divided in half: The part that votes Labor is given to Wentworth, miles away, while the people on the southern side who vote Liberal form part of a continuous zone of the Phillip electorate. Does this not smell to high heaven? Yet Government supporters laugh. They laugh at corruption. The people in that area go to the same churches, the same shopping centres and use the same transport and their children go to the same schools, but those people have different Federal members. So where do we get this consideration of section 19- the consideration of economic, social and regional interest? It is a blatant hypocrisy for anyone to say that this is a fair proposition. It has been carried out to sustain the seat of Phillip for the Liberals but we will win despite the unfairness. </para>

          <para>The local member, who happens to be myself, was not consulted at any stage. I agreed that the subdivision in toto should be removed, but to remove half of it on the basis that it is known which way the people will vote is a blatant discrimination against the people in that electorate. You would have to fire a 25-pounder gun from that area to try to find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> He has never seen the area. Now he is going to be the local member. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Birney</inline> is going to represent the other side of the road. It is just so ridiculous to think that the Government can say to the people in the Kensington subdivision, that from now on their affiliation is going to be with Vaucluse and Point Piper. That is where they have been put purely on the basis that they happen to vote </para>
          <para class="block">Labor. The electorate of Wentworth is so Liberal dominated it can absorb some of the saturation of Labor voters. Where is the continuity of interest? Where is the affiliation of socioeconomic zones. Where is the affiliation in the normal community of interest, from the point of view of schools, shopping centres and the like? What provision will be made for them to be adequately represented? They are in a different municipality, a different area, altogether. </para>

Really I do shed a tear for him. It is a pity he would not shed a few tears for those people in country areas whose electorates have been made so very much bigger. The honourable member would not care one iota for them. It was the Australian Labor Party which decided to make electorates bigger by hundreds of thousands of square miles, to make them even more enormous. For example, the electorate of Riverina, which was a compact electorate and which had a community of interest, under the terms and conditions of the redistribution now takes in the borders of four States- Victoria, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Goodness me, what an enormous electorate to have to represent! Yet we hear about people having to travel 5 miles to get to a shopping centre. I suppose they cannot even get a bus. Or is no helicopter service available? It is about time they started to realise how a few other people in Australia have to get on and how honourable members from country areas have to try to get around. They are lucky if they can get to all centres in one year. Yet honourable members from city areas are complaining about a distance of 5 miles. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith appears to be going off his rocker. Honourable members from city areas will have to represent 4 square miles instead of 3 square miles. They might even have to get on their bicycles instead of walking. Goodness me! When we hear all these complaints about manipulations and gerrymanders let us remember the redistribution that the Labor Government brought down in this House. In New South Wales the five seats with the largest numbers of voters happen to be enormous country electorates. The Labor Government lowered the numbers for the city electorates which are only pocket handkerchief size in any case. What could have been more of a gerrymander than that? Thank goodness the Senate was prepared to throw out the redistribution proposal and not accept it. While I cannot say that this redistribution fills me with much satisfaction it is a darn sight better than that brought down by the Labor Government. </para>

          <para>The National Country Party will not try to prevent these proposals being adopted. However, we take that attitude only with the greatest reluctance and with serious misgivings. To say we support the proposals would be to put the matter in the wrong perspective. We believe that they are grossly unfair to country people. They are based on a principle which is wrong, one which does not even apply. I have no doubt that within the Parliament, particularly on this side, there is a degree of understanding of, sympathy with and support for the point of view put forward by the National Country Party- that there needs to be a degree of tolerance to try to compensate for all the disabilities of the large country electorates. We say that all Australians wherever they live, should have the opportunity of at least some equality of representation. </para>
          <para>All parties, Labor, Liberal and our own Party, until recently supported provisions which would have allowed the electoral laws which have applied since Federation to be maintained. They provided for a tolerance of 20 per cent above and below the quota for electoral enrolments. Today it seems that only the National Country Party supports that provision. So far as we have been able we have endeavoured to have the 20 per cent provision restored. We believe that it should be restored. We will continue to try to have it restored. It is fair and reasonable and it has applied for a long time. The proposals which applied were based on rules which allowed a degree of equity. However, they have now been circumscribed so that the discretion of the Distribution Commissioners is exercised in a way which does not apply to any other democratic country in the world. I shall illustrate this point in a moment. I think that the claim we have heard so often, that Australia is now blessed with a system of one vote one value or close to it, should be exposed for its hypocrisy and nonsense. </para>
          <para>Under the electoral laws as they now stand, and as they were drawn up by the Whitlam Government, Australia&#39;s smallest electorate can contain 45,048 voters and the largest electorate can contain 8 1 ,457 voters- a difference of 36,400 voters. That was brought down under Labor&#39;s rules. What hypocrisy, what humbug for these self-styled champions of democracy to claim that they have prevented the destruction of democracy in Australia, that they enshrined the socalled sacred principle of one vote one value in our laws. Labor&#39;s rules, which have not been changed, allow for one electorate to contain 80 per cent more voters than another. What is the maximum tolerance in enrolments? Is it really 10 per cent? The average enrolment in Australia&#39;s 124 electorates is 68,906 voters, yet we have an electorate with only 45,000 voters and another which can have as many as 8 1 ,000 voters. That is a departure from the average not of 10 per cent but of 35 per cent below the average in one case and of 1 8 per cent above it in the other. </para>
          <para>These figures are based on the enrolments in the Northern Territory compared with the permissible enrolments in electorates in South Australia. Even if we regard the Northern Territory as a special case and base the comparison on electorates in Tasmania and South Australia we still find that, under Labor&#39;s rules, there can be as few as 47,162 voters in a Tasmanian electorate and as many as 81,457 in a South Australian electorate. That is a difference of 34,000 voters. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member says that it is in the Constitution, but if the principle is so great, why do honourable members opposite not work towards constitutional change? They will not do that. Of course, the principle is not great enough! It is quite all right for little, compact electorates in Tasmania to have smaller numbers but big electorates elsewhere have to have the normal numbers. We know how phoney the Opposition&#39;s proposals are. They are nothing more than a political device to try to concentrate political power and votes in the city areas, at the expense of country people. </para>

          <para>I said that there could be a difference of 34,000 in the number of voters in electorates. This means that there can be 73 per cent more voters in one electorate than in another electorate under </para>
          <para class="block">Labor&#39;s rules. So much for Labor&#39;s principle of one vote one value. It means there can be a departure from the average of 32 per cent below and 18 per cent above. Yet Labor Party has hoodwinked many people into believing that it gave Australia one vote one value. What a fraud! What we have in Australia is a system which allows a far greater tolerance in electoral enrolments than the great majority of people believe is provided under the law. So why all this humbug about one vote one value? The trouble is that the tolerance is not applied when common sense and fairness require that it should be applied. The system requires that the tolerances I have described apply in a back-to-front manner. The result is that the relatively small electorates in Tasmania can have very small enrolments and that the large mainland electorates must have higher enrolments. It should be the other way around if honourable members believe in that principle so strongly. </para>
          <para>I said earlier that the Commissioner&#39;s discretion is circumscribed to a greater extent than occurs in any other country which can claim to have a democratic tradition such as ours. Let me mention two examples. In Britain in 1974 the larest enrolment was 118,000 voters in Antrim outh and the smallest was 23,000 voters in Western Isles- a difference of 95,000 voters. In Canada in 1974 the largest enrolment was 125,000 voters in Yorke-Scarborough and the smallest was 12,300 voters in Yukon- a difference of 1 12,000 voters. The British example is especially significant. Britain regards her electoral laws as being based on one vote one value but applies that principle, even in such a small, compact country, in ways that take greater account of factors such as remoteness, communication difficulties and distances, than we do in this vast continent of ours. Britain, in other words, does not adopt the rigid, unthinking, mathematical approach that we do, but tries to see that voters in every part of the country have some opportunity for equality of representation. I think it is about time we did the same. The National Country Party is in complete agreement with the Leader of the Opposition on this point- or at least with the views he expressed a few years ago when he was in a more rational frame of mind. </para>
          <para>Speaking in this House on an occasion which should be recorded in the history books, he said the 20 per cent tolerance above or below the quota was &#39;perfectly reasonable&#39;. Let me repeat that: the Leader of the Opposition is on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as saying that the 20 per cent tolerance is &#39;perfectly reasonable&#39;. He emphasised that he was speaking impartially. &#39;I am speaking impartially and without party political bias on this matter&#39;, he said. He went on to say on the same occasion that the principles enunciated in the Electoral Act should be &#39;preserved and enshrined in the Constitution&#39;. So what we have is the Leader of the Opposition saying, when he speaks impartially and without party political bias, that the 20 per cent tolerance is perfectly reasonable and should be preserved- in fact, should be enshrined in the Constitution. I suggest that all those people who have been conned into seeing the Leader of the Opposition as the great saviour of the principles of democracy ought to look at what he says when he speaks in different circumstances. </para>
          <para>The fact is, of course, that a 20 per cent tolerance is perfectly reasonable- for all the reasons I and others have described over and over again, in this House and elsewhere. A 20 per cent tolerance is absolutely necessary if the commissioners are to be able to draw boundaries that go even some of the way towards providing some opportunity for equality of representation. But we are told that it is far more important to see that there are more or less equal numbers of people in each electorate than to try to ensure that each elector enjoys at least some equality of representation with his fellow citizens. No one, except the National Country Party, is prepared to say that the rights of people, the interests of people, should come before theories based on numbers and an irrational attachment to an allegedly sacred principle- a principle which, in practice, is not applied. </para>
          <para>What we have is a situation in which hypocritical lip-service is paid to a principle while approval is given to a practice which ignores that </para>
          <para class="block">Erinciple- and in fact turns it upside down. We ave a situation in which people are told that there is a 10 per cent tolerance, while in fact a 35 per cent tolerance is actually perpetrated in the current redistribution proposals; but, of course, it cannot be applied in a reasonable and sensible way, whereby the big electorates can get the tolerance that should be given. It is about time there was an end to all the nonsense and hypocrisy about one vote, one value. It is about time there was some attempt made to understand the real difficulties faced by country people in gaining adequate and fair political representation. </para>

            <para>( 5. 1 3)-The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> has just perpetrated another of his tiresome whinges about electoral democracy in Australia. Now we have been warned: He wants to alter the Constitution of Australia to provide that Tasmania shall have only the number of electorates to which its population would entitle it; that is, he wants Tasmania to lose two divisions in the House of Representatives. He wants to take out of the Constitution the safeguard which says that original States, of which Tasmania is one, shall always have at least five representatives in this chamber. He complains about this. </para>

              <para>- Of course he does. He cannot bully you and me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> The Labor Government tried to amend the Constitution at a referendum in May 1974 to provide that, as nearly as practicable, there should be the same number of people in every electorate on the mainland. That, of course, is what the Constitution already ensures in deciding the number of members there shall be between the States on the mainland. The number of members in the House of Representatives between the States on the mainland is determined by their respective populations. The Labor Government wanted to alter the Constitution to provide that the number of people in the various electorates on the mainland within each State should be based directly on population also. That is one of the great reforms that the Warren Supreme Court has achieved in the United States. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> refers to other provisions in other democracies. The greatest of federal democracies, the United States, under the Supreme Court&#39;s prescription now says there shall be, as nearly as practicable, the same population in all districts for the House of Representatives and in all districts for the State legislatures. That is the sort of provision we ought to have in the Australian Constitution. The people have been warned. If, on 10 December, they were to be so misguided as to give another term to the FraserAnthony Government, the  Deputy  Prime Minister would be doing his level best to restore that margin of 20 per cent that used to apply until after the joint sitting of this Parliament in 1974. Not only did the people at the election of 1974 say that there should be no greater than a 10 per cent variation from the average numbers in an electorate for the States - </para>

              <para>- If the quota for the electorates in a State is 60,000, if there was a 20 per cent margin, as there used to be until the Joint Sitting of this Parliament brought it down to 10 per cent, there could be at the outset of a distribution some electorates with 72,000 electors and others with 48,000 electors. That is not democracy. There could be adjacent electorates, one with half as many electors again. The right honourable member for Richmond quoted something I said at the first distribution I spoke on in this House in 1955. He at least might nave had the grace to admit that, in the Constitutional Review Committee&#39;s report of 1958 and 1959, 1 was the one who insisted that the margin should be reduced to 10 per cent. The two Country Party members of that Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dnimmond</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamilton,</inline> supported that recommendation. Twenty years ago decent Country Party men said that a 10 per cent margin was all that was needed. I take up the right honourable gentleman in the case of the electorate of Kalgoorlie which is the largest in area in the world. This distribution enlarges that electorate still further. From the report which we are debating, it would appear that the enrolment in Kalgoorlie is the smallest of any division in Western </para>

          <para class="block">Australia. If, however, Aborigines in Western Australia were encouraged to enrol, as distinct from being deterred from enrolling, it would have an enrolment in excess of the 10 per cent margin- in fact, in excess of the 20 per cent margin. </para>
          <para>The Western Australian redistribution enshrines the most serious and deliberate discrimination against Aborigines in Australia. The result is not only grave injustice against the Aboriginal people but also unfairness for the electors of Kalgoorlie as a whole. As a result of this discrimination against Aborigines, the new electorate of Kalgoorlie is larger in size and larger in population than it need be if all eligible Abongines were enrolled. Discrimination against Aborigines has diluted the vote of all other Australians in the Kalgoorlie electorate. There can be now no doubt about the source of that discrimination. It is the Liberal Party and the Liberal Government of Western Australia. Further, the Federal Government is failing in its obligation to encourage Aborigines to enrol and exercise their democratic rights. Evidence given in the Western Australian Court of Disputed Returns last month on an appeal in relation to the electorate of Kimberley in the State election in February puts that beyond doubt. It is clear that the Liberal Party has engaged in a deliberate campaign to discourage and deter Aborigines from enrolling and from voting. </para>
          <para>The existing electorate of Kalgoorlie had the highest population over the age of 18 of all the 10 Western Australian Federal electorates at the time of the census in June 1976; yet it had the second lowest enrolment. The Kalgoorlie population over 18 years of age at the census was 86,743. The enrolment at June 1976 was only 59,161-68.2 per cent of the population over 18 years of age. By contrast, Forrest, with a population over 1 8 years of age of 59,936 at that time, had an enrolment of 58,719-97.96 per cent of those 18 years of age and over were enrolled. The proportion of those enrolments to the population over 1 8 years of age at June last year in the other electorates in Western Australia was as follows: Curtin, 95.5 1 per cent; Moore, 92.28 per cent; Fremantle, 91.91 percent; Swan, 91.36 per cent; Canning, 91.25 per cent; Tangney, 89.20 per cent; Stirling, 87.46 per cent; Perth, 84.93 per cent. But the proportion for Kalgoorlie was only 68.2 percent. </para>
          <para>The percentage of the eligible population enrolled for the State, other than for the Kalgoorlie division, was 91.09 per cent. The Western Australia quota is now 69,443 electors. The new Kalgoorlie has 65,070 electors. On the old boundaries, Kalgoorlie would have been 14 per cent above the new quota if 91 per cent- the State average- had been enrolled. Instead the new Kalgoorlie has had to be even further extended to come within the new quota. If the Aboriginal population had been properly enrolled, Kalgoorlie, already the world&#39;s largest electorate, could have been reduced in size. Instead, it has been enlarged. </para>
          <para>Even when allowance is made for the number of itinerant workers in the electorate of Kalgoorlie there remains one overwhelming reason for the huge discrepancy between population and electors. Plainly, Aboriginals are not being enrolled and, if enrolled, are being discouraged from voting. The extent of discrimination against and intimidation of Aborigines has been fully disclosed in the Court of Disputed Returns over the last few months. Evidence was given that five lawyers, acting on behalf of the Liberal Party, had flown to the electorate, purportedly to act as scrutineers. In a letter written by the Liberal Party member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline> Ridge, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr P.</inline> J. Quilty of Ruby Plains Station it was stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>You are possibly aware that on polling day we had five young solicitors fly up to the Kimberley region to work as scrutineers for us at places where there was a large Aboriginal population. As a result of their activities I believe that we now have enough evidence to try and convince people of the necessity for amending the Electoral Act in relation to illiterate voters. If this is not done I would anticipate that by the next election there could be in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 Aborigines on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In another letter tabled in evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ridge</inline> wrote to an earth moving contractor at Derby, Jeremy O&#39;Driscoll, who had acted as a scrutineer for the Liberal Party and said. </para>
          <para>I wanted you to know also that I didn&#39;t underestimate the value of your &#39;trick &#39; at GoGo station on 1 9th. We could have been in real trouble without the services of a person such as yourself as scrutineer and I am extremely grateful. </para>
          <para class="block">Evidence was given that 34 Aborigines had been deprived of their right to vote at that polling booth alone by this &#39;trick&#39;. Evidence also was given that the Liberal lawyers deliberately humiliated and confused Aboriginal voters. Aboriginal elders were asked: &#39;Are you over 18?&#39; Others were asked: &#39;Are you a natural born Australian?&#39; Others again were asked: &#39;Are you a subject of Queen Elizabeth II?&#39; Only Aborigines were asked these questions. One of the five Liberal lawyers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Haydn</inline> Wesley Dixon, told the judge that he had decided that &#39;any lawful means could be used to stop illiterate Aborigines from voting&#39;. He said that &#39;he had regarded illiterate Aborigines as being invalid potential voters because of the pressure he was told was being applied to them&#39;. The Constitution defines the grounds for disfranchisement. Illiteracy is, of course, not one of them. It is a monstrous suggestion that there should be a literacy test for electors. It would enable the wholesale disfranchisement not only of Aborigines but also of migrants and indeed scores of thousands of handicapped Australians. Literacy in what? Why limit it to English? Literacy tests are the most notorious weapons against civil liberties in South Africa and right back to the days of the post-bellum deep south. </para>
          <para>Not all forms of discrimination are so blatant as that practised against Aborigines in Western Australia. The question we can legitimately ask now is: If in Kalgoorlie, the largest electorate in the world, the electorate in Western Australia which already has the largest population but the smallest enrolment, we find that Aborigines who have exercised their option to enrol are being deterred from voting might we not assume that they have also been deterred from enrolling? That is why this electorate is being made still largerbecause Liberal lawyers and other Liberals have deterred Aborigines from exercising their right to vote as Australian electors. </para>
          <para>I want to mention one other form of discrimination, and that is the discrimination against persons who are Commonwealth citizens, in particular citizens from Cyprus and Malta and who therefore, under our laws, are not only entitled to vote after they have resided in Australia for six months but are compelled to vote. This matter has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and others in the Senate and by some of us in this House. On 5 October this year I asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Will the Government make it known that Commonwealth nationals are not only eligible to be enrolled as voters but also required to be enrolled and that, under Australia&#39;s system of compulsory enrolment and voting, they are subject to the same penalties as Australian citizens for failing to enrol and vote? </para>

          <para class="block">On 1 1 October the Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> wrote to me saying that steps had been taken to ensure that the correct information was given to the divisional returning officers and to persons seeking to obey the law.

            <para>-The happenings of redistributions should never be imagined to be accidental. They are calculated and they occur in that way. The fortunes of redistributions also are not accidental. That is quite clear when one looks at the results of redistributions over a long period of time. In any redistribution half the members ought to be disadvantaged and half the members advantaged. The pluses ought to balance out the minuses. Yet an examination of what has happened in redistributions over many years shows that with a government side of 65 or 70 members, 20 of whom are Ministers, no Ministers are even in danger. Thenseats are never put at risk. They are never significantly disadvantaged in a redistribution. Were the commissioners to be totally unaware of the political consequences of their decisions, that would be an impossibility. So, I begin by making the very firm point that it is a statistical fact that distribution commissioners are aware of the political consequences of their decisions. The history of Australia since World War II verifies that fact absolutely and overwhelmingly. One&#39;s fate in redistributions is not a random number in the wheel of fortune. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I turn now to the redistribution as it concerns Queensland. The distribution commission in Queensland consisted of three people- two Commonwealth public servants and one State public servant, who is a statutory officer, the State Surveyor-General. It is a widely known fact in that State that the non-Commonwealth officer has been desperately unhappy about what occurred in the redistribution. That has been made known to people. It is known to honourable members in this place- honourable members who are not scheduled to speak-and it is not known indirectly. It is quite clear that one of the commissioners felt that the minds of the other commissioners were not open in respect of the redistribution and he desperately considered making a minority report. That information has been conveyed directly and indirectly to a number of people, and some honourable members in Parliament House who are not scheduled to speak are aware of it. So, the circumstances of a redistribution immediately become obvious and the nature of the commissioners becomes obvious. </para>
          <para>I have referred elsewhere to the manner in which recommendations are made for people to become distribution commissioners. In Queensland two such appointments were made within relatively recent times. One person appointed was the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, who was new in that State, and the other was a Commonwealth public servant in Queensland. Both were appointed to their positions very recently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman,</inline> the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, who must take the blame for what has happened in Queensland, has to bear the brunt of any criticism. I believe that that is quite reasonable and ought to be so. Those two people represented a majority of those who would make the decision. </para>
          <para>I was always desperately unhappy about a previous redistribution through which I lived, and for the first time I make a criticism of it. The last redistribution went through this House in 1968, and one of the people in my State who was concerned with it was a senior Minister, a PostmasterGeneral. One of the commissioners appointed was the Director-General of Posts and Telegraph in that State. I always maintainedthis is the first time in 10 years that I have stated it- that there had to be a very severe clash of interests in that redistribution. It is for that reason that I have said that the composition of many of the distribution commissions in 1975, in which Commonwealth public servants did not constitute a majority, was correct. The 1975 redistribution could not be impugned because of the honesty of the commissioners. I said that in the House at the time, and I admit that it was only out of party loyalty that I voted against that redistribution. But the principle remains and it ought to be adhered to. That redistribution was impeccable in its procedures. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the events of this redistribution, both as it concerns myself and as it concerns a wider sphere. I deal with my own case first, in terms of the principles involved. An extraordinary selectivity of principle was involved in this redistribution in respect of the seat of Lilley. An area had to be added to the seat, and the only area added was one which had the greatest separation from the seat. The key principle was the attitude of the commissioners to what are known as freeways. The area added to my seat is separated from it by both a railway line and a proposed freeway. No other area was so separated from the seat by clear, continuous and complete boundaries. Yet that was the only area added to the seat. It also happened to be an area which was rather disadvantageous to my own position. That was not unknown to the commissioners, as I indicated from the evidence which can be adduced since 1945. No suggestions were made for a change. A change was not contemplated. It was the only area on the border which would have been somewhat disadvantageous to my position. I am puzzled when I realise that the commissioners went out of their way to make freeways the boundaries between electorates on the other side of Brisbane. Where possible they made freeways the boundaries between the Griffith and Moreton electorates and between the Bowman and Moreton electorates. In no other way did the boundaries exist </para>
          <para>The New South Wales commissioners went out of their way to make freeways the legitimate boundaries of electorates where they could. Freeways separate the electorate of Prospect and the proposed new seat of Macquarie and the electorates of Robertson and Hunter. In Victoria, the commissioners also used freeways on the north and south of the Yarra River as boundaries wherever it was possible. I am puzzled that the commissioners when drawing up boundaries for one side of the Brisbane River should think differently from what they did on the south side of the river and differently from the commissioners in New South Wales and from the commissioners in Victoria. I am overwhelmingly convinced that they were aware of the consequences of what they were doing. Not for one moment do I retreat from that position. Given the composition of the tribunal, the commissioners obviously felt that they could adopt that course. </para>
          <para>I come to the final changes that were made to the redistribution proposals in Queensland. I find some of these the most fascinating of the lot. Two changes were made between the first publication of the maps and the second publication of the maps. One change was made in north Queensland between the electorates of Dawson and Kennedy. It was also a proposed change. It was put forward by way of an objection. The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Braithwaite)</inline> would immediately agree with that. In south-east Queensland, the commissioners made a change. They changed the electorate of the Gold Coast to the electorate of McPherson and changed the electorate of McPherson to the electorate of Fadden. I am fascinated as to what caused them to make those changes. I say to the House: I am totally convinced they acted on evidence other than that presented to them in public documents. </para>
          <para>In Queensland the names of electorates are important. If an electorate changes its name and a person contests that electorate, the seat is open for challenge by another party because of the three-cornered contest atmosphere that operates in Queensland. We know that. It does not matter whether one agrees with what has occurred. </para>
          <para class="block">Were the name of an electorate changed from, say, McPherson to the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast electorate becomes open for challenge by another party. Miraculously the electorate names were changed by the commissioners, but nowhere, as I look through the volurninous document entitled &#39;Redistribution of Queensland into Electoral Divisions&#39; can I see that such a change was proposed. The commissioners, like St Paul on the road to Damascus, obviously had a vision and felt that they could make that change. They felt that they could make that change with impunity. They felt that they could make that change with confidence. The political consequences of that change ought to be known to the House. The political consequences of a name change are greater in Queensland than in any other part of Australia. Names of electorates were changed in Queensland. They were not changed elsewhere in Australia. The changmg of names of electorates in normally left to this House. The Fox report of 1969 made it quite clear that the authority to name electorates lay with this House, and yet out of the blue, without any suggestions under section 2 1 of the Electoral Act for such a proposal, the commissioners changed the names of electorates. I shall read section 2 1 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act because that is the section which governs the final changes between the first publication of the maps, the 30 day period for objections and the final publication of the maps. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Suggestions or objections in writing may be lodged with the Distribution Commissioners not later than 30 days after the advertisement referred to in the last preceding section, and the Commissioners shall consider all suggestions and objections so lodged before making their report. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is quite clear that the commissioners considered some other objections which were not lodged before they made their report. I believe an explanation is required from the commissioners. I am not happy with the position. No reasonable person could possibly be happy with the position. I believe tracks have not been covered very well. It was an error not to propose a change. What the commissioners did was an error. It is widely known in the House that over recent years commissioners have not been particularly interested in naming electorates. They have shied away from taking upon themselves the precise naming of electorates. They have tended to give electorates merely geographical names and leave it for the Parliament to decide. That is what has happened in this case. The decision in the instance to which I refer came from nowhere. I am puzzled by it. I am also disturbed by it. The House can well understand why I find myself unable to vote for the proposed redistribution. </para>

        <para class="block">My reason for doing that is that in the new electorate, or should I call it the new, new electorate of Grayndler, the constituents are made up of 11,384 from Grayndler, 2,485 from Blaxland, 35,181 from Evans and 22,208 from the seat of Lang. Yet the commissioners have proposed the name of Grayndler. Apparently the Government has accepted the name of Grayndler. </para>

          <para>- Yes, it should be called the seat of Evans, as I intend to show. But as it is not being called the seat of Evans I prefer to have it called the seat of Lang. The reason it should be called the seat of Evans is that in 1968 a select committee of the Parliament, the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Naming of Electoral Divisions, was appointed. The Committee was chaired by E. M. C. Fox. One of the members was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gordon</inline> Bryant and another member was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duke</inline> Bonnett. Those last two members are in the Parliament now. The Select Committee established by the House of Representatives stated on page 7 of the report: </para>

          <para>For the purpose of this Report, your Commissioners have allocated names to proposed Divisions on the basis of the name of the existing Division providing a preponderance of the electors. This decision is in accord with recommendations made in a report in 1969 by a House of Representatives Select Committee on the naming of Electoral Divisions (Parliamentary Paper, No. 35-1969). However, your Commissioners submit that the name of Angas has greater significance to South Australia than that of Wakefield. </para>

          <para>Your Commissioners are aware that it is not their prerogative to name Electoral Divisions and have, as a matter of convenience, allocated tentative names in order to refer to the Divisions concerned. In allocating tentative names to the proposed Divisions of Parramatta, Sydney and Grayndler, your Commissioners recognised that the majority of the electors included in each of those proposed Divisions are currently enrolled for Divisions having other names. While they feel that Parramatta and Sydney are appropriate place names, they appreciate that the position m respect of the name Grayndler is not so clear. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Why they named it Grayndler, I do not know. I agree with some of the statements made by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns),</inline> who spoke before me in the debate, that pressure was applied on the Commissioners to name the seat Grayndler. In the original proposal brought down by the commissioners the seat of Lowe had 22,208 of the constituents from the existing seat of Lang. After the protests had been heard there was a clean sweep of those 22,208 constituents out of the proposed seat of Lowe into the new, new seat of Grayndler. If the select committee of this Parliament has any authority at all, the new, new seat of Grayndler should be called Evans. I propose that one of the reasons that it has not been called Evans is that the present honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Abel)</inline> is endeavouring to become the new honourable member for Lowe, and it suits him very much if there is no division named Evans. It is not possible for him to win the new, new seat of Grayndler because it happens to be a Labor seat. If the name of Evans is kept for that area, the present honourable member for Evans might not have the opportunity of running against the present honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William McMahon).</inline> So, because of the pressures applied the name of Evans was allowed to become non-existent. Then for some reason- some untold reason- instead of going down to the next electorate with the largest number of constituents and naming the seat Lang, the Commissioners passed over to the name of Grayndler. </para>
        <para>The name of Grayndler, of course, is not a particularly well known one. It has been in existence only since 1949, and so has the name of Lowe, for that matter. But the division of Lang has been in existence since 1 90 1 . It was one of the original divisions. Yet, the decision was taken by the Commissioners to name this new, new seat of Grayndler, Grayndler. They have passed over a division which has been in existence since 1901 and which has the second largest number of constituents and called the seat Grayndler. I am not a very suspicious person, but I cannot help being suspicious because there was talk that the present honourable member for Grayndler, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tony</inline> Whitlam, and myself were likely to oppose each other for the seat of Grayndler. It was indicated that perhaps I had the numbers. Because the honourable member for Grayndler is an honourable man he has decided he will run for the seat of St George. That was proposed earlier. The name of Grayndler was retained in order to try to create embarrassment between myself and the present honourable member for Grayndler. The present honourable member for Grayndler will become the new honourable member for St George. </para>
        <para>I suggest that in this instance the recommendations of the select committee should be followed and if the present incumbent for the seat of Evans does not want that name retained the choice of name should pass down to the seat with the next largest numbers in the territory. If that name is not wanted an impartial name could be chosen. The seat of Parkes was in existence for some time. The name of Parkes is certainly much better known than either Grayndler or Evans. So if an impartial and neutral name is wanted let us call the electorate Parkes because this area was substantially in the old seat of Parkes a few years ago. It may be that the name of Parkes is not considered appropriate. In this case, I point out that the late Joe Cahill, a Premier of&#34; New South Wales, resided in the Marrickville district. Perhaps the seat could be called Cahill. However, of course, I would prefer to see it called Lang. I have held the seat of Lang now for about 25 years. Only one other member has held the seat for longer than that period. Honourable members will break my intended record if they do not change their minds and adopt the amendment that I have moved; namely, that the present seat of Grayndler be called Lang. </para>
        <para>I do not want to go into some of the skulduggery that went on over this distribution, but one only had to look at the electoral map to see that the proposed seat of Lowe was aligned northsouth whereas most of the other seats were aligned east-west. I again suggest that pressures were applied in the first distribution proposal to have the seat of Lowe retained and the name of Lowe retained. Lowe was one of the seats that should have been abolished if this distribution had been carried out correctly. If it had been, we would not be in the present situation. I ask all honourable members to adopt the amendment that I have moved. </para>

        <para>DAVID FLATMAN: Good evening, welcome to T.D.T. Election fever runs high in Canberra tonight as press and television crews await the Prime Minister&#39;s next move. After a day of intense speculation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> arrived at Yarralumla just an hour ago to confer with the GovernorGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr on the anticipated Federal election. For the Opposition, a wish come true, after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s challenge yesterday to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> to call an early poll. The issues of an election campaign now are fairly obvious. The economy, unemployment, uranium and who is running the country. </para>
        <para>Tonight we are giving you the chance to put your questions on any relevant issue to the Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam who is now in our Canberra studio. We already have a number of questions recorded this afternoon, as you can see we are taking more. If you would like to call during the program we will take your questions and put as many as possible during the next half hour. The numbers to ring here in Sydney are 4382680 and 4382440. Now we are crossing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr whitlam</inline> with George Negus in Canberra. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> thanks very much for joining us . . . </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>A pleasure. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: . . . predictably the first question has got a touch of deja vu about it. Its from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Raynor</inline> of Hawker who asks. &#39;Why do you think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has visited the Governor-General at Yarralumla tonight?&#39; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well my guess is the same as everybody else&#39;s. To discuss whether the Governor-General will give him a premature election. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: Are you able to tell us then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> when you think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will tell the country about this election. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well I would guess the normal time to do would be in Parliament after question time tomorrow. But, of course, the cat and mouse game should go on for a little while yet There is no reason we should not be told tonight. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: Another question, this time from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smithers</inline> of Scullin who asks &#39;on the eve of what looks like being a Federal election do you feel like yesterday&#39;s man?&#39; </para>
        <para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Oh no. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: I think we have a question from somewhere else now? </para>
        <para>DAVID FLATMAN: Yes we have got a question from Sydney, one of our viewer&#39;s question we recorded this afternoon. </para>
        <para>MICHAEL BOYLAN: Michael Boylan, West Ryde. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> why do you not stand down as Labor Party leader. First you are the Liberal&#39;s greatest electoral asset because thousands of people will use you as an excuse for not voting Labor. If Hayden were leader they would not have that excuse. Second, you ought to have stood down because of two crucial foreign policy positions. First your position on East Timor is appeasement of the brutal corrupt Indonesian military regime, and second by your willingness to accept half a million dollars from the Iraqui&#39;s for Labor Party funds, you have fatally compromised Labor&#39;s even handed policy on the Middle East. For these reasons why do you not stand down now? Not just in the interests of the Labor Party but so that Australians can have a Labor Government after two years of madness. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well I&#39;m not going to stand down because the Party does not want me to. Either in the Parliament or in the Branches. Anybody going around Australia and seeing how I am received at any public meeting would see that the public, the Party want me to lead at these next elections. There are two things you said on Foreign policy. One is about East Timor. You have completely misrepresented the party&#39;s position and my position and then you make an allegation about being willing to receive half a million dollars from Iraq for the last elections. A newspaper said that, I have sued it and it is settling the case. </para>
        <para>CUVE HAIME: Clive Haime in Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> A South Australian viewer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Clark of Nurioopta puts to you this proposition. He says &#39;I cannot vote Labor when you and your party&#39;s performance between 1972 and 1975 had unquestionable merit in its idealism and humanist aims but was abyssmal in its pathetic attempts to cope with the realities of 20th century political power. Why should I give you another chance to reaffirm the political sobriety of the conservatives. What chance is there for voters like me?&#39; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well in fact, in our three years of. government we brought Australia up to thus part of this century. Obviously in External Affairs we put Australia in a proper position in the world. There can be no question about that. On internal matters we also brought Australia very much up to date. The administrative arrangements and reforms we made have been continued and are applauded on all sides. It is true that we were unfortunate enough to be in office when unemployment and inflation hit every western country. It didn&#39;t hit Australia any worse than other countries. I would make this point however, in 1976 and 1977 inflation has gone down in other western countries it hasn&#39;t in Australia, unemployment has gone down in other western countries, it has gone up in Australia by 32 per cent. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: I think the next question is from Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline></para>
        <para>PETER COUCHMAN: First question inaudible for technical reasons. I have a question that I will read. This is a question that I have taken from Tasmania because we have Tasmanian viewers with us tonight. It&#39;s a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Von</inline> Beberer. She asks <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;How can the public have faith in the Government led by you when your previous Government created the worst inflation in the history of Australia, created the worst unemployment, showed instability in an executive position and virtually strangled private enterprise? &#39; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>There was not the worst inflation in Australia under my Government. The worst inflation in Australia was in the early 1950s under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> as he then was. We did not produce the worst unemployment in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> Government has produced that. He has increased unemployment by 32 per cent in the 22 months that he has been Prime Minister. </para>
        <para>PETER COUCHMAN: Another question from Tasmania, this time from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Parr</inline> who lives in Moonah, &#39;If you were re-elected would you travel as much overseas as you did last time?&#39; And she also asks &#39;Would you charter your own 707&#34;? </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>I would probably not travel as much overseas because I would have another Minister as Foreign Minister. You should remember that in the first 12 months, the first 1 1 months of our government, I was Foreign Minister as well as Prime Minister and I handed over the job of Foreign Minister when we had got right our relations with the United States and Japan and with our neighbours and with China. If, as I was advised previously, one should, for security reasons, travel in a chartered aircraft I would do so. I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has adopted the technique of having the officials who go with him travel commercial and charge their bills to their Departments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> in fact, has been out of the country more days than I was in the same time and the bills have been just as great but they have been dispersed among all the Departments from whom the officials came instead of being on one bill for my Department only. </para>
        <para>MELBOURNE ANNOUNCER: A constitutional question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> of Malvern. &#39;On an evening where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> is discussing who can tell what with the Governor-General, do you still believe that the Governor-General should always follow the Prime Minister&#39;s advice?&#39; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Yes, as the Queen does. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Thirty. </para>
        <para>JUNE HEFFERAN: This is another election question its from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Curtin</inline> from Hurstville and she wants to know &#39;What would be your policy on a national superannuation scheme and the abolition of the means test on pensions?&#39; </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>The introduction of a national superannuation scheme is a very difficult one, I won&#39;t pretend to have the answer on that. We had a committee which we appointed in the first couple of months to make a report on that. It came up with a divided report. And it will I suspect be quite some time before there is a national superannuation scheme in Australia. Its one of the most complicated matters that Governments have to consider and the other matter was the abolition of the means test- our Party is committed to the abolition of the means test. We did, by stages in each of our three budgets, abolish the means test for everybody 70 years of age or above. We&#39;re still committed to that. I think it will have to come in rather gradually from now on. I would point out that we are the only government that ever abolished the means test for anyone. We want to do it but it will be quite some time I guess before it can be done. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs LEMMINGTON</inline>of Botany: Don&#39;t you think that the recent difference between your attitude on Timor and that of the Party as a whole, points out to you that you are out of step? </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr ROCHE,</inline>Oakley: If the Labor Party is returned at an election to Government will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> persist in borrowing money from overseas private sources or will he use our own Commonwealth Bank funds? </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well if one needs to borrow money from overseas one would do so through ordinary public sources. I don &#39;t get the gist of the question about using Commonwealth Bank funds. Of course bank funds are used by all governments in Australia, not really Commonwealth Bank funds. If you&#39;re referring to overseas borrowings then of course you may have in mind that we were contemplating borrowing $2,000m US dollars for temporary purposes. The present government has in fact done so. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs GWEN</inline>PARSONS, Nambucca Heads: I would like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> does he know why we have got to have an early election when the Prime Minister and the members of the present government all begged and stressed of the public m Australia to give them a full three year uninterrupted turn in office, stating that they could not possibly bring the country back on its feet, restore full employment and give all Australians full confidence unless he has a full three year uninterrupted term in office, and he has only done two years. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well it is quite obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> wants to drop his bundle after two years instead of after three years which he said he needed, because his policies aren&#39;t working and it&#39;s very obvious that if he waits until next May, which is the proper time to have the elections for both the houses of the federal parliament he will be seen still more obviously to have made a mess of the economy, particularly in the increased unemployment which we will then be suffering. I pointed out that the proper time is next May and I say that for this reason. Last May, at a referendum, over 62 per cent of the Australian electors said, two thingsthey thought that elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate should be held at the same time. They also said that they thought the two houses should commence their terms at the same time. Now the half of the Senate which has to go to the people next will still continue till the end of next June. Whenever we elect the new half of the Senate you won&#39;t get those senators becoming senators until 1 July, so if there is an election in December you will still have the old senate until the end of next June and when you get new senators they will already be seven months stale. </para>
        <para class="block">GEORGE NEGUS: So you quite clearly have changed ?our mind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whidam</inline> because you are on the public record ast year as saying you thought about this time would be a reasonable time for it. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Yes but I said that because that was before the people expressed their views so very clearly at the referendum last May and ever since then, as you know quite well, I have constantly said, I said on the Sunday after that referendum, that the proper time to have the elections would be in May 1978 because that is as close as you can get to the time when the Senators you elect have to take up their office. It takes a few weeks to count the Senate votes, you want to have senators who represent the contemporary point of view. </para>
        <para>PETER GOMBRETZ, Yarra Glen: If you were Prime Minister, what would you do if the unions refused to accept a decision that was handed down by the Arbitration Commission? </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well there are very few cases where union do not accept decisions handed down by the Arbitration Commission. The only thing that I want to stress is that the Arbitration Commission is the best equipped body to solve industrial disputes and if governments buy into those disputes they only inflame those disputes. No government ever setded an industrial dispute. The Arbitration Commission settles 99 per cent of them. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>The first question: yes. The second, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hurford.</inline> I add, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> doesn&#39;t want to be Treasurer in my next government, he wants to be Minister for Foreign Aflairs and I think he will be that and Defence Minister as well. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well we would certainly try to and we should. The small businessman of course is ignored in all the programmes that the Fraser Government has brought in. Its policies are devoted to the interests of big business and very often the overseas companies. The things that it has done for business, such as investment allowances and mining concessions and the various protective measures, tariffs and quotas, haven&#39;t helped the small businessman one bit. </para>
        <para>Q: Schoolgirl sitting for Higher School Certificate: She wants to know what your Government, if you were elected, would do for school leavers and their future prospects. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well of course they are the hardest hit part of the community. There is 200,000 of them leaving school at the end of this year and only 100,000 of them will get jobs. The biggest thing that has to be done is to at least maintain the level of government expenditure. The big reason why unemployment and particularly youth unemployment, has grown so much in Australia- 32 per cent more people seeking jobs than there were 22 months ago, is that the Australian Federal Government has cut down on Government contracts and we&#39;re the only federal government in the world where that&#39;s happened, Canada and the United States and West Germany don&#39;t do it and that&#39;s why they don&#39;t have as much unemployment, they haven&#39;t had the rise in unemployment that we have had in Australia. The Government sector has been badly hit in Australia and the private sector which depends quite largely on government contracts, hospitals, education institutions, transport municipal institutions, it&#39;s not been able to give the jobs that it always has been able to give in Australia, or which it can give in other federal countries. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>No I would heed the very distinct impression that the view that the public expressed at the referendum last May. Over 62 per cent of them. I would be having elections for both houses as close to the time when the Senate has to have its new members. That is, I would be having it next May, that&#39;s what the people said they wanted, they want elections at the same time, but they want the terms of both houses to date from the same time, they don&#39;t want to elect senators who wont take their positions in the Senate for another seven months. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>No I believe that the Governor-General ought to be appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Australian Prime Minister, that&#39;s what&#39;s happened ever since 193 1 and I think it&#39;s the proper system and I also of course obviously think that the Governor-General of Australia ought to behave as the Queen behaves and of course as she and her ancestors for the last 100 years have, on the advice of their Prime Minister. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>No I have never said anything of the sort. What I have said on uranium has been said in the Parliament and in recent months I have also spoken to several gatherings outside of the Parliament but I have never signed a statement like that. What I have done in the Parliament of course and as prime minister was to persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox to chair an inquiry into the Ranger proposal and earlier to commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward to conduct an inquiry into the effects of uranium and other matters on aboriginal lands in the Northern Territory. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>No. This suggestion is made by very many people. I don&#39;t believe that that is the way to get employment for our people, young and old, and I think it would be a shocking waste if people had to retire at 55 and I believe most people at 55 want to work and can make a big contribution. It would be a shocking waste to encourage them to or to compel them to retire. </para>
        <para>ROSEMARY HARRIS, Canberra: What are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s views on whaling and if in the next election, whether that&#39;s in December, April or May, the Labor government is restored to office, what steps will it take to stop disgraceful and unnecessary slaughter of these animals? </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well we would use all our influence to see that no more whales are killed. I would point out that this is not something that Australia can do single handed. It can only be done by international agreement because certainly beyond 200 miles-what&#39;s that-320 kilometres from the coast of every country the ships of any nation can do what they like, whether killing whales or commit pollution or whatever it is, so our efforts would be directed to getting international arrangements to prevent the killing of any more whales by any country. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>No I don&#39;t believe that one ought to segregate various parts of Australia&#39;s population and have a separate government for them. I certainly believe that aboriginals ought to have better facilities for taking part in government. Our government did a very great deal to that end but- and I certainly deplore the shocking efforts that were made, and it has to be admitted that they were made by half a dozen Liberal solicitors at the last Western Australian state elections, to deter aborigines from voting although they had exercised their option of getting on the electoral roles. There&#39;s far too few aboriginals who in fact have exercised that option of getting on the eleaoral role, particularly in the northern parts of Western Australia and Queensland. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well there are two great things that have to be done, the first is to see that the people that live in towns in the country are able to get decent facilities, and I take pride in the fact that my government did more to upgrade the educational and civic facilities, recreational facilities in country towns than all previous Australian governments, Federal Governments have never concerned themselves with that. The second thing is that for primary producers, the Australian government has to try to give honest advice as to the prospects of overseas markets. It^ a cruel deception that throughout the 1 960 &#39;s in particular, Liberal Country Party Governments perpetrated on rural producers, just conning them into thinking that Britain could be frustrated or deterred from joining the European Economic Community and they were encouraged to put a great deal of effort and go into debt to produce things for which there was no real prospect of overseas sales. I think that was a cruel deception. But primary producers need to have a government which will give them frank advice as to export prospects and that&#39;s not often been achieved. We at least emphasised in all the appointments we made to the marketing bodies, we emphasised people who had skill in marketing, not just producing, but marketing, you have got to have places where you can sell our rural products. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs HALLIDAY,</inline>Tasmania: In assuming that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will be granted a December 10 election she asks how much is it going to cost taxpayers for the new Senate that will be elected on December 10 but won&#39;t be able to take office until next June? </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>I don&#39;t know how many million dollars are involved, I just don&#39;t know. Let me put in a plug in here, that if we are to have a proper opportunity in Australia for political parties which are the essence of democracy in any country, if we are to have political parties able to put their points of view to the public then the taxpayers should subsidise political campaigns in proportion to the support that they get at the last elections and that is now done in every country in Western Europe and North America. Australia is now lagging behind. The only assistance which the taxpayers give political parties to give their story to the electors is free time on the ABC and not enough people look at the ABC. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>Well we did something about South Africa, we ceased to subsidise exports to South Africa and we ceased to vote with South Africa in the United Nations, it&#39;s only as recently as 1972 Liberal Governments had successively supported South Africa, Portugal, New Zealand, on all these racial and colonial questions. We changed all that and unfortunately the New Zealand Government changed at the same time and the Fraser Government, I applaud it for doing so, has continued its opposition to apartheid policies. The Menzies Government and other Liberal Governments did not. I believe that the world must consistently take action against South Africa and now at last, at last, the United States is accepting its moral leadership in this respect.  President  Carter is a man of courage and consistency and thank God the West is no longer contaminated by this collaboration or cover up in respect to the minority governments of Southern Africa. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr WHITLAM:</inline>We will bring back Medibank as soon as one can. I would point out that the sooner we get Medibank back the less the taxpayers, as individuals and collectively, will have to pay for health services. For the last full year of Medibank, the one when it covered everybody in Australia, that is up to October last year for the 12 months up to then, it cost the taxpayers $51 million. In this year&#39;s Budget $54 million is being spent to provide Medibank cover for onethird of the population. We are being ripped off by these chosen private health funds and the public shouldn&#39;t cop it. It might take a little while to bring back complete Medibank but it will be a saving for taxpayers as a whole and it will be a saving for every individual taxpayer. It&#39;s costing three times as much per head with the divided system as it did for universal cover through Medibank. </para>

All the noises that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and his colleagues on that power dispute were devoted to exacerbating the position, they had no relevant contribution to make and I can understand the Hamer Government in Victoria, thought it was a blessing in disguise, taking the land scandals in which they have all been engaged, off the front pages. </para>
        <para>DAVID FLATMAN: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> thank you very much for handling the viewers&#39; questions and now for a summary of today&#39;s developments, we&#39;ll cross back to George Negus in Canberra. </para>
        <para>GEORGE NEGUS: What I am able to tell you is that whilst we were on air the Prime Minister&#39;s press office has told us that, yes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> did visit Yarralumla, it is officially confirmed, and also they were able to tell us earlier in the day he conferred with his colleagues and confirmed that he had indeed spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> the Chief Electoral Officer. What they wouldn&#39;t tell us were the subjects of the talks that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr so we can only assume that if he is going to tell us at all it would be in the Parliament tomorrow and I think on that note <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> we would thank you again. </para>

          <para>- I announced in Brisbane last Monday evening that, because of the Federal redistribution which has adversely affected the seat of Griffith which I have represented since 1966, it is my intention to place my nomination with the Liberal Party in an endeavour to gain preselection for the new Federal seat of Fadden. The new seat of Fadden is named after a great Queenslander and former Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Fadden. It is situated between the southern outskirts of the city of Brisbane and the New South Wales border and between the back of the coastal strip and roughly the base of the Great Dividing Range. I look forward to representing the people of Fadden. Representing that electorate will provide a totally new lifestyle compared with that of representing a central city seat such as Griffith with its numerous and diversified problems. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I state that no parliamentarian could be richer in experience and memories than I am as a result of my association with the people dwelling in the 25 suburbs which in these remaining hours constitute the present electorate of Griffith. Those people have been good to me, and it is worth stating for the record that there is no Federal seat in Australia that has stuck by its member as Griffith has stuck by me. The seat was won from the ALP by 801 votes in 1966 and, as a result of the 1968 Federal redistribution, was subjected to some improvement. During the turbulent years that followed for the Liberal Party- a time when I saw several of my colleagues defeated- my majority was 1,600 in 1969, 350 in 1972, and 1,550 in 1974. </para>
        <para class="block">Honourable members might remember that 1974 was the year that the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> personally chose a candidate for the Labor Party for the purpose of taking the seat from me. Clem Jones&#39; 1974 campaign in Griffith is now history. He was described at the time as the best political candidate the Labor Party could offer Australia. No one gave me a chance of winning; yet the people of Griffith indicated at the ballot box that they felt that they were satisfied with their sitting member. The 1975 election was an easy one for sitting Liberal and National Party members. The people of Griffith, despite their basic political leanings have stuck fast during all those years. I seek leave of the House to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard a</inline> paper prepared at my request by the Parliamentary Library. The paper indicates the volatility of the Australian electorate. I seek leave to incorporate also the letter which I lodged with the Distribution Commissioner on the redistribution of Griffith. </para>

                <para>Most other alterations are totally unnecessary. All that needs to be done to get the numbers within 300 of the proposed number of electors for Griffith is to retum Coorparoo and Greenslopes Subdivisions to Griffith and remove the Morningside Subdivision from the existing Griffith to existing Bowman.

        <para>As much as I respect the people of Morningside Subdivision after almost eleven years association, such a change would cause minimum dislocation and allow you to carry out the Redistribution in accordance with the guidelines. The numbers in Bowman are barely altered from what you proposed. </para>
        <para>The suburbs of Murarrie, Morningside, Cannon Hill, and Hemmant- in existing Griffith and existing Bowmanrepresent a distinct community of interest. It is a meat industry orientated community. To regard it as one area is justifiable. </para>
        <para>The Griffith I maintain you should have arrived at becomes an area containing two communities of interest. The inner Brisbane area and inner Southside suburbs. I trust you will recognise that my living in the district all my life, (indeed I am third generation m the area), and representing it in Parliament for eleven years gives me a greater comprehension of community of interest- economic and socialthan you would be expected to possess. </para>
        <para>The original growth of Greenslopes, Coorparoo, Norman Park, Hawthorne and Bulimba Subdivisions took place in the same era. I find myself in frequent attendance these days at Golden Anniversary celebrations of Churches, Schools and organisations operating in these subdivisions. A great similarity exists even in the appearance of the homes. Even the tram lines, which were torn up by a disappointed opponent some years ago, were originally extended to the suburbs involved in the same period. </para>
        <para>I have done a distribution of a letter in the Greenslopes and Coorparoo Subdivisions explaining what you propose and requesting the people of those areas to tell you what they think of your proposal for their future. Should you get in excess of 100 you should take great note of their attitude. In all my years as a parliamentarian there have only been two issues which have triggered off a deluge of correspondence in excess of 100 from the entire electorate. If, on this occasion you receive more than 100 replies from a quarter of the existing Griffith, it is an indication of grave public discontent towards your proposal. </para>
        <para>Many are unaware that on 1974 election result figures the proposed Bowman is an ALP seat. If you have emasculated Griffith with a view to seeking an overall political balance, and many people are suggesting this, might I remind you that the present Griffith and the Griffith I propose is really a Labor Seat. Griffith will contain what can be fairly judged as a conglomerate of approximately <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> Labor State electorates, and less than 2 Liberal State Seats. </para>
        <para>In the 1966,1969, 1972 and 1974 Federal elections, 99 per cent of political commentators predicted a Labor victory in Griffith. Indeed, amateur &#39;bookies&#39; offered odds as high as 8 to 1 against me and professionals at 5 to 1. They learnt the hard way. The people of Griffith know just what they want despite the majority&#39;s involvement in blue collar industries. You will not be accused of favouring a particular political party if you follow my submission. </para>
        <para>To the contrary, you will be priased by all political persuasions. </para>
        <para>The rationale behind the direction to take into account existing boundaries has two facets (a) stability for the people and (b) the need to preserve in the Parliament Members who survive and gain experience. It will probably surprise you to learn that a Member of the House of Representatives has five times more chance of losing his Seat in elections than the average of the fatality rate of the six State Legislative Assemblies. Only a relatively small percentage of M.H.R.&#39;s ever qualify for the Parliamentary Pension which requires three elections and at least 8 years&#39; service. </para>
        <para>In terms of service, in our present House of Representatives, consisting of 127 Members, there are only 26 who have served longer than I have served. Already three of them have announced their intention to retire at the next election, (Messrs Beazley, Nicholls and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns).</inline></para>
        <para>After surviving in Griffith against all odds, what you propose virtually does what other factors have failed to achieve. </para>
        <para>If  what you nave done to Griffith were to prevail nationally (and remember recent High Court rulings necessitate future redistributions being done more frequently), Australia would end up with a national Parliament comprising Members with little experience. </para>
        <para>Surely you must recognise that in the interests of Australia, it is essential that the already uncertain and difficult career of Federal Parliamentarians be not made even more uncertain by the intrusion of an even more devastating factor. </para>
        <para>Little wonder gifted persons like yourselves, who have achieved the top in their chosen vocations, are not prepared to forsake security by offering their talents to the nation with the inherent risk of political life. </para>
        <para>You may make the judgement that I have a vested interest in labouring this aspect. There is an element of truth in that. But for approximately 80 hours of almost every week since 1966 I have given much to my country and to the people I have been privileged to represent. Despite the popular view you too may hold about Federal Parliamentarians, I am more the rule than the exception. </para>
        <para>If you conclude my opposition is dominated also by monetary gain let me inform you that after surviving five elections in Griffith I could retire on a Pension of approximately $13,000 per annum, take a position outside which allows me to finish at S.00 p.m., and which makes Saturdays and Sundays mine. I would end up financially better off than I am now and working half the present hours. </para>
        <para>The direction by the Act that you consider existing boundaries seems to have escaped you. If you reconcile yourselves by concluding that a Member can nominate for some other Seat, let me assure you that the relationship one develops in an area is not easily built. In my case in Griffith, it is an association which commenced 37 years ago. It could not be rebuilt elsewhere if I were to live another 37 years. There is only one area where you can stand and say &#39;I was born and raised here&#39;. Even my late maternal grandfather represented much of the area in the 1920s in the now absorbed South Brisbane Town Council, and many streets in Griffith carry the names of both deceased and surviving forebears. Political parties choose and the people prefer candidates with a local identity. Some will match my identity but few will surpass it. </para>
        <para>Attached is the 1000 signature result of a two-hour effort by eight people in just three shopping centres on Saturday morning, 27 August, when we turned to the people with petitions to seek their attitude to your proposal for Coorparoo and Greenslopes subdivisions. </para>
        <para>In the name of the Electoral Act, decency and justice you have a very deep obligation to rethink the Redistribution of the Federal Seat of Griffith. </para>

            <para>- In summary, the paper prepared by the Parliamentary Library shows now, since the writs were issued in 1966, there have been 92 changes in the political allegiance of the seats in this House; 32 of the seats have changed their political representation more than once.

When one considers that the average parliamentary life of a Federal parliamentarian is stated to be less than eight years, this is an unusual performance for a member who has won by such a tiny margin. It will interest members of the House of Representatives to learn that members of the lower houses of the six State legislative assemblies have a fivefold greater chance of surviving in their chambers than do members in the lower House of this Parliament. Those figures are based on records which go back to 1963. Survival here for 11 years is a long time. Indeed, it took nine years for the Sydney Harbour Bridge to be constructed. The construction of the Panama and Suez canals took only 10 years. Michelangelo, if he worked non-stop, would have completed painting the Sistine Chapel three times in that period. </para>

              <para>-People have a right to expect that Commissioners will at least take note of public comment, and I am pleased that the honourable member for Riverina who has been disadvantaged agrees with me, but this is not the case in Queensland. Their minds appear to have been closed except for the two alterations which were alluded by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns).</inline> There was a slight change to put back what they unnecessarily removed from the electorate of Dawson, and there was a change of name of the new electorate from Gold Coast to McPherson. As the  Chairman  of the Distribution Commission and Queensland&#39;s Chief Electoral Officer, Francis Coleman was, prior to his appointment from Canberra last year, the electoral officer for McPherson, one might argue on his behalf that he had a strange sentimental attachment to that name and wanted it for ever emblazoned in the lights of the Gold Coast. Beyond that the Commission did nothing. Section 19 sub-section 2 (g) of the original Act provides that the Commissioners shall give due consideration to &#39;existing boundaries of divisions and sub-divisions&#39;. Even when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> was the Minister for Administrative Services and altered the Act, he ensured that that very important provision was maintained. The only change in the Act in this regard was that that provision became section 19 (e) but the words, that is, the Commissioners shall give due consideration to &#39;existing boundaries of divisions and sub-divisions&#39;, remain. The Commissioners disregarded that provision. </para>

              <para>-Put together, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs reminds me. Obviously something was wrong. Its the thickest book of objectives against a redistribution in Australian history. More than half of all objections throughout Australia came from the people of Queensland, and over one-quarter of all the objections for Australia came from one-fifth of one of the 127 electorates. A small pocket of people screamed in dismay and disappointment, but the Commissioners brushed them aside with a contemptuous 29-word sentence. That is all the attention they paid to half the objections in Queensland- 29 lousy words. I said previously that it appears as if their minds had been made up. </para>

          <para class="block">That comment is not unlike the words which came from the hps of the honourable member for Lilley earlier this evening.  His  words make interesting reading. Indeed they come from the lips of a man without an axe to grind. He still has his Lilley, but he was so moved by the stories in wide circulation in Queensland- I see the honourable member for Bowman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jull)</inline> nodding his head in agreement- that he drew the attention of this place to what has happened in our State. </para>
          <para>As the honourable member for Griffith, I turned what may have been regarded in 1966 as a seat of clay into a seat of gold for the Liberal Party. It stood by me five times. The Commissioners may have taken Griffith from me, but they have not taken my integrity. If ever I reach the stage in this place that I have to silence my hps when I see rotten apples in the case, I would rather be out of it because I would no longer possess the integrity that a member of this place should have. </para>
          <para>I suggest- after the next election I will work towards this goal- that the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be altered. As the honourable member for Lilley said, we should never again allow the third Commissioner, who is a government appointee, to be a public servant because pubhc servants, like everybody else, have a great deal of interest in their own careers and opportunities for promotion. Never again, if I have my way, will a bunch of anonymous men- three of them- sitting in their soft chairs behind closed doors be able to treat the people with the contempt that has been displayed, principally by the  Chairman  of Commissioners in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman,</inline> to those hundreds of people in those two subdivisions who reacted in a spontaneous way and wrote in protesting at what the Commissioners were doing. Their words were not heeded. Those hundreds of people may as well have saved their stamps, their envelopes and their time in writing. </para>
          <para>Every puppy has his day. That is not meant to be an idle threat. I assure the House that whilst I face a new future in a new seat, what has been done to Griffith is an event that should not be allowed to be repeated anywhere in this country, whether it is done to a Labor man or a Liberal man. In short, the Commissioners removed from the seat two subdivisions which made it impossible for me to win it, put them in another seat, took two subdivisions out of that seat and put them in Griffith. They set out to turn it into a safe seat for another party. In my opinion they did it simply to make themselves look good guys and fair guys. </para>

            <para>- I rise in this debate to oppose specifically the distribution commissioners&#39; report in relation to New South Wales. I do so in great sorrow. I must talk about the way in which this redistribution has been effected, and about the electoral laws and the way in which they have been implemented by the distribution commissioners. I do not wish to speak about the Commonwealth Electoral Act, except to say that it is apparent from the exercise in relation to New South Wales that it is completely deficient. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many of the comments which have come from the other side of the House have come from persons who, like me, have been disadvantaged personally as a result of the recommendations in the reports which we are now debating. That is inevitable. Whenever this House of this Parliament considers redistribution proposals, the inevitable spread of population and the static number of seats in this House will mean that certain members will be gravely disadvantaged. I have been gravely disadvantaged. However, I hope that I can speak about the deficiencies in the mechanisms available, the deficiencies in this legislation, and most importantly the many grave questions which hang over the whole way in which the commissioners in New South Wales have carried out their brief to redistribute the electorates of New South Wales. Very grave questions are raised as to the propriety of the way that was done. </para>
          <para>The commissioners for New South Wales were appointed on 19 April 1977. A little over four months later, on 23 August this year, the commissioners gave notice of the proposed divisions for the State of New South Wales. I believe that, if the mechanisms set out in the Commonwealth Electoral Act are not to be a mockery, the commissioners ought to have thought long and hard before they come out with their notice of proposed divisions and only in the most extreme circumstances and only after great consideration ought they to depart from their initial suggestions. I regret that in New South Wales major departures have been made without any explanation whatsoever from the commissioners. This calls into question, I believe most sincerely, the diligence and, indeed, the honesty with which they have discharged their commission. </para>
          <para>I started out by saying that inevitably, with the spread of population and the pattern of human settlement in our great metropolitan areas, there has been an invanable pattern in the large cities of Australia that members occupying seats closest to the central business districts and closest to the centres of town are the most vulnerable in a redistribution. But what we expect is that the commissioners have given proper consideration when they come out with notice of their proposed divisions, so that they do not depart dramatically and drastically from that notice when they come out with their final report. In New South Wales, in relation to the central metropolitan area of Sydney they have done that in a way that is so seriously at variance with their original suggestions that there is a stink about the whole system. After four months&#39; consideration the Commissioners complied with the charge that they are given in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which is to publish notice of the proposed divisions at every Post Office in the proposed divisions. There is a reason for that. It is so that persons can see into what electoral division it is proposed they should move or indeed in which electoral division they may now be. </para>
          <para>I think it is a commonly accepted fact by honourable members on both sides of this House that if there has been a major change in land use, if there has been some resumption of land or if some land formerly settled becomes recreation land or something like that, an adjustment of a boundary may be appropriate. Indeed, a reordering of the boundaries of subdivisions may be appropriate. It has not been unknown for whole subdivisions to be shifted after the Distribution Commissioners have given notice of their original proposal. </para>
          <para>In the central area of Sydney the Distribution Commissioners have drastically altered their originally proposed divisions. They have shifted a majority of electors in a whole central Sydney municipality from a proposed division into a new division. They have given no notice whatsoever of that to any of the persons affected by it, and of course no person, no institution and no local government authority has had the opportunity to protest against the intention which I firmly believe they held in the back of their minds the whole time. I believe a dishonest notice was given under the terms of section 20 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That can be the only conclusion that follows from such a dramatic variation. </para>
          <para>In New South Wales we were all faced with drastically changed ground rules. The number of electorates was being reduced from 45 to 43. This meant that the number of electors in every electorate would increase hugely at a time, of course, when the population is increasing and at a time when, as every honourable member knows, the demands on the responsibilities of members of Parliament to their constituents are also increasing. The Commissioners should have thought long and hard about this. The quota for New South Wales was set at substantially more than 71,000 persons. Every one of the electorates affected- I am referring to Sydney, Grayndler, Lowe and Evans- was about 10,000 under quota, so it was a big cut-up. It was a major recommittal. It was not a matter of aligning one subdivision with another. We are as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> reminded the House today, working in an area where huge numbers of the population are not citizens or are not registered to vote and are therefore not counted for the purposes of this whole exercise. We are talking about the most densely populated, the most deprived areas in the inner metropolitan area of Sydney. The Commissioners have disposed of their change of mind in these terms: &#39;We have made certain changes to our published proposals&#39; and now there is &#39;a more equitable adjustment of community interest among the electors involved&#39;. They refer there to the seats of Lowe, Grayndler and Evans. That is nonsense. The Press, which again has never discharged the responsibilities which Australians should impose upon members of the fourth estate in this country, has never looked at the comments made to the Commissioners about their original distribution proposals. </para>
          <para>There has been an acceptance that, because a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William McMahon)</inline> published a lengthy objection, it was therefore a worthwhile and a well thought out objection. It is a nonsensical objection. It is an objection of which the law clerk in the firm which drafted it for him ought to be ashamed. It commences with an incorrect citation of the Electoral Act. It refers to the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918-1973. In fact, it has been amended on several occasions since 1973 and, in any event, the former Attorney-General changed the form of citation. The Act that was passed by this Parliament in 1974 as a result of the great double dissolution and the historic Joint Sitting of the Houses of Parliament set out the new matters which are to be considered in the distribution of electorates. The right honourable member for Lowe has set out an objection which I commend to honourable members for examination. It is a disgrace; it is a circular argument that, because of its length, is supposed to have some internal consistency. In fact it does not. </para>
          <para>I want to hark back to the point that the distribution commissioners say that they have more equitably adjusted community of interest. That is the criterion addressed in section 19 (2), paragraph (a)- &#39;community of interests within the Division, including economic, social and regional interests&#39;. There the right honourable member for Lowe made several points. He talked about there being no economic, social or regional interests in common between the parts of land which it was proposed to join to the former parts of the division of Lowe. The mere assertion of that ought to be backed up with some facts. Yet this is what he calls in aid: He says that the major economic markets in the area are the shopping centre of Burwood and the Flemington markets. He says that they draw their support as commercial centres solely from the subdivisions which lie to their north and which have been placed in the division of Sydney. If he had supported that with a statement or a market research survey conducted by the Chamber of Commerce in Burwood or by the State Produce Authority that conducts the Flemington markets, there might have been some basis to it. But there is none. It is a dishonest statement. The Remington markets are populated and patronised by persons who would&#39; never be able to live in the more wealthy precincts of the former division of Lowe. The right honourable member for Lowe ought to know that and so must the distribution commissioners. </para>
          <para>When talking about economic and social interests, the right honourable member for Lowe put in aid that the Hume Highway marked a natural boundary. Later on he went on to describe it as a physical feature, as though it were a huge gorge or a freeway instead of a street that is punctuated at 100-yard intervals by intersections, traffic lights and massive traffic flows in every direction. It cannot in any way be described as a physical feature. But most interestingly he referred to the proposed local government amalgamations in New South Wales as being some authority for the proposition that those local government authorities that lie to the north of the Hume Highway have something in common because it had been proposed by the Boundaries Commission in New South Wales that they ought to be amalgamated. When he asserts that that is the case, he overlooks the fact that a massive part of the municipality of Strathfield lies south of the Hume Highway. The most comic objection of the right honourable member for Lowe was what he said in relation to the criterion set down in paragraph (b) of section 19(2) of the Act relating to means of communication and travel within the division. He said: . . . there are very few transport services running from the area South of the Hume Highway . . . and . . . to travel by train from Strathfield to Campsie Stations requires a journey via Redfern or Central Stations. </para>
          <para class="block">Well, I suppose, as the proverbial managing clerk used to say to the articled clerk: &#39;If you want to go down two blocks and travel via La Perouse on the tram, it is going to take you three hours &#39;. It is a nonsense ! </para>
          <para>The right honourable member has nominated in his objections the prime commercial areas of his former electorate. Burwood is one of the biggest areas. Everybody in Sydney knows the Westfield Shopping Centre as a focus of commercial attention for persons from a very wide area. There is a direct bus service, run by the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales, from Burwood to Campsie. It runs at 10- minute intervals and it is routes Nos 492 and 494. I do not expect those who formerly transported themselves only in Daimler motor vehicles, sitting up in the back seat to elevate their height, to be aware of that. But the government bus services are run as an integrated operation by the Pubhc Transport Commission of New South Wales. </para>
          <para>There is a stink about this. It becomes a farce that there ought to be a provision in the Act that boundaries be posted in post offices when half a municipality- 30,000 people- and I spoke to the Mayor of Marrickville today- sees this area go into the seat of Sydney. The honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les MacMahon),</inline> who is a hard workmg member, will now have responsibility for the most disadvantaged areas in the State of New South Wales. That has been statistically proven. I refer to Leichhardt, Marrickville, the centre of Sydney and south Sydney. The statistical bias operating against the Labor Party which Malcolm Mackerras, a prominent psephologist, has noted at a figure of about 2 per cent has been restored. Labor will get 90 per of the vote in Sydney, but we will have a safe Liberal seat for a tired, weary old man who ought to be discredited by bis own party. </para>

            <para>- I join this debate for different reasons from those of the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Antony Whitlam).</inline> In fact, they are different from those of all members of the Opposition and, in most cases, supporters of the Government. I say at the outset, that I have notning to say against the work done by the distribution commissioners. To put it bluntly, if we give a group of men a stupid task we must expect a stupid answer. The commissioners were given a stupid task in 1974-75. They were given a stupid task this year. Nothing will change that situation. The arguments tonight have been put forward by those who see political variations in the boundaries drawn by the commissioners. After all, what is this game but a political game? If we cannot accept the decision of the umpire we should not play in the match. My position has not changed with regard to the redistribution proposals put forward either by the Labor Party or on this occasion. I quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> &#39;in 1975 when I said: </para>

I must voice, on behalf of the people of my electorate, the strongest possible objection to the redistribution proposals. I am speaking on this occasion with almost absolute support from my people.

I do not consider the task of winning the new seat of Riverina in 1977 to be as daunting as the task in 1974. 1 have also spoken out strongly in the Press against these proposals. I do not think I will be saying anything new tonight, but I wish to say a few words about this catch cry &#39;one vote, one value &#39;. I hope that I will speak the truth about that catch cry and that honourable members will listen to it. It will be their decision, their choice, whether they are prepared to live with it. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> in speaking in this debate earlier this afternoon talked about one vote one value and mentioned the United States as being an example of where that catch cry is practised. I refer him to the record. It is clearly stated in a hand book from Congress in the Umted States of America that the state of South Dakota has an electorate population of 333,000. New York has an electorate population of 468,000. It is 40 per cent larger. The United States also recognises that there are States which cannot adequately be represented under the normal system. They are called &#39;at large&#39; States. The variance between those at large States is interesting. In Alaska, for example, the electorate population is 302,173. The District of Columbia has a total electorate population of 756,510 electors. That is more than 100 per cent variation. At that stage this afternoon I was forced to withdraw the remark I passed about the Leader of the Opposition, that he was lying. </para>
          <para>The principle of one vote one value in this country must be considered at a Federal level. When we consider these points in the debate it is necessary that the truth is told. Let me take as examples the States of New South Wales and Tasmania. People should be aware that the population of New South Wales is 4,800,000 and the population of Tasmania is 402,804. There are 43 divisions in New South Wales and 5 divisions in Tasmania. There are 3,059,402 electors in New South Wales and 262,009 electors in Tasmania. In New South Wales the quota for a Federal electorate is 71,149 and the quota in Tasmania is 52,402. It seems to me at the outset from looking at the quotas that there is a discrepancy in the principle of one vote one value. The honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> had the temerity to suggest that this situation was written into the Constitution. </para>
          <para>Let us look at more of the figures to see exactly how the situation works agamst people in the more populous States- I have taken New South Wales as an example-and how it works to the tremendous disadvantage of people living in country areas. There are ten senators from New South Wales and ten senators from Tasmania. In the State Parliament in New South Wales there are 99 representatives in the lower House and 60 in the upper House. In Tasmania there are 35 in the lower House and 19 in the upper House. I want to come now to the revenue sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States under the federalism arrangements which have ensured that the States have been given the greatest amounts of money in the history of Federation. This year New South Wales received $ 1,327.4m and Tasmania received $2 14.6m. In local government tax sharing New South Wales received $60.3m and Tasmania received $5.3m. I mention at this stage that the Minister for Health in the New South Wales State Government has more money in his portfolio than there is in the total budget in the State of Tasmania. For that total budget in the State of Tasmania there are 54 members of Parliament administering less money than the Minister for Health in New South Wales administers. </para>
          <para>In Tasmania there is a total area of 68,331 square kilometres. In the Riverina, the electorate which I am to continue to represent, there is an area of 251,777 square kilometres, Four Tasmanias, in area, would fit comfortably into the seat of Riverina. In that area in Tasmania there is a total of 69 State and Federal representatives. The figures are quite frightening. The ratio of the total number of State and Federal members to the number of people in Tasmania is one to 5,800. So every 5,800 people in Tasmania have a State or Federal member of parliament. In New South Wales the figure is one member for every 22,000 people. </para>

              <para>- That is called &#39;one vote one value&#39;. It is interesting to speculate on why both major parties accept this situation. It must be very obvious to anyone who thinks about the matter even in a shallow way. In terms of Federal representation, if one wants to put it on that level, Tasmanians have a Federal member of the House of Representatives, or senator, for every 24,000 people. In New South Wales the ratio is one for every 60,000. So much for one vote, one value. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Why does this situation remain and why have the two major parties done nothing about it? That is where the truth must come out. It is reasonable to suggest that if one can convince 262,000 voters one can win 10 seats in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives. Let me go on record as saying that that is why nothing has been done about the Tasmanian situationalthough I am not suggesting for one moment that Tasmanians deserve any less representation than does anyone else. What I am suggesting is that the two major parties have not the political courage to recognise that the other States need more representation, that those who are suffering as a result are the people who live in country areas. </para>
          <para>We heard the honourable member for KingsfordSmith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> say tonight that, as a result of this proposal, five miles would separate parts of his electorate. That is the most incredible statement I have heard in a debate of this nature. He went on to say that there was a lack of community of interest, in that those 5 miles brought in a new suburb. I suggest that the honourable member come to some of the larger electorates, come to my electorate. He would find not just two or three schools but in excess of 200, and that a distance of 5 miles would be considered a normal walking distance; that one would be lucky in most cases if there were even a road. It is impossible seriously to come into this House and suggest that what is now apparent to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has not in fact been apparent for a long time to everyone in the country areas. The country people will be disfranchised, will lose their representation. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that the Premier of New South Wales proposes to re-arrange the seats in the Upper House of that State, reducing their number from 60 to 45 and that most of that loss will be felt in the country areas. This is a ridiculous situation. We stand here and argue small political points because we have not the courage to consider what representation should be all about. </para>
          <para>The time lost in travelling through a country electorate cannot be regained by giving a member an aeroplane or any other form of rapid communication. In this new seat of Riverina, as any honourable member from a large electorate would know, time spent in travelling is time completely wasted. One cannot represent voters adequately when one spends up to 30 weeks of working time behind the wheel of a car or sitting in an aircraft That inadequacy must be redressed by extending a degree of tolerance, and we have asked that a tolerance of 20 per cent, for what it does, be accepted. It is not a political move, such as we have seen on the part of Labor supporters to win votes through a variation in the boundaries of electorates. It is designed merely to provide representation to those who live outside major capital cities. However, it is quite apparent that the two principal political parties do not intend to agree to it. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter)</inline> has not spoken in this debate. In my opinion he has not done so because he believes in the principle that he must get big or he will be put out. That is not a good enough reason to enable one to speak adequately on behalf of country people. I do not believe that in this chamber we should suggest that the philosophy or policy of a party is all that is required to get a member in this House; that any member from any seat comes in here purely to be a number, and participate in votes. Unfortunately, there are many honourable members sitting on both sides of the House now who are no more than just numbers when divisions are called. What people have to say on issues is what representation is really about. What chance has a member in a country electorate spread over hundreds of thousands of square kilometres to be able to get the idea, the consensus, of what his people want put in this chamber. Surely that is what representation is all about I was appalled tonight when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> got off this subject while speaking and tried, for cheap political motives, to attract the Aboriginal vote in Kalgoorlie. Then he switched to the Maltese and Cypriot vote. He is very clever at trying to arrange the vote of the minority groups in this country but he misses the main point. He did this before the 1975 election quite adequately when he was seen once with the Vietnamese orphans. He was never seen with them again. Recently he took his grandson to see the Australian cricketers, purely to get votes. </para>

            <para>-In answer to some of the points made by the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sullivan)</inline> one must point out that the relationship of the Tasmanian membership of this Parliament to the actual total number is established in the Constitution. If the honourable member would give us a guarantee that he would work for an amendment of the Constitution and change it in some way, it would be helpful but he has not done that Let me say that I am sympathetic to some of the points made by the honourable member about representative government. I am a firm believer in representative government and on the whole, after 22 years in this Parliament and a long time in public life, I am prepared to support the view that in most instances there should be more members rather than less. The representatives of the people must face up directly to the great forces which direct the community, the media, the great and powerful commercial and industrial institutions and so on. I am with the honourable member in that regard. I think there should be greater accessibility but the facts of life as we face them here today are conditioned by the failure of the people pf Australia in 1967 to amend the Constitution with regard to the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives so far as numbers go. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not blame the honourable member for Riverina or the National Country Party because all the major parties campaigned for it. The Democratic Labor Party campaigned against us and defeated us, to out shame. My own view is that we should amend the Constitution in some way or other. I have canvassed all the members of this Parliament several times. I know that a lot of people in this Parliament are on my side about the matter but nothing happens. The honourable member for Riverina talked about people coming here and being independent, individuals, their own men. Ever since this recent distribution was announced and it was realised that they were going to lose seats, National Country Party members nave been weeping away silently in the corners of Parliament and everywhere else about it, but they have fronted up here today behind the Liberal Party because they are just plain satellites. If they were dinkum parliamentarians they would have stood up long ago and taken steps to change this situation. Whilst I sympathise with those members who have been disadvantaged by this redistribution, I think it is totally ridiculous that the number of members of the House of Representatives is related to the Senate. I have done my best as an individual to change this by encouraging members to do something about it but they have not done so. They are the puppets of the Prime Minister of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> They have turned this institution into his private parliament. The election date, 10 December, is the finest example of this. Dozens of honourable members on the other side are going like lambs to the slaughter. They are the sort of people who, if one saw them at the French Revolution being taken in the tumbrils to the guillotine and a wheel came off, would get out and help the executioner put it back on. That is why they are in a fix. </para>
          <para>What is the practical problem? I believe it is possible to draw up the electoral boundaries so that on the day they are drawn they contain almost equal numbers of electors, I believe that perhaps we should redraw the electoral boundaries after every election at some fixed time before the next election. I believe that we ought to establish a relationship between the number of members of this House and the actual population or the voting population. My suggestion was that we should hold a simple constitutional referendum to provide that there should be one member of the House of Representatives for every 100,000 people. We could resolve the problem with the Northern Territory and so on by relating the membership to the number of people in the smallest electorate. I do not see any practical problem with that. </para>
          <para>I raise a matter that relates to my electorate. I represent one of the industrial areas of Australia. It is a small, highly congested electorate of 1 1 square miles or, I think, 30 square kilometres. It is not the smallest electorate but it is one of the  smallest. </para>

              <para>- I do not mind having a lot of Tasmanians coming here. In the last Parliament we had a very fine group of them. The situation has deteriorated a good deal, but that will change on 10 December. Whilst this redistribution is better than most, there is less differential between city seats and country seats than there used to be. I have no sympathy whatsoever for the view that we ought to have a differential that is related to distances or anything else because in this Parliament we make the decisions for the nation in the votes on the floor of the House and the numbers in Australian politics are so finely balanced that when one changes the numbers one changes the vote here. I will give some examples. </para>

          <para>According to a schedule I have in front of me, the electorate of Wills has 73,995 voters. But the electorate has been substantially enlarged. The only other figures I have are the census figures of those actually over 18 years of age. These figures were given to me a while back. In the present electorate- the one I am representing tonightthere are 58,000 people on the electoral roll. The Government Whip is making signs to me to finish off. If he gives me three more minutes I will wind it up and the Government will have to resign, as it is doing. Over 58,000 voters over 18 years of age are now registered for the electorate. There are actually 78,000 people over 18 years of age in the electorate. I should think that about 15,000 of the additional 20,000 people would be non-naturalised people who arein the process of being naturalised. I can foresee that, before many months have passed, the electorate of Wills will be well over the quota. </para>
          <para>On the general question of the difficulty of representation, my friends from the country areas will be well aware that I have travelled throughout this country as much as most of them and I recognise some of their difficulties. I was born in the Western Districts of Victoria. But we represent people. As I have said, my electorate is one of the most congested in this country. It is also one of the most complex. It has one of Australia &#39;s greatest concentrations of migrants. </para>

          <para>- I believe that the redistribution proposal for Western Australia is, to begin with, totally unfair to the National Country Party which in that State gets sufficient votes to merit its having one seat. The drawing of the boundaries in that State has meant that a significant rural seat which could have been designed on a community of interest basis is now lost to that Party. The redistribution in the metropolitan areas is what I might call the philosophy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> which is how to immobilise the Labor vote by confining it to a very few super-safe areas while at the same time ehminating the National Country Party. I do not suggest that the commissioners accepted the philosophy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> but the redistribution almost makes it appear as if they did. I believe the redistribution is very unfair. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> complaining about the redistribution which took place when the Australian Labor Party Government was in office. When the votes in Western Australia split 50-50 the seats went 50-50. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is a clear calculation of the Liberal Party that no matter what happens it will get eight out of ten seats, on 45 per cent of the votes. I think that is the way the redistribution works. I believe it is not a good redistribution either in terms of reflecting the will of the electorate of Western Australia or of taking into account community of interest. Therefore, I believe the motion should be defeated. </para>

That debate was gagged. I objected very strongly to the gag and opposed it. Since then we have been putting through these distributions State by State. It was my understanding that once we had completed a cognate debate there was no further discussion on it when it came to putting the individual questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> you allowed the honourable member for Fremantle to speak to the issue of redistribution of electoral divisions in Western Australia. Why was he permitted to do that when, in actual fact, you are now ruling that we cannot speak to the previous vote that was taken for Victoria?

          <para>-In spite of the assistance that I am getting from many honourable members, the answer to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Wimmera is that in a strict sense, of course, a cognate debate is an arrangement of the House which assists debate on legislation when there is a basic principle involved in the subject matters of the legislation before the House. When a cognate debate is held and the individual questions are put, there is always an opportunity for honourable members to comment on the individual questions. Normally that does not happen because honourable members have said what they desire to say during the cognate debate. The reason that the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Corio spoke about the Western Australian situation at this point of time is that the motion before the House deals with the redistribution in Western Australia. The redistribution for Victoria, South Australia and other States have been agreed to by the House. Therefore, the debate on those States is completed. The matter of the gagging of the cognate debate is not within the province of the Chair, except that the chair must put the question. The motion before the House concerns the redistribution in Western Australia. </para>

          <para>- I should like to challenge what the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Beazley)</inline> has said in relation to the distribution in Western Australia. I am not certain exactly what way he would have had the boundaries drawn to preserve this so-called community of interests, particularly bearing in mind that the existing boundaries were also a requirement that the commissioners ought to take into consideration. The story that has been put around by the Labor Party in Western Australia is that Canning and Moore were rural seats and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate for suburbs such as Lockbridge to be included within them. I suggest that the dormitory suburbs that are to be included in Canning and Moore are not very different from those that are already within them. In any case, either before or after the redistribution, only about 20 per cent of the people in those electorates have any direct connection with the land. </para>

            <para>-A simple motion would be that the House vary the motion already agreed to in respect of the redistribution in New South Wales to change the name of the division of Grayndler to Lang. It might be best if a motion in simple terms such as that were moved. The House is the master of its own business and a motion such as that put to the House and agreed to or defeated could finalise the matter. </para>

              <para>- I point out to the honourable member for Holt that we have not yet had a division. That is what the Opposition is trying to achieve so that it can have its proposal recorded. As I have pointed out on many occasions, the House is the master of its own business. The House, acting within the Standing Orders on a reasonable basis, can decide its own business.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I raise a point of order. I think that a most serious event as occurred. I believe that a wrongful ruling has been given which should not be allowed to be a precedent. I draw your attention, firstly, to Standing Order 170, which provides that a vote may be rescinded only if seven days notice is given. That Standing Order can be suspended as provided for by Standing Order 399. Standing Order 399 requires that a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders must be carried by an absolute majority. The fact that no voice was raised against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders moved earlier tonight does not establish that it was carried by an absolute majority. There might have been only 10 or 20 honourable members in the House at the time the question was put. The ruling that has been given is substantially wrong and is a very dangerous precedent. I take this opportunity to draw your attention to it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> lest it be followed in the future. It is a wrongful ruling and a most dangerous one. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)There</inline>was no dissenting voice when I put the question that the Standing Orders be suspended to allow the recommittal of a motion that had already been passed by the House. To save time in having the matter recommitted, the House agreed to a particular action being taken. The honourable member for Mackellar can shake his head as much as he likes, but they are the facts. The motion was put in the knowledge that it had to be passed with an absolute majority. When it was put, no one objected to the decision that was made. The number of honourable members who were here, the vote that had been cast previously and the vote that was cast afterwards make it obvious that there was an absolute majority on that occasion. In the circumstances, no ruling was given. It was accepted by the House that the matter should be handled in that way. I have already said, and I repeat, that the House is the master of its own business. The Chair does not dictate; it only guides. If any member of the House or sufficient members to fulfil the requirements of the Standing Orders had moved any motion in. regard to the action that was being taken, then the House itself could have made the judgment. In my opinion the House made that judgment. The Leader of the House explained the situation in regard to the matter of time, which is of some importance. That is the position at this moment. I call the Leader of the House, on a point of order. </para>

              <para>-May I point out that the vote on the last division was 45 ayes and 29 noes. Part of the substance of the point of order raised by the honourable member for Mackellar was that there might well have been less than an absolute majority in the House at the time the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was put. In fact the numbers 45 and 29 amount to 74, which is more than an absolute majority of this House. There was no dissenting voice. I would suggest that in those circumstances the matter was entirely in order and therefore we should proceed to our next item of business. </para>

            <para>- This legislation is designed to increase the salary of the Governor-General-elect or, it might be better to say, the occupant of the office of Governor-General in future to the sum of $37,000. I think it is important to look at the office of Governor-General in relation to the Constitution. It is significant that the Constitution itself, as far back as the original Bill of 1900 did provide for a salary; but it took some 74 years before that salary was adjusted, and it is being adjusted again now within a space of three years. I think it is also worth mentioning that a salary of $37,000 as proposed is in no way related to the expenses of the holder of the office. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) reveals that the cost of the office in toto for what one would call day to day expenses is $500,000. In addition, there are the very substantial costs associated with transport, furnishings and the like. What the Opposition is emphasising is that in no way will the salary be spent by the occupant of the office. It is a net gain; it is non-taxable and there is no question of his having to spend any part of it. </para>

          <para>The principles that were announced at the time when this matter was last before the House one would hope would still apply. But we must look at the matter in the light of what is happening in Australia today, on a constitutional basis. The Opposition is firmly of the view that the people of Australia should judge very quickly whether they are prepared to accept the Constitution as it now exists or whether there should be a new Constitution. In the course of that judgment it could well be appropriate for them to decide that they do not need the office of GovernorGeneral. Accordingly, what we are saying from the Oppositions &#39;s point of view is this: It is inappropriate for this Parliament, particularly in its dying stages, to be suggesting a salary which is in no way related to the cost of the office. To suggest it now could bind a subsequent Parliament, and indeed it would do so. It is more important to submit to the Australian people a convention as to the type of Constitution they may want. In the course of asking people to determine this matter we would be submitting that there is no need for the office of Governor-General. In modern democracies we can run democracy with the people and the government elected by the people. They are the two factors. Such a situation applies in Great Britain at present. There is no impediment to the powers of the Parliament in Great Britain. Those powers are not interfered with in any way by the Monarch. Unfortunately, in Australia the rules of the Constitution allow for an intrusion. That appears to be the situation. Any intrusion into the people&#39;s rights means that the democratic principles are not sustained. </para>
          <para>There has been a lot of argument about this matter for some time. The sustaining of the democratic principles has been on the basis that the occupant of the office has always acceded to the wishes of a Prime Minister. To that extent the onus is on the Prime Minister. That has not happened in recent years although it happened again last evening. The fact that the Prime Minister might have given wrong advice in no way detracts from the democratic principles that he has to be answerable for that advice. We are saying that the constitutional conventions in Australia at present are not in our opinion representative of the wishes of the people. It will be announced in the forthcoming election campaignit is most important- that we want to encourage a people&#39;s convention, which would be held we think in 1978 or 1979, to determine a new constitution for Australia. We would be putting forcibly to the people at that time that there is no need for a position such as that of GovernorGeneral. In other words, we can pass laws in this Parliament and have them certified without having any other so-called higher authority to suggest that perhaps they should not be passed. </para>
          <para>One can see the problems we have in Australia at present when one looks at the Constitution and sees in it provisions, for example, that a law can be withheld for the Monarch&#39;s consent. One can see how ridiculous it would be if the law was the Appropriation Bills. It means that the Monarch could disallow that law at any time within 12 months. It would bring Austraha to a standstill if we passed Appropriation Bills and, 1 1 months after we had approved of the Budget allocations, the legislation was disallowed by the Queen. That is the present situation. The Constitution also provides that the office of GovernorGeneral can intrude and suggest amendments to any Bill. It is a very important office. It relates to the future of democracy in this country. Every time a decision is made on a personal basis or deemed to be the prerogative of the occupant it is in our view an interference with the normal democratic rights that should prevail in any democracy. Austraha should have the same rights, powers and privileges as now apply in the United Kingdom. They do not apply here. </para>
          <para>We cannot continue to sustain the present position. It is a severe negation of a democratic constitution for Australia. If we have powers outside the powers of the Parliament it reduces our Constitution to an absurdity as it is at present. We are mindful of the fact that while we need some form of knowledge that the Executive of a government can rule, we do not need anybody else to support the decisions of that Executive. We need a Parliament to evidence the type of legislation that has, in fact, been passed. We can readily establish to the courts of the land that any law passed has been properly passed when it has been assented to by the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and the  President  of the Senate. We need no other evidence of that fact. We can reduce the Constitution as it now applies to a modern concept in which every aspect of democracy is put to the people and they agree on it. They control it. The Parliament is theirs and the Government is beholden to them. We would not have any other force indicating that there are some divine rights or a higher authority that can in any way interfere with the workings of a parliament or the life of a government. Unfortunately, that has not been the situation in the last few years. </para>
          <para>Speeches have been made outside this nation indicating that the occupant of the office might well exercise a discretion that would be against the advice of the Executive. We do not agree with that. We are also rnindful of other expressions being made overseas as to what sort of tariff barriers we might apply. We do not think those expressions should be made by an occupant of that office. What we are saying is that this legislation provides the Australian people with an excellent opportunity to have a look not only at this office but also at every aspect of democratic government in Australia. What better way is there to allow democracy to prevail than to organise conventions of the Australian people and to submit to them a set of rules for their approval, for their negation or for their variation? If they wish to retain an occupant of that office they may do so, but it is not good enough in modern times just to go along with the old established position and to say that it will not be changed and that we will continue to add on to a monetary figure which is just deemed to be money in the bank. </para>
          <para>People all over Australia are meeting and wanting to know when they will be able to take part in conventions to determine what sort of constitution they ought to have. In our view, if a solid case is made out on a democratic principle there is no justification at all for an occupant of this office to exercise any powers relating to this Parliament. In other words, governments can fail without anybody sacking them. They would fail in this Parliament. They would fail perhaps because of refusals of Supply. That is not a normal democratic process. It does not require anybody else to say in a particularly bad moment: &#39;I wish to dismiss the Cabinet or the Prime Minister&#39;. As honourable members know, our Constitution makes no provision for Cabinets and Prime Ministers. It is very defective in regard to the operations that should prevail. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is opposing this legislation in regard to the office, not in regard to a personality. We see no need to retain this office as it is now occupied, because the occupant can interfere with the rights of a Parliament or the tenure of a government and can decide whether Ministers can continue to hold office. Any intrusion or action is a denial of democratic rights. Because of those matters we are saying that we do not approve of this legislation. We oppose it and make the point that it can be reviewed at a later date. No personal hardship to the new incumbent would be involved when one realises that there are no expenses to be paid out of that salary. We are also mindful of the fact that one of the principles announced in 1974 was that the occupant would make no financial gain from the office that he or she held. We notice at the moment that somebody is talking about issuing at least three volumes of memoirs which will be sold commercially. We are aware of these matters but we do not think the office should have been accepted by the occupant on that basis. We make that very clear. </para>
          <para>At the present time in this country we are striving desperately to establish a national identity. A lot of irrelevant actions are being perpetrated on the basis that there is a need for intervention by someone such as a Governor-General. At the present time we have a very large number of people of different ethnic backgrounds coming to this country. Those migrants are interested in seeking a new identity. It is against Australia&#39;s interests to be harking back to the colonial days when we were deemed to be subservient to some other government well away from us here. We are still in the ridiculous situation whereby the British Parliament could rescind our Constitution tomorrow and we could do nothing about it. For those reasons it is very urgent and essential that the Australian people address their minds to the need for a new constitution. It has to be drastically altered. The people alone should have the capacity to do that and it should be subject to their consent and approval. </para>
          <para>If one looks at modern-day democracies such as Sweden, Japan or Switzerland one can find plenty of examples of where there is no outside intervention. Even Britain, with an unwritten constitution, has been able to reach that position by continually reducing the powers of the monarch. If an attempt had been made in Great Britain to exercise powers such as have been exercised here in recent years the British Parliament would have passed such further laws as would have even prevented the Monarch from remaining on the throne, or would have interfered with the rights of succession. We have no such powers here. What we want is a system that is democratic and workable, that is beholden only to the people of Australia. It is for them that we seek such a new system, because democracy in Australia is about those two fundamental issues, government and people. No third party should be involved. Accordingly, we oppose the Bill, reiterating that it has nothing to do with the running or day to day expenses of the office. If honourable members will refer to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) at page 104, they will find that the resent provision made for those expenses is 1.5m, so there need be no reduction in the Governor-General&#39;s standard of living. I might add that at the forthcoming election the Australian Labor Party will be proposing a people&#39;s convention to draw a new Constitution. We oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>-This legislation is not complex. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> has indicated that his Party will oppose it for particular reasons. The Government obviously will ensure that it passes. It is a fact of history that the salary paid to a Governor-General is not increased during the period for which he is in office. Therefore, the only opportunity presented to a government to ensure that more reasonable remuneration is paid is when a change of office holder is being contemplated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to pay my respects to a man who has, I believe, fulfilled his office with a great degree of responsibility. The present Governor-General is one who has understood the importance of the Australian Constitution, something that cannot be said for a great many members of the Labor Party in this country and this Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Constitution which we in Australia have accepted over a period of 76 years involves the Queen, her representative in Australia, the Senate and the House of Representatives in legislative acts on behalf of the people generally. The present Governor-General protected that Constitution and, as a result, was subjected to more derision than probably any other individual has suffered in the history of this country. Millions of citizens will never forget the actions of the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> and his colleagues, and in particular the statement in which he called upon his supporters to maintain their rage and express it against the GovernorGeneral, who had acted so responsibly and courageously in the interests of the country. The Governor-General had exercised great judgment in an extremely difficult situation, one which had been exacerbated by a Prime Minister prepared to ride roughshod over a Constitution that had been accorded due respect for 76 years. The Governor-General had ensured a continuation of parliamentary democracy.  His  action was vindicated in the subsequent election by an overwhelming majority of Australians, and that support spoke for itself. </para>
          <para>I respect the right of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, and of other Australians, to promote discussion on the form the Australian Constitution might take in future years. It is worth mentioning that the Governor-General has himself encouraged discussion of the role of his office and its relationship to the Constitution. All I would like to say at this stage about that proposition is that if we ever accept and adopt another Constitution in this nation, I hope sincerely that that Constitution will provide a similar system of checks and balance to control the likes of Prime Minister Whitlam who may foist themselves upon parliaments and the people of Australia at some future date. The experience of October and November 1975 is, I believe, burned into the minds of Australians, and rightly so. The fact is that a Prime Minister, who is supposed to hold a responsible position on behalf of Australians, who takes an oath of office, who sits in this Parliament on behalf of Australians, was prepared to reject the Constitution, to ride roughshod over that Constitution for his own short term political gains. </para>
          <para>We have in Australia a system which provides for a Parliament to operate. The Senate has the same rights as the House of Representatives in all respects other than the amendment of financial Bills. The Senate has an equal right with the House of Representatives to reject a financial Bill. The Senate was rejecting a financial Bill. The Senate has the authority to reject a financial Bill if it so chooses. The fact that a Prime Minister was prepared not to accept the situation which is in the Constitution, and was prepared to exercise every means that he could find available to him to govern without Supply, to find any situation to perpetuate his own time in office, proves that the Constitution of Australia is still a very workable document for all Australians. There were checks and balances within that system which the Governor-General had the courage to exercise. As a result of that we have a maintenance of parliamentary democracy in this country. All Australians owe the Governor-General a great debt for that It is almost impossible to contemplate the system that might be operating in Australia today, late in 1977, had there not been that restraint exercised over Prime Minister Whitlam in November 1975. All Australians will remember, and if a new Constitution is ever being contemplated, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> and others, I would hope sincerely that similar checks and balances will operate in that Constitution, as operate in the present Constitution. The lessons of October and November 1975, when a Prime Minister was prepared to flout the Constitution and throw the Constitution out the window for his own ends must never be allowed to happen again in this country. I am not concerned with the arguments that are being put forward by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. I am concerned with the role that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr played in preserving the Australian Constitution as it exists now and as it existed in late 1 975. The GovernorGeneral acted courageously and responsibly in an intensely difficult situation and deserves, and </para>
          <para class="block">I believe has, the respect of responsible Australians. On my own behalf, on behalf of the National Country Party and, I am sure, on behalf of the entire Government and most Australians, certainly responsible Australians, I want to place on record our appreciation of a great Australian. </para>

          <para class="block">Justice Fox. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox is of eminent background and well fitted to carry out those tasks.

All his rights and privileges will be maintained should he return to his office as a judge of the court in the Australian Capital Territory. We support the Bill to that extent. </para>
          <para>One point that I think is worthy of comment is that  His  Honour is a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, which is a very busy court. It is thought that the Territory should have at least four judges. At persent only one judge is available to carry out the enormous work load that now exists in the Australian Capital Territory.  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Connor is likely to have a breakdown, in our opinion, unless he gets some help.  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Blackburn has a year&#39;s leave due to him, and he is taking that leave. We would have thought that the Government would have been aware of the acute problem that exists in the Australian Capital Territory. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> would be entitled to do something about this matter, but there is a convention that judges are not appointed once dissolution of Parliament has been announced. Accordingly, nothing can be done by way of intermediary relief until after the writs are returned following the election. It is a disappointment to the people in the Australian Capital Territory to think that this matter was not considered on that basis when the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox was announced.

          <para>Parliamentarians are in the throes of preparing themselves for an election on 10 December next. Despite the ovemhehning amount of money that is anticipated will be spent by the opponents of Labor, the Labor Party feels that it will win the confidence of the people of Austraha which will enable it to take over the treasury bench of the nation after that election. I point out one of the great difficulties that the Labor Party has to surmount. The <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> of 17 October last set out on page 28 the amount of money spent by the Liberal and National Country Parties on television and radio advertising during the 1975 elections. The Labor Party was able to spend only $808,442 which enabled it to purchase 249 hours of time on radio and television. The Liberal and National Country Parties spent $ 1 ,2 1 9,7 1 3 and occupied 4 1 4 hours on radio and television. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the same newspaper the broadcasting times allocated by 13 television stations throughout the nation are listed. In my view, a very unfair allocation of television time to the major political parties- that is the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country parties- is shown. Television station TCN and other stations in Sydney broadcast the speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> between 7.15 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. The latest time at which the Prime Minister&#39;s speech was broadcast was 8.30 p.m. The times allocated to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> by some of these television stations were 1 1 p.m., 1 1.58 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. Television stations CBN and CWN Orange and MTN Griffith did not show the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s speech. At Newcastle his speech was broadcast at 9.30 p.m. It was not shown by WIN Wollongong. Television station AMV Albury broadcast the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s speech at 10.10 p.m. The Rockhampton and Maryborough stations did not show it. At Tamworth and Lismore the time was 10.30 p.m. and at Wagga Wagga it was 10.2 p.m. </para>
        <para>All my adult life I have respected to some degree but hated the power of money. My party advisers inform me that in the Hunter electorate, which is one of the truest Labor electorates in Austraha and which is the electorate that I have the honour to represent, the National Country Party of Australia spent $5,000 during the 1975 election campaign. It is an electorate which that Party could not even hope to win, because of the loyalty of my constituents to the true principles of Labor. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Chifley says: &#39;A good member&#39;. That is a matter for the people to decide. My party, the Labor Party, spent only $1,400. Despite the avalanche of money which swept into the Hunter electorate, the National Country Party was able to persuade only 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent of my voters to change their allegiance from the Labor Party. Many of those electors have regretted their switch during the term of the Fraser Government. </para>

        <para>I know that it would be impossible to convince the National Country Party of this, but many people in my electorate believe that the National Country Party should make a contribution of the amount or half the amount it spent last time and the Labor Party should make a contribution of the amount it spent, if there were no contest, and that the money should be donated to some worthwhile organisation such as the Boy Scouts movement which is in dire financial straits in my electorate. That organisation plays an important part in the formation of the characters of our future citizens. In the little town of Aberdare outside Cessnock the Scout hall recently was burnt down. Dedicated citizens with a great love for character building are trying to raise sufficient money to rebuild - </para>

          <para>- I wish to raise three separate matters tonight, each briefly. The first relates to the publication called <inline font-style="italic">Detours</inline> which has been put out by Qantas Airways Ltd as a free aid to young people in relation to travel. It has come under notice and has been criticised by various churchmen. I have started to receive letters about this publication from concerned constituents. When it is perused it is found to contain references which I do not wish to go into in detail in the House, for obvious reasons. There are references to sexual matters and to drugs. I admit that those references appear to be only small portions of the publication, but they have caused real concern to persons who worry about the values of our community. They want to know why a government instrumentality is expending money on these matters. I have taken up the matter personally with the Minister for Transport and discussed it with him. I am advised that the Minister has called for a careful investigation. I hope that a proper and reasonable solution can be obtained so that offensive matter will not appear in these types of publications in future. I am quite sure that if other airlines sought to put some of this material into booklets that were circulated in Australia there would be even more comment about the matter. The second point I want to raise - </para>

            <para>- The second matter I wish to raise is a separate matter. It relates to the incredible announcement yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> that if he is returned to office- a wild delusion that could happen only by some outrageous mischance- the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> would probably be the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence. I point out to the House the near impossibility of any one man handling those two heavy portfolios. It shows the totally unrealistic attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and the totally unrealistic attitude of the honourable member for Oxley. The ministry of defence now consists of parts of three or four departments. It was conglomerated some years ago. It is a massive job. It nearly broke the back of a respected former Defence Minister who is now an ambassador overseas. It is a very heavy </para>

        <para class="block">Siortfolio and it is a tribute to the present Minister or Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> that he has handled it so well. </para>
        <para>The ministry of Foreign Affairs requires that Minister to be out of the country for lengthy periods. How any Minister could combine the two portfolios, I really cannot imagine. One recalls the problems that the Leader of the Opposition had when he was Prime Minister and also Minister for Foreign Affairs. He totally neglected the economy with disastrous results for Australia. If any Minister should become the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence there would be disastrous results for this country. </para>
        <para>The final matter with which I deal is entirely personal. I want to pay a tribute to a person I have known for a few years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gordon</inline> Albert Kelso, who is a good, solid Labor man and who would support tie Labor Party. This week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelso</inline> will celebrate his fiftieth year as a newsvendor at the corner of King and Elizabeth Streets in Sydney. I went to law school with his son. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelso</inline> is an admirable man. He served in the Second World War, his only break from his job as newsvendor. He started there as a boy and eventually he bought the franchise in the 1950s. He is a fifth generation Australian of direct male line. In fact, his brother was a former Australian and British Empire lightweight boxing champion and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelso</inline> used to be his second. I want to pay a small tribute to this gentleman who has seen a passing parade of many famous identities in Sydney. </para>

          <para>- I rise tonight to deal with the question of pressures that have been brought to bear on both the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> and the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and, of course, their two departments, to allow the airport at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Nirimba</inline> to become a general purpose airport. Of course, this pressure has been coming from aero clubs and the like for some considerable time. The position as I understand it is that whilst it was receiving some encouragement from the Department of Transport the proposal was strongly opposed by the Department of Defence on defence grounds because HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Nirimba</inline> is, of course, a defence establishment. But this has not deterred the aero clubs from pursuing their cause. I was very perturbed to read a letter I received only this week when I came back to Canberra from the Schofields Flying Club Ltd inviting me to be among the official guests at the Schofields Silver Jubilee air show to be held as an official part of the Silver Jubilee commemorative celebrations at Schofields aerodrome- that is the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Nirimba</inline> defence establishmenton the weekend of 12 and 13 November 1977. What shocked me most of all was this unity ticket. The letter states: </para>

          <para>The Minister for Defence, the Rt Hon. D. J.

          <para>The Air Show has been likened to a &#39;mini-Farnborough&#39; or &#39;mini-Oshkosh&#39;. Although mainly oriented towards light and general aviation, emphasis is also being given to all other facets of aviation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, there is or there would appear to be a unity ticket between the two Ministers with the object of converting to a general aviation airport this aerodrome at a defence establishment at which the movement of private planes has been very carefully kept down to a low level because of defence requirements. A high level of aircraft movements would interfere not only with the Schofields Aerodrome itself but also would interfere with air traffic at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Nirimba</inline> and also with movements from the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Richmond. As I have said, this letter appears to be undoubtedly a unity ticket between the two Ministers to allow the Schofields airport to be used for general aviation purposes or, in other words, to become another Bankstown Airport. This is a quite ludicrous situation. Schofields borders on Blacktown, Mt Druitt, Marayong, Riverston and Doonside. All of these areas have a high population density. Of course, we know that the aviation position at Bankstown is such that it is already dangerous to the general public. The situation would be compounded if a general purpose airport were established in the Schofields area. There would be greater danger to the general public. </para>
        <para>I have already sent urgent telegrams to both Ministers asking them to take action immediately to ensure that their acceptance of this invitation as co-patrons does not mean that this airport is to be used for general aviation purposes. </para>

          <para>- I want to raise tonight a serious problem affecting many constituents of the electorate of Macarthur whose land has been designated under the Macarthur growth centre proposals. I want to say at the outset that I have a great deal of respect for the capacity, hard work and integrity of the Macarthur Development Board and I regard what they are endeavouring to do in that area to be certainly visionary and I hope ultimately successful. However, there is a serious problem that has emerged as a result of the designation of a very large area of land to the south of Campbelltown which will not be used for many years to come. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As of this week it appears that Campbelltown and Appin, which are two sections of the growth centre, will no longer be in the Macarthur electorate. Nevertheless there are sections of Camden which remain in Macarthur and which will be affected by this growth centre. As a result I feel not only a specific responsibility for the people in the new Macarthur electorate but also for many of those in the old Macarthur electorate who are being disadvantaged so seriously by this situation. </para>
        <para>The fact is that in 1974 an Act was passed when the Australian Labor Party took the view that money grew on trees. It then started to chop the trees down. It took the view that anything could be achieved with money, including buying votes. Unfortunately the money ran out even under the Hayden Budget, with the result that the grandiose plans for purchasing with Federal money large tracts of land could not be proceeded with. Nevertheless the present Government last year provided $5m to buy designated land from people who were in distress. I thank the Government for the kindness it showed to those people at that time. In the current year the Federal Government offered $ 1 for every $2 provided by the State Government to finance the growth centre. That offer was rejected out of hand by the Wran Government for petty and, I would say, disgraceful political purposes. I hope that those people who are unable to sell their land will recognise the reason for it. The fact is that now there are many people who are tied into the ownership of that land and who are unable to sell it but who at the same time are obliged to pay very high council rates upon it. </para>
        <para>The people on the development board for the Macarthur growth centre are very concerned about the situation. They are endeavouring to establish appropriate ways of allowing people either to dispose of their land or to keep those small portions of their land which would be nondesignated. I commend the board for its endeavour. What concerns me greatly is the fact that the State Government has been crying poor and accusing the Federal Government on this matter. But at the same time it has been selling at undisclosed prices large tracts of industrial land in that area. As I understand it, that land has brought in very substantial amounts of revenue. That money has not been returned to the Macarthur growth centre; it has gone into the State coffers. It has gone into the State&#39;s Consolidated Revenue. At the same time, the State of New South Wales has been bleating to the Federal Government to provide more finance. That is basically dishonest. </para>
        <para>What is even more dishonest is the fact that the State Government refuses to reveal to the people of the area the price obtained for the land that has been sold to various industries, including the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd- I am overjoyed to see this happening- or the terms on which the land has been leased, if it has not been sold, because it appears to me that in order to attract people to this outstandingly good area the State has been prepared to enter mto deals which are non-commercial. As a result the people whose land has been proclaimed are not getting a fair deal because the Macarthur development board is not getting a decent return and as a result the money is not being paid out to the people who are in distress. It is disgraceful that those people should suffer as a result not of the </para>
        <para class="block">Federal Government&#39;s failure to offer funds- the funds it offered have been rejected by the Statebut of the State&#39;s secret deals with major industrialists, and as a result of the State not revealing the basic price and the basic returns which it is getting on that land. </para>

If he pleases, I ask him to shift his attention to the southern section of the continent and read some of the reports resulting from the Victorian land inquiry. If he does so he will see where the dishonesty and the corruption lies.  His  own fellow members of the Liberal Party are involved in diverting vast sums of money away from proper public utilisation, away from providing homes for those people who are needy and who do not have homes. </para>

        <para>I suspect that later this evening the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> will raise a matter relating to the Qantas Airways Ltd publication <inline font-style="italic">Detour.</inline> In his defence I should say that yesterday he raised this matter with me in my capacity, I took it at the time, as the shadow Minister for Transport. He asked me had I seen this publication <inline font-style="italic">Detour</inline> and I replied promptly that I had not. He said: &#39;I went to the trouble to ring <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt and congratulate him on the quality&#39;- 1 think that was the word, but it is near enough to it-&#39; and tell him that at last Qantas was getting with it and now is recognising a needy section of the market&#39;. I raise that in defence of the honourable member for Denison- I think what I have said is accurateand in rebuttal, on his behalf, of the remarks made earlier by the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil).</inline> I am sorry that there is such division amongst honourable members opposite on the very back bench but this is indicative of the general attitude of honourable members opposite towards successful publicly owned transport enterprises. Qantas Airways Ltd managed to make a profit last year. Its annual report has been deliberately delayed by the Treasury, no doubt because this can have an impact upon its liquidity position in the current year. That, I understand, is the position. </para>
        <para>There is criticism within the Government party room, at Young Liberal Council and State Liberal Council meetings about the successful operations of Trans-Australia Airlines. It seems to me that the Government party would rather have those successful publicly owned transport enterprises in the hands of foreign corporations and I wish they would stand up and declare their attitude clearly. The backbiting, the division and the argument that goes on among Government party members operates only to the detriment of fine, efficient, well-managed and successful Australian publicly owned transport enterprises. If they want to argue about something they should turn instead to the dirty land deals in Victoria. Let us see some honesty on the part of Liberal members opposite and let us put an end to the corruption. Quite clearly, from the reports coming forward from that inquiry, money has gone to the Liberal Party of Victoria in consideration of decisions made by members of the Government. That is where honourable members opposite ought to be directing their attention in order to achieve a much higher level of honesty so that the people we represent will get the services and facilities they pay for through their taxes in the various revenue forms that come to the Government. </para>
        <para>Last evening we heard the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)</inline> tell us that the cost of local telephone calls is to rise to 15 cents.

            <para>- I accept that ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I have not called the honourable member for Oxley an &#39;economic traitor&#39;, words which I withdrew on a previous occasion. I used the words &#39;economic subversion&#39;. I simply make the point that it seems inconceivable to me that any man who has been censured by this House in accordance with the words of that motion, which is indeed public property, could even be considered to be put in charge of the defence of this country. It might be an indication that, on this matter, the Leader of the Opposition has recognised the wisdom of the decision of the House of 4 October to censure the honourable member for Oxley. I suggest that there is a clear and demonstrable link between the Parliament&#39;s censure of the honourable member for Oxley and his removal from the post of economic spokesman for the Labor Party. Quite clearly in the forthcoming election campaign he cannot speak with any authority on economic matters, because his leader has publicly indicated that if Labor came to power the honourable member for Oxley would not be permitted to hold an economic post. </para>

          <para>- I raise a matter with which the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> who represents the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> might be able to deal. Recently a sheltered workshop was completed in my electorate, at the cost of $500,000. An application was made to the Government for assistance in the form of a grant to purchase equipment for that workshop. The letter which was received by the committee representing that workshop indicated that the Government was sorry but it would not consider providing an equipment grant for this completed sheltered workshop, which is urgently needed and which the Commonwealth agrees is needed, until after 30 June 1979. The Government will not allow the workshop even to be registered until that time. The workshop cannot spend the money which it has available now to buy equipment; otherwise it will become ineligible for subsidy at that time. I think it is a matter of considerable seriousness. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The workshop was completed. It was completed with assistance from grants through the State Government. The Commonwealth claims ignorance of the proposal. I am certain that the Commonwealth participated in that construction program. If the workshop is left to gather cobwebs between now and June 1979, 1 think it would be to the eternal disgrace of this Government or any other government. I ask the Minister whether he would take up this matter with his colleague because it is a matter of seriousness which promises to disadvantage people who could be employed in that sheltered workshop but who would have to sit around doing nothing for two years until the Department decides that it might register the workshop. </para>

            <para>The bulk of Australia&#39;s food aid is provided under the Food Aid Convention (FAC) of the International Wheat Agreement which commits Australia to supply a minimum of 225,000 tonnes of food grains per annum to developing countries. While small quantities of rice or coarse grains can be substituted for wheat or flour under the terms of the FAC, it is not possible to substitute non-grain foods such as meat, vegetable oils, milk powders and so on. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>It is generally acknowledged that grain foods, particularly wheat, are the most cost effective means of transferring nutrition to developing countries. The requests which Australia receives for food aid assistance reflect this realisation. On occasions, however, canned meat is requested by potential recipients, in which case Australia attempts to oblige by providing quantities consistent with current funding capacity, and provided we are satisfied as to the proposed usage. </para>
        <para>The Government recently decided to include non-grain foods regularly as part of the Australian aid program in future years. We expect this to provide some opportunities for greater utilisation of canned meat. Actual purchases will, however, be related to the requirements of specific nutritional impact projects Australia agrees to assist. </para>
        <para>There has been some success in shipping canned meat as part of Australia&#39;s commodity pledge to the World Food Program (WFP). Australia&#39;s ability to supply canned meat in quantity has been formally notified to the WFP for many years. The selection of commodities, however, is at WFP discretion. </para>
        <para>In this context it is somewhat unfortunate that after extensive representations to WFP, on a general plane, concerning the availability of canned meat from Australia, Australian producers were unable to fill a WFP order for 646 tonnes of canned pork. In fact 165 tonnes was all that could be supplied within the three months quotation period. </para>
        <para>The Government is keenly conscious of the position of beef producers and will seek to make use of Australian beef within the aid program as appropriate, bearing in mind constraints imposed by dietary preferences, shelf-life factors, cost disadvantages and, of course, funding limitations on the aid appropriations. </para>

The first grade is known as a standard, followed by recommended practices and by guidance material. The capability of a rescue and fire fighting service to be provided at an airport is not the subject of a ICAO standard. In determining the fire fighting capability to be established at an airport Australia generally follows ICAO recommended practices.

The services at Brisbane, Darwin and Perth only fall marginally short of some of the guidance material. At domestic airports the provision of water and foam capacity and the capacity to discharge this extinguishing material in accordance with the prescriptions of ICAO are recognised as the primary objective. These prescriptions were revised at the end of 1976 and maximum effort has been made to utilise existing fire appliances and improved foaming agents to meet these revised specifications wherever a service is provided. Meeting them in full depends on the purchase of new equipment Initial purchases are in progress. </para>

For domestic airports the general objective adopted has been to provide fire services to cover about 90 per cent of all users of regular public transport air services. Provision of a service at an airport handling 25,000 embarking/disembarking passengers per annum was judged to achieve this objective. Another guide taken in establishment of services was that, in order to maintain a minimum level of preparedness and efficiency in a fire service unit, there would need to be an aircraft activity of at least 2,800 regular public transport movements per annum or, where this level was not achieved, total aircraft movements in excess of 1 5,000 per annum. </para>

            <para>Sustenanace Allowance is payable, under regulation 71 of the Repatriation Regulations, in respect of any period during which a veteran is prevented from working through the necessities of treatment for an incapacity accepted as being service-related. It is also payable, under regulation 72, when a veteran cannot work because of medical investigation of a pension claim he has made or of disability for which he receives a pension. </para>
            <para>Sustenance Allowance takes the form of a payment which, together with any disability pension in payment, is equal to either the level of the 100 per cent General Rate pension or the Special (T. &#38; P.I.) Rate pension, as applicable. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>It is clearly important that, as part of its responsibility for administering the Handicapped Persons&#39; Assistance Act, my department should assess the capacities of sheltered workshops and ensure that they meet the requirements of the Act. </para>
            <para>The department is now finalising an analysis of returns from sheltered workshops which will help to identify requirements for upgrading services. Improved techniques for evaluating programs for handicapped persons are being developed by the department with the assistance of the Schonell Educational Research Centre of the University of Queensland. The department also works closely with the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled in promoting acceptable standards for sheltered workshops and is developing methods of improving the performance of workshops. </para>
            <para>However, restrictions on the types of work undertaken by sheltered workshops do not seem to me to be commensurate with the aims of the handicapped persons assistance program. Indeed I believe it would be undesirable to discourage initiative and self-development generated within the sheltered workshop movement, as this would operate to the detriment of handicapped people by reducing employment opportunities. </para>
            <para>As most production undertaken by sheltered workshops is on a contract or sub-contract basis, a high degree of selfregulation is inherent, since failure to meet specifications and time schedules militates against the future viability of the workshop. </para>
