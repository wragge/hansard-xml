            <para>- My difficulty is that I cannot table the advice because it was oral. The advice given in this matter was given in part by the Solicitor-General and in part, I understand, by the Crown Solicitor. I did not participate in the giving of that advice. The Solicitor-General went overseas recently and is now overseas. I have not been able to speak to him and therefore I am not able to confirm what advice he may have given. On the other hand, I can only assume that the advice he gave would have been consistent with the judgment. I have indicated already- I think I indicated it yesterday- that the purport of the judgment was not to find that Karen Green was entitled to unemployment benefits but to find that she was entitled to a declaration that the Director-General, in effect, had taken into account something which he should not have taken into account; or alternatively, that he should have taken into account matters which he had not taken into account. I think that is summed up in part of the judgment where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen said: </para>

          <para class="block">He went on to say that she was not entitled to all the relief. Under section 107 of the Social Services Act, the Director-General had to be satisfied as at 20 December last that Karen </para>
          <para class="block">Green had, amongst other things, taken reasonable steps to obtain work. </para>
          <para>One of the questions that arose for the Director-General s consideration in relation to this matter after the judgment was as to the facts that he should take into account. One approach would have been to say: 'I shall take into account such facts as I in fact knew on 20 December'. Another approach would have been to say: 'I will take into account all facts including those that I knew at 20 December and such other facts as may have been revealed, say, in the High Court proceedings. ' I am told by the Crown Solicitor that the advice he gave orally recently to the Director-General was that the Director-General should take into account all the facts as known to him on 20 December, the date of the application, or which became known to him subsequently that were relevant to the question of whether, as at 20 December 1976, Karen Green had in effect taken reasonable steps to obtain such work. </para>
          <para>I am further informed that the Director-General acted in accordance with that advice; that is to say, he gave consideration to all the facts and came to a decision based on those facts. That was the decision he published the other day. The precise decision, that is, the substance of the decision, was not something that was advised to him by the Crown Solicitor because that was a matter peculiarly for the Director-General. The Crown Solicitor only went so far as to say that if he were to give a decision which did go to the contrary, that is, that she was not entitled, it could be in the form of the document which in fact was published. One has to emphasise in relation to this matter that the decision related only to Karen Green and not to others. </para>

            <para>-I can confirm for the benefit of the honourable member and a number of other honourable members who are most interested in this very important reference that the Industries Assistance Commission has been asked to report on wheat stabilisation. A reference was sent to the Commission by me on 14 February 1977. The IAC is required to report by 14 May 1978. As yet, a division of the Commission has not been appointed but, as the honourable gentleman will be aware, that is a matter for the Commission itself to determine. However, the  Chairman  of the Commission has indicated a schedule of hearings in a circular which was sent out on 27 May. Hearings will commence in Melbourne on 1 August and conclude in Bribane on 25 August and will be held also in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney. Any witnesses and other interested persons who have not already done so should notify the Commission immediately of their interest in order that they will receive copies of circulars, etc. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should also point out that, due to the great importance of this inquiry by the IAC, the Commission has decided to issue a discussion paper early next month- I expect within a few dayswhich will greatly assist witnesses in preparing their submissions to the inquiry. I can only add that this is an extremely important inquiry so far as the rural area of Australia is concerned and urge all honourable senators who have a particular interest in it to encourage organisations and other interested parties to participate fully. </para>

It is true that India is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty but it is the desire of the United States to try to get as many countries as possible to become signatories and to abide by the rules laid down by that international organisation. Australia will be selling uranium only to those countries which are signatories to the NPT or which at present are classified as original weapon states. Under the NPT the 5 original weapon states are not necessarily signatories but they abide by the rules of the International </para>

Now that he and the Government accept what some of us have been saying for many years, namely, that in the long term Australia would benefit from a steady reduction in tariffs, will he now take the next step and see that the Government's short term actions on tariffs do not inhibit the long term reduction now seen as so desirable? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that though in a particular industry employment may benefit from emergency protection there almost certainly will be corresponding costs which will result in employment being lost in other industries, particularly export industries for which the Acting Prime Minister has a special responsibility?

            <para>- I would not like to distinguish between periods of time. When some people talk it can be considered a very long time. In relation to our policy on tariffs and imports there has to be a sensible balance between competing demands in a community. We do have severe unemployment problems and they must be looked at in the light of present day circumcircumstances. Our overall policy is, of course, to reduce tariffs wherever possible. In respect of certain domestic industries we have had to impose some temporary restraints on imports but far too much has been made of this action as something which has impeded imports coming into the country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Any temporary restraints that have been imposed in recent years have permitted imports at almost the existing record levels and the total quantity of imports coming into Australia reveals that temporary restraints are being applied to only about 4'/5 per cent of imports. I certainly hope that there is not a need to impose any more import restraints but for the moment there are some severe employment problems that must be looked at. We have a responsibility to look after the social problems of the community. We will do that but hope that with the passing of time we will be able to remove these restraints and allow imports freer access to Australia. </para>

            <para>-I must admit that when answering questions on this subject now I really do have to rein in my feelings. The Government has shown remarkable tolerance on the question of Albury-Wodonga. I answer the honourable member's question by taking up the last remark he made, which is the Government's whole point. We believe that there has to be a degree of responsibility in the way we rein in expediture on this project. I make no secret of that. The Ministers concerned in New South Wales and Victoria agree with me wholeheartedly. On the question of cost sharing, I asked the ministerial council in November last year whether it would agree to a sharing arrangement. This has nothing to do with what the original arrangements may have been. The Ministers agreed that they would look at new arrangements urgently. Therefore there is no question about what original arrangements were made by that naive economist who is the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. We will continue to try to solve this problem. When the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition asked me the other day whether I would be meeting with the Ministers I said that I would meet them as soon as I could. Hopefully I shall be able to do so on Thursday night. </para>

              <para>- There is no point in adhering to the original arrangements having regard to the spirit of responsibility in which this problem of Albury-Wodonga has to be solved. The arrangements that were made before were intolerable to the 3 governments concerned. Nobody argues about that. We are trying to make responsible agreements. We will continue to try to foster those negotiations. They will have to be negotiations on a sharing arrangement. </para>

My attention certainly has been drawn to those reports. I assure the honourable gentleman that action is being taken to make quite sure that we prevent expenditures being made in the final part of this year for the sole purpose of utilising funds which have been appropriated under the various allocations. I have specifically directed the Department of Finance to clamp down on any practice of this type. The Department is therefore monitoring very closely expenditures towards the end of the financial year in particular. I assure the honourable gentleman that any practices of this type that come to my attention or that of my department or are brought to attention by honourable members, including the honourable member for Bradfield, will be fully investigated and appropriate action will be taken. The Government certainly does not take this matter lightly. It is a matter of serious concern. The instances alleged in the article are subject to examination. The Government will make every effort to ensure that taxpayers ' funds are not wasted in this fashion. </para>

Is it a fact that funds for many worthy causes financed under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act have been fully allocated until 30 June 1978? Is the Treasurer aware that many new sheltered workshops cannot be financed because he will not allocate funds for this purpose? Is he aware of the misery that this entails for handicapped children and their parents? Will he cease acting like a Scrooge and allocate sufficient funds to assist worthy causes for handicapped persons? </para>

In fact, if the honourable gentleman is fair and recollects what was said about handicapped children in the last Budget I think he will find- I speak heavily from recollection- that the increase in the handicapped children's allowance was greater than that for almost any other single item in the Budget. The Government can stand fairly on that record. With regard to the question of funds in this area at present I shall consult with my colleague who has particular jurisdiction to see what are the answers to the questions raised by the honourable gentleman.

            <para>-I most certainly can give the honourable member some hope in this regard. As he well knows from my visits to his electorate and to the electorates of other members who represent rural areas, I have been concerned about providing television facilities for the rural parts of Australia as quickly as possible. This problem of providing facilities for probably 5 per cent of the community is not restricted to rural areas alone. There are problems in some capital cities as well. Now there is a program. The implementation of that program will be dependent upon what funds can be made available in the Budget and also upon what engineering resources are available for the implementation of the program when a decision has been reached. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the particular policy at the present time, if a rural community or a mining organisation wants to fund the expenditure now, the program can be accelerated. That is not to say that the Government will not be able to provide that program as we are gradually able to implement it. I say finally, because I believe there might be some misunderstanding of the Government's policy with regard to communication services throughout Australia, that it is a conscious decision of this Government which is being implemented in my Department and in the CommissionsI am talking now of the Postal Commission and the Telecommunication Commissionto give a greater percentage of funds for the provision of improved services throughout rural Australia. Given a little bit of patience, I am quite certain that all my friends who represent rural areas will see that policy come to fruition. </para>

            <para>-The application of this Community Development Employment Projects Scheme will allow a work test to be applied in communities where it has been very difficult to apply the general unemployment benefit criteria to Aboriginals. This is simply because in many of these places work is not readily available. Aboriginals themselves made considerable representations to me against the continued payment of unemployment benefit to these communities, particularly those which still have a very strong tribal or tradition orientation. The payment of this benefit created a great deal of socially undesirable consequences. So, the scheme which was developed by me and supported by the Government is to inject into those communities funds more or less equivalent to the amount that would otherwise have gone to them by way of unemployment benefit. This will allow the communities themselves to identify work that would be of advantage to them and also allow them to choose those Aboriginals who would do the work. Thereby, those Aboriginals who were available for work and who offered themselves for work would be given it. Those who declined the work would have a work test against which their application for unemployment benefit could be considered. I think that these CDEPs as we call them, will be of tremendous benefit in these remote communities because they will provide work of a kind which the communities themselves want. The socially undesirable aspect of unemployment benefit being paid without regard to the desires of the communities themselves will be removed. </para>

If we look at the approvals figures- I did not want to bore the House with them yesterday and I hope not to bore the House with them today- and take the average for the 3 months January, February and March, the latest figures available, and we compare those figures with the figures for those months in 1975, which was, I remind the House, a year of Labor administration, we see that the private non-residential approvals figure for that quarter in 1975 was $5 lm out of a total of $ 163m. In the first year that we were in office this figure was increased to $75m out of a total of $ 130m. In the first 3 months of this year non-residential private approvals averaged $89m out of a total of $167m. I can assure the honourable gentleman that that is a very significant increase. </para>

Were not the producers who were withholding their cattle simply acting on his Leader's advice of 8 March when he suggested to producers that they withhold cattle from market to force exporters to pay higher prices? Is he contradicting his Leader? If not, what is he doing? </para>

            <para>- It is a little difficult to make any prognosis on just one month's figures but when taken in relation to the last quarter's figures it is instructive to examine them. I think the figures of the Australia Bureau of Statistics show that there has been on seasonally adjusted figures a rise of about 19 per cent in approvals for the dwelling industry. A particularly pleasing part of that approval rate was that a strong part of it was related to private dwelling approvals. But, taken together with the commencement and approval figures for the March quarter, it would appear probable that we will have a slight decline for the rest of this financial year. As my colleague the Minister for Construction has said in this House on a number of occasions over the last couple of weeks, the matter has to be put into perspective; that is, that this financial year's total activity in the building industry probably will be the best on record for the last 2 years. So that is a pretty good thing. Taking the overall view for the rest of this year I think, particularly because of the build-up of stocks and because of the high level in the last half of 1976, we could see some decline in the general activity in the building industry in 1 977. </para>

            <para>- There have been inordinate difficulties in industrial relations in the meat industry, particularly in Victoria. Repeated stoppages have quite disrupted the normal auction system of selling livestock. Works have been uncertain about the degree to which they would be able to kill livestock already purchased and the result has certainly been, as the honourable gentleman suggested, to the detriment of Australia's international reputation and certainly to price returns to sorely affected producers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The predicament, of course, is not peculiar to Victoria. It is true that in many States there have been quite severe industrial troubles which have seriously prejudiced the recovery of the meat industry. If one looks at the extent to which there has been new investment in the whole of the livestock sector one can see that enormous sums were spent in abattoirs, upgrading the facilities generally to meet the standards required and the specifications laid down for the export of Australian meat. Much of this money has been spent in improving the general operating conditions within the works. For all that, the general performance of the labour force within the works does not seem to have improved at all. In fact the volume of work and the hours spent in work if anything have deteriorated. Therefore the overall performance is certainly not assisting to overcome the overall economic plight of the cattle industry. </para>
          <para>As regards the closure of works, a number of abattoirs have intimated that under present circumstances they find it extremely difficult to continue operating and I believe it to be true, as the honourable gentleman suggested, that one abattoir at least at Wodonga has intimated that all men will be dismissed and the plant closed down. Were this to happen it obviously would not assist those who are currently working within the plant. It is but another indication of how radical left wing trade union leaders seem intent on destroying job opportunities for those whom they purport to represent. While that sort of direction is pursued within the trade union movement I am afraid there is little chance for the prosperity of that sector. </para>
          <para>The difficulty in this sector is and has been to some degree a matter of communication. One of the purposes of setting up a conference system under the meat and livestock legislation currently before the Parliament is to try to ensure that there will be an opportunity for all involved in the trade to meet and to discuss industrial problems and such other problems that affect all parties within the meat industry. Similarly, it may be possible within the tripartite council for which my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is responsible to set up again some forum within which there may be meaningful discussion. In these discussions I only hope that the rank and file of meatworkers will be able to have their voices heard because often I suspect that they have an attitude to industrial disputations which is entirely different from that of those who for the time being at least are their industrial leaders. </para>

Computerised axial tomography, or CAT scanning, is an innovation in the area of diagnostic services extended by the medical profession. I understand that substantial orders have been placed for CAT scanners. As a consequence, to try to overcome some of the likelihood of excessive scanning of patients which could also cause some excessive radiation, I have asked my Department to prepare for me a report on terms of reference for a working party to inquire into this activity in Australia. Neither the Government, the community nor I would like to see, the degree of abuse take place in this part of diagnostic medicine in Australia which we have seen in pathology. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer to allegations made by me last February, which led to me being investigated by the Commissioner for Community Relations in which I said, simply for identification purposes, that an organised group of Brisbane Aboriginals had been stealing Government originated cheques in Brisbane. Have Commonwealth Police investigated the claims? Has evidence been forthcoming to bear witness to the truth of my assertions and hence get that other person off my back once and for all? </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Administrative Services has supplied me with the following information in answer to the honourable gentleman's question: Since January 1977, Commonwealth Police in Brisbane have been investigating information received by them that a group of Aborigines had been committing crimes by stealing Government cheques from letter boxes and forging and uttering. On 6 April 1977, 5 Aborigines in the Brisbane area were arrested by Police for the stealing, forging and uttering of stolen cheques. I am informed that 5 persons are on remand awaiting trial. Since 6 April 1977, 4 other persons, consisting of 3 Aboriginals and a postman, have been arrested by Commonwealth Police on similar charges. The postman and one Aboriginal have been convicted since, relative to those charges. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that in the national wage case, arising out of the December quarter consumer price index increase, all calculations submitted by the Government to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission relating to tax indexation were based on the assumption that there would be no discount for Medibank or devaluation? Does this not compound the misrepresentation made to the Commission in the September quarter case, to which I referred yesterday? Is it also a fact that the consumer price index increase figure on which the 1976-77 tax indexation calculation was based was reduced by health insurance charges being eliminated when Medibank was introduced? Why is tax indexation being affected adversely by health charges this year when taxpayers did not benefit last year? </para>

            <para>-I will deal with the honourable gentleman gently today for reasons of which the House will be aware. The fact is that the recent Bill introduced by the Government and passed by this House represented an adjustment to the figures on which tax indexation was based. I made perfectly clear why those adjustments were made. When the Commonwealth's submission was put in the case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to which the honourable gentleman referred, the policy which has just been announced was not then the policy of the Government. The adjustments followed the recent decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which, as I mentioned to the House earlier this week, allowed an adjustment factor of 0.39 per cent, rounded to 0.4 per cent, for devaluation. The Commonwealth in fact is pursuing the logic and common sense which the Commission itself adopted on that occasion. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of the continued provocative statements made by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other Ministers of this country against the Republic of South Africa, a country with whom we have ties going back over many years, with whom we have considerable trade connections, and with whom we have diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors, is the Government contemplating breaking diplomatic relations with South Africa? How else does he explain the actions of the various Ministers? Is the Government simply currying to the communist and Afro-Arab bloc in the United Nations? </para>

            <para>- On many occasions in this Parliament the Prime Minister and members of the Government have expressed concern about the policy of apartheid as it is followed by the present Administration within the Republic of South Africa. Statements which have been made have related only to that policy. The good relations which have existed between our countries have been fostered at both a commercial and a political level in every other sense. However, the general attitude of our Government remains firm. We believe that the policy of apartheid as applied in South Africa is one which is not capable of being supported in the light of our attitude towards democracy and the equality of people within the general concepts applied by the United Nations. For that reason, I can assure the honourable gentleman that there is no suggestion of our severing diplomatic ties with the Republic, but there is a hope that as a result of calmness and reason it might see fit to change its racial policy. In other respects, we also hope that commercial and other contacts between our countries will be furthered. </para>

            <para>-Yes. On the first page of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> today reference is made to my tabling yesterday a paper from the Treasury regarding a restructuring of accounts. It implies quite clearly that it was a current paper. As a matter of fact, it was not a current paper. It was a paper prepared for a previous Ministry which had been recirculated by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> recently. I want to make it quite clear, because there is quite a considerable and important misrepresentation flowing from what is in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review.</inline></para>

            <para>-by leave-I feel sure the Parliament can appreciate the responsibility that this Committee bears in attempting to find solutions to the very high road accident casualty figures in this country. Current statistics indicate that an average of 10 deaths occur per day on Australian roads. Committee members and staff of this Committee could be forgiven for regarding this Committee as the most important in the Parliament in terms of its constant dealings with human tragedy. As the activities of the Committee proceed, it is becoming more and more apparent that the final authority on road safety matters, whether it be statutory or otherwise, must have independence, must have muscle and must be able to demand the respect and cooperation of the States. We feel that any petty objections by some of the States which feel that their authority is being threatened should be put to one side. Surely in this matter it should be realised that the paramount objective must be to cut down the slaughter on our roads. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The heavy vehicle safety report which has just been tabled is the second report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road </para>
        <para class="block">Safety established in the Thirtieth Parliament. The report is also the second in a series of reports that the Committee is preparing on safety aspects of vehicles using public roads. The first report related to passenger motor vehicle safety and was tabled on 2 June 1976. The next report which we will commence work on very shortly shall concern motorcycle and bicycle safety. </para>
        <para>During the course of the heavy vehicle inquiry, the Committee held 10 public hearings and inspected truck and bus shows in Sydney. The Committee also held informal discussions with drivers of heavy vehicles. Seventy-four submissions were received during the course of the inquiry. </para>
        <para>There are 28 major recommendations in this report covering a wide range of matters. They include recommendations calling for safety related improvements in the important areas of heavy vehicle braking, steering and handling, tyre standards and the use of retreads, structural strength of truck cabins and bus frames, loading practice, vehicle inspections, modifications and component failures as a source of accidents. A number of recommendations also have been made in areas related to the heavy vehicle driver's field of vision, his comfort and the use of seat belts. </para>
        <para>In relation to other road users, the report makes what I believe are extremely important recommendations. Having regard to the frequency and the severity of rear-end accidents involving cars and other light vehicles crashing into the rear of heavy vehicles, the Committee has recommended that States and Territories make mandatory requirements for rear-end markings and under-run barriers on heavy vehicles. The Committee received many diverse opinions on the desirability of having mandatory requirements in this area of heavy vehicle safety. </para>
        <para>The Committee concentrated its attention in the report on determining the nature and extent of problems related to heavy vehicle safety and on the range of measures by which heavy vehicle safety could be improved. I must say that I was pleased to find that many significant areas for improvement have been identified and that regulatory authorities are giving increasing attention to the need for further regulation over heavy vehicles. The Committee was also impressed with the evidence given by a number of heavy vehicle manufacturers demonstrating their continuing concern to improve the safety of vehicles produced. </para>
        <para>The lack of adequate accident statistics is a basic problem faced by both vehicle manufacturers and regulatory authorities in attempting to make rational decisions on the effectiveness of various safety measures. Extensive comment was made on this problem in the Committee's previous report on passenger motor vehicle safety. In the case of heavy vehicle accidents, the Committee is aware that extensive investigations of such accidents are currently being conducted. However these studies will only partly meet the need for more data and the Committee remains deeply concerned with the lack of uniformity in the collection of accident data. It might interest honourable members to know that even in the elementary matter of ordinary police accident reports, no 2 States use the same form. There is an urgent need to implement a uniform accident report form throughout Australia and this report urges relevant data collecting authorities to cooperate in a complete rationalisation of accident data collection. We feel that comprehensive data collected on a uniform basis will enable authorities more accurately to assess the benefits of safety measures introduced, and determine areas requiring priority attention in the future. </para>
        <para>I would like to pay tribute to the staff associated with the inquiry and the preparation of this report. Since this Committee commenced its inquiries in 1972, we have been most fortunate in having the assistance of staff who obviously appreciate the very serious nature of our work and who have ably assisted the Committee in its inquiries. I would also like to express my thanks to the witnesses and experts who have contributed to this inquiry. I would like to thank both the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and officers of his Department who have so willingly assisted the Committee. Finally I would like especially to commend the Road Trauma Committee of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons for the superb manner in which it organised and conducted the recent International Conference of the Association for Accident and Traffic Medicine. I look to the Road Trauma Committee to assist our Parliamentary Committee in the future to the same great extent as it has in the past. </para>
        <para>I commend the report to the House. </para>

          <para>-by leave- I join with the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> in expressing my thanks and appreciation to the staff of the Standing Committee on Road Safety for their support. I likewise join with him in expressing my appreciation to the witnesses, some of whom came from overseas, for bringing to the Committee their experience and informing the Committee of their objectives in endeavouring to improve the safety of heavy vehicles. This is an area in which there is a great and urgent need to do something. Once again we have an all-party committee bringing down unanimous recommendations. The recommendations in this report were unanimous. Some members of the Committee, because of other committee commitments, were unable to be present when the recommendations were being formulated but their views which had been conveyed by them to the Committee were taken into consideration when preparing the final draft of the report. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Among the recommendations was one relating to heavy vehicle braking. It astounded me to find out that although there was a considerable amount of knowledge flowing to the manufacturing industry from the aircraft industry which, as honourable members would realise, has the latest technology in braking systems, this knowledge is not passed on to the road vehicle industry. Heavy braking is an area on which a great deal more study can and should be done by the industry itself so as to improve the vehicle that is on the road. Other areas in which there is need for improvement are in relation to steering and handling, tyre standards and the use of retreads, the strength of cabin and bus frames, loading practices, and modifications. Once someone buys a vehicle very little regard is had for the subsequent condition of that vehicle and for the way in which the owner can either add to it, subtract from it, add wheels and do all sorts of things when in so many cases he does not have a clue what the overall result of the modifications that he has carried out will be. This criticism applies particularly to one-man businesses and to one truck or two truck operators. They are more concerned with the economics of their industry, and with how they can cut costs and remain more competitive than the other fellow and do not have sufficient regard for the safety of the vehicle they are driving or for their own well-being following modifications which they have made to the vehicle with so very little technical advice and assistance. </para>
        <para>Other areas of concern are component failures and vehicle inspection. Not nearly enough heavy vehicle inspection is carried out. Before we as drivers of passenger vehicles can re-register our vehicles, they have to be submitted for close examination by registered inspectors. There is a great need for much more of this type of inspection of heavy vehicles, not so much on an annual basis as on a quarterly basis, as these vehicles are so heavily used and knocked around. Another recommendation related to rear end accidents and the fitting of under-run barriers of which the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> is a great advocate. So there is any amount of work to be done to improve the safety of heavy vehicles. </para>
        <para>One of the things which concerns me is the failure of governments to implement the recommendations of parliamentary committees. We had a committee comprising an expert group bring down its report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Road Accident Situation in Australia</inline> in September 1972. The former Labor Government accepted the recommendations of that Committee. It was not a Committee appointed by the Labor Government. It was one of the previous Government's committees which had been appointed, I think, by the present Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> As I have said, all the Committee's recommendations were adopted and put into effect to the extent of setting up the Road Safety and Standards Authority. Unfortunately, it was disbanded in February 1976. There is no reduction in the number of accidents occurring or the number of people being killed on the roads today. Statistics show that in 1973, 3679 people were killed on the roads. In 1974, 3572 people were killed on the roads. In 1975, 3694 people were killed on the roads. In 1976, 3584 people were killed on the roads. In 1975, 89 499 people were injured in motor vehicle accidents. There is a need to take greater note of the recommendations of these non-political committees. </para>
        <para>I emphasise, as I did earlier, that the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Road Safety are unanimous. They are not the recommendations of the National Country Party, the Liberal Party or the Labor Party. The Committee members were in complete agreement on the recommendations. For this reason alone I believe that there is a need for the Government to pay greater heed to the decisions that have been taken. For example, the  Chairman  of the Committee in his closing remarks referred to the need for a collection of accident data. That was a recommendation in a report on the road accident situation. It would have been brought about by the Road Safety and Standards Authority which would have been functioning well and truly by this date. </para>
        <para>To save a lousy $ 10m when there is no reduction in the accident rate and the cost of road accidents is about $ 1000m a year was, in my opinion, a paltry action and not in the interests of the people of this country. If the Road Safety and Standards Authority could have saved one life it would have achieved something. I believe it would have done much more than that. The decision to establish the Authority was not a political one. It was a decision arrived at by a Committee set up by this Government in 1971-72. Once again, I hope that the Minister for Transport will take note of the recommendations of this report which were made on a non-political basis and move hastily to bring about their implementation. </para>

          <para>-by leave-My purpose in rising to speak is to address myself to only 2 principal recommendations contained in the report of the Standing Committee on Road Safety. They are the recommendations seeking to compel the provision of under-run barriers on large vehicles which have an overhanging tray and rear marking plates on heavy vehicles. However, I cannot avoid directing some attention to the remarks of my colleague who spoke before me on this subject, the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> I should like to think that the problem of achieving standardisation or uniform collection of data could be solved simply by allocating a sum of money to establish a Commonwealth authority such as the Road Safety and Standards Authority. Regrettably, it is not as simple as that. Data can be collected on a uniform basis only when those parties who are responsible for collecting the information are prepared to forgo some of their powers to set the terms upon which they now collect information. No number of authorities established by the Commonwealth, when they lack constitutional competence, can overcome the right of each State to set its own method of collecting information. Each police force, each transport authority and so on has its own method. It is not a matter in which one can introduce a political note and say that something has been lost because some savings were made in a Budget context. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In this report we are seeking State cooperation in providing for under-run barriers on heavy vehicles. We are compelling manufacturers to make all motor sedan vehicles crash worthy so that the front or back of a vehicle will concertina if it hits a heavy object and protect the passengers inside the passenger compartment. The development of crash worthiness in motor vehicles has cost a lot of money. We have on our roads other vehicles which immediately undo that crash worthy capacity in the motor car. They have wheels and a tray and when a collision with a car takes place what happens? The bonnet goes underneath the tray, the tray goes into the front of the car passenger compartment and its occupant is injured. If there were a substantial barrier at the end of the vehicle or if the vehicle tyres were set well back with barriers in between the crash worthiness effect of the car would play its role and the occupants would be protected. </para>
        <para>People talk about a cost benefit analysis. A cost benefit analysis may be carried out on how much extra it costs to run a vehicle which has a crash barrier. We could say that it is a very expensive item. We should put that up against a person whose life is lost because the capacity of a vehicle to save his life was nullified because another vehicle on the road was totally incompatible with it. If it was a matter of having telegraph poles down the middle of the highway we would not hesitate to get them off the road. Trucks, of course, cannot be taken off the road but they can be made safer. This step is one method by which it can be done. Coupled with that is the provision of adequate rear marking. Quite obviously if we can stop cars hitting trucks because people can see a vehicle ahead, so much the better. These recommendations are important. I see them as being the crux of this report. I believe that all honourable members ought to give this report their utmost consideration. </para>

            <para>- The Karen Green case will go down in history as part of the present Government's record of hostility towards anybody who has a meritorious claim for social benefits. The Government has used that case to say that it will not grant unemployment benefits in those circumstances because it will mean that so much more money will have to be paid. In answer to questions asked in the House today the Government said that Karen Green is to be treated as a person and not the subject of a uniform policy. Is that the true position?

Taking the 35 000 school leavers claiming unemployment benefits, it means that the Government is trying to opt out of a liability of $10m to $12m. It is erroneous, improper and unfair to say that anybody else might succeed but Karen Green cannot succeed because of some peculiar difficulties with her case, her submissions or application.

I repeat that  His  Honour said: 'I find that the plaintiff's case was not considered as the section contemplates and the plaintiff is, I think, entitled to some relief. What happened as a result of that determination? The case was referred back to the Director-General who has the responsibility to determine Karen Green's application.

Is that not an indictment of the Government? How can a government defy a law which this Parliament passed? It should not place the blame on the public servant who has to abide by policy directives. It should not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniels</inline> as it is now being suggested that he is to blame by saying that this was not an inflexible rule. It was a very inflexible decision by the Government that the Director-General was not to give ground in any circumstance in 1976 to give school leavers the benefit of unemployment benefit. </para>
          <para>Certainly the Government might have been able to find circumstances in regard to one or two school leavers which it might have said entitled the Director-General to refuse to give those school leavers unemployment relief.

She had even had discussions with a guidance officer in November as to what she would do. She immediately registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service. She sought job after job in December. The record clearly shows that. But where did this young lady fail to meet the criteria? As I say, she had no chance. She was prejudged. It was an issue of economic policy of this Government. The Government was going to do 2 things: Keep the unemployment statistics down and keep its financial liability down. What sort of a policy is it that it applies only to school leavers? As  His  Honour said in the course of the judgment, it was a policy aimed directly at school leavers. Anybody else who applied for benefit prior to the school leaving period commencing would of course have obtained the benefit. This is the point.  His  Honour said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There remains in question her eligibility before that date; should the Director-General, in conformity with my declaration, undertake a re-examination of the plaintiff's position and conclude that, on the facts then existing, she was in fact qualified as from some earlier date she will, no doubt, receive payment accordingly . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In this House, we have had answers to questions which state that the young lady was being dealt with on the merits of the case, and that there were found to be no merits involved. Therefore, what the Director-General has now found to be the situation means that she never had any entitlement to unemployment benefit. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the facts of what the Government did. As I said, it issued a policy directive for this last school leaving year which clearly stated that in the case of school leavers no unemployment benefit was to be paid until 22 February. It must astound the people of Australia that what is deemed to be the Director-General's discretion now is that, from 22 February, Karen Green qualified in meeting the criteria. Section 107 of the Social Services Act makes it very clear that where a person is unemployed and has taken reasonable steps to obtain such work- and that is the position of Karen Green- unemployment benefit should be payable. The benefit would be payable as it would be payable to anybody who left school during 1976 or other than what is called the 1976 school leaving period. What the Government has to face up to is the fact that it issued a policy directive, which set out in terms which it itself issued to the Director-General, that he was not to pay unemployment benefit to people leaving school in 1976 until 22 February 1977. And when Karen Green herself lodged the application for unemployment benefit as she did back in the December period, the officer taking the form immediately noted on the top the date 22 February 1977'. </para>
          <para>How can it be then that we have an Act of Parliament which says that the Director-General shall use his discretion and a High Court determination which finds that the Director-General did not use his discretion correctly and finds in favour of the plaintiff that she has a case if the Director-General will only look at it? As  His  Honour himself says, if the Director-General finds that this young lady genuinely sought employment after she had ended her school career, was seeking a place in the work force and had taken reasonable steps to obtain suitable employment, she virtually must qualify. In other words,  His  Honour clearly said to the Government: 'You cannot direct Daniels, the Director-General, to deny this child her unemployment benefit because you have laid down an economic policy that says that nobody is to get unemployment benefit'. The laws of this land say that everybody is entitled to unemployment benefit if they are unemployed and have taken reasonable steps to obtain work. </para>
          <para>The Director-General's discretion was completely removed. It was removed by a policy document issued by the Fraser Government. The Cabinet determined that there would be no discretion for the Director-General as far as school leavers were concerned. These young people were to be denied the monetary benefits that would be payable to anybody else. The Government was telling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniels</inline> that that was how he would interpret this policy. It was a most inflexible policy, as was clearly said by  His  Honour in making the decision. The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is quite wrong again when he stands up in this House and says that the policy was not really an inflexible one: It was a flexible policy. We cannot find any school leaver who qualified for unemployment benefit before 22 February 1977 because the issue was pre-determined by the Cabinet and the executive government of this country, completely contrary to the law. </para>
          <para>I find it incredible to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daniels</inline> has now added that Karen Green could not obtain work suitable 'for her'. What evidence was there of what work was suitable for her? A child, 16 years of age, went to the guidance officer at school and sought guidance as to what employment she should be seeking. She was tola that she should try to engage in the trade of apprentice cook because it does not require an enormous amount of skills at that stage. The question would be whether the aptitude was there. The youngster applied for 3 positions and registered with 2 employment agencies. She complied with every aspect of the regulations. By the same token, let us not forget that she has no father; her mother is a widow. There is no suggestion of trying to exploit the situation. The terms of the Social Services Act clearly spell out what the Director-General is going to do. He has failed to do those things. The High Court determination says: 'I find for the plaintiff, but I cannot find in monetary terms. I merely ask the Director-General to satisfy himself as to whether the girl had genuinely left school, whether she had genuinely sought employment and whether she was in fact employed '. That young lady, Karen Green, succeeds on every one of those 3 counts. On the face of it, the person who has failed is the Director-General. He has abdicated his responsibilities because he was instructed so to do. So, here we have the Government today and even the Director-General saying that this was a case for Karen Green only. Does the Government really think that it can fool the Australian people that way? Does the Government not realise that even the Director-General has had to say: 'I have had discussions following a High Court judgment'- and by the way, that was back on 15 April-' and I have had a number of discussions with officers of the Attorney-General's Department and I am taking the benefit of thenadvice on the legal aspects . The legal aspects were non-existent from the point of view of what the Director-General had to do. The judgment states that the Director-General had to take advice as to what were the facts on which he could exercise a discretion. No law can form the discretion. A law merely says whether the Director-General has exercised his discretion properly on a criterion which commonsense would indicate should apply in this case. But that was not done. The facts, as found by  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen, were as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I find . . . that by the end of . . . 1976 the plaintiff had determined to leave school and to seek employment at the end of the school year in November 1976; that she abided by this decision and to the best of her ability sought employment, without success, from the month of December 1976 onwards; that her lack of success was not due to any want of trying but rather to her relatively poor qualifications combined with the depressed employment conditions then being experienced in Hobart. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How is it that this callous Government can then say: 'We are dealing only with Karen Green's case and all those other 34 999 school leavers may apply'? Why does the Government not face up to the fact that it issued a policy directive to the Department of Social Security stating that it should not pay any school leavers the unemployment benefit until 22 February 1977? How is it that Karen Green's application, when lodged in December, was marked with that February date? What a fortuitous situation! When she applied in December the clerk who took the application was able to put on it the date that subsequently became the date determined at the Director-General's discretion as to when she qualified for the benefit. The clerk was able to forecast 2 months beforehand what the Director-General was going to say- that eligibility for unemployment benefit would date from 22 February 1977. Is it any wonder his honour rejected the Government's claim that the Director-General had acted properly? </para>
          <para>We say that this case is an example of what this Government will do. It will stop at nothing to deny people their rights and will bend the law and give instructions to public servants who are frightened to disobey. Why should the public servants take the risk when the Government has this policy and $ 10m or $ 12m is involved? Let us have a look at that judgment. Let us apply it and then give justice to Karen Green. She is entitled to the unemployment benefit from 20 December when she first applied. The Government has taken a weak kneed approach and stated that the judgment applied only in relation to her case, knowing full well that if she is successful every other youngster who applied will be able to receive that benefit. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition has sought to make the Karen Green case a major political issue, so far without any real success. Notwithstanding the High Court's decision and the determination made by the Director-General of Social Security in his own right, the Opposition has failed to make a credible case. I hope to prove the basis for that statement. In spite of a series of questions in the other chamber and several in the House of Representatives and the discussion of this matter as a matter of public importance in both chambers, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> and members of the Opposition persist in their attempts to make the matter an emotive political issue. If it were an Opposition other than the present Opposition involved there may have been some sense in pursuing this course for political motives. But the Opposition has failed because of the Whitlam Government's record in regard to employment. It was so appalling. Nobody really believes what the Opposition says. Indeed, the Whitlam Government's irresponsible attitude to the payment of the unemployment benefit was to its public discredit. Once again the House has to be reminded of the Whitlam Government's unemployment record. Inheriting an unemployment rate of 2.4 per cent of the work force m December 1972, that rate had reached 5.4 per cent of the work force in December 1975. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Melbourne does not like the truth. Unemployment trebled under the Labor Government; it has not trebled under our government. The number of unemployed persons under 21 years of age doubled. What a record! The Labor Government's shocking record during its term of office leaves the Opposition in no position to seek to capitalise on Karen Green's unemployment She had not taken appropriate steps to be eligible for benefits. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Let us get the issue into perspective. Refusing the unemployment benefit automatically to school leavers was a matter of policy. We do not retract from that policy. That was announced by the Government last year following the release of a working committee's report on the unemployment benefit. That working party was set up while the Opposition was in government because it was concerned about many matters associated with eligibility for the unemployment benefit. Many Ministers of the former Government publicly stressed their concern about the meeting of the eligibility requirements by those who were at that time being paid the unemployment benefit. The present Government addressed itself to the need to postpone the payment of the unemployment benefit in cases where a person voluntarily left his job. It also addressed itself to the matter of whether the unemployment benefit should be automatically payable to a person immediately on leaving school or whether, in terms of the Social Services Act, reasonable steps should have to have been taken by that person to obtain employment before becoming eligible for the unemployment benefit. </para>
          <para>The policy of the Government with regard to school leavers was announced early last year- in fact on 23 March last year. It was stated at that time that in the past many school leaver claimants who said they were not going back to school had been paid the unemployment benefit and for one reason or another they had returned to school. Of course some claimed the benefit without any intention of being dishonest and had later gone back to school. It is apparent, however, that there were others who merely sought the benefit for the holiday period knowing that they would be returning to their studies. This meant that they were receiving a benefit to which they would not otherwise have been entitled. It was said then in relation to school leavers that if the applicant demonstrated hardship as a result of non-payment of the unemployment benefit during the periods mentioned sympathetic consideration would be given to the case and the payment of a special benefit would be made in appropriate cases. </para>

              <para>- It was said that a special benefit would be paid in cases where need was demonstrated. That is the difference between this Government and the Government that was in office previously. We turn our attention to people who have a demonstrated need. We attempt to assist the needy sections of the community. It was said that we would definitely use the special benefit in appropriate cases. Under section 124 of the Social Services Act the Director-General of Social Security has a discretion to make a special benefit payment where because of age, physical or mental disability, or domestic circumstances, or for any other reason a person is unable to earn sufficient livelihood for himself or his dependants, if any. The rate of the special benefit is equivalent to the rate of the unemployment benefit. </para>

The Director-General should have responded to the claim by making all such investigations, if any, as he then might have thought necessary. Whether he should have inquired of her more than she disclosed is a matter for the Director-General. It is then up to the Director-General to investigate as he thinks fit and I will not define what he thinks. I cannot go any further. He should be entirely at large and I regard the Act as conferring jurisdiction upon him to make such investigations as he thinks fit. It seems to be, if there is one vital factor, such as making of efforts to obtain employment by the plaintiff, as to which the plaintiff may notify to the Director-General, as that might be regarded by the Director-General as vital, the Director-General would regard that as something appropriate for investigations to the extent of asking the claimant: "Have you made any employment applications?" I am inclined to the view that that is something he might think fit'. In view of that legal point I really cannot understand why the Opposition should initiate a discussion on the Government's defiance of the law. Where is the defiance of the law? </para>

              <para>- I make the point that there has been a great deal of loose talk within recent weeks- indeed, months- to the effect that the Director-General of the Department of Social Security has illegally deprived school leavers of benefits. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> has tabled in the Senate the actual judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen on the action taken out in the name of Karen Green it might be instructive if I refer somewhat more specifically to what has actually occurred up to date.

In his judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen restated the provisions of section 107 of the Social Services Act in relation to which the plaintiff's claim was lodged.  His  Honour pointed out that the section provides that a person's qualification to receive unemployment benefit depends on his satisfying the Director-General in relation to a number of matters, particularly that he is capable of undertaking and is willing to undertake suitable work and has taken reasonable steps to obtain such work.

            <para>Even were I minded to find the necessary facts inher favour, as to which I say nothing, the course suggested is not, I think, one which is open to me. It is the Director-General or his delegates that the legislation assigns the task of attaining satisfaction and the Court should not seek to usurp that function. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Honourable members will appreciate that the people representing Karen Green did not secure from the Court the order that they sought. What the Court did was to issue 2 declarations on 22 April 1977, the substance of which was that the Director-General should in his consideration of the claim have considered all the circumstances of the claim, making such investigations as he determined, and in the light of this decided whether the plaintiff satisfied him on all the matters set out in section 107 of the Act. The Court further declared that the Director-General might have regard to the fact that the claim was made during the period of school holidays shortly after the plaintiff had left school but should not treat that fact as of itself decisive in determining the claim. Those declarations, as I have said, were issued by the Court on 22 April. A stay of 2 1 days was allowed in which either party had an opportunity to appeal. The 2 1 days elapsed on 1 3 May without any appeal being lodged. </para><interjection>

I have had those documents incorporated because I want to indicate to the honourable member that the Government is well aware of some of the anomalies that have occurred, some of the things that have gone on and some of the rip-offs that have taken place in the unemployment benefit area and that as soon as the reports of those inquiries come to hand the Government will be making decisions on some of the matters to which the honourable member has referred in his speech. But, as the Act and the law now stand, the Director-General has acted in accordance with section 107 of the Social Services Act. He has the power to determine whether those who make application for unemployment benefit in these circumstances should be eligible to receive such benefit. It is quite wrong and foolish for the Opposition to pursue an argument that tries to make out that the Director-General and the Government have acted <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the Act because that is not the truth. It is quite untrue and the Opposition knows it, but the Opposition is more concerned about trying to whip up a great swell of emotionalism around this issue. The Government made its policy clear early last year and made no secret about it. </para>

That statement reads: </para>

          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>Unemployment benefit be not paid to school leavers during the long vacation but that benefit be paid from the commencement of the new school year if the students do not then return to school or proceed to university. This procedure will operate from the end of the 1 976 school year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister claimed that in previous years school leavers had claimed unemployment benefit and then had gone back to school. Despite repeated questions from the Opposition in the other place the Minister for Social Security has not been able to provide any figures on how  many school leavers had done this in previous years. The Government cannot table any legal advising that its action was justified and it cannot provide any statistics to justify its policy. Once again the Minister for Health is vacating the scene. The Minister for Health also was unable to provide any evidence. So we have had the Minister for Social Security being challenged in the other place to produce statistics and we have had the Minister for Health stand up in this place today and go on with a lot of twaddle but produce no evidence whatsoever. </para>
          <para>The Government's action in relation to unemployment benefit is an example of the welshing of the Government and the total disregard that it has for those people who, unfortunately, find themselves in the situation of being unemployed. This arbitrary and quite callous policy decision was implemented by the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security during the long vacation. Section 7 of the Social Services Act binds the Director-General of Social Services to act on the direction of the Minister for Social Security. The Minister for Social Security had directed that this policy be implemented. The Government was responsible for its introduction and the Government must accept responsibility for its implications. </para>
          <para>Great play was made by the Minister once again of the fact that the plaintiff had sought an order that she was entitled to the benefit. The judge said in his judgment that he could not give such an order. As a consequence it naturally follows that the Government is not entitled to direct the Director-General. The Government has put him in a straight jacket. It has stood over him. What he is doing is mouthing the policies of the Government. The Government will find it difficult to side step this issue. The community at large and school leavers in particular will be bearing down on the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Health in this respect. The High Court subsequently found that this blanket policy was contrary to the provisions of the Social Services Act.  His  Honour found that the Director-General should not have taken the Government's policy on unemployment benefits for school leavers into account when determining whether <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Karen</inline> Green was eligible for benefits. In other words,  His  Honour found that this policy was illegal, and the Government did not bother to appeal against the decision because it knew that such an appeal was useless. The Solicitor-General had originally advised the Department and the Government that they would lose the case and they did. Having failed in its attempt to bypass Parliament, the Government and the Minister searched around for another reason to deny <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Green</inline> and the 35 000 other eligible school leavers their rightful income and support. Last Friday the Director-General of Social Services found that <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Green</inline> had not taken reasonable steps to find employment. It is quite clear and concise what has happened. The Government once again has stood over the Director-General to hide its embarassment for the callous and frightful policy it had initiated in the first instance. It decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Green</inline> and the 35 000 other eligible school leavers would be pawns in a game of chess. The Director-General in a Press statement said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am not satisfied that by 20 December 1 976 she had taken reasonable steps to obtain work suitable to be undertaken by her. </para>
            <para>I therefore determine that on 20 December 1976 she was not qualified to receive an unemployment benefit. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a load of rot. <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Green</inline> made extensive efforts to find employment. She first registered for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service on 27 November 1976, and she was told that no work was available for her on that date and again on 20 December. Evidence was tendered in the High Court that <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Green</inline> had made intensive efforts to find employment during this period including repeated visits to 2 private employment agencies. We might wonder what criteria the Director-General used in reaching this decision and what constitutes reasonable efforts to find employment. We might wonder whether these efforts were enough and what else she was expected to do to find employment. There was no way that the Minister for Social Security was going to allow the Director-General out of a straight jacket. He was to carry out the Government policy whether he liked it or not. The truth is that the Government is determined to ignore the High Court judgment and it will not pay these benefits to school leavers no matter what the legality of its actions. Why else would the Government refuse to review the case of 35 000 school leavers who most probably are eligible for benefits? It is the Minister's duty to instruct the Director-General to review these cases. She has the power under section 7 of the Act and she must use it. The Government must stop hiding behind the skirts of the Director-General and accept its responsibility to set right this disastrous and illegal policy. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has said that it believes that school leavers are entitled to unemployment benefits. They have felt the impact of Government unemployment policies in a disproportionate way. It is bad enough to suffer the frustration of not being able to obtain a first job but it is worse to suffer the indignity of total dependence on others. The Minister for Health, who is at the table, made great play about the unemployment situation under the Labor Government. What is the case today? More people are receiving the unemployment benefit at present than ever before. What is the Government doing in terms of policy? </para>

              <para>- That is true. Karen Green has been made a scapegoat for the callous policies of the Government. She had sufficient fortitude to continue to fight her case against crushing odds of Government indifference. She took her case to the High Court which found in her favour. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Government's harsh attitude to Karen is characteristic of its general attitude to the unemployed. Indeed, the Government is inhuman and inflexible to all wage earners and those who want to become wage earners. But beyond that the Government flies in the face of the High Court decision and persists with its refusal to pay unemployment benefits. This action can be described only as bloody mindedness. There is no excuse for such behaviour. Clearly the Department did not make an independent decision. It is clear from the Government's statement how the Director-General was expected to interpret the matter, how he was expected to make decisions along these lines. This question of the statement was followed by a buck passing exercise, with the Government shifting whatever blame it could back onto the Department. We heard the Minister in another place go to great lengths in an endeavour to do that. It is clear that Karen satisfied the criteria for receiving the benefit. It is unbelievable that a girl with the tenacity to take her case to the highest court in the land would not have pursued every job opportunity possible. Dismissal of her application on a technicality is a clear extension of the Government's policy of bashing the unemployed. </para>

I state very clearly and very precisely that I do not now nor will I in the future support paid vacation leave for school leavers. I shall look at a few more statistics. The claims for unemployment benefits for school leavers in the period 7 January to 22 April 1977 numbered 62 820. Claims granted in that period numbered 38 537 leaving a balance of 24 283. 1 ask: Where did the balance of 24 283 go? I suggest that a great proportion went back to school and that a great proportion took gainful employment. </para>

              <para>- There is no evidence. I suggest in the strongest possible terms that studies in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries, where money is given for no gainful work, demonstrate without any shadow of a doubt that there are social problems and that in the years to come they will be frightening in their magnitude. The honourable member for Melbourne is saying that we do not want young people to work. When I left school, I sought a position. I had a break for four or five weeks having completed a long time at school. Then I decided to seek a job. I did not ask someone to give me money while I searched around for that position. Notwithstanding, if the decision of an applicant is that he should take employment after three or four weeks because of hardship or on the ground of difficulty at home, provision already exists in the Act for him to be considered for special benefits. The Minister for Social Security has stated clearly and constantly in the Senate the Government's policy in regard to the payment of unemployment benefit.

          <para class="block">The Minister has said that clearly. There is the Government policy. It is up to the Director-General to clearly make the determination. When the Government's policy was announced last year, provision was stated clearly for the Director-General of Social Services, under section 124 of the Social Services Act, to have the discretion to pay a special benefit because of age, physical or mental disability or domestic circumstances or for any other reason, where a person is unable to earn sufficient money for himself or his dependents, if any. The rate of that special benefit is equivalent to the rate of unemployment benefit. Surely this is fair and just. We are giving the young people the opportunity, if there is hardship, to claim a special benefit. Surely it is fair for Australians to feel that when people leave school they must make some reasonable effort to obtain work. The Opposition has argued today, and it has argued constantly, that because somebody goes out and looks for employment for 7 days, 10 days, 14 days or a month, that person has made every effort. Karen Green was given the opportunity to state a case to the Director-General of Social Services for special consideration. </para>

          <para class="block">Karen Green was given the opportunity and she did not avail herself of it to claim that she had a special case. In raising this matter of public importance today the Opposition, by the nature of the debate, has tried to make political capital out of human misery and the suffering of the young. The honourable member for Melbourne nods his head in agreement. I would like him to listen and perhaps he will agree with my proposition. As at 31 December 1976, 95 per cent of school leavers from the previous year had obtained gainful employment. Under the policy of the previous Government of paying everyone who left school I would not predict that 95 per cent would have obtained gainful employment. Today over 80 per cent of last years school leavers have found employment. </para>
          <para>When this Government came to office in December 1975 it found that, as at November 1975, 60 249 school leavers were unemployed and 152 000 people under the age of 21 years of age were unemployed. The comparable figures as at April this year are 32 600 and 127 352. The reason for this improvement is that under this Government's policy we have, in fact, made an effort to see that people find gainful employment. It is not the old story of the Australian Labor Party which gave out money and people did not have to find work. There are social problems. There are moral problems. Not one press statement from the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party spokesman on social security or from honourable members opposite has done anything in regard to those questions. </para>

            <para>-The Government's proposal to increase the superphosphate bounty is not opposed by the Opposition. However, we want the section of primary industry which uses superphosphate to be absolutely clear that the action being taken by the Government is a cunning, mischievous way of disguising future price increases. The Government will increase the phosphate bounty from the current rate of $1 1.81 a tonne by 19 cents to $12 a tonne. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> claims that the action is in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Industries Assistance Commission report. This is not correct. Either the Minister has difficulty reading IAC reports or is deliberately attempting to mislead primary producers. The Government did not follow the IAC report strictly. The IAC recommended a 20 per cent <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate on superphosphate and on phosphate rock prepared for use as fertiliser, or $138 a tonne for phosphorous content either greater or less than the phosphorous content of single superphosphate on the available phosphorous content. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the Government adhered to the IAC recommendations it would mean that the amount of bounty would increase with any increase in the ex-works price for bulk material or of the importer's selling price at the port of entry. However, the Government is really announcing the intention to decrease the rate of bounty over the next 5 years. There is no doubt that the price of superphosphate will continue to rise. In fact, we believe that one of the reasons why the matter is being rushed through at the end of this current session of Parliament is that a price rise is imminent. The Government must think primary producers are fools not to have seen the Government's intention to reduce the effective rate of assistance to this section of the industry. The recent decision in the Ocean Island case and the commitment by the partners in the British Phosphate Commission to pay the Banabans $10m, combined with increasing costs of removing Christmas Island phosphate rock, means that price increases for phosphate rock must soon beassed on. Once the price increases, the rate ofounty will no longer be the 20 per cent <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate recommended in the Industries Assistance Commission report but something less than that and ever decreasing. </para>
          <para>As with so much of the current legislation, it is not clear if the review within the 5-year period would include a review of the rate and total amount payable to the industry. In fact, the Opposition understands that the review would only be to consider if the bounty should be maintained beyond 1982. The Government should have been honest to primary users who use superphosphate and warned them that price rises are imminent and that the Government did not propose to adhere strictly to the IAC recommendations. While the Opposition does not oppose this Bill, it must observe that the report of the IAC was not a majority one. One of the commissioners recommended that the bounty be phased out over 2 years. The Opposition understands the reasoning behind his dissenting recommendation. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is concerned that the benefit of the superphosphate bounty is not spread equally throughout rural industry. There are large sections of the cattle industry in Queensland and wide areas of the black soil plains wheat growing areas which do not need superphosphate. In addition, wool and cattle producers in the pastoral zone are unable to usefully spread superphosphate on their vast grazing areas. It seems inequitable that a section of primary industry receives $50m a year while others receive absolutely nothing. There is also some concern that the bounty is not enjoyed by those who most need it. There is strong evidence to suggest it is the wealthier section of the industry which receives the greatest advantage. At a time when many primary producers are in a desperate state there are some grounds for arguing that the $50m could be more equitably distributed to assist those people in real trouble. However, it appears that the Government is cutting back this sort of assistance, and the recent announcement by the Minister for Primary Industry that funds for loans to beef producers will be cut back during the next financial year is some indication of that. Thus the apparent munificence of the Government in increasing the superphosphate bounty is little better than a callous sham and is increasing evidence of the Government reducing its support for rural industry in real terms while granting a disproportionately larger increase to manufacturing industry at the same time. </para>

            <para>-We have heard the same thing again from the Australian Labor Party, which has the worst history of any government in this country in helping the farmer, welcome the decision of the Government, as implemented by this Bill, to continue for a further 5 years from 1 July the payment of a bounty on production of phosphate fertilisers for use in Australia at the rate of $12 a tonne. Referring briefly to the history of the subsidy, when it was introduced by the coalition Parties in 1963 the objectives of the bounty were stated to be to encourage the most economic use of agricultural resources, to stimulate pasture improvement, and to help increase productivity and the expansion of rural production. In December 1974 the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> announced the discontinuance of the bounty. So much for what the previous  speaker  said. In fact, at that time the then Prime Minister said that the aims of the bounty had been achieved and that it was no longer appropriate for this extensive charge to be carried by the taxpayer. In 1973-74 bounty payments totalled almost $67m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the interim report of the Industries Assistance Commission on 31 July 1975, two commissioners recommended the restoration of the bounty at the previous rate pending completion of the inquiry. They proposed that, if practicable, restoration should be retrospective to 1 January 1975. Again, what did the Labor Government do? Absolutely nothing. It was only after the election, when the coalition Parties were put on the government benches, that on 10 February 1976 the Government announced restoration of the bounty. In announcing the Government's decision the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> stated that the bounty would apply on sales to users from 11 February 1976 until 30 June 1977, by which time the Government would have considered the Commission's final report. Of course, during that period, and indeed since then, the Labor Party has continually ridiculed the coalition Parties for giving aid to farmers. It has taken great pride in quoting the amount of subsidy to some users. It was the Labor Party which inflamed inflation in this country and did a great deal to reduce the income of the farming community. Farmers were not protected against inflation. They were faced with the cost of their inputs rising enormously in both machinery and labour, with no matching increase in their incomes. They did not get any wage rises but still the Labor Party removed the subsidy. </para>
          <para>I ought to point out to the Labor Party that the bounty is not a payment to the farmers, as Opposition members seem to think, but rather a reduction in the cost that the farmer has to pay for one of his imput components. As to the benefit arising to the different farmers, the IAC report stated at page 34: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In general it would appear that the effects of the bounty on income distribution within the farm sector are likely to be small, and not advene, and therefore do not constitute grounds for rejecting the bounty as a method of assistance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Labor Party would do well to drop its cheap political gimmickry in relation to this matter. I want to refer briefly to the basis of the bounty and to the IAC report which shows that the commissioners are obviously convinced of the justification for the bounty. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In assessing whether the Australian Government should continue to provide assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers, the Commission has considered both the economic efficiency and welfare implications. It has concluded, on efficiency grounds, that assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers should be continued. It has reached this conclusion on the basis of its judgment that, given present levels and pattern of assistance to Australian industry generally and the low-cost status of the major phosphate-using activities, removal of the present assistance would lead to less efficient use of Australian resources. However, it does not favour increased assistance. </para>
            <para>The Commission recognises that a fertiliser subsidy has disadvantages but assesses these to be small relative to the advantages of maintaining encouragement for the use of  resources in a relatively efficient sector of the economy. It believes the desirability of bounty assistance should not be judged by reference to some ideal configuration of the economy or ideal form of assistance, but rather by reference to the existing situation and the likely practical alternatives. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Further it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission sees tariff-induced distortions as being removed only gradually. It has no evidence that demonstrably better measures will be found easily or quickly. On the other hand, it believes the opportunities to identify alternative and more efficient measures should arise as assistance for rural industries is reviewed. Progress in this area and in reducing high protection to import-competing industries would need to be taken into account when the bounty is reviewed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, the Commission is saying that once the protection to the other sectors of Australian industry is reduced and so the burden borne by the farmers of such protection is likewise reduced, this is one factor to be considered in a review of the bounty. I am sure that the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> will say more on that. </para>

              <para>-The Labor Government did in December 1974. In 1975-76, $20. lm was paid but, of course, the subsidy was reintroduced only in February of that year. In 1 976-77 to the end of April, $27.9m was paid in subsidy. The projected figure for 1977-78 is $50m. But that figure was based on the subsidy on an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> 20 per cent basis and, in fact, it may be a little higher than the actual figure given the $12.00 bounty which is the subject of this Bill. I want to look very briefly to the future supplies of phosphate rock in Australia and particularly at the availability and possibility of using the deposits from Queensland owned by Broken Hill South 's subsidiary, Queensland Phosphate Ltd. The development program of that deposit has been inhibited, especially by the Labor Government when it virtually stopped the project when, as I understand it, the company could have made some export sales and thus recovered some of its setup costs to the benefit of the Australian producer and, of course, the Australian community in general. I am told that the company has spent some $70m so far and it is obviously in Australia's interests to become self reliant with a source of supply within Australia instead of relying entirely on Nauru and Christmas Island deposits. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There are problems which, as I understand it, have not yet been resolved. These are mainly technical and quality problems. From the trials so far concluded it has been shown that the deposits could be used for superphosphate of slightly lower grade, but the tests left unresolved the problems concerning wear on rock mills caused by inclusions of chert, a hard siliceous rock, in the phosphate. Also, I understand that there is an excessive evolution of fluorine during the processing, following which the gas offtake flues become quickly blocked with silica deposits. In addition, there are problems with severe setting of the product in storage prior to sale. So it would seem that more work needs to be done before this deposit can be used commercially in Australia. However, I am sure that the Government will try to assist in bringing that Queensland deposit into use. Finally, I want to congratulate the Government for continuing the bounty. It may in future have to review the size of the bounty depending on the cost of superphosphate from the supplier. However, the undertaking in this Bill is of great assistance to the farming community in Australia in that we will not have the threat of the subsidy being on and off as occurred under the previous Labor Government. </para>

            <para>- I support the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Amendment Bill, which extends the payment of the bounty on the use of phosphate for a further period of 5 years as recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission. It is inevitable that the Government will say that the Australian Labor Party has changed its mind about the bounty. Of course, this disregards the very large number of issues on which the Government has changed its mind, including the very important recent issues of the referendum in which the Government recently did a complete turnabout. However, although the Opposition does not formally oppose the Bill this does not mean that we are admitting that our previous criticism was not valid. I still think that the criticism we made of the inequitable way in which the bounty operated is still very valid. Certainly, the assistance in the form in which it has been given in the past has not been of material benefit to the majority of farmers. It has been of particular benefit to a notorious few farmers and of very little benefit to those who have been in the greatest need. It is a well known fact that those farmers at the lower end of the scale are not in a position to use superphosphate at all. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The bounty is regressive in that the big companies and big land holders, including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> are the people who profit most from this bounty. </para>
          <para>For example, the bounty has not assisted the 50 000 farmers who have left the land in the last 10 years. It can hardly be claimed that it has assisted those farmers who received on average less than $150 a year from the operation of the scheme when other measures would have been more effective. Of course, when the ALP Government moved for the removal of the bounty, farm incomes were much different from what they are now. They were at an all time high of $15,902. Average yearly earnings at the time were $6,136. In other words, average weekly earnings represented only 38.59 per cent of farm income. By 1975-76, however, the position had changed drastically. The change primarily was caused by the severe drop in farm income which in no way could be attributed to the superphosphate bounty. Farm income in dollar terms dropped to $9,194 which in real terms represented a much greater fall. By comparison, average weekly earnings rose to $8,814, still below farm income and in real terms not a substantial increase. Average weekly earnings represented 95.87 per cent of farm income for that year. These figures quite clearly support the case for a fundamental re-think of the existing measures designed to assist farmers. The existing measures are not doing what they set out to do. </para>
          <para>It is unfortunate that so much emphasis has been placed on the continuation of the bounty that it has hindered the formulation of alternative or supplementary policies of assistance which would provide genuine assistance to our rural industries. Farmers are fighting to maintain their viability not because in any way they can be said to be inefficient but because of the forces, especially those of the international sphere, which are continuing to dominate the economy. Farmers are aware of the diminishing terms of trade that they are fighting against and that the type of assistance offered by governments in the form of bounties on use or production have not been really significant. What has been more significant is the international market situation for Australian agricultural products. </para>
          <para>Since attaining office the Fraser Government has illustrated beyond any doubt that it has no special relationship with our major trading partners. Instead of the Government's promoting our agricultural products, the Australian people are confronted with the spectacle of Minister after Minister, mostly the farming Ministers and particularly the Leader of the National Country </para>
          <para class="block">Party, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> tripping overseas with the objective of selling our minerals as cheaply as they can. The significance of these endeavours bears directly on the situation of the rural sector. The demands of international economic pressures are for our minerals. These pressures nave relegated out rural exports to a secondary role. It would appear that the role Australia is being increasingly asked to play is that of a major mineral exporter and a very minor agricultural exporter confined to quota systems with our traditional markets, which means a further reduction in the living standards of people living on the land. To provide assistance on the basis of a substance which increases production is only true assistance if there is a market at a sufficient price for the extra production. In some instances there is a market and in those cases the bounty can be said to provide an economic return to producers. Of course, this is not always the case and that is why the Opposition while not opposing the Bill would like to draw the attention of the House to the opinion of the dissenting commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robinson. Mr Robinson</inline> proposed a full scale inquiry aimed at co-ordinating existing assistance measures and recommending new measures where justified in order to develop an effective and efficient framework within which rural industry could continue to develop as a low cost, nationally valuable activity. While farmer organisations have displayed little interest in this proposal, I have found that individual farmers are quite receptive to it. Perhaps the farmer organisations should consider the wishes of thenrank and file and at least look at this suggestion in a serious way. </para>
          <para>Returning to the detail of the Bill, I would like to make a few points. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in his second reading speech misled the Parliament. The rate of bounty is not in accordance with the Industries Assistance Commission report. The IAC recommended that the bounty be paid on an ad valorem rate of 20 per cent of the manufacturers' ex-works price. Setting the bounty on a fixed rate of $12 per tonne, whilst in round terms it approximates 20 per cent of the current price, does not take into consideration future fluctuations in price. The prospect is that the price of phosphate will rise. The existing iniquitous arrangements for exploiting rock phosphate from Christmas Island no doubt will be terminated and the workers and people of the island compensated. The result will be increased pressure for rises in the price of superphosphate. Thus the Government, by not adopting the letter of the IAC recommendation, has adopted a basis which will become less significant as the price of phosphate undoubtedly rises. No provision is made to adjust these rises in price. </para>
          <para>I believe that there is a strong case for reviewing the bounty when conditions improve in the rural sector. I have no doubt that conditions will improve in the rural sector and that the present slump in the beef industry will be followed by a boom in a year or two. That would be the appropriate time to consider reviewing this bounty, not when conditions in the industry are bad. The continuation of the bounty now is a justifiable protection in much the same way as we justify similar protection of the manufacturing sector. I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I promised our Whip that I would try to say what I had to say in 5 minutes. I have a fair bit to say but will have mercy on the House and not say it all at this stage. Above all I want to make one point. The only real justification for doing what we are doing today is to give back to the rural sector some of its own. As the honourable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Porter)</inline> so rightly said, the rural sector has been carrying a great cross in terms of high costs caused by tariffs. This Bill is some compensation- not good or efficient compensationfor the damage that the rural sector has had to suffer because of the tariff policy of this and other governments. One of the disquieting things about the tariff policy is the way in which it teaches and encourages people to lean on one another, and here we see it happening again. Now even the rural sector has had to go to the Government because it has been leant on by secondary industry through the tariff system. This was revealed in the Brigden report back in 1929, which said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The most disquieting effect of the tariff has been the stimulus it has given to demands for government assistance of all kinds with consequent demoralising effect upon self-reliant efficiency throughout all forms of production. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We are seeing that again now. The rural sector has had to ask for tariff compensation because it has had to carry this immense extra cost which it should not have had to carry. The tariff policy has turned Australians into a mob of leaners. People are always bragging about their belief in private enterprise but as soon as they have finished making their resounding speeches on the subject they slip around to the door of the Industries Assistance Commission or to the Government and say: 'We would like a bit more assistance for this and that'. Now even the rural sector has to ask for tariff compensation. It will not be fair compensation. There will be many people in my saltbush areas and in Queensland who do not use superphosphate but will have to pay through taxation for the compensation that will be paid to other sectors. This is yet another example of the implications of the tariff system and of the way it is destroying the private enterprise system. Even farmers now have had to ask for tariff compensation in this way. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the case that the graziers' association made when it said that it would rather have a reduction in tariff than the superphosphate subsidy. It was right because the rough balance sheet shows that last year secondary industry received SI 59m in direct subsidies and $4,000m in indirect subsidies through tariffs. It may be thought that these are my figures, but they are not. I am quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Henderson,</inline> the Director-General of the Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia. No one could say that he is a lightweight. Certainly no one could claim that he is not generally a high protection advocate. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I fully accept the IAC argument that the consumer must pay for tariff protection. There is no question about this. I will also accept the arithmetic that the cost is around $4,300m annually. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the size of the burden. The rural sector produces about half the exports so it carries half the burden. It has hanging around its neck a $2, 000m albatross which is beginning to do what dead albatrosses do, which I hesitate to mention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> in your distinguished company. It not only is heavy but also has that other attribute. The rural sector got only $6 lm in direct subsidies last financial year. It now will get another $50m which is what this superphosphate subsidy will cost. Yet it will have to pay about $2,000m, that being its share of the tariff burden because it produces half our export income. The rough arithmetic is that secondary industry is getting $4, 15 9m in the form of subsidies while the rural sector is getting minus $ 1 ,889m. That is the kind of justification, indeed the only justification, for this Bill being before us. </para>
          <para>Let me put it more sharply into focus. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> you will be well aware that a lot of superphosphate goes away in bags. Just recently there came into this House a tariff decision on bags and the subsidy equivalent of this Government decision works out at about $5m. I did not see anybody giving tongue about the featherbedding of the bag manufacturers. No one mentioned that. Yet $5m was provided in one simple Bill as the result of one simple tariff decision. In the IAC report the IAC estimates that the cost of having to carry the rock in Australian manned ships is $10m. Again no one mentioned that. People sling off about the featherbedding of the farmer but no one says anything about the flagrant featherbedding of the sailors who carry the rock in Australian ships at an extra cost of $10m. The justification for the Bill before us today is that we are getting a little bit of our own back. That is not a good reason for doing anything but it is better than doing nothing when the rural sector has hung around its neck this great albatross weighing $2 ,000m each year. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr FitzPATRICK</inline>(Darling) (4.41)-The honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> has given us the benefit of his knowledge on the effects of tariffs on our rural industries. I am inclined to agree with him that no doubt they have a very serious effect on our rural industries. I also agree that perhaps there are better ways of giving assistance to the rural industries than paying a bounty on superphosphate. The only thing that had me worried was that I thought that as the honourable member was warming to his subject he was going to deprive me of my opportunity to have a few words on this matter. I support the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Amendment Bill. It gives effect to the Industries Assistance Commission report of 20 October 1976 which recommends the continuation for another S years of the payment of a bounty on the production of phosphate fertilisers for use in Australia. This is very important. It seems to me that the various industries have enough trouble getting their problems before the Industries Assistance Commission. When they get them there and a report is brought down I think that the Parliament has some obligation to take notice. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt that most of our rural industries are at present faced with rising costs and falling prices. As the honourable member for Wakefield said, tariff protection is one of the factors that vastly increases the cost of production. There is no doubt that this will have a resulting squeeze on farmers' incomes. The Australian Labor Party has never opposed giving assistance to industries which require it. We are opposed to assistance going to the people who need it least of all. I shall not deal with the people who receive the superphosphate bounty. I think it is well known that many people who benefit from this bounty do not require it. Many other sections of our rural industry vitally need some kind of assistance and it is not reaching them. </para>
          <para>In my electorate a good deal of support for the superphosphate bounty arises from an emotional issue. The bounty has been given so much publicity that it seems to be a status issue. People believe that if the Government does not give them a superphosphate bounty it is doing something bad for the rural industry. I am inclined to agree with the honourable member for Wakefield that we should be looking at other ways of assisting people in rural industries. We should be giving assistance which is of more benefit than the superphosphate bounty. The reason there is so much emotion about this issue is that Australia has a long history of assisting the use of phosphatic fertilisers. A bounty has been paid in most of the years since 1931. It is easy to understand that many of our farmers have become used to using superphosphate and they depend vitally upon it for their results. </para>
          <para>Although much has been said about the Labor Party's actions in relation to the use of the bounty we should have a look at the first interim report of the Industries Assistance Commission. It gives some idea of the justification for the Labor Government removing the bounty. Page 2 of that report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At the time the decision was taken, economic conditions within the rural industries were generally buoyant. Since then, the average ex-factory price of single superphosphate (in bulk) to users has risen from about $16 to about $55 per tonne. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The price is much higher today. That gives some indication of the justification of the Labor Party in removing the bounty at that time. When these measures come before the Parliament they should not be attacked from a political viewpoint. There is no doubt that many of our rural industries at present are undergoing severe economic pressures. Until we put into effect some of the suggestions of the honourable member for Wakefield the superphosphate bounty seems to be justified. </para>

            <para>- Australians must surely be grateful to the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> for his clear and direct exposition of the facts in relation to this legislation. I believe that in his excellent address he laid at rest once and for all the charge of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> that members of the farming community are nothing more than corporate dole bludgers. The honourable member for Wakefield in his lucid explanation of the situation left us all completely convinced that what the farmers are getting under this legislation is their actual right. I believe that his speech should be made compulsory reading for all those people who live in the city areas so that they know the tremendous burden under which the farming population has been operating for a great length of time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This legislation is most pertinent at this time. Real income per farm at $10,432 per annum is slightly lower than it was last year. It has risen by 13 per cent but, on account of inflation running at IS per cent, real farm income is somewhat less than it was the previous year. Farm costs have risen by 1 1 per cent. This has been due to a 13 per cent increase in the price of farm inputs which was balanced by a continuing improvement in productivity. The application of the superphosphate bounty concerns productivity. As the honourable member for Wakefield outlined, this Government's contribution to farmers does not nearly measure up to the contribution which governments are giving to people engaged in the ship building industry at $19,000 per man per year, to waterside workers at $13,000 per man per year or to people engaged in the car manufacturing industry at $5,000 per man per year. It is no wonder that the National Country Party fully supports this continuing commitment to Australian rural production by the Fraser-Anthony coalition Government and, more importantly, the guidelines which have been set for the next 5 years. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that there has been a decline in prices for farm products. The price of wheat has fallen by 8 per cent from last year with an anticipated income of $1,1 50m. The volume is roughly the same but the area planted has increased by 5 per cent to 8.9 million hectares. The average yield is down. This is a further proof that there is a vital need for the input of fertilisers. In reading page 35 of the Industries Assistance Commission report I was convinced by the argument that was advanced that one of the disadvantages in a blanket cover was that it provides little assistance to producers of wool, wheat and meat in districts where little or no phosphatic fertiliser is used. We might therefore refer to those areas where nitrogen is used and phosphate is not. It is absolutely essential, I believe, if productivity is to be increased so that costs can be contained, that the Government, in its pre-Budget discussions, gives very serious consideration to maintaining the present bounty on nitrogenous fertiliser at $60 a ton of contained nitrogen. There has been pressure for agriculture in Australia to be expanded due to difficulty in the beef and sheep industries with the consequent increase in areas of what we might term infertile land. Of course associated with this is the fact that our present lands and soils are becoming older and consequently need applications of nitrogen. This is so in all areas of Australia, not only in Queensland, in order to guarantee increases in productivity. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that the grain industries are now the greatest users of nitrogen. It is absolutely essential to realise that nitrogen is required in cereal growing areas, sugar areas and fruit growing and dairying districts. It needs to be applied each year. There cannot be a bank or build-up of it. In most areas where it is required, there are no clovers. It is therefore necessary to do all that is possible to ensure that this particular subsidy is increased or at least maintained at the present rate. It is worth reminding people that in 1975, when the IAC commissioned the report on nitrogen, it was stated that the situation would be reviewed later on- this also was a commitment in the Budget of last year-in the light of prices prevailing at the time. When it was decided to grant a nitrogen subsidy of $60 a ton, wheat was worth $1 10 on the world market; at the present time it is $90. Sorgum was worth $80 a ton and is now $64 a ton. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose these Bills but welcomes them as evidence of the first tentative signs of this conservative Government finally acting to lead the ailing Australian dairy industry down the road to rationalisation and reorganisation. The Bills simply act to implement Stage I of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations on marketing arrangements as included in the report delivered to the Government in early September 1976. These Bills do not embrace Stage II which relates to a nationally negotiable market entitlement scheme, nor Stage III which relates to opening up the entire industry to the impact of export prices. The Bills give effect to the agreement reached by the Australian Agricultural Council at its one hundredth meeting in early February of this year. It was agreed at this meeting that provision for a compulsory levy disbursement system should be made. In other words, the voluntary equalisation arrangement is being replaced by a compulsory one. It is encouraging to learn that such agreement was reached regarding Stage II at the Australian Agricultural Council meeting. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition acknowledges the difficulty faced by any federal government in trying to bring equitable reforms to the dairy industry. State interests are of vital concern in this matter and a compromise has to be reached with each State unless the Commonwealth is prepared to lead. However, comment needs to be made on the tardiness and lack-lustre performance of the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> with respect to the dairy industry which has just gone through its two worst years, particularly in Victoria. The Opposition's criticism is not that nothing is being done but that so little is being done for so many in such a slow time. </para>
          <para>The Government is not and has not been short of information on the dairy industry on which to base policy if it wanted to act. But the Minister invited paralysis by analysis in asking for a further report on the dairying industry from the IAC immediately after having the report of the IAC which was delivered in October 1975 to the Labor Government shortly before the Senate was perverted by the Liberal and Country Parties in November of that year. The Minister, in his speech on the second reading of the Dairy Stabilisation Bill 1977 said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As the dairy industry was, however, unable to come forward with an agreed plan the Government referred the matter back to the IAC and requested that it report specifically on what long-term marketing arrangements should be introduced for the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is a hopeless reason to state that the industry was not able to agree. For a start, there are at least 3 industries involved in dairying and a superstructure of administrative and institutional arrangements that means consensus is impossible. For those who talk so much about 'leadership, ' why would the Government not propose a scheme in the light of all the knowledge it has. It is not for the IAC to make Government policy. That is the function of the Government via the Minister and his Department. It is the IAC's primary function to make recommendations to the Government on measures of industry assistance, not on industry arrangements. What if the arrangements as recommended had not been satisfactory or not agreed upon? Would another inquiry have been called for? What makes the Minister think that all the recommendations will be accepted by the industry? Even he hints- he has done so recently- that they will not be. So much for the abdication of responsibility that has marked the Minister's administration of his portfolio! </para>
          <para>The Minister knows full well that there was no need for a second inquiry. The findings of the Victorian inquiry of May 1975 provided abundant information on the deficiencies of equalisation. The discussions centring on the Australian Dairy Corporation plan indicated the parameters on which any scheme could and should centre. In the hour of the dairy industry's greatest need the Government called for another inquiry as a stall. Prevarication and procastination have marked the Government's approach to primary industry matters since its election. It took an estimated 20 000 Victorian dairy farmers and their families who took to the streets in June last year for the Government to make decent gestures towards the level of underwriting for the 1976-77 season. Addressing the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria in October 1976, the Minister said that the Government would not abandon dairying and that decisions of great courage were needed. It has taken another <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> months from that meeting for us to arrive at this first step towards industry marketing reform. Stage I is the easy stage of the IAC recommendations. This is supposed to be called courage! </para>
          <para>Of course we all know of the Minister's tardiness with respect to marketing reform in both the meat and wool industries.  His  inaction provoked the New South Wales United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association to call for his resignation in February this year. And of course, dissatisfaction with the Minister's hamfisted approach has continued until the present with calls for changes to the Meat and Livestock Corporation still being called for by way of full page advertisements in some newspapers. It is not just the Minister who should take the blame for inaction on rural matters. In speech after speech to rural audiences over many years, Liberal and Country Party speakers have scorned the lack of farmers in the Labor Party. The barbs that once were aimed at Ken Wriedt are now aimed at me. The Minister still cannot resist denigrating Ken Wriedt because he was not a farmer. One only has to read the Minister's Press release on his address to the Victorian Country Party Annual Conference at Horsham to realise the repetitious and sterile line of argument that is used on rural audiences. </para>
          <para>So let us see what a farmer's government has done for the dairy farmer. Of the 4 most senior people in the Cabinet, three are farmers. Of the 12 Cabinet members, six are farmers. Of the 25 Ministers in the Ministry, nine are farmers. It has taken this farmer's Government 17 months to introduce a first step on the road to dairy marketing reform the rule of which is to change a voluntary arrangement into a compulsory one. Big deal! No wonder beef farmers are predicting that the Government could lose 13 seats in rural areas at the next election. The slogan 'Only Butter Butters' is now being joined by 'Only Sinclair Dithers'. What has been happening to this great industry while the Government has been dithering? It has been going backwards, and well the Government knows it. </para>
          <para>Taking Australian Bureau of Statistics data for the period 31 March 1971 to 31 March 1975 the number of dairy holdings declined by over 26 per cent with the number of properties dropping from 54 841 to 40 490. If herds under 30 cows were excluded from these figures on the grounds that most farmers in this category are not specialist dairy farmers, then the decline is still in excess of 23 per cent. These figures do not necessarily represent a fall in production of the percentage stated as the tendency is for average herd size to increase and cow numbers have dropped by only some 9 per cent for the same period. But since this period and particularly for the period that this Government has been in office, and taking into account the drought in Victoria in 1976, and State trends in the decline in farm numbers, it is probable that today the number of holdings is now down to 33 000. That would be a drop of nearly 40 per cent in 7 years. With figures like these it is no wonder that many dairy farmers, or should I say ex-dairy farmers, regard the Government's inaction with cynicism. </para>
          <para>All Governments in Australia and all in the industry have known or should have known of the long term prospects for the industry. Although the facts have not prevented State governments and politicians from encouraging more production for parochial reasons, the trend has been plain and apprehendable for those that would read, listen and see. Britain's entry into the Common Market, France's continuing intransigence with respect to domestic subsidisation, the European Economic Community's overall policies, the problems faced by New Zealand and the volatility of prices on the world market, given small changes in the volume traded, have all been known for a long while. On the domestic scene although the fluid market is strong, <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> consumption is declining. The impact of margarine as a competitor for butter is causing severe problems for the manufacturing milk sector and the processing industry, being over capitalised and under specialised, is engaged in a process of rationalisation. Measures of assistance for rationalisation and readjustment have helped some people out of the industry. But for many the economists' euphemism of adjustment' has meant getting out without any compensation. The reason and the blame for this sorry state of affairs must be laid at the doors of previous Liberal-Country Party governments through the 1960s which encouraged the dairy industry and led it to believe in a fool 's paradise without pointing to the inevitable. If there are any dairy farmers who do not believe the industry is in the process of adjusting to a level of production at or near local consumption then I believe they should read the statements of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tony</inline> Webster of the Australian Dairy Corporation at this year's Outlook Conference. </para>
          <para>The Dairy Industry Assistance Levy Bill relates to the powers to impose a levy on market milk, which will raise concern in many quarters, particularly in New South Wales, but it is to be hoped that the need for such a levy will not be prompted and that available fluid markets will continue to be shared more equitably in the </para>
          <para class="block">States. The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1 977 which is also being considered in this cognate debate is to be welcomed because it sensibly sets up an advisory committee to phase out the equalisation committees without conflict and to centralise marketing and administrative power in the Australian Dairy Corporation. In the Minister's second reading speech on the Dairy Industry Assistance Bill reference was made to the blanket provisions on access to properties, power to call for books and returns and to set up virtually an inspectorate and a disbursement scheme on the lines of Commonwealth Egg Marketing Authority legislation in the poultry industry. It is to be hoped that the mechanisms of inspection and enforcement of the Act do not lead to the conflict and excessive bureaucracy that is causing concern in the egg industry where the cost of orderly marketing seems to be out of all proportion. </para>
          <para>Finally, it seems that the Australian Agricultural Council in February this year largely agreed to Stage II of the IAC recommendations; this stage to commence possibly on 1 January 1978. Although some States are baulking at Stage II, it is essential for the Minister to initiate more discussions on national entitlement measures. That date, 1 January 1978, is very close and any decision on Stage II not well appreciated by the farmers themselves is going to cause governments much difficulty in the implementation phase. The tardiness that has marked the Government's approach to this industry to date must not be allowed to continue. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-Congratulations to the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> on the rapid progress he has made to stabilise the Australian dairy industry since the Liberal and National Country parties were returned to power 18 months ago. I emphasise rapid in view of the recent years of indecision within the industry about the need to adjust to the real market situation following final exclusion from the British market, the threat to domestic orderly marketing following the Labor Government's abolition of the bounty and the reliance on a voluntary equalisation scheme without a bounty incentive. There was also the inappropriateness of a private company administering the financial mechanism of equalisation. There is also the changing dairy products consumption pattern domestically with the removal of margarine quotas, once again by the Labor Government, and internationally with the loss of the British bulk butter and cheese markets. Furthermore, when we returned to office the export manufacturing sector of the industry faced chaos due to the collapse of the international skim milk powder market and the failure of the Labor Government to agree to an industry request several months earlier to support the industry by underwriting a minimum equalised price. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government, at the urging of the Minister for Primary Industry and a number of Government back benchers, moved quickly to provide underwriting at approximately 50c per lb fat in whole milk in March last year and thus prevented the breakdown of orderly marketing and farmer and factory bankruptcy. Since then underwriting has been progressively increased to 60c and now approximately 60c to 65c per lb. The Minister already has announced continuation of the 60c to 65c per lb level of underwriting for the 1977-78 season- an announcement made in good time to allow the industry administrators and producers to plan for the new season. I have only one contradictory comment on the new underwriting; that is, that full cream powder should be included as it will be included in the new equalisation arrangements for 1977-78. </para>
          <para>The first report of the Industries Assistance Commission in 1975 recommended no specific action on restructuring the dairy industry and handed the matter over to the industry. The industry organisations were unable to resolve the issues confronting the industry; so the Minister for Primary Industry moved quickly once again to refer the matter back to the IAC, but this time he stipulated a time limit and required the IAC to make specific recommendations. The IAC reported in September 1976. Following a series of Australian Agricultural Council meetings the first stage of a 3-stage proposal is before the Parliament today. It is a proposal that was necessarily amended after consultation with the industry, the States, and Government back benchers. In the meantime the continuation of underwriting has kept the industry stable and in a reasonable if not prosperous state. The underwriting has cost the Commonwealth Government approximately $10m since its inception last year and it could cost the Commonwealth Government far more in the coming year. </para>
          <para>Stage I really only makes the present voluntary equalisation arrangements for manufactured dairy products statutory or compulsory by the imposition of a levy. That is a simple but important and fundamental breakthrough for the orderly marketing of dairy products. In fact, the use of the levy is of tremendous importance to primary industry stabilisation generally. Those who challenge it will do so to the peril of the orderly or stable marketing of all primary products in this country. Stage I is of greater value to the 2 southern export States- Victoria and Tasmania- and to a lesser extent to South Australia than it is to the deficit States of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales because it prevents any of the deficit States' factories from withdrawing from the equalisation scheme and just selling their product on the higher priced local market. The corollary or <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> of this compulsory equalisation of manufactured products is the compulsory or orderly marketing, if you like, or continued stability of market milk sales through the imposition of the market milk levy, which will be applied if and only if the market milk sector is threatened by imminent breakdown. </para>
          <para>The other aspects of the legislation include a Reserve Bank or government guaranteed advance payment procedure to overcome a possible short term liquidity problem with the product levy for both the factory and the farmer. Secondly, the equalisation function will be assumed by the Australian Dairy Corporation, which is in line with the control by the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wheat Board of the financial mechanisms or arrangements of those industries. A dairy industry advisory committee will be established with which the Australian Dairy Corporation will be required to consult to allow a greater accountability by the Corporation to the various sectors of the industry. I suggest to the dairy industry that once the new arrangement is working satisfactorily it should look at the direct election and accountability mechanisms in the consultative committees which will be there to support the new Meat and Live-stock Corporation; in other words, a further degree of accountability back to the 2 major sectors of the dairy industry- the producers and the manufacturers. Unfortunately, condensery products will not be included until Stage II. It is unfortunate because all major products and all major sectors of the dairy industry should be included. </para>
          <para>The contradictory criticism coming from the various States over the Stage I proposals and the market milk levy indicates that the Minister has trodden a fairly neutral and constructive path with this legislation. Those who cry that a lack of justice has been shown to the Victorian dairy farmers- I am a Victorian dairy farmer- because of the market milk levy overlook the fact that the States jealously retain their power over intrastate milk, the Victorian Government no less than the others. Fortunately the States are at last beginning to equalise their market milk arrangements; in some cases, such as in New South Wales, it is done without reasonable compensation and in others, such as in Victoria, it is done with over generous compensation and over too long a period. It is hypocritical for a Victorian Minister to claim that lack of justice has been shown because the Victorian dairy farmers theoretically cannot take on the Sydney milk market when the same Victorian farmers will be prevented for 10 years by that same Minister from complete access to the Melbourne market and to cry about UHT milk- ultra-high treatment milk- being included in the levy if and only if it is found to be disrupting orderly marketing when Victorian UHT milk has been effectively barred from the Melbourne market for many years. However, it has to be recognised that there is a need for an annual review of the interstate sales of liquid milk, along with State aggregate entitlements, when Stage II is introduced. </para>
          <para>Now that Stage I is here the real debate is under way on Stage II. It involves a far more fundamental restructuring of the industry. The issues still to be resolved include the size of the national aggregate entitlement, interpool transfers, market signals and the inability of factories and their suppliers locked into a product range necessarily to respond to the ebbs and flows of the market, reviews of entitlement and transferability, and the inclusion or exclusion of market milk in the entitlement. </para>
          <para>As I stated earlier, I agree with the Minister's decision to stabilise market milk at least until such time as the new industry arrangements are in operation and the States have equalised thenown market milk arrangements. However, that raises the important question of whether, if the additional financial return for market milk is not to be equalised, then, as a position of minimum justice for southern dairy farmers the quantity of that milk should be included in the national entitlement; that is, that the quantity as distinct from its value should be included or, to put it another way, the butterfat equivalent of market milk produced in a State should be included in the State's entitlement and the State should then be left to sort out how it will handle the market milk in the provision of an individual farmer's entitlements. </para>
          <para>The percentage of a State 's production that is used for market milk varies from State to State. According to the first IAC report, in 1973-74 it was 56 per cent in New South Wales; 12 per cent in Victoria; 40 per cent in Queensland; 35 per cent in South Australia; 48 per cent in Western Australia; and 20 per cent in Tasmania. The percentages now used for market milk would be higher. If the butterfat equivalent of that market milk used in a State is not included the farmers in the deficit States will not only have their equal share of the national aggregate entitlement but an even better entitlement, that is, their market milk entitlement. That will be the real cream, if you like, on top of the whole milk or the national aggregate entitlement and a very small or nonexistent non-preferred percentage, or skim milk. In the export States of Tasmania and Victoria there will be very little cream because we are looking at a percentage of 12 in relation to Victoria for market milk to a percentage of 56 in relation to New South Wales. There will be the same amount of whole milk and there will be a hell of a lot of skim milk. </para>
          <para>I have made certain calculations that are based on the production by 2 farmers of 30 000 lb of butterfat in whole milk in the States of New South Wales and Victoria. I have based these calculations on the New South Wales farmer having an equalised return of 56 per cent of his production at the current Sydney market price for milk and on the Victorian farmer having a 12 per cent return at the current Melbourne price. I have made certain guesstimates concerning production in the coming year and concerning the relativities between exports and home consumption and Stage II percentage of preferred and non-preferred entitlement. The example I have used is probably an extreme case now but in 2 or 3 years it will not be extreme. I estimate that without the inclusion of the butterfat equivalent of the New South Wales dairy farmer's market milk entitlement in the national aggregate entitlement his income on that 30 000 lb of butterfat would be approximately $40,500. The income of the Victoria'n dairy farmer producing the same amount of milk would be approximately $23,500, which means a gap of $17,000 between the gross returns of the New South Wales dairy farmer and the Victorian dairy farmer producing the same amount of milk. </para>
          <para>If the butterfat equivalent of the market milk entitlement is included in the national aggregate entitlement and therefore in the State entitlement, there is still a tremendous difference between the New South Wales and the Victorian dairy farmer. But this difference is reduced considerably. My calculations are that the gross income of the New South Wales dairy farmer comes back to $33,000 and the Victorian dairy farmer's gross income increases to $23,000. There is an approximate $10,000 difference still in favour of the New South Wales dairy farmer. No one could say that by including the butterfat equivalent or the quantity of market milk entitlement as distinct from the value we are by any means equalising the situation. I intend to send these calculations to the Minister for Primary Industry so that the officers in his Department can tell me how far wrong I am. But I would be surprised if the overall result is very different from what I have indicated. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Minister should allow adequate time for debate on and assessment of this most fundamental restructuring of the dairy industry. I refer here to the Stage II proposals. The Minister should be prepared to go against the majority of the States if they are not prepared to concede the justice of the argument that I have just put on the inclusion of the butterfat equivalent of the market milk entitlement in the national aggregate entitlement, just as that same Minister decided against the State with the majority of production when he introduced the market milk levy. I support this legislation. I believe that it is the most important and fundamental dairying industry legislation to be introduced into this House for many years. I congratulate the Minister on treading a steady and constructive path through the minefield that he has had to walk so far and I wish him well for the future. </para>

            <para>- I rise to debate these Bills as chairman of the Government parties rural committee only because of the generosity of various members of the committee who have refused to take my place in the debate. I thank them for their loyalty and I shall attempt to cover their point of view. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are debating 5 dairy Bills of great significance to the dairy industry. The first 3 Bills concern the introduction of Stage 1 of the Industries Assistance Commission dairying plan which was primarily involved in giving legislative backing to the old voluntary equalisation scheme. They deal with milk which has been processed into butter, cheese and other milk products. The other 2 Bills propose to place on the statute book a law that can be triggered by decision of the Australian Agricultural Council in the event of the emergence of any serious threat to the stability of the domestic fluid milk market. This matter was most adequately covered by the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd)</inline> in the excellent speech that he made a few minutes ago. Because I have noticed some misunderstanding in relation to these Bills it should be emphasised that the Government is not introducing levies on the domestic milk section of the market by virtue of this legislation. The Government proposes purely to put a law on the statute book in case it is deemed necessary in the future by the Agricultural Council whose role is to trigger such action in case of need to avoid any vast disruption to that market. </para>
          <para>Historically the dairying industry has never been short of its Messiahs, nor has it been shy in producing plans affecting future marketing. In my short memory a very interesting plan was produced by Edwards and Drane in 1959. That Edwards is perhaps better known today as the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Edwards).</inline> Amongst other matters they suggested a 2-tier price system for purchasing dairy production for the first time, as did a scheme put to the present Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> back in 1971. Since then, as the economics of the dairying industry have reeled from a world over supply of butter to an even bigger mountain of skim milk powder, and in Australia we have entered into extraordinarily difficult times of drought, the industry itself produced the Australian Dairy Corporation Plan, the Spectrum Plan and finally the Commonwealth equalisation committee plan. In the field of equalisation we have had the Norton plan and then more latterly the O'Brien plan. In the meantime Professor Crawford tabled on 1 1 November 1975 his first Industries Assistance Commission report. </para>
          <para>It is hardly surprising in retrospect that few people got around to studying this plan. In some ways I hold the personal belief that it possibly had more merit than did the later Crawford plan or IAC report commissioned by the present Government and on which the Bills under consideration today are based. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> stated that these legislative proposals are concerned only with Stage I of the IAC report and that it is hoped to introduce Stage II in approximately 12 months. The IAC, at least, looks on a slightly longer interval prior to the introduction of Stage III. Many members of my committee and State Ministers of Agriculture will not at this early stage look forward at all to that introduction. It would be a fair assumption to state that the Government parties rural committee finds no problem with the Bills before the House. On the other hand, it has several reservations about the legislation as it relates to the latter stages of the plan. Might I add that I personally have no particular reservations about the introduction of Stage II. </para>
          <para>Many of the doubts were placed in our minds by a most successful meeting held on 17 December last with representatives from the </para>
          <para class="block">Dairy Corporation, the Milk Equalisation Committee and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and representatives of various manufacturing interests, both proprietary and cooperative. In justice to those who were kind enough to attend this meeting, I must say that a full copy of the proceedings was sent to the Minister and I believe was studied by his Department. It was at this stage that the Minister for Primary Industry, chairing a series of Agricultural Council meetings, started to make real progress towards the consensus on which these Bills are founded It is perhaps true to say that the rapid progress made, greatly to the credit of the Minister, in some ways pre-empted the work done by the rural committee. However, it is true I think to take note of Bill Pyle, the  President  of the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria when he said 2 things of note. Firstly, he said: 'If you are going to introduce the IAC proposals, then don't tinker around with them too much because there is merit in the totality where alterations may prove to make the scheme unworkable'. Secondly, if I can paraphrase his remarks, he said: The situation of the dairying industry is in such an urgent position that action must be taken and people must see the merits in the total proposals '. The practical difficulties that then eventuated were, of course, that each State tended to make its own individual stand on one or several of the considerations. However, in spite of these difficulties, I believe we have before the House today a set of proposals which can achieve a great deal of rationality and which will work to the benefit of the industry as a whole. </para>
          <para>It is perhaps unfortunate that because of the actions of at least one State we are now posed with the problem in the dying stages of this session of Parliament of introducing quite radical changes to the structure of the dairying industry without a proper amount of time for debate. I seek leave of the House to table a Press report labelled <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Delays to Federal Dairy Marketing Legislation.</inline></para>

              <para>- The blame for this situation cannot be held to be the fault of this Government. It is obviously necessary that the new plan be brought in as of 1 July. Therefore, the squeeze on all of us in the late hours of this session of Parliament is obvious. It is also necessary to make one other matter clear to the industry. The new arrangements before the House will not in themselves mean any increased return to the industry. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para class="block">In isolation the new arrangements will not generate additional funds. However, I anticipate that there could well be a rub off in relation to returns to growers by a more efficient operation. But I make a proviso. It is apparent to many that there is an enormously increased amount of statistically work involved in the new arrangements. If that work can be carried out economically- some people think it cannot- I believe that some of this efficiency can rub off to the benefit of the industry. </para><para>I note that the  Chairman  of the Australian Dairy Corporation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webster,</inline> states that, given a normal season, production in Australia is estimated, for this coming year, to be about 5.3 billion litres of milk which is much the same as the level achieved last year. The drought of 1976 and the huge increases in the cost of production which have been borne by the dairy industrythis bears on the excellent speech made by the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> about half an hour ago- together with the consequent effect on a lack of competitive position with other producing nations and, a surplus position with many dairying commodities on the world market have all brought about a contraction in the size of the industry. This has been of great consequence. Much of the contraction has occurred in the case of younger dairy farmers who, unfortunately, have had a higher debt load. They have had to give away their vocation in life. I mention this aspect because they are from the very section which would have produced the dairy leaders of the future. Their loss is a very dire one to the dairying industry and to this country. </para><para>This contraction has brought production to a volume at which we should be able to sell our products at a reasonable return if some sanity can be brought to bear on the policies of other dairying producing nations. The Industries Assistance Commission in its report of September last year recommended the implementation of a staged mandatory marketing scheme for the manufacturing sector of the industry with a view to achieving a stable and viable basis for the industry. The Australian Agricultural Council and sections of the industry have agreed with the Government that the implementation of stage one should be from 1 July this year. As well as providing for compulsory, instead of voluntary, equalisation the legislation provides for a levy on prescribed products. The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill empowers the Australian Dairy Corporation to administer the levy-disbursement arrangements and sets up an Australian Dairy Industry Advisory Committee to give the best possible technical advice to the Corporation in the field of marketing arrangements. The Government has listened to further advice and recently it amended the composition to include 11 members. There will be one independent chairman, 3 members representing butter, skimmed milk and casein manufacturers, 2 members representing cheese manufacturers, one member representing other processed milk products and 4 dairy farmers, including one from the market milk sector. </para><para>The last 2 Bills establish, as I mentioned earlier, reserve powers to be used if disruption occurs in the liquid milk sector. These powers can be triggered by the Agricultural Council, by majority vote.

              <para>- Quite true. The lower cost of production in Victoria and South Australia will interest the industry in other States, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>There is still much to be done in relation to the dairying industry. I shall mention some of these matters in brief form. The first matter is allowances. Various allowances, for example to assist with storage and transport, will be reviewed. The Industries Assistance Commission has recommended that they should be reviewed. These allowances are funded under equalisation by the industry. I believe that some of the allowances may prove unnecessary. </para><para>Underwriting of equalised returns from sales of dairy products to assist in stabilising the incomes of dairy farmers is the next matter. The Government has extended this scheme for butter and cheese, as is probably well known to the House, to the 1977-78 season. Subject to agreement by State governments, a similar extension could be granted in the field of skim milk powder and casein. In relation to rural adjustment, the Commonwealth and the States will make $55m available in 1977-78. A significant proportion of this amount will no doubt be provided to assist dairy farmers. I gather that more funds can be made available when claims which might necessitate that action are processed. However, the implementation of stage one from 1 July 1977 is a major step forward. The Government and the Minister are to be congratulated on this action. </para></speech>

            <para>-The House is concerned with the Dairy Industry Stabilization Bill and associated Bills whose provisions are designed to bring some stability to the Australian dairying industry. It is a matter of record that the Liberal-National Country Party Government has always had a concern for primary industry in general and the dairying industry in particular as is evidenced by the support measures which it has introduced over the years. These Bills constitute another chapter in the rather sorry saga of the progression of an industry from the euphoria of the post World War II period to the present situation where, with escalating prices and diminishing market opportunities, chaos is threatening. I say it has been a stumbling progression. At times it appeared more as a bumbling progression where a diligent and efficient dairying industry responded to the demands which were made from time to time. The initial demand was that production should be increased. When increased productivity failed to achieve economic viability, it was said that efficiency must improve. This did not prove a solution to the dilemma. Various measures were discussed and some were proposed as to how rationalisation in the industry should take place. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I shall say a word for Queensland in the face of the commendable exposition given by the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd)</inline> who, understandably is concerned for his constituents in Victoria. I speak for Queensland because since the post-war period it might be claimed that Queensland has suffered retrenchment in the dairy industry with a fall in the number of producers from approximately 25 000 to 4000. In many respects the cause of that reduction can be attributed to the lack of concern, even total indifference, shown by other elements in the dairying industry, particularly in other States. While we talk now of market signals, one cannot be too optimistic about the people concerned taking heed of signals. The market signals have been there over the last 25 years. In the 1960s, notwithstanding clear indications that the dairying industry was heading for trouble, Victoria with cavalier disregard for the signals embarked on the development of the dairying industry. It had some encouragement to do this in the short term because under the subsidy provisions which prevailed at the time a substantial portion of that subsidy finished up in Victoria and Tasmania. Because dairying was carried out in a conducive environment, farmers were able to produce a high class commodity at a low cost of production. </para>
          <para>There were efficient producers in Queensland who had a greater need of subsidy support but they were actually receiving less because the level of production was lower. In that climate it was easy to understand how the Victorians thought these euphoric conditions could last forever. In the present deliberations it cannot be disguised that a cancer still exists in Victoria resulting from the irresponsibility of a previous administration which produced enormous problems for dairy farmers in Victoria for whom I have a strong personal sympathy. It is not unreasonable to expect that that cancer should be first excised and stability should be brought to that State- as it should to all States- before serious thought is given to a national stabilisation scheme which, in effect, gives a commonality to the prospects of the dairy farmers within that State. Queensland has been apprehensive that Victoria would look to be eased from its selfinduced difficulties by drawing on some of the prospects of dairy farmers in other States. </para>
          <para>I say again that Queensland has suffered retrenchment and it is insisting, therefore, that stage 2 be introduced at the earliest possible date. It is envisaged that stage 2 will be introduced on 1 July 1978 and this will not be a day too soon. It is totally unreasonable to imagine that the situation in Victoria can exist without a special effort within that State to resolve its self-induced dilemma. This would thereby deny the State of Queensland and possibly other smaller States the opportunity, long awaited, to establish some degree of stability within their States. Queensland is in the position now of importing its domestic butter requirements and that indicates the downturn of the industry in that State. We are at a stage now where, with a State entitlement, we can rationalise the industry within the State and hope to exploit the only real prospect in the industry of developing the market milk opportunity. At the present time, happily there is no serious competitor for market milk. We have not been able to withstand the intrusion of substitutes in other manufacturing fields. Initially there was a moral argument to withstand the intrusion of imported vegetable oils as a butter substitute but as the growing activities became established in Queensland that argument could not be sustained because it limited the opportunities of Australian oilseeds producers. </para>
          <para>The fact of the matter is that the retrenchment has taken effect in Queensland. We have suffered our trauma. We require Stage II of the scheme to ensure that we will not be subjected to further disadvantage. While the States have arrived at some degree of accord through the Australian Agricultural Council, it must not be forgotten that the acceptance by the State of Queensland of the introduction of Stage I by this legislation is dependent entirely on the assurance that Stage II will be introduced, thereby enabling the establishment of a State entitlement program which will protect Queensland from further intrusion on its not unreasonable prospects. I have pleasure in supporting the Bills and I hope that in the current sad situation they will lead the Australian dairymen to a happier position, one which can be arrived at in complete accord. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of this Bill and the associated levy Bills is to establish the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and set up the basis for financing the operations of the proposed new Corporation and associated activities in the meat industry. The handling of this issue by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> will ensure that he goes down in Australia's agricultural history because the bungling of the entire Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation proposal is a monument to 12 months of procrastination, indecision and, at times, bitter attack by primary producers on the Minister and the Government. </para>

          <para>National Country Party members, particularly those in Queensland, must be increasingly concerned about the criticism which traditional National Country Party supporters are levelling against the Minister and the Government. </para>
          <para>The ever-growing and publicised criticism by the Australian Cattlemen's Union in Queensland indicates that large numbers of National Country Party supporters are far from happy with the approach adopted by the Minister and the attitude of some of their traditional organisations. </para>
          <para>If we go back over the records, it is easy to see why the criticism has been made. On 8 September the Minister published a letter which he had written to various industry leaders about his proposals for the re-organisation of the Australian Meat Board into the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. In that letter, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During the past six months, I have indicated publicly on numerous occasions, that the present powers and functions and composition of the Australian Meat Board would be reviewed to ensure that the Board is adequately equipped to control and promote Australia's meat exports in the light of present and likely future production and marketing decisions. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Even this statement is a little surprising, because if we go back less than 6 months from September last year we find that on 2 April when addressing the Central Coast Graziers' Association in Rockhampton, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Meat Board is faced with an exceptionally demanding task of great magnitude. These set firm decision making tasks against a background of improving and protecting the interests of the meat industry. Too much criticism of the Board has been negative criticism. If criticism is to be made, it must be constructive. The Board has a difficult task. It has to strike balance, assist the Australian industry and ensure that Australia's meat industry can sell successfully overseas. It needs the highest managerial skills, the best marketing intelligence, the best context. In recent times, it has endeavoured to do its job in an adverse era for the meat industry. To my mind, it has done its job well. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These remarks imply that in April the Minister was satisfied with the Board, and contrast with his assertion of needing to proceed towards replacing the Board. Further, it is in line with the Minister's reputation throughout the country that he does not spoil a good story with the truth. Again in his letter attached to the statement of 8 September, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I believe that an early decision concerning reconstitution of the Australian Meat Board will be to the benefit of all connected with the meat industry to enable the Board to commence operation as soon as possible. It is my intention to proceed with the legislation necessary to amend the Board's charter as a matter of priority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am certain that most primary producer organisations understood these remarks to mean that a draft of the legislation would be available before Christmas and brought in during February or March so that the Corporation could have been operating by 1 July of this year. The Minister reinforced this notion of attempting to move quickly when on 2 1 October in a statement dealing with the re-constitution of the Australian Meat Board, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I can assure all parties that their views and comments will be considered by the Government and an early decision made on the nature and timing of any necessary legislation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the words, 'an early decision made on the nature and timing of any necessary legislation'. It was not until the producers' criticism reach a <inline font-style="italic">crescendo</inline> that the Minister or the Government showed any haste. In the process of floating his notions about the proposed structure of the Board and its powers and functions, we find the result is that the organisations representing livestock producers are at each other's throats and the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council is attacking both the livestock producer organisations and the Minister. This is somewhat ironic because when the Minister was speaking on the Wool Industry Bill on 28 November 1974 he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is essential that the divisiveness which Labor in office promotes be reduced. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What nonsense. I believe that the Minister has deliberately set about to cause division within this industry because he knows it will delay the implementation of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation proposal. Consequently, it is highly doubtful whether effective trading and the introduction of meat classification on a serious basis will start until at least February or March of next year. This gives a further lie to the election promises made by the National Country Party in November 1975 when it said a system of meat classification would be introduced after consultation with the Australian Meat Board and the industry. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has taken note of the statements by all the producer organisations and has received written statements from them. It has also received the proposals put forward by the Australian Meat Exporters' Federal Council. The Opposition does not oppose the concept of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. In fact, it is in line with its restructuring of the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. The Opposition strongly supports this new body. It also supports the structure and composition of the Board. We do so because it was what we devised and would have applied to the Meat Board, although the Opposition cannot help but notice that the proposal which the Minister puts forward is almost identical to the concept, the composition and structure of major rural product marketing corporations initiated by the Australian Labor Party in government and about which the Minister, during his period in Opposition, expressed strong reservations. In fact, it will be most interesting to see how the Minister and his supporters justify their support of this Labor initiative, because the Minister himself on 4 December 1974 said: </para>

          <para class="block">It will be interesting to see if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bungey,</inline> who is still in this Parliament, along with his other colleagues now on the Government benches, will express the same fierce opposition which they professed towards exactly the same restructuring proposal for the wool industry. At least in this matter, the Australian Labor Party is being consistent, which is not something which can be said of the Government. It is no wonder the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and other organisations are accusing the Government publicly of hypocrisy. </para>
          <para>While we agree with the composition of the Board, we do not agree with the way in which the Minister has structured the trading powers and we have a number of reservations about the levy Bills. It is proposed to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock Bill in some detail. I should make it clear to primary producers who may be listening to this debate that our intention is not to block the legislation but to try to put it in a form that is more in line with their proposals. We are strongly of the view that if the Minister had approached the negotiations in a different fashion and had been more persistent in talking to the primary producer organisations, this last minute rush would never have happened. The Minister is reaping the harvest of his own delay. </para>
          <para>Fundamental to the producer organisations' proposals, was a notion that the new Corporation should have unfettered commercial autonomy. There are differences in emphasis. The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Cattlemen's Union want absolute acquisition powers and the Australian National Cattlemen's Council and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council want commercial autonomy but have reservations about acquisition. The Opposition, like the Government, has reservations about the beef stabilisation proposals. The price of beef cannot be set independent of either other red meats such as mutton and lamb or white meats such as chicken and fish. </para>
          <para>Recent evidence has shown that demand for beef is relatively elastic and a decline in price will lead to a substantial increase in consumption. While not greatly helping the financial position of beef producers, the slump in beef" prices caused a large increase in consumption. From the industry's point of view, it is essential that the rate of consumption be maintained. However, sections of the beef industry do appear to have forgotten that the functions of the existing Australian Meat Board and the proposed Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Meat and Live-stock Corporation are to further the sale of sheep and goat meats as well as livestock. </para>
          <para>In 1970-71 during the dying days of the last Liberal-Country Party Government, the bottom fell out of the wool market. As a consequence, surplus sheep and lambs could not be sold and the price of sheep meats plummeted. That situation may arise again. The large scale factory type production of chickens offers a threat to both beef and sheep meats and any pricing policies must recognise that a fall in feed grain prices would intensify the consumption of white meats. Under these circumstances, the new Corporation cannot deal in isolation. It must be able to influence pricing policies so that if beef is being promoted the interests of sheep meat producers are not prejudiced. If the Board has to constantly refer to the Minister for approval, the Opposition believes that it will make it extremely difficult for the Corporation to meet this competition. The Opposition does not believe that much of Part II of the Act gives the Corporation adequate flexibility. It has doubts, for example, whether the Minister could adequately explain in terms of section 9 (4), what is regarded as 'commercial practice' in the meat industry. The producers' attitudes and marketing approaches are so diverse there is no such thing as an 'average' or basic model. What is commercial practice for one firm would not be for another. </para>

              <para>- In principle, the Opposition contends that the Corporation should be able to operate in a similar manner to either the Australian Wheat Board or the Australian Wool Corporation. It is proposed to remove any reference in the legislation to the Board of the Corporation having to seek approval from the Minister to act. Naturally, because it is a statutory corporation and there is a Government appointee on the Board, that person would keep the Minister informed in detail about the Corporation's operations. As with other major primary product marketing boards, the Opposition agrees that the Minister should have the power to issue mandatory directions. Not only does this protect the Government's position, but in the event of it being necessary for the operation of the Board to be co-ordinated with other Government trade policy objectives, the Minister is in a position to issue a direction and the Board shall comply with that direction. </para>

          <para>The Minister has precluded the new Corporation from trading within Australia. It appears that the Government wishes the new Corporation to have a limited scope within which to exercise its powers and functions. While the Opposition is not arguing that the new Corporation should go into the Australian market and compete on a daily basis with meat wholesalers and retailers, it is necessary for the Corporation to have the power at least, to trade within Australia. For this there are several good reasons, one of which is to be able to buy meat so that it can be sold in conjunction with advertising and other promotion work the Corporation might be undertaking. Several years ago, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation attempted to promote the sale of sweet meats, previously described as offal. It would have been helpful if the Australian Meat Board could have been more actively involved and the power to buy stocks of meat to sell as part of the promotion program would have been useful. The operation and interpretation of section 92 of the Constitution effectively prevents the existing operations in the Australian market from domination by the Corporation. To grant the AMLC power to trade locally would be consistent with the powers which have been given to the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Corporation. On that basis alone, there are no grounds for Government opposition to our amendments. </para>
          <para>One of the major innovations producers and sections of the meat trade are seeking to implement is meat classification. While there are strong arguments about the most suitable method to be used the strong consensus of the industry is that a clear, reputable system of classification is urgently needed. One of the major obstacles is the high capital cost of establishing facilities in some of the existing abattoirs. While the level of profitability of some meat companies does seem to be high, there are grounds for the new Corporation supervising and assisting with the introduction of a standard Australia-wide system of meat classification. It is surprising therefore that section 7 (d) of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill is identical with section 23 ( 1 ) and (b) of the existing Meat Industry Act. </para>
          <para>A large number of producers have accused the Australian Meat Board of proceeding very slowly with the devising of a classification scheme and its introduction. Although the Government in its election policy promised the introduction of a classification scheme, it has not publicly urged the Board to proceed with more speed. Unless the Minister can break his procrastination habit, to leave the final decision in his hands awaiting consideration would be a total disaster. The Opposition believes that the new Corporation should be issued with a direction to proceed with the implementation of a meat classifiacation scheme as a matter of urgency and top priority. </para>
          <para>Apart from reference to the Corporation's powers to borrow, there is very little detail about the financial arrangements, especially if the Board decides to trade. What is to happen if the Board trades at a loss? What is to happen with any substantial profits that are made? There is no similar arrangements that exists for the Wool Corporation or the Wheat Board. As meat exports have on occasions been the most rural export and in every year are extremely important, the Opposition contends that the funding arrangements should be more certain than they are. </para>
          <para>The Opposition regards as of paramount importance the appointment of an independent  chairman  and managerial staff of the highest calibre. It is pleasing that in the determination of salaries, the Remuneration Tribunal rather than the Public Service Board shall be the determining body. When the salaries are being determined, particularly that of the  chairman,  the Minister should, as a guide, suggest that they are set at a level so as to attract the best men from industry. The appointment of the  chairman  is a delicate matter but it must be raised because the producers' organisations have been unanimous in requesting that the present  Chairman  of the Australian Meat Board not be re-appointed. I will request an assurance from the Minister at the Committee stage that this will be the case. </para>
          <para>The final matter is the question of the producer consultative groups. The Opposition does not oppose the idea of the consultative groups but has some reservations about their structure and the role of the Australian Meat Industry Conference. It is understandable that the details should be set out in regulations. However, we suspect it is being used as a subterfuge for further delay. In his second reading speech, the Minister spoke about 'the electoral producers' of the consultative groups. This is vague, but is probably deliberately so. What it does not say is whether the members of the producer consultative groups will be elected by the producers themselves, as proposed by the AWMPF and the ACU or by the existing organisations as proposed by the AWGC and the ANCC. The latter two organisations obviously oppose election because they would be outnumbered by representatives from the other organisations. </para>
          <para>The Opposition seeks a clear statement from the Minister on whether he proposes that election to the producer groups will be along the same lines as current elections of members to the Australian Wool Industry Conference or by direct election by livestock producers. If the Minister proposes direct election by producers, we seek a statement on the proposed sheep, lamb, cattle, goat equivalent for the purpose of determining a common basis on which to determine an eligibility qualification. We also seek a statement about the minimum qualifications for an elector and whether voting will be on the basis, one man, one vote or a multiple voting system. </para>
          <para>The composition of the Australian Meat Industry Conference has not been stated. Prior to the end of this debate we trust that the Minister will have given some sort of guidelines to the House. The Minister expressed this view on 4 December: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As far as I am concerned, the farmer deserves a say on the Corporation just as much as representatives of the trade union movement deserve their say. He should not accept any move by this Government to destroy the opportunity of a farmer having a say in regard to the wages and salaries of the people he employs. We accept that the trade unions should be represented on the Corporation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>There are a number of other minor matters which the Opposition believes deserve less hurried consideration by both the Parliament and the organisations which have an interest in this legislation. The only good fortune is that due to the speed with which this legislation was put to the Parliament, it will be here for amendment in the near future. </para>

          <para class="block">Blaxland accused the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and, I think, the Government of prevarication. As I will explain later on in my speech the opposite is the case. He confuses the need to negotiate, and to give all groups a proper chance to express their opinions, with prevarication. </para>
          <para>The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill gives effect to proposals from the majority of elements of the industry to change the composition, powers, financial arrangements and salaries applicable to the current Australian Meat Board. The new Corporation envisaged by this legislation oversees the promotion and export of beef and veal, mutton and lamb, goat and buffalo meat as well as live cattle, buffalo, sheep, lambs and goats with the possibility later of the inclusion of pig meat and the export of live pigs. Statutory control over export marketing of meat has existed since the Meat Export Control Act 193S which established the Australian Meat Board. Changes have been made to the composition and powers of this Board on several occasions, including the Meat Industry Act 1 964. </para>
          <para>Since that time, with a large increase in the national cattle herd, a higher proportion of total production from this nation has gone to export. This simple fact has meant that the Government has to restructure the composition and powers of the Board for that internal reason and also for the external reasons whereby various countries, including those from behind the Iron curtain, now resort either to government to government arrangements for the purchase of beef and meat or, alternatively, by contracting with the wide variety of national boards and corporations. An understanding of these changed conditions is necessary to appreciate fully the Government's thinking in relation to changes to the composition, functions and powers of the new Corporation. I refer honourable members to statistics given in the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry on 26 May which point to the huge increases in production and the export component and the value of meat exports themselves in Australia. This has increased by 270 percent from 1964 to 1973. </para>
          <para>Likewise, there has been a big change in the pattern of exports associated with this increase in volume. In 1963-64, 90 per cent of exports of beef and veal were shipped to the United States and the United Kingdom. There is no need for me at this stage to point to the difficulties that Australia has experienced with all trade to the European Economic Community with its insistence on an inward, selfish and artificial internal pricing mechanism that flowed from the Treaty of Rome. Although prior to the United Kingdom entering the Common Market the sight of Australian frozen beef carcasses at Smithfield did little to improve the image of Australian beef, we were still far too slow in those days to encourage innovation and arrange for Australian chilled beef to reach that important market. However, the changing pattern now shows that more than half of our beef exports in 1976 were consigned to the United States of America with growing markets in Canada, Japan, the Middle East and eastern Europe. Australia is now the largest single meat exporter in the world. This has occurred at a time when many importing countries face strong political pressure to protect their own production. </para>
          <para>The restrictions that this has imposed on Australian exports have led to a potential instability for us and small changes in demand overseas have had large ramifications on our sales and on the price structures of Australian producers. Rises in shipping freights, in some cases exorbitant rises, have cut into the final realisations of growers in this country as has the undue use of industrial muscle in process and killing meatworks thanks to the irresponsible years of the Whitlam Government and, perhaps, a Labor Minister's insistence on using the civil service as a pace setter in wages and conditions. Those working in meatworks have been granted an undue proportion of the final price available from export meat. Nor is this the end of the problem. More than one meatworks- I am thinking now of Consolidated Meat Holdings in Wodonga- has had to close for long periods due to industrial trouble. In many instances those striking are receiving much higher weekly payments in their pay packets than the producers of the commodity they process. New innovations and upgrading of mechanism has not brought the increase in productivity expected. I have in mind Murray Meats in Murray Bridge, which, 2 years ago, put a hide stripping machine on cattle killed at that meatworks. By the time it had finished negotiating with the unions it was a worthless exercise as regards the returns flowing to that factory and to the producer. </para>
          <para>It is against all these factors that the Government has now produced the new Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. For nearly 9 months now, instead of prevaricating as the honourable member for Blaxland would have us believe, both the Minister for Primary Industry and others from the Government side, including members of the Government parties rural committee, have held negotiations with a large number of major rural industry organisations, consumer bodies and other interested people. Is this the honourable member's idea of prevarication? Everybody has not only agreed, but also requested that there should be change. In many cases there has been little unanimity as to what those changes should be. The Minister produced for consideration, as did the Government parties rural committee, a paper which was read out by the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hyde)</inline> as  deputy chairman  of our committee at a seminar called by the Minister in Sydney during, I think, February this year. All industry representatives were invited to make further submissions and to give additional thought to areas where it proved impossible to reach consensus. </para>
          <para>Because of the conflict of interests, particularly between rural organisations on the one hand and meat exporters on the other, the Government quite properly has had to adjudicate and come down with a structure for the new Corporation which it deems to be the most efficient method of streamlining its future functions. The national interest has been taken into account by increasing the administrative efficiency and flexibility of the operations of the new Corporation. I fully support the Government in the action it has taken and regard this new legislation as an historic move which is likely to increase the efficiency of handling Australia 's meat exports in all forms and likely to lead to a better feedback of information both to meat processors and exporters but, more particularly, to rural organisations and the grass roots producers themselves. </para>
          <para>I shall now touch on some of the reasons for my belief. Firstly, the powers of the Corporation itself have been extended. The Bill allows for this form of elasticity of operation by way of regulation. Matters of great concern to a more efficient pricing mechanism inside Australia, such as a system of meat classification, is a case in point. The sooner we can concoct an efficient method of harnessing the majority of meatworks to this system, the sooner Australian producers will receive the proper price for their product. There has been comment on the powers of the Minister included in this Bill. I seek leave to have incorp orated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard-I</inline> have shown it to the h onourable member for Blaxland- a paper setting out a comparison of ministerial involvement and powers under the Meat Industry Act 1964 as compared with this new AMLC Act. </para>

              <para>-It will be apparent to those interested in the technical features of powers that the powers in this Bill are similar to those of the recently formed Apple and Pear Corporation and the Australian Wool Corporation. In many ways the powers vested in the Minister and, indeed, in the Corporation are less than those vested in the Australian Wheat Board or in the Minister in relation to that Act. By vesting these powers only in the field of export and therefore in the field of handling, shipping, promotion and sale, all of which in my view are the basic ingredients of marketing, the Government has assured the maximum play of the free enterprise system in comparison with changing market attitudes of other nations. Likewise, the powers vested in the Board are consistent with this theme but protect to a real degree the deteriorating position of grower returns. The traditional free enterprise system 'of marketing the product will remain an important ingredient as new markets are discovered and promoted. I personally hope, however, that, where entitlements to the United States market are purchased by price cutting in other markets, the Board will use its powers to rationalise such under-cutting. The Corporation will, therefore, have power to cancel or suspend the licences of exporters who fail to comply with a Corporation direction. I am pleased to note also that in such instances there is a capacity to review the decision by appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>The composition of the Corporation, as is well known to this House, has been altered with a view to introducing a compact, cohesive working corporation with members of the highest possible calibre, particularly selected to cover new fields of expertise necessary in the interests of efficient meat exporting. As well as the  chairman  and the Government representative, 4 members representing Australian livestock producers, one meat export representative and two specially qualified members will be appointed. So far, industry organisations have, I think, been looking on the producers' consultative group as a group charged primarily with the responsibility of producing a panel of names- six in all- from which the Minister will select 4 representatives. However, the importance of this group is far greater than just this single responsibility would imply. The Minister has suggested that this group, and in particular its executive, should maintain a close working relationship with the Corporation itself. This should assure a proper flowback of information to all industry groups and to all grass roots producers in each State of the Commonwealth from which this group will be elected on a franchise which is yet to be determined. I personally hope that there will later be a voluntary arrangement between the producer consultative group and the export and abattoirs consultative group to form a joint executive for even closer contact with the Corporation. Be this as it may, it is necessary that the producer consultative group executive consults regularly with the Corporation and passes back all information necessary through the chain to the producer himself. On the other hand, I see the role of this executive as being the mechanism by which the full consultative group is called together from time to time. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel MacArthur,</inline>the present  Chairman  of the Australian Meat Board, has performed in his inimitable way, displaying his great personality to a magnificent extent to many of our export customers overseas. Nobody would question his dedication to the job and the hard work he has performed on behalf of the industry. This hard work possibly accounts for his recent ill health. But given the changing circumstances of today, the Meat Board was not constituted to deal with the proper flow back. It is vital that the new Corporation considers fully its powers under the new Act and makes quite certain that grower groups are kept fully informed as to the reasons why decisions are made. </para><para>It is also my belief, supported by a certain amount of evidence, that exporters have in many ways dominated the decision making process of the Meat Board, although producer representatives accounted for six of the ten members of that Board. To overcome this problem, the Government has cut the number of exporter representatives, which is presently two, to one and increased the number of those with special qualifications to two. It is fair to say that nobody was entirely happy with the performance of the Meat Board in the past, although six of the ten members represented primary producer organisations. The Government has therefore decided to appoint 4 representatives, who, together with any duplication of interests from the 2 representatives with special qualifications or from the appointment of the  Chairman  himself, in my view will certainly give adequate producer representation. Logic demands a compact and cohesive board and logic also demands a higher proportion of those with knowledge of overseas markets and trading rather than general industry experience to be represented for the first time on the new Corporation. We have proved conclusively in the past that we can produce beef cattle and all meat extraordinarily well, but we are yet to prove that we have a structure that can market that commodity efficiently. </para><para>As a producer of beef and fat lambs, I believe that we have the best potential structure to cope efficiently with the future problem of meat marketing. I say 'potential', not because I doubt the Minister's wisdom in the appointments he will make, but because there is still the need for producer organisations to put forward on their panels for ministerial consideration, the absolute top calibre of man available to sit as their representatives on the Corporation. If this is done and if the producer consultative groups function as they are expected to, the use of the word 'potential' can certainly be deleted from my previous statement. There is no doubt that, with increasing world demand reflecting an increased price and with reduced inflation and with some industrial peace, there will be an improvement of prices to the producer. I believe that this new Corporation will do more than play its part in achieving the results that all of us desire. </para><para>I should like to thank all of the producer and other organisations which have so frankly expressed their views to the Government Parties' rural committee and for the time and effort they have obviously devoted to forming their submissions, both written and oral. I hope that this enthusiasm and dedication is continued through the consultative groups once the Corporation is operating. I strongly support the Bill. </para><para>

              <para>- I agree. The impression I gained was that the honourable member believes that machinery amendments to the Australian Labor Party's political machine is more important than the amendments his Party introduces into this House. At least I must agree with him that the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> deserves to be congratulated for the fine results of the Party ballot. It is indeed a credit to such a young member to get such a high vote in that Australian Labor Party ballot. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection><para>I believe that the Australian meat industry requires a board or a corporation with powers and financial arrangements to oversee and promote Australian meat and livestock exports. For that reason, I am supporting the Bill that reconstitutes the Australian Meat Board as the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. I also support the Live-stock Export Charge Bill, the Live-stock Export Charge Collection Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Amendment Bill and the Meat Research Amendment Bill. We all know that these Bills are necessary so that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill can operate efficiently. All of these Bills are necessary because during the last few years there has been a decline in meat prices. This has brought about tragic economic circumstances for many, if not most, of the Australian livestock producers. </para><para>The Australian Meat Board, which was established in 1935, has been subjected to considerable pressure and criticism. I agree with the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who, in his second reading speech, said that much of this was unwarranted because, during the last few years, the circumstances of the industry have largely been beyond the control of the Board and indeed most Australian producers. With the output of the industry greatly expanded and the greatly increased proportion of beef and sheep meat being exported, it was only natural that a review of the Meat Board's functions was justified. All representatives of the industry seem to agree that an immediate change should take place. But from my observation there seems to be some difference of opinion as to what changes should take place, especially in regard to the composition of the Corporation and the selection procedure applying to its members. </para><para>The Minister informed the House in his second reading speech that the bulk of the powers possessed by the Australian Meat Board will be retained by the Corporation but the changes provided for in the Bill have received very little reaction from the industry, the implication being that there is widespread agreement with these changes. I am glad to get this assurance from the Minister because many producers in my electorate have given me the opposite impression. I have received many telegrams complaining bitterly about the changes. However, I have to be honest; I have also received telegrams informing me of support for the changes. A Press report which seems to be causing some concern to the producers stated that the Corporation will have to consult the Public Service Board when appointing its senior officials. The beef producers in my electorate are very concerned about this matter. They think that this will not produce the best type of person for the Corporation. Of course, this could happen. </para><para>Some of the producers complained about the Minister having too much power over the Corporation. However, the growing tendency to move away from the traditional trader to trader operations in my opinion makes it more important that the Minister has more power. I believe that in recent times a lot of our primary products would have been left unsold if it had not been for government to government agencies. I cite the example of the eastern European and Middle Eastern markets. We all know that a lot of government to government negotiations were going on in respect of the Australian beef trade with Japan. This being the case, I believe it is warranted that the Minister have a certain amount of control. Australia's obligation to regulate meat exports to the United States of America in accordance with a voluntary restraint arrangement also would require a certain amount of Government control and certainly inspection. </para><para>In his second reading speech the Minister stated that hopefully these Bills will facilitate a return to reasonable prosperity for many cattlemen who are disadvantaged at present. There is no doubt this could happen and that over the long term we will see a big upturn in the beef industry. This seems to be the general trend in all our industries. They have their slumps and then they pick up again. However, I believe it would be foolish to suppose that just by setting up a new board and changing some provisions of the legislation things will improve overnight. Many producers realise that the situation will not improve overnight. What is worrying a good many of them is that they may not be able to survive much longer. They are looking for additional assistance. </para><para>I am reminded of the buffer price scheme or the deficiency payments that they brought to my attention. In particular the producers mentioned the stabilisation scheme operating in New Zealand. They said that if New Zealand can provide some kind of a buffer price scheme Australia also should be able to provide the same sort of thing. It is well known that we have such schemes for our other primary industries, the dried fruit industry and others. I believe that these Bills should be supported and that we should look for some other way of tiding over our meat industry in this severe economic period. </para></speech>

            <para>- It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to be able to associate myself and my Party with this important legislation. Regarding the remarks of the honourable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fitzpatrick),</inline> I think it is appropriate that I point out to him clause 3 1 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill, under the heading of 'Staff ', shows that what he said about the Public Service Board is completely and utterly incorrect. In fact clause 3 1 (2) states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The terms and conditions of service or employment (in respect of matters not provided for by this Act) of persons appointed or engaged under this section are such as are, subject to the approval of the Minister, determined by the Corporation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That provision removes the matter completely from the Public Service Board. In representing the beef capital of Australia, it could be said that I have had more than a passing interest in the formulation of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the rural committee received in excess of 200 submissions from organisations and individuals. Honourable members must realise what a tremendous cross section of views was placed before all concerned. All members of my Party and I support the Minister and the rural committee in reaching a compromise between all parties. </para>
          <para>During the past 5 weeks there has been a considerable amount of criticism of the Minister and the Government. It is fair to say that no area has been more critical than my own or, for that matter, my State. It was unfortunate that such criticism occurred because more than anything else it assisted in dividing the cattle industry. It is not my role here tonight to canvass the issues that developed between the different organisations. Suffice to say that all the bickering and the different points of view should now be treated as water under the bridge. Industry leaders ought to try to reach a situation whereby they can once again put forward a totally united front. All persons who have been involved in the beef industry should never lose sight of the fact that we all- I emphasise the words 'we all'- should do all in our power to obtain a better return for the producers and at the same time to ensure that our export markets remain open to us. </para>
          <para>It has been of major concern to the Government that some of our exports have not been true to label. This was borne out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Egerton who stated on behalf of Qantas Airways Ltd that Qantas could not afford always to use Australian beef because there is virtually no quality control. The legislation before the House covers this aspect. There will be provision for the Corporation to have access to all export works, in order to check on quality control and to take the appropriate action if any group or company is found to be abusing this area of its export contract. </para>
          <para>The Corporation will now have a great deal more autonomy than the Australian Meat Board. In regard to overseas sales, the new Corporation will have extensive trading powers providing it acts within the confines of commercial marketing practices. The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> made great play on this tonight. He asked: 'What are normal commercial marketing practices?' If he does not know that now I can well understand why he did not make the grade this morning. The Corporation can act in this way without having to seek ministerial approval. The only time the Minister is to be involved will be when the Corporation considers there is a need to engage in practices that might well involve a financial loss to the industry or where the actions of the Corporation will in fact contravene the laws of the importing countries. In the case of these circumstances arising it is essential that the Minister be informed and that his approval be requested or we could find ourselves in a situation where the whole industry would be seriously disrupted. </para>
          <para>The legislation provides further for major changes in regard to who will be eligible to become members of the Corporation. For example, it has been put forward that the beef and sheep producers of Australia elect by postal vote their representatives to form the producers consultative group. It will be from this group that their 4 representatives will be chosen to take their places on the Corporation. That will come about by virtue of the consultative group placing 6 names before the Minister and the Minister selecting four of the six. In the normal course of events the first 4 representatives nominated would be automatically elected. The exporters and processors shall also set up a consultative group and shall also place names before the Minister for their representatives to be elected. It is also to be compulsory for any member of the Corporation to disclose any pecuniary interest if that member is involved with an organisation or company that employs 25 or more persons. That in itself is a major departure from the regulations governing the Australian Meat Board. </para>
          <para>Two persons with special qualifications will be appointed to the Corporation by the Minister. It is this area that has caused a great deal of concern to all the organisations. In fact, it has become the most controversial provision of the new Corporation. It should be agreed by all- I am sure that it will be- that if the Minister is to attract the person who has the ability required it would be foolish to expect that person's name to be bandied around as if it were some type of political football because, without a shadow of doubt, these types of people are already holding down very important and responsible positions. By the same token the Minister has indicated that any organisation or industry leader who feels that it or he knows such people should forward their names to the Minister for consideration. The Minister has said that the same set of circumstances will apply to the very important position of  Chairman.  The Minister has also clearly indicated that he would not and will not appoint anybody without first consulting with the consultative groups. That in itself is a major step forward. </para>
          <para>There is also to be a major departure with regard to the employment of staff and consultants. This is where the honourable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fitzpatrick)</inline> has missed the point. Previously they had to be employed under conditions laid down by the Public Service Board. Now the Minister shall have the say in regard to the terms and conditions of employment. This has been welcomed by all the producer organisations throughout Australia. As I have mentioned before, the Minister has abdicated his power in many areas so as to ensure that the Corporation not only will appear to have more autonomy but also in actual fact will have a far wider and freer reign than ever before. </para>
          <para>I would like to deal now at some length with how this legislation will apply to the primary producer sector. As I have already said, the main proposal is that the primary producers elect their representatives to the consultative group. The intention is to hold an election in all States and the Northern Territory. The eligibility to vote has not yet been defined, but it is expected to be on the basis of the number of cattle and sheep held on a particular property at the time of registering with the Australian Electoral Office. The Government considers this to be a fair and equitable method because in the past a number of producers, and quite rightly so, have argued that their representatives were not directly responsible to the rank and file producers. By the method now outlined producer representatives will be directly responsible to their electors. That in itself should lead to a better liaison between all concerned. </para>
          <para>Some organisations have argued that the Corporation should be producer dominated. It is worth pointing out here that the producers are the dominating body on the Australian Meat Board and that it is a body that most producers agree should be changed. The producers will still remain the largest single group on the Corporation. While that is a very significant point it is not the strongest control working for the producers. If honourable members look at clause 30 (4) of the Bill they will find that a quorum shall consist of 5 members of which one member must be a representative of the Australian livestock producers. The significance of that clause is that if the producer members were to feel that the Corporation at a particular meeting in fact was not considering measures that would be beneficial to the producers in the short or long term they could, after careful consideration, withdraw from that meeting and, because of clause 30 (4), the meeting would have to be abandoned until the producers indicated that their area of concern had been rectified to their satisfaction. </para>
          <para>That is one of the most important clauses relating to primary producers in this whole Bill. In this manner the producers would have in actual fact sacrificed nothing by way of loss of numbers but in reality have enormous powers vested in them. That is one of the reasons why the Minister should and must retain the power of selection of members. One could well imagine the situation that could arise if, for one reason or another, an irresponsible person happened to be appointed to the Corporation and decided that he was going to subvert every attempt made by the Cororation. For this very reason the Minister will ave the responsibility to ensure that such a person does not reach this high position. Of course, the producers are expected to elect only very responsible people to the Corporation. </para>
          <para>That is not the only reason why the Minister must retain the power of selection of members, even though it is a very important and valid reason. Another valid reason is that the Corporation has to reflect the views of all the different areas of Australia and also must take into account that both cattle and sheep producers must be considered. If, for example, the Minister were to abdicate his power in this respect the situation may arise whereby the sheep producers in Australia could dominate the Corporation or, alternatively, the Victorian members could well be in the majority. If that situation were allowed to arise one could well imagine the outcry that would come from the cattle producers or the producers from the larger States- for example, Queensland. </para>
          <para>The Minister must ensure that there is a geographical and industry spread across Australia. I suggest that this could have been achieved by having an additional producer on the Corporation, but where would one stop if one did that? Maybe there should be one from each State plus a representative of the cattle industry and a representative of the sheep industry from each State. We should not overlook the exporters and the processors. Therefore what number would we have in reality on the Corporation? It was for this reason that the membership was declared to be nine in number and no more. The producer consultative group will be the body that must represent all the producing areas and all the producers likewise. The exporters consultative group should represent all the different areas of processing and exporting. If that does not occur the Corporation will surely suffer the same fate as the Australian Meat Board. </para>
          <para>We can all learn a valuable lesson from the Australian Meat Board. I am appalled to find that many producers are not kept informed about the decisions taken by that Board. I would suggest that the new Corporation should pay particular attention to reporting back to producers and exporters alike. For example, I can see no valid reason why with the co-operation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission a spokesman from the Corporation could not report back to the people on the outcome of any meeting after it had concluded. By this method, together with the reporting back by the consultative groups, most if not all people would be better informed. Surely that would take a lot of the speculation out of the many business transactions that occur almost daily. It would also assist in the formulation of better budgets from year to year. </para>
          <para>There is a new provision in this legislation in regard to levies. This legislation clearly states that the owner of a beast at the point of slaughter shall pay the levy. This legislation also deems that the point of change of ownership occurs at the knocking box and not at the scales unless a prior contract is entered into between the producer and the processor. This is a major departure from anything else that has occurred previously in Australia. As I said when I began, surely it is time that all the bickering between the different organisations stopped and we were all firm in the resolve that this Corporation will work. It can work only if we the producers and the people who are making the decisions decide that it shall work. I am quite sure that if we all work together this Corporation will become a major force in establishing a far better deal and a far better return to all producers. It should be clearly understood by all concerned that this Corporation will not be a panacea to all the problems being experienced by our beef producers today, but in fact it will form a base from which many innovations can be implemented. For example, the Corporation is empowered to continue with classification if the producers deem this to be in their best interests. I think that the majority of producers have deemed already that this is what they require. </para>
          <para>The Corporation shall also be empowered to investigate the best method to obtain shipping rates and so on. This has drawn some criticism from a number of organisations which have not quite realised the full implications. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> for example, has insisted that the Minister must retain power in this area. It is important that we all acknowledge that the Meat Board has not in fact been altered since 1964 and yet the whole trading circumstances have significantly changed since anybody last looked at or amended the Board. I am sure that the legislation before the House deserves the full support of each and every supporter of the Government, if not of all the members of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>I am appalled at the content of the amendments put forward by the Opposition. Never has anything been so hastily prepared and ill conceived as the amendments we have before us tonight put forward by the Opposition. The Opposition is claiming that the Corporation should have the power to trade within Australia. The Opposition members know quite well that the Commonwealth has no power whatsoever to trade within Australia. Nor has it the power to legislate for trade within Australia. That is a State matter. The Minister and the Government have said on numerous occasions that if the States legislate for power over and for control of the beef industry the Commonwealth will surely follow suit. But the first move must come from the States. For example, if the States want to set up stabilisation schemes, they must have the approval of the Agricultural Council to do so and then the Commonwealth Government legislates accordingly. I give my full support to the Bill. I wish it a speedy passage. I also wish and hope that the Corporation will be implemented in the very near future. </para>

Secondly, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Carige)</inline> on his magnificent contribution. </para>

          <para class="block">Those of us on this side of the House are fully aware of the great contribution that the honourable member has made in relation to this legislation. I am sure that most honourable members who followed his speech intently will fully appreciate what he had to say. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt in my mind that this legislation is important. I fully appreciate that the Government naturally wants to dispense with this legislation tonight so that it can go to another place and so become law in the very near future. Those people who are interested in the meat industry will appreciate that we are dealing with a very contentious issue. We have on the one hand exporters opposing the legislation because we are proposing to reduce the size of their representation from two on the Australian Meat Board to one on the new Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. Some primary producer organisations are opposing the legislation for a similar reason in so much as their representation is to be reduced from six to four. I am sure that if the Minister who has made a great study of this legislation were to try to agree with all the requests that he has had put to him in recent times we would have a corporation made up of 30, 50 or even 100 members. We would need a body of this size if the Minister were to try to fulfil the wishes of those people who would like to be represented. The demand for a greater grower and exporter representation has been outlined in the Bill. The grower organisations are divided by States. They are divided between difference sections within the industry such as lamb, mutton and beef producers. Then, of course, 3 major federal organisations all want a voice for representation. No doubt many of these organisations would like to have a majority of representation on the Corporation. </para>
          <para>It is obvious that the main opposition to this Bill by the Victorian Farmers Union concerns a lack of grower representation on the Corporation. This organisation believes that it should automatically have a majority of the 9 members appointed by this Government. Over the years I have watched the activities of the Meat Board. It is obvious to me that there has been a great deal of criticism of its actions. The view has been put forward that if 6 growers out of a total of eleven on the Meat Board failed to meet the requirements of the industry we should well ask the questions: Did the 2 exporters with all thenknowledge sway the 6 growers? Did the Board have sufficient independent experts when making decisions? Did the 6 growers have enough time and ability to convey the problems to the industry? These are but some of the questions that are very much in doubt in the minds of people, including many primary producers. </para>
          <para>It is obvious that strong opposition is coming from the exporters who are to have their representation reduced and some of the organisations which believe that the industry itself should have a majority on the Corporation. The exporters claim that once the stock are slaughtered it virtually becomes the property of the exporter and that with only one representative they could eventually lose their influence. I do not argue that case one way or the other. The cattlemen's union based in Queensland, which is another great critic of the legislation, is a com- paratively new organisation and no doubt it has een formed only as a result of the very low beef prices. It is my belief that the meat industry is far too important to have people playing industrial politics with it. If we want a first class system of selling stock on the one hand and meat on the other we must look to expertise. The States have the responsibility of marketing and this can quite easily flow to the Commonwealth through the Australian Agricultural Council. Unless the industry is prepared to adopt this principle there is little future for an overall Australian marketing system which is acceptable to all sectors of the industry. Those people who are so inclined to believe that they should hand over their industry to the Commonwealth Government of course must suffer the consequences. </para>
          <para>I believe that this Bill is a genuine attempt to try to solve the problems that have plagued the industry for so long. When prices have been high or reasonable growers have been reluctant to do very much about the situation. Today we find that Australia is producing too much beef to match a reluctant buying consumer. The Minister in his second reading speech reminded the House that since 1964 beef cattle numbers have increased from 14 million head to 30 million head. So we have a situation in which, as I have said, Australia is producing too much beef to match a reluctant buying consumer. At the same time we are seeing a terrific increase in the purchase of sheep meats. So we have a situation in which beef producers are almost going broke while mutton producers are doing very well. This Bill, of course, will not cure this anomaly but it will place one section of the industry in a position where it will at least endeavour to match the world problem. </para>
          <para>I can fully appreciate and understand the feeling of growers at the moment. I can appreciate their desire to boycott cattle sales in an effort to draw the attention of the world at large to their plight. But in my mind a deliberate move to withhold stock from market will not rectify the situation. What is required is a marketing system, which takes into consideration the quantity or production in keeping with demand, not just in Australia or in one corner of the globe but based on world requirements. It is not an easy situation to resolve. Price and cost, of course, are of the utmost importance. So, it is obvious that the major problem now is that, while we have an unlimited spiral in cost, the future of primary producers in this field is very much in doubt. I commend the Minister for the introduction of this major meat industry legislation. I know that in recent times he has come in for a lot of criticism. </para>

              <para>- It is most unfair criticism. Most of this criticism has been brought about by people who, to my mind, do not understand all the ramifications of the problems of the industry. In my electorate there has been a great deal of criticism of the Minister. I am equally sure that it has been brought about by people who do not know how much time and energy he has expended in preparing this legislation. It is interesting to note that for years growers have been somewhat critical of the existing Australian Meat Board. The general cry has been: 'What about re-organising the Meat Board and giving it more teeth and more authority?' So, the present Minister for Primary Industry in conjunction with his colleagues has worked on this matter for quite some time to produce this legislation. Following the announcement of the legislation many of those critics who once believed the Meat Board was ineffective, are now criticising simply to try to secure a board or corporation which basically will concentrate on individual interests and not on the industry as a whole. I am quite convinced that, once growers really understand this legislation and once the corporation becomes effective, most of those critics of the past will change their views and accept the corporation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>To my mind, when this legislation is implemented there will be room for improvement in our marketing methods. There is no disputing this. However, I do not believe that it is a case of the responsibility falling on the Commonwealth. Rather, it is up to the industry organisations to get together, particularly on a State level, work out what they require and then put their submissions through the Australian Agricultural Council. I believe that by doing this the meat industry will have come a long way towards solving its problems. I go along with the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating),</inline> who is the spokesman for the Opposition, in relation to his remarks on meat classifications. This is an area in which the industry must make a more definite move instead of throwing the responsibility on the Commonwealth. As I have said, one of the criticisms which have been put forward by the growers is that they have only four out of nine members on the proposed corporation. </para>
          <para>But, of course, there is the possibility that the  chairman  could be a producer and this would give them a total of 5 members or a majority. If 4 strong primary producers cannot convince one of the remaining 5 members of their point of view, either their case is weak or the members may be weak. I think that this is an important point of which growers must be reminded when they are being critical of this so called minority. I am sure that if a suitable primary producer could be found to fill the position of  chairman,  the Minister would appoint that person. After all, this certainly would not be the first occasion on which a Minister has appointed a primary producer to the important position of  chairman.  This appointment would give primary producers the majority they require. </para>
          <para>To me it is far more important that the personnel of the corporation must be the best possible. Today the industry is looking for salesmen who can put a strong case on behalf of producers. If one finds oneself in court because one has a speeding charge, one does not go to another speedster to defend one. One will try to secure the best brains possible. That is exactly what we are trying to do in relation to this Bill. We are making sure that there are sufficient brains available to represent the growers and their all important issues. We want people to assist in the marketing of Australian meat, particularly on the world market. I can think of many first-class meat producers but they may not be worth a pinch of salt when it comes to being salesmen. </para>
          <para>The wheat industry has been held up as a perfect example of successful marketing by a grower controlled board. I wish to make 2 points in relation to this matter. Firstly, wheat is a comparatively easy commodity to handle and it can be stored easily for a reasonable length of time. Meat is not so easily stored and its life is somewhat limited while the storage of it is very costly. The second point is vital as far as the wheat industry is concerned. It has one federal organisation, namely, the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, with one commodity to sell although it might have a commodity made up of 16 or so different qualities. So we cannot compare these 2 issues. When the meat industry organises itself into one organisation, I believe the situation will be different. But until the industry does that there is little chance of unanimity within the industry. I support this Bill wholeheartedly. I think this legislation is long overdue. I again compliment the Minister and the  chairman  of the Government Parties Rural Committee. That Committee spent a great deal of rime on this matter. I am sure that when this Bill becomes effective- I do not believe it will take until March next year as the spokesman for the Opposition has said-that will be the time when the growers of this nation will fully appreciate its importance. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased to support the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation Bill as its introduction recognises the very dire straits that the beef industry is in and also the way in which the Government has let down the beef industry. The Government, with these belated efforts, is trying to overcome those deficiencies. There is no doubt that the Government has let the beef industry down. We have seen a unique situation. It is something which happens very rarely in Australia. We have seen primary producers in Australia adopting a militant attitude and organising themselves accordingly. To indicate my interest in the industry I point out that a couple of weeks ago I was invited to address a meeting of Victorian farmers at a little place called Merino which is in the heart of Wannon, the electorate of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> We had a very successful meeting. It was a unique occasion where 60 or 70 farmers- a lot of them militant-sat down and talked across the table with 3 Australian Labor Party politicians. They were very glad to listen to us because they knew that we were sympathetic to their problems. They knew that we understood their problems. They found us much more sympathetic and understanding than some of the politicians on the Government side. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It was an interesting experience. Of course, it was the militant farmers from Hamilton who organised the first boycott of the meat and livestock auctions at Hamilton. Whose co-operation did they seek in order to make that boycott successful? They sought the co-operation of the trade union movement. With the assistance of the trade union movement- particularly the Transport Workers Union- the boycott was successful. It was so successful at Hamilton that some livestock producers in Queensland were encouraged to do the same thing. They showed their disgust at the way in which the Government was handling their situation by putting on a boycott at Rockhampton. Last week we had another boycott at Horsham. These are indications of the dissatisfaction of the producers at the way in which the Government has misled the industry, has not looked after industry interests and at the contrary advice which it is getting from the Government. </para>
          <para>Only a few weeks ago the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> was telling the producers to withhold their stocks. That is what they did. But when they did what the Leader of the National Country Party told them, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> turned around and criticised them for doing that. No wonder they have lost confidence in the Government. When one looks at the results that the meat exporters have achieved one can see who has been profiting from the bad management of the Government. We all know that the meat exporters have been showing increased profits for the last two or three years at the expense of the producers. </para>
          <para>Returning to the meeting, I must tell the House of the concern these farmers have about the Meat and Live-stock Corporation. Firstly, they were very concerned about the inconsistency of the advice they were getting from the leaders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> who were putting opposing views. There were very concerned about the overriding authority of the Minister and about the lack of clarity in the selection of the consultative committees. They were very concerned about all the things which have not been set out in this legislation and which are to be left to the regulations. A very wide ranging set of conditions are to be left to the regulations over which this Parliament will have not control whatsoever. They were concerned about the lack of producer representation and they were particularly concerned about the timing. I hope I am wrong but I cannot see how this Corporation is going to get off the ground before next March. The Government has not said how the consultative committees are to be selected. It has not outlined the basis on which representation is to be based and it will take a long time for the producers to get their representatives into the field, and for all the other sectors of the industry which need to be represented to organise themselves. </para>
          <para>These people had reached the stage where they realised that to do anything about thenindustry they had to accept some form of government intervention in the marketing of meat. They had to accept a degree of socialisation, not in the production of meat but in the marketing of meat. They are prepared to accept that. That is what they want, but it took the Government a long time to respond to the needs and requests of the industry. It will be interesting to see whether the producers still think that their marketing needs to be socialised in 18 months or 2 years time, when the beef industry starts to recover, and I have no doubt at all that it will recover. In view of the experience of the last couple of years, I hope that when the industry does recover the producers will have the good sense to set up a levy and put aside some money in the boom times to carry them through the sorts of bad times they have experienced recently, when they have had no levy to support them and no support from the Government. I am convinced that some people at least will learn from their experience. They will have learned that sometimes through frustration militant action is justified. Even though they have been very ready to criticise trade unionists who take militant action, when they see that it is in their interests to take such action they do so. I commend them for doing that. I commend them also for asking the trade union movement to support them because when they work together they can be very successful. The occasion when primary producers combined with trade unionists to achieve some relief from their problems was a very interesting event. </para>
          <para>I was interested to read what was said by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sainsbury).</inline> He must have been in a great dilemma when he had to come to the rescue of the Minister and defend him against the criticism of some of his own constituents and of some of the organisations in his electorate. The United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association objected very strongly to not having enough producer representation and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro had to come in and defend the Minister. I do not know that I admire his judgment but certainly I admire his courage in doing that. Whether he showed good judgment or not we will be able to tell at the next election. There is no doubt that the way this matter has been handled has caused great divisions in the beef industry, divisions which I hope have taught the industry a lesson. I hope too that the producers will learn that lesson. I hope that when the good times come along they will remember the occasions when they called on the support of the trade union movement to help them overcome their problems. I hope that they will remember the days when their returns were very low; that they will put aside some money during the boom times so that they do not have to ask the Government for assistance but can be strong and independent. I think they can do that if they are prepared to set up export levies when times are good to protect themselves against downturns in the market. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">The main purpose of this Bill is to provide interim funds for the continuation of Commonwealth financial assistance to the States for road works during the first 3 months of 1977-78. The Bill provides for the appropriation of $1 18.75m, that is, one-quarter of the already announced program of Commonwealth assistance for 1977-78 totalling $475m. The legislation currently before the House can most easily be considered by taking the funding aspect separately from the general question of the administration and programming arrangements involved in the operation of the Commonwealth's roads assistance program. </para>
          <para>First of all, as far as the funding aspect is concerned, honourable members will be aware that at the present time financial assistance is provided to the States for road works under the National Roads and Roads Grants Acts. Appropriations under these Acts terminate on 30 June 1977 and new appropriations and legislation will therefore be needed to cover Commonwealth assistance from the beginning of the new financial year. It is the Government's intention to introduce legislation in the Budget sittings to provide for continuation of financial assistance to the States for road works over the 3 years 1977-78 to 1979-80 inclusive. The new road arrangements which we will be proposing from 1 July next onwards do involve a number of significant policy issues. It would in the Government 's view be inappropriate to rush such legislation through the Parliament without the opportunity for proper study of the specific provisions of the legislation by members of both Houses. However, the States will need funds in the early part of the 1977-78 financial year to meet the Commonwealth's share of the costs of the road program. We have decided to introduce the Bill now before the House so as to ensure that the necessary specific purpose funds are available for the States. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the administrative issues. I think honourable members are already aware of the general shape of the arrangements under which our roads assistance program operates. However, I have arranged to have circulated to honourable members background material explaining in some detail the principles on which the scheme is administered. In very general terms, the road arrangements involve approval by the Commonwealth of road programs proposed by the States on which Commonwealth funds are to be used. Programs are submitted for approval in relation to works to be carried out by the States on particular road categories, for example, national highways, rural arterials, local roads and so on. This system ensures that the Commonwealth can identify the uses to which its funds are to be put. Honourable members will be aware that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> makes available to each member of the House- irrespective of party affiliations- details of the programs that affect his electorate. </para>
          <para>Since coming to office we have held extensive discussions with the States, mainly through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, on the arrangements which are to apply in respect of Commonwealth assistance for road works to be carried out by the States in the future. The Bill now before the House contains some general provisions which have the effect of allowing, by the exercise of ministerial discretion, the proposed arrangements to operate virtually as if the legislation to be introduced in the Budget sittings had, in fact, been passed. As indicated, the States themselves are already aware of what is proposed with regard to future roads assistance programs. They have been assured, and I now give the House the Government's assurance, that the interim arrangements will be administered in accordance with the spirit of the proposed 3-year legislation. </para>
          <para>I now propose to deal in a little more detail with the Bill itself. Clauses 1 and 2 provide the usual details with regard to title and date of commencement of the Bill. Clause 3 sets out a number of definitions which are needed in order to limit the ways which Commonwealth funds may be used in relation to road works. I would also draw honourable members' attention to sub-clause 3 of clause 3 which has the effect of allowing pay-roll tax charged by the States to be treated as an eligible item of expenditure from Commonwealth grants. This is in line with assurances given to State governments. Clause 4 provides the Minister with discretionary powers to approve road works. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the Commonwealth is aware in advance of the projects on which Commonwealth funds are to be used. As already indicated to the </para>
          <para class="block">House, this power will be exercised strictly in accordance with the arrangements discussed in detail with State administrations. It will be up to the State governments to propose road programs. </para>
          <para>Clauses 5 and 6 are essentially to permit funds to be paid to and used by the States in accordance with their entitlement to Commonwealth funds as specified in the schedule. Each State already knows its entitlement of grants for the full year 1977-78. In the first 3 months of the year each State will be entitled to exactly one quarter of its proposed full year allocation. The amounts for each State in this period are: </para>

            <graphic href="105131197705310_57_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">Honourable members will note that clause 6 also allows certain conditions to be attached to these payments. This has been done to ensure that policy objectives with regard to use of these funds are in fact adhered to. I would again stress that the Bill covers only a limited period and specifies the level of funds which may be used during this interim period. The Bill will be subsumed by the legislation to be introduced in the Budget sittings. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para>-A number of provisions of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Bill are very unclear and require clarification. Rather than move an amendment to each clause the Opposition prefers to seek clarification from the Minister for Primary Industry. Of course he will understand that if he is unprepared to give assurances we will be obliged to move amendments now and probably to move further amendments when the Bill is debated in the Senate. So I should like to pose to the Minister a number of questions concerning clause 7 (d), to which I ask the Minister to respond. </para>

        <para>Has the Minister had discussions with the Australian Meat Board about the introduction of a meat classification scheme? Secondly, has the Minister reached any agreement with the Board about a date for the introduction of a meat classification scheme? If so, will he regard those discussions as being discussions held with the new Corporation? Lastly, if the Government does not agree to the amendment circulated by the Opposition, will he give an assurance to the Parliament that he will act immediately on any recommendation from the new Corporation board about the introduction of a meat classification scheme? </para>

          <para>- The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> has circulated a number of proposed amendments. In addition he has given me a copy of a number of questions he proposed to ask. For the convenience of the chamber and the information of honourable members it may be easier if I were to respond to those questions. Firstly, discussions have been held with the Australian Meat Board. The present meat classification proposals that are in trial in a number of abattoirs around Australian are a product of those discussions. The Australian Meat Board has not yet come to a decision on which preferable meat classification scheme it should implement. Accordingly, the p resent position is that no recommendations h ave come as to the time when classification will be introduced uniformly. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Agricultural Council and I personally have been very anxious that there should be classification. However, as most members of the industry would know and honourable members on this side of the chamber at least would know, there have been enormous difficulties in getting exporters and abattoirs to accept classification. I know the Meat Board is very anxious to achieve a fairly uniform acceptance of classification as well as to be in a position to implement a preferred scheme as soon as it is available. Of course, discussions held with the Board will be identical to discussions held with the Corporation and it will not be a matter of beginning <inline font-style="italic">denovo.</inline> It is intended that as soon as possible classification should be introduced subject to the resolution of a number of matters relating to the cost of introducing the capital equipment, the personnel who will be required to operate it and the integration of those personnel with other people who are already on the meat chain. These are matters on which I expect either the Board, if it should be in a position to do so before the Corporation's commencement date is proclaimed or, if not, the new Corporation, should make recommendations at the earliest possible time. I can assure the honourable member that we on this side of the chamber have a very firm intention to introduce classification as soon as any recommendation is available. </para>

          <para>- I should like to say briefly that it is a very grave step when a government such as ours gets involved in the possibility of regulating a market. I can assure the chamber that I know the Minister for Primary Industry took this grave step only after realising the very strong fears of many of the producers that to some extent they were being exploited. That fear may well not have been reasonable, but nevertheless when we do have a number of companies involved in the export market who have a base overseas there is always that possibility that those polynationals can shunt profits overseas. I can quite understand the feelings of many of the producers who said we do need some sort of operation in the market, such as the proposed Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, to provide the right sorts of safeguards. That is one of the reasons why this </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Bill seeks to set up that Corporation. This clause, however, is couched in terms that one would tend to expect from the coalition parties. It states that the Corporation shall not engage in trade otherwise than in a manner which accords with commercial practice. This should provide some reassurance to the exporters who may see this clause as a possible means to bite into their markets on illegitimate grounds. </para>

          <para>- There are difficulties in extending the powers of the Corporation in relation to the domestic market. Honourable members will realise that there are constitutional problems in any area affecting the domestic maret. Certainly there is a doubt about whether a clause, even one framed in the manner which the honourable gentleman proposes, would be constitutionally acceptable. There is also another difficulty which flows from discussions we have had in Agricultural Council on a number of primary commodities. If there is a question relating to domestic marketing of an agricultural commodity of any sort, the power should be introduced only after discussions within Agricultural Council. The Council has discussed the whole structure and format of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. </para>

          <para>-In my view the reply of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is unsatisfactory. The Australian Wool Corporation has power to trade and process products in Australia without complementary legislation. Although we realise that there are constitutional impediments to such a provision, the Government could seek complementary legislation from the States, as it has done with the Australian Wheat Board, to enable the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation to trade within Australia. Therefore the Opposition will press the amendment to a division.

          <para>-The important thing to be understood when we are looking at this clause is the state of the meat industry as it exists in Australia at the moment and the way in which that industry is structured. This legislation is designed to cater largely for that portion of the Australian meat and livestock produce which is exported. As the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has said, there are constitutional difficulties associated with the introduction of a domestic marketing scheme in this country. The Commonwealth Government does not have the power, of its own accord, to introduce a domestic marketing scheme in Australia. As I understand the situation, the Minister has given an undertaking that if the States are able to reach agreement in this area the Commonwealth Government, for its part, will co-operate with them. In the meantime, the Opposition has moved an amendment to allow for what is, in effect, a domestic marketing scheme within Australia which obviously must be subject to constitutional difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline> is it appropriate at this time to talk about the second amendment that is to be moved by the Opposition or do I have the right to speak on that amendment after it is moved? </para>

The purpose of the amendment is to give the Board commercial autonomy and to ensure that the Minister is informed of any commercial transactions that take place.

Does the Minister have any guidelines which would clarify to the Parliament what is meant by this term? The Opposition is concerned that the procedures adopted in the meat selling industry are so diverse that it is very difficult to establish what is commercial practice'. Will the Minister provide these guidelines before the Parliament rises at the end of the week? Finally, does the word owner' in sub-clause (10) of clause 11 adequately cover all people who own livestock? Does it cover, for example, persons with livestock on agistment or livestock bought and travelled along stock routes? Does it also cover livestock dealers? </para>

The whole basis of the amendment is to ensure that there will not be a reference back to the Minister on occasions where there are non-commercial transactions.

            <para>- ... the Australian Meat Board entered into some arrangements with the Soviet Union. Well, I think it is wise that we do bring up those days because during those days the Labor Government entered into an arrangement which finished up in a very significant loss to the Australian meat industry. At the time that contract was negotiated, the then Minister for Agriculture, knowing that the beef industry was in a disastrous plight, came back and said: Don't fear, taxpayers; we are going to levy the meat growers of Australia so that you will be covered for the loss'. Of course that was one of the areas where this Government picked up the loss in order to ensure that those same meat growers, the beef cattle men, were not unduly disadvantaged. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The purpose of this clause, as it was written, is to ensure that except with the approval of the Minister, the Corporation engages in normal commercial transactions. In answer to the question of the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> there is no definition or guideline as to commercial practice; commercial practice is the practice by which the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation will sell under the same sorts of terms and conditions as operate in the normal course of the Australian meat trade. Of course there are occasions when, under commercial practice, meat is sold at a loss. </para>
        <para>I shall give honourable members an illustration of what I regard as a commercial practice. It is where there is only a marginally profitable sale such as the sale by the Australian Meat Board to the Soviet when, in order to establish a place for boneless meat in boxes, the Australian Meat Board offered a concessional approach. In other words, the sale perhaps was not at the best market price obtainable but the advantage of selling into the Soviet market for the first time instead of in carcass form, in hinds and quarters, in bonedout meat in boxes would be obvious to anyone. There is a saving in freight and a new product is being put into a new market. Now that was a commerical sale negotiated on the basis of being able to develop a market. But, when one is developing a market in a sense such as that where there is only a minimal discount, one would regard it as a commercial practice. But where there is obviously going to be a noncommercial sale or if the Corporation has doubts about the commercial character of the sale, the purpose of this clause is to ensure that it will be carried out only with the approval of the Minister. </para>
        <para>The reason for this clause is to ensure that, if there should be a sale of the character of that earlier one to the Soviet and if the Government is likely to have to pick up the cost on behalf of the taxpayer, the Government is forewarned of the sale. I believe it to be a very proper and appropriate practice that clause 9 (4) remains in the Bill in its present form for that reason. The clause itself is intended simply to ensure that the interests of the taxpayer and the public at large are protected and that sales of that character are advised to the Government, but that all other sales by the Corporation may be made in a normal commercial manner. </para>

          <para>-The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has pointed out the circumstances under which noncommercial practice can be undertaken. I think that it is a fair and reasonable assumption that the Minister should have the power of approval or veto if non-commercial practices were to be undertaken by the Corporation. Such practices could be discounting, the covering of loss sales, various types of export or new market subsidies. Such practices could have implications as far as international trading agreements are concerned- - for example, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Basically the principle is that in this situation of a non-commercial type of operation, it is the industry's money that is being utilised. Therefore, the ultimate power and the ultimate responsibility of the Minister should be appropriate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>At the same time, the Opposition appears to be somewhat confused as to whether it wants more ministerial powers or less ministerial powers. The Opposition, in its amendment, has suggested that the Minister be notified in writing at regular intervals of all purchases and sales by the Corporation, whereas before, the Corporation was only required to inform the Minister of its policy and the reasons for adopting that policy. It also had to seek the approval of the Minister to operate in a non-commercial sphere. So, I think that the Opposition should make up its mind whether it is seeking more ministerial powers or less ministerial powers. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition has moved an amendment to this clause which has the effect of introducing ministerial control into this particular power. There has been a lot of comment in the industry, particularly from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the cattlemen's union group, about the extent of ministerial power under this legislation. I want to take the opportunity during discussion on this clause to draw attention to some of the powers available to the Minister in relation to other corporations which exist by virtue of statute of this Parliament. Under the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act the Minister has powers under section 8 concerning the composition of the Australian Wheat Board and in relation to resignations and termination of appointment he has powers under sections 1 1 and 12. He has powers concerning delegations by the Board under section 14; performance of its functions by the Board under sections 17 and 18; approval for the appointment of overseas agents under section 20; payments for wheat under section 24; declaration of final delivery day for a season under section 27; the average support price under section 29; refunds from the Fund under section 31; the home consumption price of wheat under section 32; the special account for freight to Tasmania under section 33; borrowing under section 36; licensed receivers under section 40; and the operation of State laws under section 4 1 . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the Wool Industry Act the Minister has powers in relation to the composition of the Australian Wool Corporation under sections 8 and 13; the appointment of a deputy chairman under section 11; the granting of leave under section 15; vacation of and removal from office and resignation under sections 16, 17 and 18; the functions conferred by the Act under section 20; consultation with trade unions under section 20A; borrowing under sections 26, 27 and 28; the market support fund under section 2 8 A; reimbursements under sections 3 1 and 32; and profits and losses in relation to wool marketing under section 33. The Treasurer must approve the bank with which the Corporation deals under section 34 and investments made by the Corporation under section 36. The Minister, again, has powers over the functions relating to wool marketing under section 38; over other trading functions under section 39A; wool futures contracts under section 40; the flexible reserve price scheme under section 41; payments to the Wool Research Trust Fund under section 68; research expenditure under section 69; the application of the Wool Research Trust Fund under sections 70 and 71; research agreements under section 73; and restrictions on transfer of land and buildings under section 76. </para>
        <para>It goes on. I do not want to catalogue all the functions for the House but I think it is important that people are aware of the fact that this particular legislation does not represent the first occasion on which ministerial powers over a corporation have been put before the Parliament and instituted in the form of legislation. I could refer also- I do not want to take the time of the House on this occasion- to the Apple and Pear Corporation Act where similar and wide ranging powers lie with the Minister under the provisions of that Act. I think it is also pertinent to note that a comparison of the Ministerial involvement under the Meat Industry Act, which is the Act which this legislation is replacing, and the Bill which we are debating, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation Bill, reveals that the powers which the Minister has at his disposal are very similar between the 2 pieces of legislation. In fact, if there is a difference it is in the area of appeals to decisions to withhold or cancel or suspend the licences which, under the Meat Board legislation, was a power available to the Minister. Now it is not. It is a power available to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. With regard to the clause relating to staff and consultants, the terms and conditions used to be approved by the Public Service Board. Now the terms and conditions will be approved by the Minister. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)-I</inline> think the Chair has been pretty lenient with the honourable member considering that we are discussing trading powers in this clause and not cancellations of conditions to licences, which occurs later on in the Bill. I ask the honourable member to conclude his remarks by sticking to clause 9 which deals with trading powers. </para>

This is identical to a provision in the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act which growers have found entirely satisfactory. In simple terms it is in line with the general amendments being moved by the Opposition. They seek to have the Minister out of the kitchen cabinet of the operations of the Board and yet give the Minister a mandatory power to issue a direction to the Board to protect the position of the Government. We think this is a reasonable proposition. It guarantees the autonomy of the Board. It guarantees the autonomy of the Corporation. It is not just then subservient totally to the Minister in its every day actions and performances. Yet the Minister, if this amendment is carried, reserves the right to issue directions to the Board with which the Board would, of course, be obliged to comply. </para>

          <para>- Once again the Australian Labor Party has demonstrated how hopelessly out of touch it is with the industry. While this amendment is almost identical with the powers in the Australian Wheat Board legisl ation, it is quite apparent that the Labor Party is still seeking to put the heavy thumb of bureaucracy and government into every enterprise possible. It ill becomes the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> to try to intrude into this legislation in a way that does not exist in the legislation at the moment, in a more onerous and heavy handed way than any direction that is in the legislation, in a way that is designed to give the Government the power to manipulate the decisions of the Corporation, in a totally unacceptable form and in a manner in which not one of the organisations, parties or bodies, which are divided on almost everything else, has suggested. One thing on which they are united is that there should not be undue ministerial direction. Yet here the Labor Party wants to give the Government the power to direct what the Corporation does. This amendment is totally unacceptable. Although such a provision might appear in the wheat legislation, we do not believe it to be appropriate here. The Government opposes the amendment. </para>

          <para>- As the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has pointed out, the Opposition is totally confused as to whether it is suggesting that the Corporation should have more or less power. The amendment shows how ill conceived its ideas are, how hastily they have been prepared and how inconsistent the Opposition has been. I remind the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> that if he looks at the definition of the word 'Board', which he has used in his amendment and which appears under proposed section 5 ( 1 ) he will find that it refers to the Australian Meat Board, which is the Board that we are replacing and reconstructing in this Bill.

          <para>-For the information of the ignorant members of the National Country Party of Australia I point out that the word 'Board' refers to the Board of the Corporation. Perhaps I should clear up one of the points that the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> raised in terms of political rhetoric. He talked about the Australian Labor Party imposing a bureaucracy upon the Corporation. The fact is that the Corporation now will have to come cap in hand to the Minister for practically every decision. There is to be a bureaucracy which is supposed to be autonomous and which is in fact to be subject to ministerial control at every turn of the way. What we are saying is that if the Government is going to the trouble of setting up a corporation with statutory powers it should give it the functions to operate properly in a commercial atmosphere. Certainly let the Government have powers over it and let the Government be able through the Minister to issue directions to the Corporation. That is what we are arguing. It is completely consistent with the proper utilisation of the functions of a statutory corporation. </para>

          <para>- If I were to say that the performance of the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> on these amendments was lacklustre it would be a complete over-statement. Getting back to the direction of this amendment, I think I should mention for the information and elucidation of the large number of cattle producers from the Cattleman's Union of Australia who have been lobbying in the halls of this Parliament in recent weeks and who have been talking about the problems in this legislation with regard to ministerial direction that this insertion into the legislation that the Australian Labor Party would like to make really gives the lie to the Labor Party. It wants to give the Minister the power to give directions. In just about every case where ministerial discretion is provided for in the Bill the Minister has the power to review, the power to veto and the power to consult. The amendment is typical of the big blanket Labor Party clause. We remember that before the last election the Australian Labor Party was inserting a similar blanket clause in so many Acts relating to so many fields of endeavour in Australia because of its aim to gain more power. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It wants power over the means of production, distribution and exchange. I hope that the people in the Cattlemen's Union who, as I said, have been talking a great deal about ministerial discretion will note just where the aims of the Labor Party really are. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition has moved an amendment proposing a new clause 9A which purports to give more power to the Minister and the Government. What is interesting about this amendment is that it proposes to give more power to the Minister over the whole range of functions of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. The Bill as proposed by the Government gives powers to the Minister in specific areas where they are warranted, but the amendment proposes to give him power over the performance of the functions and the exercise of the powers of the whole of the Corporation. No question has caused more concern in the industry than the whole question of ministerial influence over the Corporation. As I said a moment ago- I now reinforce my earlier argument- the powers which the Minister has taken under this legislation are quite reasonable. They have been included only where they are necessary and they are quite specific in their application. The Australian Labor Party has made it quite clear by the amendment that it wants the Minister to have overriding control over the total range of the powers and functions of the Corporation. The Government opposes the amendment. </para>

          <para>-Only because the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> still seems to be totally ignorant of the legislation, I thought I should explain one matter to him. He said that the word 'board' in his amendment referred to the Board of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. I suggest that before he uses words he should look at the definitions clause to see whether there is reference to those words. Had he done so on this occasion, he would have seen in clause 5 that 'Board' means the Australian Meat Board referred to in section 7 of the Meat Industry Act 1 964. </para>

        <para class="block">This amendment is in line with the general view that the Opposition has taken. Clause 14 deals with contracts for the shipment of meat and livestock-carriage agreements. The way the Bill reads at the moment, such agreements can be approved only by the Minister upon the recommendation of the Corporation. We are suggesting that such agreements should be established by the Board of the Corporation and conveyed to the Minister in writing. There is a shade of difference in what we propose. The difference is mainly that the Board will be able to be more autonomous and can then convey the matter to the Minister in writing. We suggest that if the Minister were in disagreement with the arrangements, he could, under the other powers, issue a direction. However, our intention here is to remove the Minister from the position of having to approve every single, solitary action of the Corporation. Therefore we are proposing that amendment and commending it to the Government, to the Minister and to the Committee. </para>

          <para>- We have spoken about the capability of issuing general directions. We do not see that as being a way by which there should be control of the negotiation of freight rates. Although in the legislation it perhaps might be so specified, the power is not to be exercised by the Minister for Primary Industry; it is to be exercised by the Minister for Transport. Its purpose is to maximise the advantage of freight negotiations for all agricultural commodities. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The reason for the inclusion of clause 1 4 in this form is that under the International Air Transport Association regulations, in an unrelated area in the negotiation of freight rates for commercial airline carriers, the practice has developed that the individual airlines negotiate a particular freight rate which then comes to the Minister for approval. It has been suggested that that is the appropriate way for a common clause to be inserted for commodity boards. The provisions of clause 14 are far wider than those contained in the present powers of the Australian Meat Board but are subject to regulation by the Minister in the form outlined in the clause. Under this clause the Minister for Transport will be able to ensure that in his dealings, which cover a broader front than those of any individual organisation and particularly those of a corporation such as the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, the maximum advantage can be obtained. If, for example, there are other refrigerated cargoes he can ensure that they can also be tied in with whatever rate is set for reefer containers. If there happens to be- as the tragedy has been in the last few years- a number of containers which have not been in use, the whole burden of the costs of storage, the capital on those containers, the amortisation of the capital, the debt servicing and so on, is not brought down on the one industry. It is felt that there is an advantage in this general form. It is in order that the Minister for Transport can exercise final approval and help the Corporation on behalf of the producers. For that reason the Government persists with the original form which is included in the legislation and it opposes the amendment. </para>

The Corporation is to inform the Minister of any specific undertaking within a specified time. This is different from the provision which presently operates in the Bill.

          <para>-In fact, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> does not give the Corporation more autonomy.  His  amendment seeks to provide a capacity to direct the Corporation. Any amendment of this order needs to be read in the light of the earlier amendments. The Opposition has circulated a package of amendments. Let no one be fooled. The honourable member tells us that he is deleting the approval of the Minister. But he has inserted a direction-making power which, as a result of the report which is required under his proposed sub-clause 3, would ensure that, the action having been taken by the Corporation, the Minister or the Government would come in and tell the Corporation not to do it in that way but to do it in some other way. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The whole purpose of our specific drafting of this clause is to ensure that in this range of functionsall of them are a little broader in their general embrace than the things which have been done by the Australian Meat Board in the past but which may well be things which the Corporation decides to do- the Corporation has the initiative. If the Corporation believes it necessary, it can come along to the Government and say that it wants to do something. In the 4 areas where the Australian Labor Party has specifically deleted the reference to the Minister, the only difference in actual effect is that under the Labor Party's intent the Corporation would be subject to a subsequent direction of the Government in a manner which we would see as not necessarily being in accordance with the wish of the Corporation. In our proposal in the Bill, the Corporation takes the decision but it cannot implement that decision until it has the approval of the Minister. The Government cannot direct. It can approve. I suggest that the distinction between those 2 words is fairly material. In not one of these instances do we see that the interests of the Australian primary producer would be protected and, therefore, we are opposed to the amendment. </para>

          <para>-As a representative of an electorate which contains several meat works and as a director of an Australian owned processor and exporter in an industry that is dominated by some very large multi-national companies, I certainly have a degree of concern about the clause. I recognise the immense difficulties with which the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is faced in trying to resolve the irreconcilable objectives of various sections of the industry and I congratulate him on the skill with which he has avoided the twin rocks. I hope that he will look very seriously at the question of representation of the processing and exporting industry. Only one processor is to be represented. I suggest that when he is looking at the special representation, where there is a capacity for the Minister to appoint 2 people to the Corporation, he might give some kind of assurance that, if the one representative of the exporting and processing industry is not a moderately sized or small Australian owned processor, that section- the Australian owned sectionof the industry will receive some sort of representation. I believe that it is vital that this take place. </para>

            <para>- I declared at the beginning of my speech that I was a director of an Australian owned meat processing company. I thank the honourable member for the interruption. The Government has recognised, as it appears in the Minister's second reading speech, that it is vital for the Corporation to have available to it the expert knowledge and advice that can only be given by exporters who are involved in the market place day by day. I submit to the Minister that his recognition of the role which they can and should play in such a Corporation seems to merit either an additional member by right or else the special consideration of the appointment of one of the 2 special representatives from the industry. It is self-evident that one processor cannot represent the conflicting interests of Australian-owned as against multinational processors and small local operators. By the way, some of those small operators are in fact producer co-operatives. One processing representative reporting back to his consultative group will not have in this situation another representative from the same group monitoring his performance at the Corporation or monitoring his reporting back to the consultative group. I am not making any comments on the calibre of the people who would not be so monitored but it would be a safer procedure if at least 2 people represented such a diverse industry with so many different motives. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Finally, I suggest that the 50 per cent reduction in the representation of the processing and exporting industry seems to imply some severe and, I would submit, unwarranted criticism of processor representation on the Meat Board in the past. If it is claimed that processor members of the Meat Board have acted improperly, I believe we should hear the accusations out in the open. </para>
        <para>I must say a word in defence of the old Meat Board. There has been a lot of criticism of the Meat Board for its misjudging of the market. I do not believe that in any reconstitution we will be able to achieve a better result in terms of judging the market than we had in the past. Let us face it; the collapse of the beef market was simply and directly the result of a bad grain crop in the United States, of all things. If anyone wants to follow that situation through, the impact on feed lots was dramatic and unexpected, and the impact on the Japanese market was similarly so. Certainly that was the basis on which the collapse of the industry began, aided of course by the anti-rural domestic financial policies pursued by the Government of the day, a Government which is now in Opposition, a Government which imposed a levy of roughly $20m a year on the industry and then lent it back at interest to the industry which it had so destroyed. I merely ask the Minister whether he can give the industry some kind of assurance that all sections of the industry, particularly the Australian-owned sections, will be represented on the Corporation. After all, the industry owns the product with which the new Corporation will be dealing. </para>

          <para>-This clause continues to be opposed by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and by the Cattlemen's Union. It has the broad agreement of other sections of the industry. On the exporterprocessing side, the belief is still held that there should be more than one representative from that sector of the industry. I believe that, for any rational understanding of this legislation and this clause, and of the reasons for the creation of the Corporation, we must take account of the industry as it exists and as it is structured in Australia at this time. I am aware that there are sectors of the industry which would seek to introduce a domestic marketing scheme in Australia. That is not the objective of this legislation. As I said earlier, the Commonwealth Government does not have the constitutional power to establish a scheme to control the domestic marketing of meat and livestock. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has given his assurance that, subject to the agreement of the States to such a proposal, the Commonwealth would cooperate. Of course, such a scheme would require complementary Commonwealth and State legislation. We are now looking at the industry as it is presently structured. </para>

The Standing Orders state that honourable members may not vote without declaring that they have a vested interest in the relevant matter. I do not know of any standing order that prohibits anybody from talking to an issue. I do not think on my reading of the relevant standing order that the honourable member for Macarthur would be out of order if he had not declared his pecuniary interest if he wanted to discuss the issue. But that is a hypothetical situation and I do not think the Chair needs to worry about it. </para>

            <para>- While we are on the subject I suppose I had better declare that I, too, produce cattle. The Committee is debating the structure and membership of the board of the Corporation. I believe the membership proposed in clause 18 is fair and reasonable. There is a balance between producers, exporters and members with special expertise. The bulk of the powers of the Corporation aim at the control of the export of meat and livestock from Australia. The fact is that exported meat is not owned by producers but is exported by those to whom it is sold. It is difficult to argue that producers should have a majority in this situation. It has been suggested that exporters and processors are under represented. I do not argue against that. There is no doubt that producers are entitled to a fair degree of say, as there is a direct relationship between the sale and the presentation of their product overseas and the overseas prices achieved for their product. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have given a great deal of thought to this question of the structure of the Board of the Corporation. I believe that if producers were to have a majority on the Board they would be able to dominate the decisions of the Corporation through a bloc vote. If this were the case, it could be argued that there would be not much point in having other members on the Corporation at all. The Board has been structured in such a way that producers, need to win at least one of the remaining members of the Board of the Corporation by logic, argument and debate in order to achieve a majority and to have their views implemented. I believe that this is a far healthier situation than to have a straight producer majority. Similar provisions exist in the structures of other corporations such the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation and the Australian Dairy Corporation. I have heard no suggestion that these corporations are any less effective for the lack of a producer majority. The Australian Dairy Corporation has 3 producer representatives out of a board of eleven. The Australian Wool Corporation has 4 producer representatives out of a board of ten and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation has 4 producer representatives out of a board of 9. I think that the most important aspect of this proposal is that it is essential that the new Corporation be able to operate successfully. I have no fears in this regard. I believe that the Corporation will be in the best possible position effectively and aggressively to market Australia's beef on overseas markets. </para>

          <para>- I must initially express my interest in this matter. Firstly, I am a West Australian; secondly, I am a beef producer; and thirdly, I do eat the stuff. So I have an interest in it. I wish to speak briefly to this clause. I would like to say to the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that I understand the extreme difficulties that he has had in putting this board together and in endeavouring to look after all sections of the community. We all know that we wanted a corporation that was reasonably small- one that was manageable. To go beyond a membership of nine would be unreasonable. Being a West Australian, I ask the Minister whether he will make sure that the special provisions contained in the Bill regarding geographical areas will ensure that the different industry interests are looked after. In Western Australia we have different markets. We have approximately 74 per cent of the livestock trade out of Australia. This is not fully understood by the marketeers of the eastern States. We have built up special markets and we have special conditions with respect to those markets. The strongest representations have been made by grower organisations throughout Western Australia. I should like some assurance from the Minister that, if by some mischance a West Australian is not chosen by the producer consultative group to be appointed to the Corporation, a West Australian would be considered for one of the special representative positions. </para>

          <para>- I note the truly dispassionate interest that it being shown in this matter by all honourable members from Western Australia. In fact, I saw the Minister for Agriculture from the west in Canberra today, together with representatives of primary producer organisations and exporters, which was quite unusual in view of the division that has been apparent in the general debate leading up to the introduction of this Bill. Essentially, all those people whom I saw today supported the case that has just been presented by the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drummond).</inline> An obvious difficulty exists. Western Australia has a different meat and livestock trade from the rest of Australia. They have developed- full marks to them- particular arrangements with respect to livestock exports. It is for that reason that the Government has agreed that in future livestock export permits will be issued only after receiving the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia so that the particular trade that has been so effectively developed can be protected to the maximum and the peculiar circumstances in Western Australia can be recognised. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I can give no guarantee as to the regional base of any member of the Corporation. I can only be sure that Western Australia will be represented on the producer consultative group. One of the reasons why there is a reserve power for the Minister which enables him to appoint the members of the Corporation is to ensure that there is reasonable regional representation and, of course, at least one representative of the sheep trade and one representative of the beef trade. I cannot give the honourable member the assurance he seeks. But as I assured the Minister for Agriculture from Western Australia today, the Federal Government does recognise the peculiar position of Western Australia and hopes that the producer consultative group in submitting names of producers in accordance with this clause will also take that particular requirement on board. One would hope that as a result there will be no necessity for any ministerial involvement. </para>

          <para>- Firstly, I am sorry to disillusion the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating),</inline> but it is a pity the work performed by his staff is not a bit better. There was a suggestion that a precedent for this was established by the Labor Government. If the honourable member had looked at the Meat Industry Act, from which this present legislation was developed, perhaps he would have realised that that legislation was introduced in 1964 by a LiberalCountry Party government. That legislation provided for the provision of a panel of names. This legislation pursues the same practice. The general idea of the Meat Board selection committee has really been transposed into the producer consultative group in this legislation. The manner by which the previous Minister for Agriculture in the Labor Government sought to impose a name on the then Australian Meat Board Selection Committee is not a practice which this Government would favour. The submission of names from producers is intended to be at the discretion in future of the producer consultative group as it is for the time being at the discretion of the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It would concern me if a Minister of any complexion were to put names forward. His right is only to say to the Selection Committee as it is now or to the future producer consultative group: I am sorry. We would like you to submit a few more names'. There is a right to refuse, not a right to nominate. As I understand it, the previous Minister sought to present names to the Selection Committee which correctly said: 'No, that is not your function'. As a result the Minister was forced to appoint those names which were put forward by the Selection Committee. The same procedure will apply with the producer consultative group. Names submitted by either the producer or the exporter group will be the names from which the Minister will make a selection. If the Minister wishes further names can be called for in accordance with clause 19 sub-clause (2), but it will not be the practice for the Minister to put names into the recommendations that emerge from either group. </para>

If so, will the Minister make any submissions to the Remuneration Tribunal about the level of salaries? Will the Remuneration Tribunal give any guidance in respect of management salaries?

        <para>So the extent to which clause 26 is applicable is that the salary of the employees henceforth will, instead of being subject to the approval of the Public Service Board as at present, be set essentially by the Corporation but will be ratified by the Minister, this being a manner of ensuring that while the Corporation will be able to function in the public arena as a competitive commercial organisation to the maximum degree, it will not serve as a pacesetter in a way which would put other corporations and statutory organisations at a total disadvantage.

          <para>-Minister for Primary Industry) ( 1 1 .  1 )-I have to behave like a schoolmaster at times when I am speaking to a schoolboy. Unfortunately within clause 43 it is not possible to lay down the clear definition of what the constitution of these bodies will be. The alternatives generally are set out within clause 43 (2). While this question deals specifically with clause 41 and another question has been asked in respect of clause 42 (3), I should like to draw the attention of the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> to clause 43 (2) which sets down in general form the area within which it is thought that the regulating of the form of the body will be necessary. With respect to the actual form of the consultative groups, discussions already have taken place, firstly with the exporter, abattoir and meat and allied trades sector, and secondly with the producers. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I should say that at the first meeting with the exporters it emerged that one group of people who we felt might need to have consultations with the Meat and Live-stock Corporation felt that they could not be represented on either of the two consultative groups. For that reason the livestock exporters may well, for the time being at least, set up a committee in accordance with sub-clauses (1) and (2) of clause 16 of this Bill which would enable the livestock exporters to include some meat exporters and some stock and station agents so that they could also pass on advice to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. At this stage, it is felt that they are not perhaps sufficiently identifiable in form for them to be written in as a third consultative group. </para>
        <para>With respect to the other two groups, it would seem that the exporters group will almost certainly be by appointment, again in accordance with clause 43 (3) (a). The form of the other producer consultative group has not yet been concluded. There is certainly some division of view as to the best manner of appointment or election. In relation to voting, discussions have been held without resolution. In relation to the extent to which votes will be allocated, there has been discussion, again without resolution. The honourable member asked what action I propose to take. I propose to distribute to the participants of the meeting on Monday a brief resume of the conclusions reached at that meeting. I hope that we identify those areas which are agreed and it will then be for further discussion to identify those areas which are not agreed. </para>
        <para>I hope to get reasonable agreement in the end which will enable the regulations to be substantially accepted by all of the organisations to which this question refers. If that is possible and if there is reasonable agreement, as I have indicated in my second reading speech, the Government may be prepared to introduce subsequent amendments to the Act. However, initially we see the answers to this question as being matters for the producer organisations, if possible, to resolve rather than to have the Government arbitrate between them. If, however, there fails to be agreement it obviously will be necessary for the Government to act as it has with this legislation and to determine whatever would seem to be the most equitable arrangement, taking into account whatever conflicting points of view there may be. </para>

          <para>- In this clause the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has provided for the formation of the Australian Meat Industry Conference. The Opposition seeks an assurance that both trade unions and consumers will be represented on the AMIC. In view of the apparent importance of this body, the Opposition also seeks details about the composition of the AMIC and the specific functions the Minister proposes. I realise that he may not be able to give all the details required about the producer consultative group. We seek an assurance from the Minister that the details will be made available prior to the Bill being debated in the Senate, which I think will be on Thursday afternoon. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other area with which the Minister has not dealt adequately is the financial resources of the Corporation. The Opposition requests that the Minister give some specific indication on the following matters: Will the Corporation be given authority to trade in substantial quantities of meat or livestock if it requests to do so on a commercial basis? What would happen to the profits from any such transaction? Would they be returned to consolidated revenue or held by the Corporation to form a trading fund? What would happen if losses were incurred? Would these be met by the Government or would the Corporation have to borrow funds to carry the loss on a short term basis? If not, what arrangements would be made? Does the Government propose that the Corporation should have established a trading fund on a basis similar to the wheat and wool industries but modified to suit the meat industry? The Opposition would appreciate receiving specific answers to these questions prior to Thursday so that we can consider whether amendments should be moved in the Senate. Of course, we would much prefer to have specific answers now. </para>

          <para>- I will give the maximum possible specific answers now. Obviously, discussions with the consultative groups have not been concluded. Until they have been concluded I cannot give specific answers. Consultations are under way. There will be further consultations fairly shortly to resolve the detail of the producer consultative group. That of the exporter consultative group seems to be fairly well established at the moment. The questions really relate more to the producer group than to the exporter group. As soon as these details are available I shall be prepared to give them to the honourable gentleman. The concept of the Australian Meat Industry Conference is that the representation on the Conference should be as broad as possible. It has been my intention, once the 2 consultative groups- possibly, there will be a third advisory committee- and the Corporation were established to have discussions with those 3 bodiesthe Corporation and the 2 consultative groupsand from those discussions to formulate an outline of the proposal for the AMIC. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It certainly is my intention that those who are not represented in the consultative groups should be available for discussion on the AMIC. They certainly would include the trade unions. I had in mind the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union and the Meat Inspectors Union as 2 illustrations of unions which I would expect to have representation on the AMIC. I certainly think that consumers should be represented. Othersfor example, the livestock agents- if not represented elsewhere, should be represented on the AMIC. Other persons may have an interest in this area. I cannot see exactly who they might be. Veterinarians might be one example of people who feel they have a special interest which is not adequately catered for. The intention is that within the Conference there will be a regular forum for the discussion of matters appropriate to the whole of the industry. The functions and the composition of the AMIC, in fact, will depend on consultations that will not be concluded until after the 2 consultative groups and the Corporation are established. </para>
        <para>With respect to the first question asked by the honourable gentleman, I think it is necessary for me to refer him to clause 9 of the Bill. He will see that the trading powers are defined in that clause. As the clause stands, without his amendment, the Corporation already has powers, without reference to the Minister, to enter into general trading arrangements on commercial terms. However, under clause 9 (2) the Corporation may adopt such policy as it determines with respect to the exercise of these purchasing, export and selling powers and it must declare those policies. The purpose of this is to ensure that under sub-clause (3) both the Government and the consultative groups are well aware of the basis on which the Corporation will be pursuing its commercial trading. We see this as far preferable to the powers that are in the present Meat Industry Act. They are certainly significantly wider but they are designed to ensure that there can be a maximum understanding of the areas in which the Corporation will act. I think that this will provide adequate protection for the interests of producers who certainly have had some cause for concern on occasions where entitlements for example, has been worth anything up to 25c, 26c or 27c a lb and the price for the same product which is paid to the producer has been as low as 6c or 7c a lb. </para>
        <para>As to profits, there is no specific provision but I would certainly envisage that they would be held by the Corporation. This could well be a matter for a subsequent discussion with the Corporation. Of course the policy would be declared by the Corporation, and at that time if the producers consultative group, the Exporters and abattoir group or the Government wished to put matters to the Corporation they would be able to do so. </para>
        <para>In respect of losses, there would be no undertaking written in or understood, which would mean that the Government would necessarily pick up losses on a short or long term basis. If the Corporation were entering into any sort of a trading program in which it envisaged it would not be able to receive a normal commercial return, I would expect it might come to the Government and put a proposition to it. Indeed under clause 9 (4) the Corporation is required to do so, and if it sought some form of an offset such a proposition would be then considered by the Government. </para>
        <para>In respect of the suggestion about the establishment of a trading fund similar to funds that operate within the wheat and the wool industries, this is a possibility. Obviously with the stabilisation proposition which is under consideration by a sub-committee of the Australian Agricultural Council at the moment this could well be a recommendation that will come forward. I do not believe it appropriate at this stage that a trading fund be established for the Corporation, but if it should be recommended by the Agricultural Council following the considerations by the sub-committee of that Council and subsequently those recommendations are adopted by the Federal Government, necessary amendments to this legislation can be introduced to ensure that trading fund is established. It may well be that if the Corporation does establish policy in accordance with clause 9(1), this may be a recommendation that the Corporation would want to put to the Government. If the Corporation were to do that, quite apart from the considerations of the Agricultural Council, I would be quite prepared to consider it at the time. </para>

          <para class="block">As honourable members are aware, on 3 April, some important proposals to change the repatriation system involving repatriation boards and the Entitlement and Assessment Appeal Tribunals were announced. These proposals were developed out of the Government's consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the independent inquiry into repatriation conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The Government has also had available to it comments on those conclusions and recommendations which it received from a large number of veterans ' organisations. </para>
          <para>The Bill now before the House makes amendments to the Repatriation Act 1920 and the Seamen 's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1 940 to incorporate some of these changes. The Bill provides for changes in the method of appointment of repatriation boards and seamen's pension committees and requires them to consult and cooperate with the Repatriation Commission. There will be no territorial limitation placed on them and, therefore, their activities will not be confined to specific States of the Commonwealth. The Bill also provides for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to give directions to those bodies for the purpose of facilitating, ensuring or requiring consultation and co-operation with the Commission. In addition, the Bill introduces a new section 47 into the Repatriation Act. Section 47 is the section in the Repatriation Act which sets out the principles to be applied in determining claims under the Act. I shall now deal with each of these matters in more detail. </para>
          <para>In his report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose recommended that repatriation boards should be abolished and replaced by a system whereby the initial determination of claims should be the responsibility of the Commission exercising its powers through suitably qualified persons acting individually as delegates. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose recommended that, if repatriation boards were retained, the members when appointed should be subjected to an intensive training programme before making determinations, rotation of board chairmen and members should be actively pursued and the boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. The Government received strong representations from the veterans' organisations about these matters. The basic argument was that repatriation boards provided the initial tier in a three-tier system and that this system had been appreciated and accepted by veterans themselves. The existence of repatriation boards has provided an opportunity for veterans' organisations to nominate persons for selection to the bodies involved in the first decision on a veteran's claim. The Government recognises that these claims do have considerable merit and has, therefore, decided to retain the repatriation boards in order to maintain direct ex-service participation in appointments and determinations at this important first level. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that within this system changes can still be made which it expects will lead to more efficient and effective administration and will improve the overall performance of the repatriation boards. To this end, the Government has decided to discontinue the present system of having boards appointed on a State basis, with their jurisdiction limited by the boundaries of their States, and to replace this with a system whereby the boards are appointed at large, with no territorial limitations on their jurisdiction. This will enable individual members to move between States or for claims to be referred to boards resident in other States if there are heavy work loads in a State. Additionally, the Government has adopted the recommendation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose that there should be arrangements for rotation of chairmen and members. The Bill provides authority for chairmen and members to be moved from one board to another for specified periods. </para>
          <para>The Government also considered the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose that boards should be made clearly and directly subject to active oversight by the Commission. However, in view of the Commission's position as the first appellate body above the boards, such oversight could be seen to weaken the independence of the boards as initial determining bodies. A modified proposal has, therefore, been developed and has been incorporated in the Bill. The proposed new section 15, set out in clause 7 of the Bill, will require boards to consult and co-operate with the Repatriation Commission. It empowers the Commission to make available to boards statements of principles which the Commission applies in deciding appeals, statements of principles deduced from the decisions of tribunals and any other material which the Commission considers may be of assistance to boards in the performance of their functions. </para>
          <para>The section further provides that the Minister may issue directions to boards for the purpose of facilitating, ensuring and requiring that a board, or boards generally, consult and co-operate with the Commission with respect to matters specified in the direction. In this context, however, the section stipulates that neither the Minister nor the Commission is authorised to direct a board with respect to its consideration or determination of a particular claim or application. The Minister will furnish a copy of any such directions to the Commission, which shall publish it in its annual report tabled in the Parliament. The object of these provisions is to obtain better co-ordination among boards, to ensure the attainment of a high standard by boards in the discharge of their duties, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose, but without reducing the independence of each board in the exercise of its determining power under the Act in respect of individual cases. </para>
          <para>The Bill inserts new sections 24aa and 24ab into the Repatriation Act and new sections 26 and 26a into the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act. All these new sections relate to the lodging of claims under the Acts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose had the following to say in this regard: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block"> I am satisfied on the evidence that for many cases in the past claims have been presented in an inadequate fashion. I am also satisfied that this has to some extent been caused by a misunderstanding of the opening words of section 47 (2) of the Act . . . </para>
            <para>A claim for entitlement may be seen as having two broad elements, first, identification of the disablement or death in respect of which the claim is made; and, second, the serviceconnection of the disablement or death. </para>

            <para>In the past many claims have not been properly or adequately presented by the claimant. In my view, a claimant should particularise his claim to the fullest extent possible. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government has accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose 's conclusion. It does not propose, however, to set out specific requirements in the legislation. Apart from the complex nature of such provisions, there could be an undesirable sideeffect of making unreasonable demands on some claimants. I refer particularly to those incapacitated by age, disabilities, or for other reasons, who may have difficulty in obtaining and providing all of the basic information, and to widows and dependants of deceased ex-servicemen who may not have such information readily available to them. A more flexible system is preferred. </para>
          <para>The proposed section  24aa  will require that a claim be submitted on the approved form and be accompanied by any evidence in the possession of the claimant which the claimant considers would support that claim. The claim form will be drawn so that those claimants who have the particular information readily available to them will be encouraged to provide it. The Bill specifically provides that such a procedure is not to be taken as imposing any onus of proof on a claimant. Under the proposed section  24ab,  the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be required to investigate all claims lodged and, on completion of those investigations, forward the claim, together with the results of his investigations and any evidence furnished by the claimant under section  24aa,  to the Repatriation Board which will consider and determine the claim. </para>
          <para>The Bill also sets out to deal with one of the most important, yet one of the most controversial, provisions in the Repatriation Act, section 47. That section sets out the principles to be applied by determining authorities under the Act in the hearing and determining of claims, applications or appeals under the Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose reported that there was before his inquiry a considerable amount of evidence that the present section 47 had caused much dissatisfaction and frustration and he concluded that the present provisions of section 47 have proved most unsatisfactory and should be amended. He went on to analyse various provisions in other countries and recommended some major amendments to section 47. </para>
          <para>The Government has examined this question in great depth and is concerned that the provision should be cast in its simplest possible form, while still preserving to a veteran the maximum advantage that should be allowed. The Bill provides for the repeal of the present section 47 and for the insertion in its place of a much simpler section which will provide that determining authorities: Are not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and shall act according to substantial justice, taking into account any difficulty that for any reason may lie in the way of ascertaining the existence of any fact, cause or circumstance, including such reasons as the effects of the passage of time and the absence of or deficiency in any official records. The determining authorities will be required to grant a claim or application or allow an appeal unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there are insufficient grounds for granting that claim or application or allowing that appeal. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable members, I can advise that a further Bill to provide for the proposed transfer of the functions of the Repatriation Appeal Tribunals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be introduced in the spring sittings. In addition, the Government is still considering many matters arising from the Toose report and the views on it obtained from veterans' organisations. We shall be progressively announcing further decisions on matters arising from them. Honourable members may be assured, and all veterans may be assured, that the Government will not be arriving at those decisions lightly, but will keep in mind always that debt which this country owes to all those who have suffered or have been bereaved because of the service of its people in time of war and conflict. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to detain the House very long. This Bill can be classed as a purely machinery Bill which puts into effect those matters foreshadowed by the Government in December of last year. It establishes the Defence Service Homes Corporation as the body to administer the Defence Service Homes Act and also effectively brings the complete administration of the Act under the one umbrella, the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is something I have been advocating for a number of years. I forget the number of departments that war service homes or defence service homes schemes have been operating under since their inception many years ago. This must have created an amount of frustration and administrative difficulties which should never have arisen. I have previously paid tribute to the good work done by the staff under these conditions and I do so again now. I can also add that it is good to see that the defence service homes scheme has been brought home under the administration of ex-servicemen's affairs, where it always should have been. I also commend the establishment of the Defence Service Homes Trust Account which I feel will assist the administrative process considerably. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, there are still a few matters concerning the Defence Service Homes Act which must be looked at closely and in my opinion adjusted by amendments as soon as possible. Foremost of these matters is the clause relating to eligibility for a defence service home which was introduced by the previous Labor administration. Briefly, and without going into detail, it extended the eligibility conditions to include those serving personnel who had completed a minimum of 3 years effective service, and it did not matter whether the servicemen had done overseas service. In my opinion this legislation completely destroyed the original concept of eligibility for a war service home, which was compensation for active service overseas in the defence of this country. If the Labor administration of the time introduced this measure as a recruiting aid, it failed miserably. What it did do was to create such a heavy demand on finance for a war service home that the waiting time to finance a loan had to be extended to 11 or 12 months. This, as we all know, has created unnecessary hardship for all eligible servicemen. I would like to see this part of the Act amended to alter this 3 year eligibility clause. If the Government wishes to include years of service as an eligibility factor and a condition of service, I have no objection providing it is done on a priority basis, where those personnel who have taken part in overseas service and who have left the Services have top priority. This should also relieve the waiting time for loan settlements. </para>
          <para>As I said I do not wish to detain the House very long. I trust the Government will consider the suggestion I have made and introduce an amendment to the Act to implement my suggestion in the very near future. I wholeheartedly support the amending Bill now before the House. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1977. Once the Parliament passed the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1976 abolishing the Australian Housing Corporation last December action such as this became a natural flow-on to clear up the administrative machinery involved. In effect this Bill ends the statutory corporation status of the Defence Service Homes Corporation and brings the administrative machinery ultimately under the Public Service Board. The original purpose of this legislation was to destroy the Australian Housing Corporation and to do so only because that Corporation had been an Australian Labor Party initiative. The Government has yet to show the Australian people that this new policy is in any way of real benefit to them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Recent Press speculation, if one can believe it, indicates that this Government intends in the Budget session to hand over the new defence service homes loans to the State building societies. That could mean that those people who are eligible for defence service home loans will have the interest rates on those loans increased by up to three times the present rate. As honourable members are aware, the present rate is 3% per cent for the first $ 12,000 and 714 per cent for the $3,000 between $12,000 and $15,000. If the permanent building societies or even the terminating building societies were to administer these loans, which has been suggested and which is certainly under discussion by the Government, it would mean that those eligible for defence service home loans could have to pay something like lite per cent interest on their loans. I can conclude only that this form of subsidisation of the building societies is another example of this Government's dogmatic determination to destroy the Labor Party's overall urban and regional development policy. In so doing it will undermine a very fine scheme which has been in existence for so long and which has been administered even by the present Government. </para>
          <para>As I said at the outset, this Bill is basically only a machinery measure. Be that as it may, it does impinge upon the overall housing situation as well as upon an area in which the Australian Government is directly involved in helping those people who served in time of war, some of whom sacrificed quite a lot and were badly injured. It is a commitment of war that we are trying to meet in this time of peace. I know that sometimes governments find it extremely hard to meet such commitments in the long term, but this is one commitment that they have been able to meet. </para>
          <para>I know that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> has to contend with the same Treasury as we had when we were in government and that the Minister will have the problem of fighting its efforts to force up the interest rates. I am not saying dogmatically that the Government intends to hand over the administration of these loans to the permanent building societies in the States, but the speculation certainly is very strong that this will be the situation. This matter certainly has been under discussion. During our time in government the Treasury wanted to increase the interest rate to the long term bond rate. In fact, one of my achievements in the last Whitlam Ministry was that I was able to defeat that move. The Treasury had a great many victories in the last Budget of the Whitlam Government, but that was one occasion on which I and my Cabinet colleagues- honourable members know what would have happened to the matter if it had been raised in Caucus- were able to defeat the Treasury. </para>
          <para>We know that the Minister is again under pressure. With the little bit of muscle that the Labor Cabinet was able to use it was able to defeat the Treasury then. I am wondering whether the Minister will have the same strength now. I understand that on one occasion the Cabinet even passed increased interest rates, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was able to get to the Prime Minister and was able to veto the decision. I wonder whether the Government will be able to continue efforts to stop this erosion. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Government, as did other coalition governments in days past, will give war service homes a decent priority. There are delays. When there are shortages of labour or shortages of both materials and labour in the industry a delay might be expected, but in the housing industry today there is no reason why there should be a delay of 1 1 months to a year such as is occurring at present. We on the Opposition side would assist the Minister to agitate against his more conservative colleagues in the Cabinet as well as that awful conservative organisation, Treasury, and at least wipe away the waiting period during which people who are eligible for a war service homes loan and have one approved have to borrow money at a higher interest rate. These are problems we will have to look at in the future. </para>
          <para>I refer now to the overall housing situation. In the 3 years of the Labor Administration a problem was building up. It is accelerating day by day and month by month. Families with a single income equivalent to something like 135 per cent of average weekly earnings are unable to meet monthly repayments, which are set by the lending societies at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. More and more people are being forced out of the group who can meet monthly repayments economically. In certain areas the Australian Government becomes involved in what we call subsidised schemes. We are now debating one of them. Others come under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The Commonwealth makes money directly available to the State governments. People earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings are at least allowed to register with the State housing commissions. At least 30 per cent of the funds made available under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement are set aside in what we call the Builders Account. That is another subsidised scheme in which the Australian Government is involved. </para>
          <para>Under the scheme people earning up to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings have a chancethey may have to wait a while- of getting a home. But the sad situation is that there is a growing group of people, those earning up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings, whom the financial institutions and the Government have not been able to assist. </para>

            <para>- I will not delay the House for very long. However, I would like to associate members of the National Country Party of Australia with this legislation for the simple reason that over the years we have taken a very close interest in defence service housing. Any honourable member who has been in this chamber for any length of time will fully appreciate the many problems that have been associated with defence service homes over the yearsproblems concerning interest rates, the amount of money that has been available and so forth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> covered this subject fairly well in his second reading speech. If people want to know more about the legislation, I refer them to that speech by the Minister. The only point I wish to make relates to proposed section 39a ( 1 ), as contained in clause 1 1. The proposed section states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There shall be credited to the Defence Service Homes Trust Account- </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">

                <para>moneys paid to the Corporation out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament from time to time for the purpose of providing capital for the Corporation or otherwise for the purposes of the account; and </para>

                <para>all moneys received by the Corporation under this Act, not being payments that are required by section 40 to be credited to the Defence Service Homes Insurance Trust Account. </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of that, in a nutshell, is to provide for moneys that are being repaid from existing loans to be paid into the Defence Service Homes Corporation instead of their going straight into the Treasury. It will be up to the Corporation then to handle the money as it sees fit. </para>
          <para>I hope that as a result of this change the Government and the Corporation will be able to give more sympathetic consideration to second loans. I think that every member who has had anything to do with defence service homes will appreciate the personal problems that are created as a result of people not being able to secure a second loan. I am not suggesting for one moment that we should open this up and extend this assistance to everyone who wants to sell his home and move around the corner. All I am suggesting is that there are numerous occasions on which people, for health, occupational and other reasons, wish to sell their home and move to another location. These people often are cornered by not being able to secure a second loan. Once they have sold their existing defence service home, they can receive a second loan only in exceptional circumstances. I hope that as a result of this legislation a move will be made in the not too distant future to ease the pressure on those people who wish to secure a second loan. </para>

            <para>- I will not keep the House for very long. The provisions of this Bill, as has been said, are consequential upon the abolition of the Australian Housing Corporation. When that Corporation was abolished the Defence Service Homes Corporation was established as the corporate entity to administer the Defence Service Homes Act. This Bill, of course, seeks to repeal the Defence Service Homes Corporation Act. So we see another change of course. There is total confusion in this area. It is confusing to ex-servicemen and it certainly is very confusing to the personnel who have been in the Housing Corporation and who now will go over to the new Defence Service Homes Corporation. The legislation establishes the Corporation under the Defence Service Homes Act. It makes certain changes to the staffing and financial arrangements under the scheme. The staff are to be employed under the Public Service Act. So the sort of statutory body characteristic that the previous organisation had has been altered. The body will no longer have the flexibility and versatility that it had previously. It will just be another routine government department incapable of meeting the housing needs of the people and using the resources that are available for defence service homes purposes in the best possible way. Of course, those resources are considerable, as the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> knows. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the developments under the Labor Government was to consolidate the land holdings of the Defence Service Homes Division. Not long ago- in fact, on 2 November 1976- the Minister was able to tell me that 1223 hectares of land were held for that purpose, that we had purchased the land for $ 19.7m and that it is now valued at $39.4m. Honourable members might understand and recall that one of the purposes of the Australian Housing Corporation was to utilise this land for development purposes and not just for ex-servicemen. It was to be used for other people as well. The Corporation was to continue to build up that stock of land so that the Australian Government could take a very real initiative in respect of the needs of ex-servicemen and others. It would not be appropriate for me to enunciate the purposes of the Corporation. That has all gone by the board now. It is another aspect of the devolution that has taken place under this Minister who is often called the undertaker, the destroyer of Labor initiatives. Of course, this is just another comment in that destructive program that has been followed. </para>
          <para>I want to tell the Minister that a great deal of concern is being expressed about the present administration of the Defence Service Homes Act. I know that the Minister in this chamber is not responsible for the Defence Service Homes Act. In this House he only speaks on those matters. However, he certainly has a very big responsibility for the destruction of the Australian Housing Corporation which accommodated the defence service homes scheme. So we are not going to be able to maximise the potential in terms of the constitutionality that is available to the Commonwealth in respect of the housing needs of the people. That is what the Corporation was all about. Its purpose was to provide housing for servicemen, ex-servicemen, migrants and employees of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it would have been able to assist the recipients of social service benefits, and special allowances could have been invoked for that purpose as well. I want to confirm my contention that widespread concern has been expressed by reading to the House a letter which I have received from the State Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Services League.

          <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Johnson,</inline></para>
          <para>The N.S.W. Branch of the RSL is concerned, that despite denials by the Commonwealth Government, there are, from time to time, media reports of proposed changes to the existing Defence Service Homes Benefits. </para>
          <para>The alleged media comments have referred to proposals to increase interest rates and dispose of residential land which has been purchased for the erection of Defence Service Homes. Speculations were published in mid- 1975, again in February 1 976 and more recently this month. </para>
          <para>On Wednesday, 4 May 1 977, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the above matters were being considered by an inter-departmental committee including proposals for handing over veterans' Home Loans to State Building Societies. </para>
          <para>My State Council would appreciate that you recognise that the RSL considers such speculations are very disturbing, because of the insecurity and alarm they create amongst eligible servicemen, ex-servicemen and war widows. </para>
          <para>We request your support in preserving the interests of veterans and their widows who expect the Defence Service Home Scheme to be maintained in accordance with the conditions of service promised to them at the time of their enlistment in the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para class="block">The letter is from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> G. Osmond, State Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Services League. There is not much need for me to comment on it; it speaks for itself. It is an indication of the very widespread concern being expressed around Australia at the present time. I believe it is the obligation of this Government to maintain the momentum of reform and progress which the Australian Labor Party undertook in relation to the defence service homes scheme. If the Minister is starting to wince, let me give him something to wince about. I shall take a minute to mention several of the reforms which occurred under the Labor Administration. These reforms included the fact that loans were increased from $9,000 to $15,000. We extended the eligibility to single men and single women. For years and years people were calling for that provision, until the Labor Government was elected and gave effect to the proposal. </para>
          <para>We introduced a transfer of loans scheme to assist persons who were required to change their residence for reasons of health or employment. That is one of the matters about which the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King)</inline> has just been talking. I do not think that he yet knows that we gave effect to a proposal along those lines. Of course, we raised the expenditure enormously. I cannot recall the figure for 1975-76 but I know that we brought the amount from $74m in 1972-73 to $1 15m in 1974-75. The amount went up much further in the next year. We expanded the category of qualifying personnel to include ancillary service personnel; for example those who served in the war theatres with the Salvation Army, the Comforts Fund and the Red Cross. This proposal was called for for many years. We changed the name of the legislation from the War Service Homes Act to the Defence Services Homes Act. We enabled national servicemen and permanent servicemen to qualify. What an enormous innovation. </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman is saying that that is a disgrace. The permanent servicemen of Australia will be delighted to know that apparently the National Country Party wants to defranchise the permanent members of the forces who now qualify after the completion of 3 years service! That was regarded as one of the great reforms under the defence service homes scheme. I have mentioned just a short number of reforms but together they add up to the most significant package deal of reforms to occur since the defence service homes legislation was first introduced in 1918. Now we have this legislation shemozzled in such a way that the staff is demoralised. I think the Minister knows that the staff is complaining. Many positions are unfilled. Other positions have been abolished. People are being worked in higher positions but they are not getting the commensurate salary. I am not speaking for myself here. I have received deputations from employees of this former great instrumentality. They want this Government to put the matter on an even keel and to make sure that the ex-servicemen do not have to wait for their loans and do not have to get second mortgages. That is what we asked the Government to do. We ask the Government to have regard to the record of progress and achievement for which the Australian Labor Party Government was responsible and to carry on in a similar vein to the advantage of servicemen and ex-servicemen of this country. </para>

            <para>- I listened with some interest to the passion and enthusiasm of the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> However, I must say with all kindness in my heart that I cannot agree with most of the things about which he spoke. We have to face some reality. The reason for a waiting time for people seeking defence or war service homes loans was because of legislation brought in by the government in which he was a Minister. We are trying, with this legislation as part of the scene, to bring some reality back to the whole situation of defence homes. I was very interested to hear the honourable member for Hughes refer to the circular letter which all honourable members in New South Wales, on both sides of the House, received. Not one of us in the House would not be very concerned about the possibility of any reduction in benefits to our returned ex-servicemen. Quite frankly, there is absolutely nothing in this legislation which would give that indication. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The subject of the debate is a technical matter, providing that the staff of the Department shall come under the Public Service Act. The fact that the previous speaker became a little confused about what was happening with the departmental staff was probably due to his passion and feeling on this subject. The reality, from my own knowledge of the staff within the Department, is that the staff is quite delighted with the prospect of coming within the broader ambit of the Public Service Act instead of being under the Defence Service Homes Act. The staff appreciates the fact that it will have the capacity and the opportunities for greater promotional and career prospects as a result of this legislation. The financial aspects - </para>

              <para>- Perhaps the honourable member for Corio has his times confused. This Government has always maintained a close and realistic relationship and liaison with the ex-servicemen's organisations. The application of all legislation that we have introduced over generations of being in government in this place since the First World War has been undertaken with complete and total consultation with the ex-servicemen's organisations. The State Secretary of the Returned Services League in New South Wales knows that and I have replied to a letter from him in such terms. </para>

          <para>Time is of the essence and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> seems anxious to answer the questions that have been put to him; so, I shall not delay the House. But I want to say one thing: There has never been any legislation introduced into this House by a Liberal-National Country Party Government that has ever suggested that we have had anything less than the legitimate well-being of all ex-servicemen in this country at heart. This Bill is in accord with that history. Any suggestions to that effect from the gallant  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> or the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Hughes, would be slightly unfair and perhaps reveal that they are not as informed on the matter of the welfare of the ex-servicemen of this country as they might well be. In the 3 years in which the Australian Labor Party was in government it brought in some interesting and well needed alterations to the Defence Service Homes Act. Labor extended it to some very worthwhile and needy sections, namely- I speak with some interest here- to the single ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen. But in general terms Labor confused the issue so badly that it has taken us 18 months to come to some conclusions as to what the future should be. No thinking person, no thinking ex-serviceman, would assume that 32 years after World War II, some years after Korea and some years after Vietnam, the same conditions that applied after the 1914-18 war would apply. I am sure that none of us in this chamber at the moment is privy to what the Budget will contain but I am sure that the returned services movements in Australia can rest content and not worry. I am certain that we will continue to be looking after the legitimate well-being of ex-servicemen when the Budget comes down. Although this Bill is very technical it is an indication that we are trying to plug the holes that the socialist Government opened in its 3 years in office. </para>

            <para>- I noted the tone of your voice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I think that only a few points need clearing up. I must compliment the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> and the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> for putting the point of view of the Government so clearly. There is absolutely no doubt about the Government's determination that the history of support to ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen will continue. I do not have to say any more about that. One thing that does have to be answered is the canard that has been allowed to run tonight by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren),</inline> and the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson).</inline> I must say that the latter honourable member loves to come in here and with crocodile tears talk about the terrible rumours that are running about various things. In doing so, he tries to prosper them as fast as he can to those who may be listening and getting more and more worried about the matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me nail 2 issues. First of all, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is worried that we might be transferring the administration of the defence service homes to the States through the permanent building societies. I am advised that there is no truth in that assertion. As to the second assertion about interest rates, I answered questions in this chamber on the matter months ago and denied it, but still it seems to run. I suppose that the honourable member for Hughes when he gets back to his electorate devils around and addresses a few Returned Services League groups and tells them it is the truth. But let us have the truth here and now. There is no truth in the rumour, and I can only repeat what my colleague said in the other place on 4 May in answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the Government does not have any plans to increase the interest rate on defence service homes. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">He went on to say very categorically:   . . the Defence Service Homes Corporation . . . is not placing any plans of this sort before any Government committee and is not placing before any Government committee or before the Cabinet any proposals to increase interest rates. </para>
          <para class="block">So foi the third or fourth time, let us have it all out again. There are no proposals in this scheme to increase interest rates. </para>
          <para>I cannot resist dealing with the matter of waiting time. It was questioned by the honourable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr King),</inline> ignored by the honourable member for Hughes and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. Of course the Labor Government had to introduce first of all increased amounts for the defence service homes scheme. After all, it produced by its wretched policies an inflation rate which made the scheme that it had inherited absolutely meaningless. Of course the Labor Government had to increase the amount. In respect of those significant reforms which were introduced and the waiting time about which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was so worried, let me remind him that in the August Budget an 1 1 months' waiting time was introduced by him. Was it the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition or was it the honourable member for Hughes? Certainly it was the Government of which the honourable member for Hughes was a member, and the reason why the appropriation of about $ 122.5m was not enough to cover the anticipated annual requirement for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act in 1975-76 - </para>

          <para>On the matter of second loans and portability of loans, I think it was the honourable member for Wimmera who raised the point. I had better make it clear that a system exists under the present Act whereby second loans may be granted. The figures show that about 470 applications a year are granted under the established policy, and that runs into an annual amount of about $2. 5m. It would be ideal if all people who applied for second loans and who wanted to transfer were granted those loans, but the policy behind not allowing the complete portability of loans is that it is simply not possible if we are to meet all our commitments in the present strictures on economic policy. I can say that the present policy of allowing second loans is being reviewed in an attempt to remove anomalies and to permit a relaxation in the existing criteria under which loan approvals are made. However, the availability of funds to permit a less rigid approach to this type of assistance will be an important factor in any consideration of it. That is all I wish to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I summarise the legislation once again by saying that the Government has a commitment to ex-servicemen and women. It has met that commitment in the past and it jolly well will continue to do so in the future. </para>

            <para>As explained previously, details of departmental expenditures are recorded under functional headings as set out in the Appropriation Acts and these are readily available. Extraction from these records of expenditure relating to particular electorates is a difficult and laborious task. In view of the heavy workload in the finance area of the Department and the continuing shortage of staff I am unable to suggest when, in the foreseeable future, staff resources will be available to provide meaningful figures. </para>

            <para>He will be aware that Parliament has passed legislation providing funds for construction of the engineering school at the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education and that a decision has been made to defer commencement of the works pending the outcome of the inquiry in Victoria into post-secondary education. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the adverse effects being experienced by the Institute, and in particular by the students, resulting from the delay in construction of the engineering school? Will the Minister advise the precise timetable leading up to the construction commencement date to ensure that the doubts which presently exist are removed? Will he confirm that the sum of $2. 5m scheduled in the relevant Act is in no way in jeopardy pending the decision of the Newman committee and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission? Finally, will the Minister confirm that additional moneys will be available to cover the increased construction costs caused by the delay? </para>

            <para>It is not possible to answer this question without first defining a 'refugee'. </para>
            <para>For many years victims of many different circumstances have been called refugees. These have included displaced and stateless persons, those seeking political asylum, defectors, members of oppressed minorities and victims of natural disasters. </para>
            <para>In 1951 the United Nations adopted a Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. This included a definition of a refugee as 'any person who, owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political group, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. ' </para>

          <para>Using nationality, rather than country of last residence, as the basis; the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has advised that approximately 2000 Vietnamese, 8000 Cambodians and 10 000 Laotians are registered with them in Thailand. In addition, there are people from these countries living in refugee-type situations in adjoining areas but the exact numbers are not known. The Office of the UNHCR also estimates that there are approximately 1 4 000 Chilean refugees awaiting resettlement. </para>
          <para>As of 1 May, 1977, 2061 Vietnamese, 285 Cambodian, 461 Laotian and 728 Chilean refugees have arrived in Australia. In addition, 387 Chileans under political duress have been accepted direct from Chile and other arrivals include some refugees who have been classified for statistical purposes under normal migrant entry categories. </para>
          <para>The Office of the UNHCR has advised that nationals of the other countries listed are not regarded as refugees according to the Convention definition. </para>
          <para>Australia, however, has also regarded Cypriots who were displaced by events in their country as 'quasi-refugees' and has accepted some 6500 Cypriot nationals under special arrangements. </para>
          <para>In addition, Australia has accepted 258 1 people evacuated from East Timor, of whom 1850 remained in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Government has also adopted special measures involving the approval, under relaxed criteria, of Lebanese migrants nominated by close relatives in Australia. During the current financial year an estimated 7365 have arrived under this program up to 3 1 March. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>to (3) The High Court ruling referred to by the honourable member was to the effect that an invalidity pension paid to a former officer of the Navy under the DFRB scheme on his premature retirement following an accident sustained in the course of peace-time duty was exempt from income tax under a longstanding provision of the income tax law which exempts pensions similar in nature to repatriation disability pensions. Since 1948 when the DFRB scheme was introduced people have acted on the basis that all DFRB and DFRDB pensions are subject to tax and they have been paid at a level that assumes this to be the case. The Government has taken the view that it would not be equitable for pensions affected by the High Court decision to be exempt from tax while tax is levied on other pensions including pensions paid under other occupational superannuation schemes. On IS April 1977 the Government s intention to amend the income tax law to ensure that pensions covered by the High Court decision would in future be liable to income tax was announced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Honourable R. I. Viner M.P., in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Treasurer. The relevant amendments have since been introduced into the Parliament in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1977 and are to apply to pensions paid after 2 1 April 1977.  1976 Census Data (Question No. 575) </para>

            <para>The brothers and sisters of Australian residents are eligble for consideration as migrants if their occupations are among those currently listed as acceptable for permanent entry. </para>
            <para>Persons seeking to migrate to Australia under the close family reunion policy are not required to meet the occupational criteria. Eligible persons are presently limited to the spouses, dependent children and parents of Australian residents. </para>
            <para>It is estimated that a relaxation of the close family reunion policy, that is, so that brothers and sisters would not have to be in an approved occupational category, could involve a minimum of  26 000  migrants in the first year, increasing to  35 000  or  40 000  in the second and third years. It is not possible to indicate the effect on net migration since information on permanent departures from Australia is not available according to relationship to Australian residents. </para>

          <para class="block"> I agree that the matter of public debate is an important element in what is happening now between the release of the First Ranger report and the release of the second Ranger report. To that end, my Department has, under my orders, set up a task force. We are monitoring that debate. I get regularly reports on what is said in the public debate. We have even gone to the extent of sending some of my staff to some of the more important public arenas to hear what is being said. We will continue to monitor that debate. When the Second Report of the Ranger inquiry is presented the Government will have put in front of it what has been said in the public debate. </para>
