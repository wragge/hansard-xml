              <para>-I withdraw. It is a fact that a representative of a local stock and station agent came to me to seek from me information about the procedures used in the acquisition of land for the Omega navigational aid. As is the normal custom, I made representations on his behalf. There was nothing secret about that. There was nothing clever about it. I do not think that anything very much came of it. As I understand it, the Department of Administrative Services followed the normal procedures and appointed three or four agents to look at land throughout the area that it had under consideration. I do not have the exact details of the number of agents; nor do I know the specific details of their names. I will seek information from my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services and make the information available to the honourable member. </para>

            <para>-Since the question yesterday from the honourable member for Oxley concerning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development review of Australia, which he suggested had been completed, I have made some inquiries. The fact is that the processes leading to the review have not even been started. The honourable member asserted that the Government has been successful in suppressing publication of the review from its normal period in December and having it held over until the middle of next year. So far from publication of the review in December being normal, not one of the four reviews so far issued has been published in that month. The facts are that the December 1972 review was published in February 1973, the April 1974 review was published in June 1974, the July 1975 review was published in August 1975, and the December 1976 review was published in February 1977. It ought to be noted that the only one of these reviews which was published during the honourable member's term as Treasurer appeared in August, not in December, 1975. The gaps between these reviews have been 16, 14 and 18 months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Oxley seems to be suggesting that the OECD should now be producing another review only 10 months after the last review. That would be out of all normal procedures. From very old days, conspiracy theories have been part of the mind stuff of the Opposition, but there is no of substance in this instance. The conspiracy which the honourable member for Oxley is seeking to trump up now seems far fetched even for him. </para>
          <para>As the Treasurer said, Australia has nothing to fear from an examination of policies by international organisations. In fact, we have the usual team from the International Monetary Fund in Australia at the moment. The usual discussions with the OECD secretariat have been proceeding in the normal way with a view to finding a mutually convenient time for an OECD mission to visit Canberra and for our officials to receive them. Australia must be fitted in to the OECD program which has about 20 member countries. As it happens, there may be an OECD mission in Australia next month, but that matter remains to be officially determined. If it does occur it will probably mean a publication of the resulting review of Australia in about April 1978. So much for that farrago of falsehoods which seems to be the only meat the Opposition has had for the last two or three weeks. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the figures that the honourable gentleman quoted in his question. The Government and its advisers are quite unaware of their origin. Certainly they do not appear in any OECD document yet available in Canberra or any document yet available to our official delegation to OECD in Paris. Perhaps the honourable member for Oxley or his friends in Paris have been opening some mail there also. No doubt the OECD, like the Opposition, has not yet caught up with the transformation of this country's economic prospects which in the last six weeks have brought a dramatic improvement in the outlook for inflation, as a result of the September quarter consumer price index, the very strong figures issued recently by the Australian Statistician for business capital expenditure for the current half year, which are up 14 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, and the sharp change in attitudes towards the balance of payments and the exchange rate since the end of September. If the OECD or anyone else is talking of a GDP deflator of 10V4 per cent for the calendar year 1978, then like the honourable member for Oxley, it does not know what it is talking about. Currently the Government's advisers' own conservative figures would be around 7 1/2 per cent. As to growth next year, our advisers' figures would be roughly double the rate quoted by the honourable member. Even that well known character whom the honourable member is so fond of quoting, Blind Freddie, would put him right on that one. </para>
          <para>What does all this add up to? The honourable gentleman seeks, as a result of a short period in the Treasury, to give respectability to his claims and to what he says, but they are a thorough garbling of the facts, a use of falsehoods, a search for conspiracies where none exist and a desperate search for any basis at all on which to hang the Opposition's fond hope of economic disaster for Australia. There is only one basis on which there could ever be economic disaster for this country. That is if the Leader of the Opposition were ever again to be in charge of this nation's affairs. Then it would be a true economic disaster, and that is why his soliciting even for a mere two-year term will be rejected. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it correct that over the past two weeks the Australian Wool Corporation sold 20,000 bales of wool ex Flushing on the basis of f.o.b. prices in Australia? Does this mean that the purchasers have bought the wool without having to pay freight to Europe? If so, does this mean that the Corporation has effectively undermined its own reserve prices and in this case has caused the drop in the wool market over the last week? Does it mean a possible loss to wool growers of up to $600,000? </para>

            <para>-I know the honourable member is seeking to learn a little bit about agriculture. One of the elements of trying to ensure stability in a market for a commodity is the recognition that whatever is said in this Parliament needs to be heard not just within these four walls but around the markets of the world. The Australian Wool Corporation has been a most effective marketing body. I do not know anything of the instance which the honourable member has just suggested has happened but I do know that Corporation stocks held abroad have each been sold in the past-I would presume on this occasion also- on the basis of all costs being included in the price charged for a particular line of wool. I will investigate the circumstance that the honourable member has alleged. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I can assure this House and the wool buyers around the world that the Corporation operates a flexible reserve. It sets the level of that reserve on a daily basis. It maintains a strong stable buying force. When sales are negotiated outside Australia those sales are normally on the basis of the cost of the wool at that particular point where it has been delivered. If there should be a variation in any particular sale that might be negotiated, I have no doubt that the variation is based on a very good premise, and indeed as far as Australian wool growers are concerned, since our return to office and the maintenance of a firm wool reserve and a sympathetic understanding of the financial policies of the Corporation, there has been no doubt that the Australian wool growers' interests have been well protected. I nave little doubt that exactly the same has happened in this circumstance. I will investigate the circumstance and write to the honourable member about it. </para>

            <para>- I believe that anyone who is aware of public administration in Australia would well know that the Defence ministry carries very heavy administrative responsibilities. After all, for a long while there were in that area Ministers for the separate Services and a Minister for Defence. How the Minister for Defence can preserve his calm and undertake in full the responsibilities formerly undertaken by four Ministers, I sometimes find difficulty in understanding. It is worth noting that in the United Kingdom where there is a unified structure, in many ways not dissimilar from our structure, there are a number of junior Ministers and Assistant Ministers- I think, from memory, about five in all in the United Kingdom contextassisting the Secretary of State for Defence. It is certainly a very full time job indeed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also would have thought that being Foreign Minister is a full time job if it is to be done well and properly, with a degree of sensitivity and strength such as we have seen over the last two years. I think my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, believes that he has been fully occupied in his functions as Minister for Foreign Affairs. How anyone, especially someone who at some stage had been involved in government administration in Australia, could ever contemplate combining these two offices, I just fail to comprehend. Of course, there have been suggestions that some people could do these jobs well and combine them and that there was an occasion when the ministry of Foreign Affairs was combined with the ministry of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under the previous Administration. I rather think that the administration of Australia's affairs failed very dismally during that period, but I am not sure whether - </para>

During the previous Administration there were occasions when one might have suggested that the good government of Australia was forfeited because the then Prime Minister was also Foreign Minister and out of the country a very great deal. On the other hand, when he gave up the job of Foreign Minister the administration of the country did not improve because he was here more. I think one can judge from that that the administration of Australia might well have been better if he had been overseas entirely. Under those circumstances Australia would have benefited. </para>

He will note that I have placed a question for him on the Notice Paper in the light of his answer to me two days ago that the Treasurer had mentioned to him the matter of his relations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Leake. I ask him: Has the Treasurer or anybody else brought to his notice a statement by a director of the company named in my question that that company merely acted as a nominee company and that if someone was uncomfortable about his name appearing in a share register he could use the company to register his holding? Does the Prime Minister think it appropriate for a Minister to make investments or to hold interests in a company in such a guise that the public cannot discover that Minister's investments or interests? </para>

I think that really the public would be much more interested to know the full details of all those people who pay into the private fund of the Leader of the Opposition and of the cheques that he draws on that fund allegedly in the interests of the Australian Labor Party. So far as I know, that political party is the only one where the leader has specific control over a slush fund of that kind. </para>

            <para>-I think it would be clear to all honourable gentlemen in this House, particularly those who sit on the Government side, that the balance of trading opportunities between Australia and the European Economic Community is totally unsatisfactory and totally inequitable to the efficient and competitive primary producers in Australia. For that reason the Government took the step of appointing a Minister with specific responsibility for this area. It was very interesting to note that while I was overseas the estimates for the Department of Special Trade Negotiations were considered and the attitude taken by the Opposition was simply that the whole exercise was a waste of time. </para>

              <para>-I think it ought to be on record that the Opposition thinks it is a waste of time to try to secure greater access to the largest trading bloc in the world. What the Opposition is saying to the primary producers of Australia is that if it were m government it would not try to improve access for the efficient primary producers of Australia into the largest trading bloc in the world. Every honourable member in this House knows that it will not be easy to improve our access into the European markets, but those who have the interests of primary producers at heart will know that it is beholden on any Australian government to try to improve that access, to try to reduce the level of export subsidies paid in respect of the large surpluses that have been created in Europe through the operation of the common agricultural policy. After this Government is returned to office on 10 December it will continue its efforts to improve that situation. </para>

While this Government remains in charge of the nation's affairs it will continue to try to improve access to those markets to which our primary producers are undoubtedly entitled. </para>

              <para>-What the Foreign Minister said yesterday was completely right, as one would expect. What the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is seeking to do is com- pletely wrong, as one also would expect, knowing his affinities and knowing his circumstances in relation to these matters. It is important not only for Australia but also for the world that Australia, as a supplier country, be actively involved in trying to seek safer international regimes in these areas. If one accepts that the full thrust of the original United States policy in relation to the internationalisation of re-processing facilities is unlikely to be achieved in its entirety, the kinds of proposals which are being discussed by  His  Honour in international forums, and which are being met with a degree of acceptability in a number of areas, surely ought to be examined very closely if we are to achieve a safer world. </para>

          <para>The honourable gentleman would much prefer that Australia have nothing to do with these matters. He has a remarkable expectancy that members of fraternal parties in other parts of the world whose working people are dependent upon the use or uranium to supply energy for peaceful purposes should become unemployed merely to meet his particular predelictions. It is not surprising that this is a view of the Australian Labor Party, because it wants to deny energy needed for peaceful purposes to countries in Europe which need it to keep their factories operating. </para>
          <para>There is not much difference between that view and the report on possible ways of increasing unemployment which was referred by me in the Parliament yesterday. I made it perfectly plain yesterday that the Labor Party on that occasion had taken an action which was deliberately designed to increase unemployment. Not only that, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, suppressed the document. It was not published until several weeks after the decisions had been taken. Then it was tabled amongst all the other Budget documents, in the hope that nobody would see what was in it. </para>

			<para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth,</inline></para>
			<para>I write to you rather than to your General Manager because of my belief that it is more appropriate that you should consider the matter which I am raising. Whilst I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kennon</inline> is a most competent and effective General Manager for your station he was, nevertheless, closely associated with the formulation and production of the now infamous television commercials produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Singleton at the 1974 election, and must therefore be assumed to have close association with our political opponents. </para>
			<para>I read this morning with some concern that your station has prepared and is putting to air next Friday night at prime time an hour long documentary about the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline> My concern is based on the fact that to the best of my knowledge no opportunity has yet been given to the Opposition to have an hour of prime time on your channel. </para>
			<para>Your are no doubt aware of and have probably read my evidence to the recent Broadcasting Tribunal Inquiry into self-regulation of television stations. Equally, I am sure you are aware of the Tribunal's Report in so far as political con- - tent is concerned. While it did not recommend amendments to the law to enforce equality of treatment of both sides of politics it did give strong support to the principle that licencees were obligated to be fair and equal. </para>
			<para>You will be aware that I brought to the Tribunal evidence showing that some stations in Australia had been most unfair and inequitable in their treatment of political parties in non election periods. In particular I made reference to the times at which Addresses to the Nation from the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader have been put to air on some stations. In the case of your station I made reference to the fact that, using the April 6 and April 13 addresses as an example, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had been put to air at the prime viewing time of 7.30 p.m. and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> had competed with the National Anthem one week later at 1 1.58 p.m. </para>
			<para>After our experiences of recent years the ALP has no intention of sitting by compliantly while it is being in its opinion screwed by television station licencees. </para>
			<para>This brings me back to the program in question. The proposed one hour long documentary, as it was filmed at a time when the Prime Minister was clearly seen to be engaged in an election campaign, can be viewed by us only as a gift of an hour of prime time to the Government parties. I am sure that not even the most ignorant Australian would argue that at the time the documentary was filmed there was not a better than reasonable prospect of a general election in 1977. (Need I remind you that as long ago as early March I was able to forecast that such an election would take place). </para>
			<para>Therefore I deem it appropriate that you should provide an hour of prime time to the ALP as the official Opposition. While I would prefer that such an hour be given to a similar documentary on a week with the Opposition Leader, I am certain that we could negotiate a program which would be mutually acceptable. </para>
			<para>However, in the event of us failing to receive equality of opportunity to that which is being given to the Prime Minister, I would undoubtedly find it necessary to recommend to our Executive that we lodge a <inline font-style="italic">formal</inline> complaint to the Broadcasting Tribunal and that failure to receive satisfaction should lead to us contesting your right to have your licence renewed when next it is under consideration. </para>
			<para>Your early response would be appreciated. </para>

			<para>I am sure you will agree that we can be forgiven for thinking that the decision to replace that program with the hourlong documentary on Prime Minister Fraser was indeed an emergency one prompted by anticipation of that gentleman's announcement of a general election on 10 December 1977. </para>
			<para>I should advise you that I took the liberty of forwarding for information a copy of my letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline> to the General Managers or television stations in the O/TEN network in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide; subsequently I have learnt that the program in question was screened last evening in prime time by ChannelO Melbourne. </para>
			<para>In view of the fact that no approach has been received by us from Channel O Melbourne regarding the provision of equal opportunity and time and that no reply to my correspondence to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline> has been received, 1 now ask your Tribunal to exercise its influence to ensure that, consistent with the sentiments expressed in your recent report, equal opportunity is provided to the Australian Labor Party. Action on your part to ensure the provision of such opportunity is fundamental to the establishment of your Tribunal as an effective body which cannot be manipulated by the government of the day to its own partisan political purposes. </para>

I am enclosing copies of both letters together with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth's</inline> reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe,</inline> which I have just received. </para>
			<para>The program was shown on Channel 0 Melbourne on Wednesday, 26 October, Channel 0 Brisbane on Thursday 27 October, and Channel 10 Sydney on Friday 28 October 1977. Channel 0 Brisbane informed me per phone on 26 October that they had sought legal advice from Henderson and Lahey who advised that provided two statements were edited out of the program they would not regard it as political from an election point of view.

			<para>The Tribunal viewed the program yesterday and decided that it did not have power to act on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe's</inline> demand for equal time for the Opposition as it is not yet the election period for the Federal election.

			<para>You will note that reasonable opportunities shall be afforded, not equal time. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Does the annual report of Telecom Australia for the last 12 months tabled in Parliament yesterday  dislcose  a profit of $ 164.4m, depreciation of $340m and intent of $278m? Does this not in reality represent a total profit of about $783.8m and, based on the earnings of Telecom of $ 1,674m, a profit of 47 per cent- something that no private company in Australia would ever be able to achieve? Where is the depreciation reserve of $2,584m? Will the Minister direct Telecom to reduce its telephone call charges or rentals or connection fees so as to reduce these exorbitant profits? Do most of the interest charges of $278m go to Treasury, and are they in other words another form of taxation on Telecom users? To settle this question of whether the profit is exorbitant, will he refer Telecom charges to the Prices Justification Tribunal so that it can carry out a full and frank investigation into the Telecom charging system? Do the charges of today represent the greatest rip-off of any concern in Australia? </para>

            <para>-I do hope that nobody ever runs the risk of putting you on the board of any commercial organisation because, frankly, the way you juggle figures up in the air and the way they fall out is appalling. I refer to the comments you made last night in which you referred to the dividend rate of some companies throughout Australia. You referred to the dividend rate as if it applied to the share issue, not to the market value of the shares. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before I address myself to some of the comments, let us just look at the record. You are asking us to consider the lowering of charges. For the last two year period basic charges have been held. Indeed, a number of initiatives have been taken which have reduced charges, particularly in rural areas. Now that is in contradiction and in contrast to what you people- yourselves and the Commission- did in three years. The basic charges for telephone calls went up from 4c to 9c in a three-year period. In the two years that we have been in office, despite the fact that we have had a rate of inflation which although now moderating has had to be contended with, because we have shown a great deal of concern and interest and have had co-ordination with the Commission we have increased services and have held charges. </para>
          <para>Let us look at this surplus. You well know what are the provisions of the Act. You well  know that under the provisions Telecom has to find at least SO per cent of its capital requirement out of internal revenue- by way of depreciation, by way of long service leave and by way of surplus. Yet you use a figure of 47 per cent when the return on capital invested in Telecom is of the order of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. On the capital invested in Telecom, the surplus is of the order of 2 per cent to 3 per cent Indeed, this Government, with the co-operation it has had from the Commission - </para>

            <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, refers to the recent dismissal of 70 people by the firm of Sanyo Guthrie Aust. Pry Ltd in Wodonga. I have no doubt that the Minister has heard about this matter because I know that he takes a very keen interest in the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. Is the Minister aware that one of the reasons stated for the dismissal was that the company's sales had been affected by imported television sets? Can the Minister inform me whether he has any information on this matter? Will he take all possible action to assist this important decentralised industry in the rural city of Wodonga? </para>

              <para>-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is always very vocal on matters concerning the Albury- Wodonga growth centre. Of course the Government of which he was a member was an organisation- I use the word deliberatelythat tried to jack things up in an artificial way. When his party was in office it took an action that caused more unemployment in the cities of Albury and Wodonga than any other government in the history of Australia had caused. I refer to the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut. Borg- Warner (Aust) Ltd, one of the best decentralised industries in Australia, cut its employment as a result of the action of the Whitlam Government. </para>

          <para>The matter raised by the honourable member for Indi is a very important and very serious one. He has asked a question in relation to the dismissal of some 70 employees of Sanyo Guthrie Australia Pty Ltd in Wodonga. I have had this matter investigated because it is one that concerns me greatly. I am advised that the dismissals have occurred for two reasons. One is largely the disastrous power dispute in Victoria. I am bound to say that many people who lost their positions for a so-called temporary period as a result of that dispute will not be re-engaged. It is an unfortunate fact that when disputes of this nature occur many people who are stood down are never re-engaged. The second reason is that a large number of colour television sets are being imported. I understand this matter is being referred to by the management of the company I mentioned. I inform the House that on imported colour television sets a duty of 35 per cent of the cost of the set less the picture tube is imposed. </para>
          <para>At present there is no application before the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission for additional assistance, but if the company makes application to the Minister for Industry and Commerce I can assure the honourable member and the House that that application will receive very careful consideration. If a recommendation is made for a reference to go to the TAA or the IAC it also will be considered expeditiously by me. This is a most important matter. The Government is extremely concerned about the employment situation in Australia and I am grateful, as indeed is the Government, to the honourable member for Indi for giving such strong support to the policies that are being pursued by this Government to protect Australian jobs and not to aggravate the unemployment position further by deliberately exporting jobs overseas as our predecessors did. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, concerns an answer he gave earlier this week in which he claimed that Australia's rates of inflation and unemployment in comparison with those of selected overseas countries were worse under Labor than under his own Administration. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to a recent report by a responsible economic commentator which demonstrated that, in comparison with the average performance of all member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Australia's performance in respect of economic growth, unemployment and inflation has deteriorated since the Fraser Government came to office? If he has seen the report does he now acknowledge that by his earlier statements alleging the opposite result he misled the House? If he has not read the report will he do so soon and learn the real facts of this important matter? </para>

The Leader of the Opposition, carried away by his rhetoric, said: 'You cannot point to a country in the world where these things have happened.' I was demonstrating very plainly that the Leader of the Opposition, if he did not know what he was talking about, knew that he was talking falsely. </para>
          <para>With regard to inflation, excluding the Medibank distortion, the gap between Australia's inflation and the average inflation in the OECD countries has been closed from 6 per cent to 7 per cent in 1975, which was Labor's inflation, to a situation in which Australia's inflation broadly matches that of our major trading partners. It is worth noting the comments from other informed commentators who give advice to business houses around Australia. They all point to a continued downward thrust in inflation and the consumer price index leading to reduced interest rates and leading, as the Treasurer said yesterday, to 1978 being a good year economically as long as the present Government's policies continue. The honourable member can thresh around as much as he likes. I respect him for trying to support an insupportable leader and for not taking the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> took that what his leader says is, in any case, irrelevant. </para>

The sports program that was first announced in the Budget has proceeded well. We said that we would be helping national sports bodies in this country to improve their administration and employ coaches to enable them to compete here and overseas on an international basis. That has been done. We also said that we would establish a national sports council. That sports council has met twice, once in September and once in October. I am pleased to report that the request by that council for assistance in the sports program has met with wide response. </para>

          <para>On 23 and 24 October the council met to consider requests. I am hopeful that within the next week or so we will be able to announce what those allocations of money will be under the program. The number of letters and other communications I have received show that not only individuals but also sporting organisations and major national organisations such as the Olympic Federation and the Confederation of Australian Sport have welcomed the program I have been speaking about and have congratulated the Government on its initiative in introducing it. This means that for the first time we have an efficient sports program in Australia that will help the national sports body. It will help Australia compete better not only here but also overseas. </para>
          <para>The honourable member mentioned the 'Life- Be In It' program. That also has proceeded well. In co-operation with the States the program will commence on a national basis in the last week in November. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Treasurer, concerns the minting of an Australian gold coin. The Treasurer will remember that I have made representations to him and have suggested to the Government that Australia should have a gold coin. Earlier in this session, in answer to a question from me on this subject, the Treasurer indicated that the issue of an Australian gold coin was under consideration. Does the Treasurer agree that the issue of a gold coin would be a profitable venture for the Government? Has the Government made a decision on this matter? Will Australia have a gold coin. </para>

The honourable gentleman has pressed this matter very vigorously with me over a long period of time and I can assure him that as a consequence of his representations the Government has decided to adopt in principle the issue of a gold coin. The matter will, of course, be dependent upon further processes. There are technical difficulties which will have to be resolved but I can advise the honourable gentleman that the Government has decided to adopt in principle the representations he has made. </para>

I ask: Has the Government had an opportunity yet to assess the impact of this scheme? If so, can the Prime Minister say whether it has assisted in alleviating the serious problems faced by Tasmanian industries because of high freight costs? </para>

            <para>- In a little under two years this Government has done more in terms of special policies for Tasmania than, I think, any other government has done since the federation of Australia. A number of concerted policies have been announced and are operating. There is also a special report on the disabilities of Tasmanian industries. An announcement yet to be made in the other place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> will very shortly be made in this House by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. So far as freight equalisation is concerned, a number of specific benefits have flowed to Tasmanian industries. The cattle, sheep and pig industries have benefited; the fruit and vegetable industries have benefited to the extent of about $3m; confectionery and chocolate products, baled wool, pulp and waste paper, tin, newsprint and paper have benefited by nearly $6m- an area m which I think the honourable gentleman might well have an interest In addition, the aluminium and zinc metal industries, as well as a number of other industries, have been advanced significantly. A great many Tasmanian firms and a number of other industries have benefited specifically as a result of our policy on freight equalisation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I hope all honourable gentlemen in this House will be particularly pleased at the announcement that has been made about the spending of some $30m at Burnie. That reflects the confidence of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd in Australia's future. This company's decision to spend $30m on expansion, I venture to say, might well not have occurred had it not been for the policies of freight equalisation. This indicates what we are doing for jobs and opportunities in Tasmania. </para>
          <para>I think it ought to be said that the honourable gentleman and his Tasmanian colleagues quite constantly, vigorously and certainly very properly have brought to the notice of Government Ministers the particular and special requirements of Tasmania. We are now starting to see the very real benefit of those policies in Tasmania, just as we are starting to see the very real benefit of our general overall policies throughout the whole of Australia. I compliment the honourable gentlemen on the effect that their representations have had- especially this latest example, APPM's $30m vote of confidence in our policies towards Tasmania and Australia. That is not a bad vote to have. </para>

Is it not a fact that there are vendors of the property being purchased?

            <para>-The honourable member for Shortland has to be the slowest learner in the House. The first thing he does not understand is the proprieties that usually accompany the naming of individuals in the Parliament. When the Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister he was very precise on this matter and said that any time an individual was named in a question that question should go on the Notice Paper. I do not know that the Leader of the Opposition has been so pernickety on that matter since he came back as Leader of the Opposition, but that is something for the record. The honourable member for Shortland ought at least to follow those procedures. In his question he has made what I would call some rather scurrilous suggestions. I do not propose to deal with them lightly. I will treat the question as though it is on notice and give him a considered reply. </para>

            <para>-Dr Mabon completed his full itinerary here. The discussions were extremely useful and, as all honourable gentlemen know, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> made quite clear the extent to which the British working people are depending upon supplies of uranium to produce energy for peaceful purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> conducted himself, I believe, with great propriety in the face of a certain degree of provocation on one or two occasions. What he was saying was completely consistent, as I have indicated to the House before, with the attitudes expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wedgwood</inline> Benn and also by the British Prime Minister, who rightly have not only a concern for matters of proliferation that are of major world concern but also a concern and an obligation in relation to their own people and in relation to the provision of energy to keep their factories operating. It ought to be noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> did complete his full itinerary in this country. This is the normal program that is put out, and I would like to table it; if honourable gentlemen would like to look at it in order to make quite certain that he completed his itinerary. On <inline font-style="italic">Willesee at Seven</inline> on 3 November a certain person, when he was interviewed, said: . . . there are some people in Britain . . . who have allowed their judgment and their good sense to be warped by their own particular personal- </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Then he was interrupted. He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>He was told by his Government to shut up and come home. He did and he has. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable gentleman who made that statement knows quite well that it was a completely false statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> did what he was intended to do and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> completed his itinerary. Let me leave that as one more falsehood in a current affairs interview. I think these current affairs programs really ought to be applauded because the more they get the honourable gentleman on, the more he speaks and the more he mentions in front of large audiences and in front of the people of Australia various factors which are evidently false, the better the Government parties will like it over the next six weeks. I shall just point out one or two other things. I would not want to go exhaustively into the list of these matters, but he said: . . . if Utah and Ford were to pay taxes, as Australian owned companies have to, then there would be plenty to spare. </para>
          <para class="block">Ford, of course, as I am advised, does pay tax in the normal way. It is registered in Australia. A government might get $40m or $50m out of these companies, even with Labor's vicious taxes, and I do not think that $40m or $50m would go very far towards paying the $3 billion for the promises that the honourable gentleman has already made. At another point the honourable gentleman said: ... we didn't have to devalue, we didn't have to devalue. </para>
          <para class="block">He said that twice. Later in the interview he said it again. Would he like to say in this Parliament that the Labor Government did not devalue in its time, as he said three times in that television interview last night? That really was a plain, blatant, utter and knowing falsehood of which the honourable gentleman must have been well aware. If he was not aware of it and it was a moment's mental aberration, really it is a stance claim for him to make while he is trying to lead a political party into an election, which I suppose his supporters are hoping he will lose. That was something said falsely three times- plainly, bla.tandy and evidently- last night on television. Yes, three times he said it. Of course, in September 1974 there was that particular devaluation. The honourable gentleman is exposing himself to the Australian people time and time again for what he has become, and all these parties want is for him to be given the maximum opportunity to show himself for what he is. I know that people then will vote accordingly. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I would like to supplement an answer which I gave during Question Time in response to a question from the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes).</inline> He asked specifically a question regarding some sales of wool from Flushing. In the time available I have not been able to identify sales from one selling centre, but wool is held at both Flushing and Tilburg and between 23 September and 14 October sales were made from stock piles in those two centres. I am advised that the realisation was approximately $1.7m. That represents not just the total cost value. The sales included a small premium which is always added to cover added costs of holding wool outside Australia and to compensate for the wool being sold privately. The idea is to try to make the Australian auction system more attractive. I am advised that the only sales that have been negotiated have been on that basis. There is no record of sales being made on the basis that the honourable gentleman has suggested. </para>

        <para>Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has misrepresented what I have had to say on unemployment in Australia and in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. I want to correct the position. Australia has normally had a lower rate of unemployment than the average for OECD countries. This remained true during 1974 and 1975. In 1974, Australia experienced an unemployment rate of 2.2 per cent compared with the OECD average of 3.3 per cent. In 1975 the figures were 4.3 per cent for Australia and 5.1 per cent for the OECD average. Unemployment went up everywhere in that year. By the third quarter of 1976 the rate of unemployment in Australia had risen to 5.2 per cent, almost the same as the average rate in OECD countries which was, by then, 5.3 per cent. By the second quarter of this year the rates were identical- 5.5 per cent in Australia and also, on average, 5.5 per cent in the other OECD countries. The second quarter of this year is the last quarter for which OECD figures have been published. The current seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment in Australia has risen to 5.8 per cent. It is unlikely that the average figure for the OECD countries when published, will be found to have risen to 5.8 per cent. </para>

The increase m unemployment under Labor was worse than in many other countries. Unemployment in 1975 was nearly three times the 1962-72 average in Australia. In the United States it was 1.8 times, in Japan 1.6 times, in Canada 1.4 times and in the United Kingdom 1.7 times. Under Labor unemployment went up 157 per cent in one year. No other country can match that notorious record. The document that became public yesterday, evidently, the Tariff Board report politely named 'how to increase imports' but more properly named 'how to increase unemployment', demonstrated perfectly plainly that the Leader of the Opposition was pursuing a policy designed to increase unemployment. </para>

            <para>- I move this motion because in the last few weeks the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> has been appearing on a number of occasions on the media and around Australia and making statements which we believe to be deliberately contrary to the real position. In circumstances in which he is offering himself to the Australian people as an alternative Prime Minister, we believe that the suspension of Standing Orders to debate a motion of this sort is the only fit and proper way by which the Parliament of Australia and the people of Australia can adequately and effectively deliberate on matters which we believe are being distorted before the eyes and the ears of every Australian. </para>

        </continue><para>The position of Prime Minister of this country is such that no man can lay down his case and purport that case to be true when in fact it is not true without the people being advised to that effect. The proposal to suspend Standing Orders is to ensure that the people of Australia look back at the real record, the real facts and the circumstances of the whole economic program of the Whitlam Government. It is imperative that we suspend Standing Orders so that we can deliberate on these matters. We believe that the various statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition in public to the media, on the electronic media in particular, are deliberately misleading the Australian people on matters of substance and matters of real concern. For that reason I have moved that we suspend Standing Orders so that the debate can ensue on the substantive motion. </para><continue>

          <para>-The Opposition will not oppose this motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. We realise that it is a parliamentary tactic which is being followed for the purpose of giving the Government some semblance of respectability in its claims in the electorate. We believe that Parliament is entitled to a debate on the economic management of the Government, and we will seek to have that debate. We believe that the Government ought to be exposed for the sort of fraud that it has perpetrated on this Parliament. In the deep hours the other night the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> came into the House and admitted to the Parliament that at Question Time he had used the seasonal figures of two years ago and compared them with the current figures. Thus he gave false information to the Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is important that the Parliament debates the real issues. It is sitting at a time when an election has been called. In recent days the Government has sought on every possible occasion to prevent debate on matters of substance relating to the election. The Opposition will not oppose the motion, even though we realise that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> feel the need for this type of smokescreen in order to cover up matters of real substance which ought to be debated in the electorate. The Government will be using its numbers to carry the motion. I am fairly certain that the Leader of the House was hoping that we would oppose his motion. We will not. </para>
        <para>I can assure the Leader of the House and other honourable members who sit behind him that those people who pay the Medibank levy, for instance, know that they pay it. It is not a mirage, as the Prime Minister seems to suggest, in the cost of living. The levy comes out of the pockets of the people. It may be a mirage to honourable gentlemen opposite. It is certainly important that the Parliament should expose the deception and the damage that has been done to this country by the self righteous, opinionated approach to policy of the Government. It has portrayed itself to everyone as God and has said that everyone who opposes it or suggests that it is wrong is guilty of a mortal sin and should be excommunicated from the community. We do not propose to oppose the motion. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition does not object to the suspension of Standing Orders for the purpose of debating this matter. It is quite clear that only by allowing a debate on this matter will the Opposition be given the opportunity to put the correct facts in relation to Australia and the rest of the world. I gave notice yesterday of a motion of censure. It was not taken immediately, as would be the normal practice. It is quite obvious from the antics of the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that he will not today move for the suspension of the Standing Orders to take the motion of censure of which I gave notice yesterday. A week ago also I gave notice of a motion of censure. Again, the Leader of the House did not follow the normal procedure of immediately moving suspension of Standing Orders to enable the censure motion to be debated. On subsequent days no such motion was taken. I have therefore taken the censure motion off today's Notice Paper. Instead, since it was likely that the Government would not call on the motion of censure of which I gave notice to be debated today, I put the substance of that censure in the form of a matter of public importance. I anticipate that you will call on that debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because it is on the informal unofficial Blue Paper which we all have before us but that the Leader of the House will abort it by moving that the business of the House be called on or whatever the formula is. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Opposition welcomes the opportunity of putting these questions straight in the Parliament. The Government has adopted the technique of providing its back benchers, particularly those who will be in this place for the last time next week, with questions which give the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> or the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)-</inline> when he is here- an opportunity to make prepared speeches and an opportunity to distort the facts and to misrepresent them completely. Out of this farrago of falsehoods which constantly spews forth from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer at Question Time, they and those who sit so forlornly behind them, hope to gain some publicity. </para>

It is only when a substantive motion is before the House that members of Parliament, both front bench and back bench, have an equal opportunity to put their cases. Question Time has been so distorted by having Dorothy Dix questions thrown up by oncers to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer that the Opposition welcomes the opportunity to have a substantial debate. We have been constantly prevented from having that debate. I cannot remember a case when so many notices of censure have been ignored in this manner. There is one motion of censure on the notice paper which should be coming on today. It will not be coming on, so we can now put the case on the motion which the Government will move. </para>

        <para class="block">Government went out of office the Australian dollar stood higher than when the Labor Government came in. The Australian dollar stands much lower now than it did when the Fraser Government was installed because of the frequent devaluations that this Government has made. Devaluations were always a prickly matter in the Government which preceded mine. The right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William McMahon)</inline> has disclosed the fact- and I hope he will be given the opportunity to repeat it, for it is a most valuable comment- that during the last debate that took place on devaluation in December 1971 he admitted that he was preparing to have a solely Liberal ministry sworn in. The Country Party was to be omitted from the ministry in the circumstances that he outlined. I do not want to go further, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because you were the Treasurer at the time. </para>

          <para>- I wish to raise the point that, whilst we agreed to this debate proceeding, it seems to me to be a total misuse of the parliamentary forms. There are already on the Notice Paper a number of items which, if debated adequately, would cover the matters that are contained in the substantive motion. I refer to the Australian Rural Bank Bill, which I have no doubt will be debated in die most meagre fashion, the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill and the Industries Assistance Commission Amendment Bill. There are two reports on the Notice Paper which are unlikely to be debated. They have been on the Notice Paper for a long while. I refer to the report by the Department of Productivity and the White Paper and ministerial statement on Manufacturing Industry. They could cover the whole question of the economy of the country. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I regard the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders as a total misuse of parliamentary time and of the parliamentary power of the majority. During the last few weeks when we were debating the Estimates, in each instance the debate was cut short. Matters that ought to have been debated fully were not debated. I want to know for how long the debate on the censure motion will proceed. Will it be an open forum in which at least 10 or 12 members will take part, or will it be simply another foray, so that there is a record placed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> by two or three members from each side, and the rest of us being here to make up the numbers? On this matter I speak on behalf of everybody in this Parliament, I am sure. There has been a great deterioration in the opportunity for most back bench members to participate in debate. Honourable members will say to me: 'Yes, but you make enough noise; you speak often enough . It is true that I do. I have spent a long time studying the Standing Orders so that I can take advantage of opportunities such as this to say what I have said now. There are other opportunities which I may take if I am not heard properly and in the way in which I think the man representing the people of Wills ought to be heard. My firm conviction is that the representative of the people of Wills ought to have as much right to speak in this House as the man who represents the people of Wannon. This is a consortium of equals. The way in which it has been handled is a disgrace to the parliamentary system. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking about the necessity to suspend Standing Orders. I am saying that it is unnecessary. The point of order taken by the temporary honourable member for New England is a typical example of him and of his approach to everybody else in the place. Fortunately the lessons of history are clear to those who care to look. The people who exercise power in an arbitrary and a capricious fashion are due for the axe themselves before long. </para>

        <para class="block">It is not lightly that the Government launches this motion, and contrary to the assertions made during the debate on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders the purpose of this motion is to ensure an adequate opportunity for people outside this place to know something of the farago of falsehoods, if I might use the phrase that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> has used, that has been spread around Australia on the media and in the newspapers by those people who are putting themselves up as the alternative government of this country and who in a few weeks will seek to offer themselves as the Government of this country. The list of items in the motion is brief but the number of false assertions by the Leader of the Opposition is many. The motion lists five. The first paragraph in the motion is: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>His assertion that Australia's rate of inflation has not fallen during 1976-77. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What utter nonsense! Can the man not read? Can he not understand? Probably the answer is no. Surely, with all that economic advice, conflicting though it might be, by those several and successive Treasurers, would-be Treasurers and possible Treasurers behind him, there is a capacity for him to understand that the consumer price index at this stage indicates that the rate of inflation in Australia is now below double digits. What a contrast to the 19.4 per cent inflation rate at the height of the Labor years. The second paragraph m the motion is: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>His false and misleading comparisons of the economic performance of Australia and other Western countries during 1976 and 1977. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Statistically, every comparison between Australia and other countries shows that we are doing very well. A couple of other countries are doing better than we are, but over the whole of the parameter of the average of the countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development there is no doubt. Our economy is picking up. I want to say a little in a moment about the state of play as we inherited it in December 1975. Everybody should look at the alternative, look at the man who was there for only two years and who has already acknowledged that if he were to be elected he would be only a lame duck Prime Minister, not a man there for the full term, not a man who wants to stay but a man who wants to get out. Quite obviously those behind him also want that. Whether he will stay after he is defeated at the election, as he undoubtedly will be, .is another interesting matter of contention. </para>
        <para>In terms of his comparison of economic performance, there is no substance whatsoever in his suggestion that the Australian economy is not now improving significantly. The various economic writers who have been looking at the performance during the last three months, in particular looking at the last CPI figure, are acknowledging that it now signifies that the Australian economy is rising out of the morass into which the Labor Party led us more than three years ago. The third paragraph in the motion is: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>His claim that under the Labor Government inflation and unemployment were no worse than in other countries. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Again, that is an utterly false contention. It is misleading. It is deliberately seeking to put the Australian voter into a position of believing that in some way the improvement that is demonstrable is not real. On the contrary, the assertions that the Leader of the Opposition makes are unreal. They are intent on leading people into a totally false belief on the overall state of the man's capacity in government. </para>

        <para class="block">Those statements are deliberately misleading and false. Speaking on unemployment during this Government's term, the Leader of the Opposition said: . . . Canada and the United States and West Germany . . . they don't have as much unemployment </para>
        <para class="block">He went on: . . . unemployment has certainly gone down in every other Western country . . . You can't quote another country in the world where it has gone up anywhere near that at all. </para>
        <para class="block">Unquestionably, the Leader of the Opposition was making two assertions. The first was that under Labor Australia's economic performance was as good as that of other countries. The second was that under the present Government it is worse. It is for that reason that I believe it is quite imperative that we look at the real record and see where we are. </para>
        <para>Firstly, Labor's inflation was demonstrably worse than that of many other countries. There are so many statements, articles and commentaries about the record of those Labor days that there is little point in my going through them all today. I wish to mention only two. One is an article by Professor Michael Parkin, who has the chair in Economics at the University of Western Ontario. He was a visiting research economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1973. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 14 January 1976 he commented about the Whitlam performance: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This is a worse stagflation performance than that achieved by any comparable country. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So much for the performance of Labor. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There is no mystery as to why the Australian economy suffered a worse stagflation than any other major country. It was not because of the behaviour of Australia's labour unions: it was not because Australia was in a particularly vulnerable position . . . </para>
          <para>The stagflation was made in Canberra by budgetary and monetary policies which can only be described as insane. </para>
          <para>The problem with Whitlam 's economic management can be summed up in a phrase as "too much, too often'. </para>
          <para>The Labor Government has left the Australian economy in a very dangerous situation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Just in case there is any mistake in the minds and memories of people about those days of Labor mismanagement, I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> of 27 March 1976. This was an article in the British media describing something of the problems that Britain saw in Australia. It made this comment about the Australian economy in those Labor days: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This is now in a state of even greater confusion than most other Western economies . . . </para>
          <para>The major economic mistake of the Whitlam government was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> himself was more interested in foreign policy and the quality-of-life issue at home than he was in economics, and at the decisive period of his prime ministership he left the economy in the charge of left-wingers whom he never really tried to get under control until it was too late. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is that, above all else, that the people of Australia need to recognise as one of the Achilles' heels of the present Labor regime. In the problems and traumas of the Labor management one finds the Leader of the Opposition still subject to the same insidious influence by the communist trade union leaders and the radical left wing. There is no change. The problem identified in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> of March 1976 is the problem that exists today. It talked about the encouraging of 'a flood of wage increases far beyond the rise in productivity'. There is a comment about the replacement of the successive Treasurers. There is a comment about the extent to which they were inclined 'to say yes to virtually every proposal for increased public spending'. The article goes on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>No economy could stand the double inflationary pressure of a budget deficit this size and a government-encouraged wages explosion. To be sure, Australia was bound to be hit by the general world inflation to some extent But a reasonable guess is that its own inflation could have been held down to about eight to ten per cent if the economy had been managed better, the country does not, after all, need to import most of its raw materials, and it supplies two thirds of its own oil. Instead, inflation went up to 17 per cent at its peak. The overpricing of labour, and the squeeze this applied to the cash flow of companies, sent unemployment up higher than it need have gone . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">They are only two of the commentaries on the state of play in those days. Thirdly, Labor certainly generated a pace of escalating unemployment that was greater than that in any of the other member countries of the OECD. In the United States of America it went up 1.8 times the 1962-72 average; in Australia three times; in Japan 1.6 times; in Canada 1.4 times; and in the United Kingdom 1.75 times. Labor's record was three times the average. Under Labor unemployment rose 157 per cent in one year. So much for the claim of the Leader of the Opposition that unemployment was not bad. Under Labor inflation rose above 17 per cent. The underlying rate of inflation today has geen reduced, if one takes the annual rate for the first nine months of this year, to 9.1 per cent. There is no doubt that each one of the assertions by the Leader of the Opposition is made deliberately to mislead the Australian electorate. There is no doubt that the statements are not accurate. They have no substance in fact, and they are deliberately intended to persuade the Australian people in some way that those disastrous three Labor years can be put aside. </para>
        <para>An interesting article was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Reader's Digest</inline> in the United States in January this year. It was published only in the United States, but it identifies one of the problems that we have had. So many of the overseas commentators accepted that under the successive LiberalCountry Party governments prior to 1972 there was a continuity and responsibility in government. They knew that government was understandable and trustworthy. But the article I am about to read illustrates just what those Labor years did to Australia's reputation. It is headed 'The Sobering Story of Australia's Big Spending'. The Labor Prime Minister might well be called the last of the big spenders. The article begins: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In April 1975, the Australian economy was in its worst shape since the Great Depression. The country's socialist Labor Government was running a $3 billion deficit, five per cent of the gross national product. Business confidence had all but vanished, unemployment had soared to the highest level in 30 years and inflation had accelerated to an annual rate of 13.4 per cent. In Canberra, Australia's federal capital, a wry joke went the rounds: 'The only Australian factory working day and night is the government mint. ' </para>

It states: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>When Labor came into office in late 1972, unemployment was just 2.4 per cent and inflation 4.5 per cent- an economic performance matched only by West Germany. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that it was not so when he came into office? Of course not. What happened? The whole of the development over those three years led to this commentary by my predecessor as Leader of the House: 'Few of us bothered to count the cost in those early days', said Fred Daly. 'We spent money as if it were going out of fashion', said Fred Daly. That is what one of his colleagues thought of him. Remember those commentaries he made in his first years in office that the Labor Government had some special relationship with the trade union movement. But strikes proliferated and 2.634 million working days were lost- a 31 per cent increase over that for the 1972 period. Then of course we had the Khemlani affiair and those Iraqi breakfasts and all those disastrous attempts to try to cover up and patch up the economy in ways that led to the Labor Government's defeat in December 1975. </para>
        <para>One of the things that does worry me in terms of the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition is that he is now saying he has learned his lesson; that perhaps the Labor Government was rash; that if he oners himself to the people on an economic program it will be properly costed. That demonstrably is not true. The demonstrable untruths in the statements he has made to the public in the media in the last few weeks set theackground. He has successively made a number of statements. They have been contradicted by the truth. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> in answers in this House, has successively gone through each of those points. </para>
        <para>The point I first wish to make is that the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition as an alternative Prime Minister is ml. The second point is that the people of Australia need to realise that the statements he is making about his performance as Prime Minister, about the economy under Labor, are equally totally wrong. The third point is that as far as our performance is concerned most of the traumas we have had in trying to establish again common sense and rationality in developing sound economic programs, in again launching Australia into a position of full employment, have been because of the heritage of those Whitlam years. In the primary industry sector alone, there are so many areas where, as a result of the implementation of those Coombs report recommendations, Australian farmers were significantly disadvantaged. Of course <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has never had any particular regard for the farming community. Setting that aside, his assertion of what his government might do needs to be seen in the light of the mis-statements he has been making in the media in recent weeks. </para>
        <para>This censure motion is presented to the Parliament and to the Australian public because it is essential that people realise that in no way have the economic policies of Labor changed from those of the Labor regime of 197S. They need to remember the product of the economic programs of the Whitlam Government in 1975 and, in looking at the statements that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has made in recent weeks, accept that not only has he not learned his lesson but also that he is not prepared to tell the truth about it. </para>

            <para>-Yes, I shall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I first state this fact: The Australian economy is now more depressed than at any time since the middle of 1972. This is the finding of an impeccable source- the Australia and New Zealand Bank. I am referring not to a United States edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Reader's Digest</inline> of last January but to the ANZ Bank's index of economic activity released two days ago. This index is based on the Bank 's own measures of the level of factory production, of job vacancies, retail sales and motor vehicle registrations. The index shows the appalling extent to which the economy has fallen below the level of economic activity which could be expected on the basis of past trends of economic growth. It shows that the Australian economy has fallen far below the level of output and income which should have existed and has fallen lower than at any time since mid- 1 972. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>This is the measure of the consequences of the Fraser Government's policies for economic recovery- the government which was going to turn on the lights. Instead, the ANZ index throws an entirely new light on the state of the economy. It is true that most people discount entirely the claims of recovery made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> who avoids Question Time. So they should discount those claims. The more charitable observers have thought that Australia was now just stagnating- striving for salvation through stagnation, as the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> has said. But the evidence which is now becoming available shows that far from recovering, as the Government has claimed, the Australian economy has declined severely during 1977. There has not merely been stagnation; the recession is deepening and deepening. </para>
        <para>The central truth about this Government's economic management is that it has chosen policies which are deliberately aimed at driving down production, output and employment. This is the result of its hostility to the public sector, even when the effect of crippling the public sector is to cripple the private sector equally. A competent, compassionate government would recognise that its true task lay in reducing the rate of inflation and unemployment together, and that these twin aims can 'best be achieved by careful, selective, stimulatory policies aimed at moving the economy progressively towards fuller employment and greater price stability. This Government, however, has chosen the destructive approach of deliberately retarding recovery. The consequence has been severely to depress all economic activity and to increase the difficulty of eventual recovery because of the distortions which are being effected in the economy. </para>
        <para>Let us examine the facts. The ANZ Bank index shows a severe recession in 1961- the result of the Menzies credit squeeze- a shallower trough in 1966-67, a sharp deterioration in 1971 ending in about April 1972, a splendid expansionary phase throughout 1973, a decline during the world-wide recession following the oil crisis of 1974, and the beginning of recovery in late 1975 and early 1976 when the effects of the Hayden Budget were still working. Since the beginning of 1977 it has been falling sharply. This new recessionthe worst slump for five years- is all the Fraser Government's own work. </para>
        <para>The ANZ index is made up of four indicators: Total new motor vehicle registrations, retail sales, factory production and job vacancies. Registrations of new motor vehicles have fallen in each of the last three months and in September were 5 per cent lower than a year earlier. Retail sales increased by 1 1 per cent during the last year. Since the existing rate of inflation was 13.1 per cent, this means that real retail sales have fallen during the last year by 2. 1 per cent. </para>
        <para>Factory production, which is the third indicator, has been falling since the beginning of 1977. The decline has been continuous since January. Total factory production is now well below the level in November 1975 when this Government was installed. The number of job vacancies registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service fell sharply during the first five months of this year and has remained at the same low levels since then. The ratio for unemployed to vacancies is now 16: 1. </para>
        <para>Let me emphasise: These are not my figures or my chosen indicators. They are the key indicators chosen by the ANZ Bank to show the current state of the economy. They have been chosen from amongst a great many available series as being most suitable as indicators of the present state of the economy. Most indicators lag considerably behind events. These ones are available fairly quickly. They represent a cross section of real activity in the economy. And most important, they have been found by the experts to be the most accurate guides to the real level of aggregate economic activity. </para>
        <para>The ANZ index has not been published before. We are fortunate that it should become available now, because it shows us clearly the state into which the economy has fallen as a result of Fraser-Lynch policies. The message of the ANZ survey is repeated in every other indicator published since the Prime Minister announced his panic election. The message is plain and it is always the same: There has been severe economic deterioration throughout 1977. For example, at the beginning of this week the most recent month's home building approvals were released by the Statistician. They show that home building approvals slumped during the last year. In September they were 22 per cent lower than in September last year. In fact building approvals are now 14 per cent lower than they were in September 1975. This is particularly serious because building approvals are another leading indicator of the level of economic activity. </para>
        <para>Another indicator published a week ago is the Statistician's unemployment figures- the Prime Minister's own preferred index of unemployment. The Statistician says that 5.8 per cent of the work force is now unemployed. He has also estimated that at least another 65,000 people have ceased to seek work because of repeated rejection and disappointment. He classifies them as 'discouraged persons'. So real unemployment is already above 400,000. This means that unemployment will rise above half a million early next year. Unless there is a change of policies, and that requires a change of Government, it will remain higher than in 1977 throughout 1978. </para>
        <para>Under this Government there has been a dramatic drop in private sector employment. Total private employment has declined by 50,000 since November 1975. So much for the recovery of the private sector under a private enterprise Government! </para>
        <para>What we have now is a new slump brought on by deliberate domestic policy. This is not a continuation of the world wide downturn of 1974-75. It is a new recession-all Australia's own work. Real government outlays have fallen during the last two years. In its obsessive hostility to the public sector the Fraser Government has taken perverse pride in an ^discriminate and arbitrary slashing of cost-effective programs. Yet it does not have the wit to see that what it is doing does not make room for the private sector. It merely reduces the demand for the goods and services produced by the private sector. Our obsessed and obsessive Prime Minister cannot see that the two sectors depend on each other. </para>
        <para>The Fraser Government has been inflicting wounds on the Australian economy. We are now in the midst of a recession caused directly by domestic policy. In late 1974 and early 1975 Australia shared a recession with the rest of the world. In contrast, the 1977 recession is internally generated. This is all the Fraser Government's own work. The Prime Minister, in his characteristic fashion, has tried to create confusion about this in every Question Time. The facts are unambiguous. In 1974 and 1975 the annual rates of growth in Australia were one per cent to 1.5 per cent respectively. During those two years the average level of economic activity fell in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </para>
        <para>In 1974 the OECD average fell by 0.1 per cent and, in 1 975, by one per cent. In both those years therefore, while output was falling overseas, it continued to grow m Australia. The difference between the situation in Australia and the situation in the OECD countries as a whole was quite marked. Our rate of growth was 1.1 per cent faster than the OECD average in 1974 and 2.5 per cent faster in 1975. These are the OECD's own figures. The exact reverse is true for 1976 and for the estimates for 1977. In 1976 national income grew by 3.6 per cent in Australia but by 5.2 per cent on average in the OECD countries. The rate of growth in Australia was well below the OECD average last year. In the current year the rate of growth in Australia is estimated to be 2 per cent and, in the OECD countries, 4 per cent. That is, under Labor, Australia's growth rate was higher than the OECD average; under Fraser it is lower. </para>
        <para>Only one conclusion can be drawn from these facts and figures. During the years of international recession of 1974 and 1975 Australia's national income continued to grow. The Labor Government's policies prevented Australia from experiencing the worst of the international recession. Yet during the last two years the contractionary policies of the Fraser Government have forced an artificially low rate of growth on Australia. Under Labor, Australia performed better than most OECD countries. Under the Liberals, Australia has performed far worse than other OECD countries. And why? Because other governments have been encouraging economic expansion while this blinkered Government has been ensuring recession. The most recent Australian national accounts show that the national income actually fell in Australia in the first half of this year. </para>
        <para>Earlier I gave the unemployment figures which showed that in 1974 and 1975 the gap between the OECD average and Australia was in Australia's favour but that in 1976 and 1977 it contracted and disappeared. Unemployment in Australia is still worsening. Whereas Australia used to be below the other industrialised countries in unemployment, it now has a rate of unemployment higher than their average. Unemployment in Australia has been worsening relative to the situation in most other industrialised countries. </para>
        <para>All this havoc, deterioration and damage have been done in the name of fighting inflation. So let us examine the facts about inflation. In the year to September 1975 the rate of inflation in Australia was 12.1 per cent. This was the rate of inflation in this country when the last election was held. At that time the average annual rate of inflation in the OECD countries was 10.4 per cent. In the year to September 1976 the rate of inflation in Australia was 13.9 per cent; in the OECD countries it was 8.3 per cent. In 1975 the difference between Australia and the OECD countries was 1.7 per cent. In 1976 it became 5.6 per cent. It sharply increased in this Government's first year. </para>
        <para>The rate of inflation in Australia in the year from September 1976 to September this year was 13.1 per cent. The OECD average was 9.4 per cent. The difference is 3.7 per cent. The figures show dramatically that Australia's inflation rate has not improved and has tended to worsen relative to other industrialised countries during this Government's term of office. The Fraser Government has had two years in which to experiment. All the evidence shows clearly that its policies have failed. It refuses to change its policies; therefore a new government must be elected. Two years ago, the Prime Minister demanded three years. He has only himself to blame when the people say on 10 December. You've had enough- and we've had enough'. </para>

            <para>- I repeat that Australia cannot afford the high cost of another term of government by the conservative coalition parties. The 1976-77 recession cost Australia in excess of $3,600m in lost domestic product. A conservative estimate is that lost domestic product in this financial year will exceed $4,500m. The Government likes to imply that there is enormous disruption and cost to the Australian community because of industrial disruption. Lost work days through the recession in 1976-77 exceeded 68 million. Compare that against a little over 3 million work days lost through industrial disputes. Compare the high cost in lost domestic product which was the result of the disastrous economic policies of the Government in that year- $3,600m- with the cost in lost domestic product through industrial disputes of $ 1 70m. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>It is a simple matter to calculate the working days lost through unemployment after allowing for holidays and so on and relating that as a ratio of the total wage bill to gross domestic product. I point out that the result is that the disastrous consequences of Liberal-National Country Party Administration during 1976-77 exceeded $3,600m in lost domestic product for this country. That means more than 5 per cent of the gross domestic product of this country for that year was lost. That is a conservative estimate because it makes no allowance at all for hidden unemployment which represents probably another 2 per cent on top of the official unemployment statistics. The Government is claiming that there will be a recovery in the new year. The Treasurer (My Lynch) is on record as saying this. Nothing could be more deceptive and dishonest than that statement. The Government does not believe it. If inflation is to be reduced to single digit figures in the new year, if the economy is going to be moving forward again strongly, then why is the Government going to the people at this point when, politically its situation is so precarious? Why is it seeking an election when the opinion polls show so convincingly that it would be very lucky indeed to win government? The fact is that in the new year there will be record high unemployment, the country will be in the grip of stagnation and there will be little impact at all upon the level of inflation in the country. That is why the Government is seeking a Senate election some seven months ahead of the normal time and a House of Representatives election more than a year ahead of the normal time. </para>
        <para>The Treasurer's suggestion yesterday, which was reported in the media this morning, that there is expected to be a substantial reduction in inflation in the course of this financial year is nothing but cheap pie in the sky served up as election fare. Not even the Government believes that because none of its advisers believes it. Let us look at what these advisers have been telling the Government. The Reserve Bank of Australia has told the Government that by June next year unemployment will be of the order of 6 per cent, much higher than for any month this year. Month by month this year we have had the highest unemployment since the Great Depression of nearly half a century ago. The Reserve Bank of Australia- the information has been published- has indicated that the rate of growth in the economy will be down to about 1.3 per cent- almost a dead halt. After the very slow rate of growth last year, which was higher than is projected for next year, it is quite evident that as bad as things have been this year in economic terms, they will be far worse next year. The Reserve Bank report says bluntly that the effects of the Government's monetary policy and the general thrust of economic management imply a credit squeeze in the course of this financial year. That is a clear implication of Treasury documentation attached to the Budget Papers. </para>
        <para>The Treasury does not believe the false state- ' ments, the untruthful statements, the dishonest statements, which are being circulated in die community by Government spokesmen, especially the Treasurer. It is a conspiracy of deception against the Australian public for any Government spokesman to suggest even for a minute that there will be an improvement in the economy in the new year. Treasury documentation makes that abundantly clear. I have quoted from the assessment of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of the Australian economy. I stand pretty much by what I have said. My sources are reliable and impeccable. </para>

            <para>-Let us be clear about the substance of these statements. Whether or not the review has been completed in literary detail, the fact is that economic forecasts are available in the OECD, I checked with the local source of my information today, which show that the rate of growth in 1978 will be about 2V4 per cent as against an increase in productivity of about 2 per cent and a growth in the work force of about 2 per cent. That clearly implies an increase in unemployment in calendar year 1978 of something like <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> per cent. There have been grand claims by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the deflator has increased by only 9 per cent. OECD forecasts and projections show that for this year the GDP deflator is expected to increase by about 1 1 per cent, an increase, therefore, on the figure the Prime Minister has been quoting for an earlier annual period, but falling in part of this calendar year, over this calendar year which has been forecast by the OECD. More importantly, the best forecast now before the OECD is about 1014 per cent for calendar year 1978. We are going to have the enormous dislocation of massive increases in unemployment, an economy that is scarcely moving, a deepening of the recession, far more dismal prospects for business and scarcely any dent at all in the rate of inflation in this country. </para>

        <para>Something has been made by the Treasurer of the increase in the consumer price index for the September quarter of 2 per cent. This is only a marginal improvement over the 2.2 per cent for the September quarter last year. Let us look at the interesting parallel between the excessively optimistic and totally hypocritical claims being made by Government spokesmen about their success in conquering inflation in the September quarter. If one goes back to newspapers subsequent to the release of the CPI figures for the September quarter last year, one finds that exactly the same statements were made. I quote from the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 22 October 1976. It said: </para>

        <para class="block">That was a dishonest statement. It was made 12 months ago but the Prime Minister's speech writer has not thought of anything new to say. The Prime Minister is making equally dishonest statements today about the inflation rate following the release of the September quarter figure.

        <para class="block">Inflation was worse for the year ended June this year as against the year ended June the previous year, and is only marginally better for the year ended September this year than for the year ended September last year, yet the Treasurer is making these outlandish claims. The fact is that the Treasurer's policies, in fact the Government's policies in economic management have failed. Let us look at the indicators of price change in the latest Treasury roundup. If we look at the broadly based figures, the early indicators of price movements, we find, for instance, that the implicit deflator for gross non-farm product in March was 4.8 per cent. We find that the external implicit deflator for imports of goods and services was 10.6 per cent in March and 5.5 per cent in June. The external implicit deflator for imported materials used in manufacturing was 11.4 per cent in March. Those forces now are feeding through the economy because of lag problems and economic effects. That means, very simply, that they will tend to telescope into the December quarter and alter and accentuate the inflationary effects of the 1 1 cents per gallon increase in the price of petrol announced m the Budget by the Treasurer. That is the sort of result we are getting and that is why the Government has decided to call an election earlier than later. The economy will not be better later so as bad as things are now it is better to go to the polls earlier because the consequences politically will be disastrous if the Government waits. </para>
        <para>Let us look at the remorseless rise in unemployment which is the direct product, the conscious product, of the Government's policies. The Government believes the more it can increase unemployment, the more it can grind the economy towards a dead halt, the less inflation we will have. It has been very successful in increasing unemployment remorselessly, in grinding the economy towards a dead halt but it has not been particularly successful in reducing inflation. Unemployment in the early new year will be of the order of 7% per cent to 8 per cent, that is, between 465,000 and 500,000 people will be out of work. As many as half a million people will be out of work in the early new year, most of them young people. Compare that with the current situation of a little over 300,000. Since this Government has been in office it has been successful in the area of determinedly increasing unemployment. It has increased unemployment by 24 per cent so far. It is going to increase unemployment by 40 per cent on top of that in the New Year. When we were in government we increased the number of people in the work force by about 150,000. Since this Government came to office it has reduced the number of people in the work force by 11,000. In that period about 120,000 people who would have been added to the available work force are not accounted for in the official statistics. Therefore, one gets a better insight into the sorts of problems confronting this country and the abject failure of Government economic policy. </para>
        <para>What does this Government care about human suffering? Not a jot. In our last Budget we set aside $153m for employment creating programs. The best this Government can provide in this Budget is $7m. If honourable members look at page 92 of the Budget Speech and statements, in Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget they will find that $40m is allocated for the cattle, sheep and pig meat industries. Cattle sheep and pig meat are more important than human beings and the distress that they are suffering. The Utah Development Corporation is able to ship out of this country, in respect of its financial year just completed, some $20m which if adequate income tax laws had been applied could nave been paid to this country as withholding tax. That $20m could have done a lot to relieve the distress of unemployment in Australia. No step has been taken yet - </para>

          <para>-This debate is about the political credibility of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam).</inline> It is entirely appropriate that at this time and in this place we should have a debate about the political credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. We ought to have that debate for two reasons: Firstly, to remind the Australian people of just what happened when he was in charge of the affairs of this nation and, secondly, to remind them that if, by mischance, he were ever given the opportunity to be Prime Minister again he would do it all again. Out of his own mouth is an admission that if ever the Labor Party became the Government of this country again he would do it all again. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think one of the most interesting commentaries on the political fortunes of the Labor Party that can be found at present is an analysis of its approach at Question Time. One would have thought that a parliamentary opposition, six weeks before an election, an election which it says it has a chance of winning, would have organised itself at Question Time and would have endeavoured to probe the policies and the performance of the Government But no, do we see any sign of organisation? Do we see any trace of a systematic approach? No! The only element of co-ordination and synchronisation which has come from the Opposition during Question Time has been scurrilous attempts to impugn the integrity of certain Ministers of this Government. The levels to which members of the Opposition have sunk, particularly the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris),</inline> the sort of questions that have been asked and the sort of implications in them are a very sad commentary. They are a very sad commentary on the contribution to political life by the Parliamentary Labor Party at present. </para>
        <para>More interesting even than that is that those actions are a commentary on the Labor Party's own assessment of its chances of winning this election. They are a commentary on the internal divisions which are apparent to all of us on this side of the House. Where, for example, is1 the putative Treasurer of this country, the honourable member for Adelaide^ <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)?</inline> Where is he? We are having a debate on economic management and on the economic policies of the Labor Party when it was last in power. Where is he? He is not present. Where, for example, is the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)?</inline> I see he has finally graced us with his presence. This debate is about the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and in a broader sense it is about the credibility of the Labor Party as an alternative government of this country. </para>
        <para>In the short space of 1 5 minutes it is impossible to categorise all the misleading statements which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and more recently by the honourable member for Oxley ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden).</inline> Perhaps the greatest untruth of all that has been put around persistently in the past 12 months is that this Government has used unemployment as an instrument for fighting inflation. Time and time again, Labor spokesmen have tried to demonstrate that we have systematically used unemployment as an instrument of fighting inflation. Not only is that statement incorrect, but also it can be more accurately applied to the policies that were pursued by the Labor Party when it was in office. During Question Time yesterday and today the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> referred to that rather infamous document that was commissioned in 1973 entitled 'A Report on Possible Ways of Increasing Imports'. In other words it was a report on how to export more Australian jobs. </para>

            <para>-Of course the Labor Party would do it again. It was quite blatant and unrepentent at the time as to its objective. Out of his own mouth, the present Leader of the Opposition, shortly after announcing the decision for a 23 per cent tariff cut, said: </para>

        <para class="block">In other words he was using the deliberate dismantling of protection for Australian industry and the resultant unemployment as an instrument for fighting inflation. In other words he was sacrificing the jobs of thousands of Australian people. He was doing it quite openly and quite deliberately. Of course the real falsehood of it all is that the very charge which is so untruthfully levelled against us was the very practice which was indulged in By the Labor Party when it was in office. </para>
        <para>That action and these statements were symptomatic of the punitive attitude that the Leader of the Opposition took to so many sectors of our nation while he was Prime Minister. It is very strange that a person who seeks political support should take such a punitive attitude to so much of the Australian nation. His punitive attitude to the primary industries of Australia is well known. Is there any sign that he would be any different if he were again Prime Minister? Is there any sign that he would not again go to the rural areas of Australia and wave his finger at an audience and say: 'You have never had it so good*? Is there any sign that he has learnt a lesson from the fact that as a result of the last election not one single Labor member in this House represents a genuinely rural area of Australia? Has he really learnt that lesson? Of course he has not. </para>
        <para>The punitive attitude of the Leader of the Opposition is not restricted to primary industry. He does not do things in small measures. He also has a punitive attitude to manufacturing industry. That attitude is extremely well known. It reached its dizzy height during his famous address to the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association in 1975 when he talked about the nervous Nellies. Do honourable members remember the talk about the nervous Nellies? Who were the nervous Nellies? They were ordinary Australian people who were worried about losing their jobs m Tasmania. They were also, incidentally, some of his own parliamentary colleagues. So obsessed was the Leader of the Opposition at that time with his punitive approach to manufacturing industry that he regarded his colleague and the Australian people who were concerned about jobs as being nervous Nellies. </para>
        <para>Do honourable members really think that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition towards manufacturing industry has changed? Do they really imagine that if he were given another opportunity he would not do it all again? Of course he would. What did he say in his address to the National Press Club on 20 July this year in answer to a question about levels of protection for Australian manufacturing industry? He said: </para>

          <para>There is no doubt that Australian industry is excessively protected. </para>

        <para>In other words, the Leader of the Opposition was saying very plainly: 'Give me another chance and I will export some more jobs'. Of course that is what he was saying. Give him another chance and he would certainly export some more jobs. </para>
        <para>It is right that this House should today look very carefully at the credibility and the truthfulness of statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. He is asking that in the weeks ahead the Australian people again make him Prime Minister. I believe that it is the duty of this House and it is our duty as members of this House to remind ourselves of what happened between the years 1972 and 1975. We should remind ourselves that, when we listen to the statements of the Leader of the Opposition in the coming weeks, we cannot believe everything we are told. Not only can we not believe everything we are told, but also we cannot believe that he believes everything he tells us. An interesting point about the Leader of the Opposition is that not only does he occasionally say things that are not correct, but also he occasionally says things which contradict what he has said on earlier occasions. One of the more interesting examples of this is a statement that he made on the television program <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> on 26 October 1 977. He said: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, not only was he on that occasion speaking an element of economic truth, but also he was totally contradicting the stance that he had taken on other occasions. Of course, that is illustrative of the carelessness displayed by the Leader of the Opposition towards truth. Last night, during his interview on the Willesee program, he said that the total cost of the taxation concessions given by this Government to the mining industry amounted to $ 1 billion. The true figure, of course, of $560m is almost half that. Last night he accused this Government of having twice devalued the dollar and denied that there was any devaluation under the previous Government. Everybody knows that a 12 per cent devaluation took place in September 1974. Everybody remembers that infamous September quarter of 1974 when unemployment rose by 53 per cent, when inflation reached a figure of 20 per cent and when interest rates rose to 10 per cent. Indeed, it was one of the worst quarters of all during the time that the previous Government was in office. </para>
        <para>It is right that we should draw the attention of the Australian people to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition led the most disastrous government that this country has had since Federation. Of course, he is a person of great modesty, a person who is still quite happy to describe himself as the greatest Foreign Minister this country has had in the past 25 years. Above all, we in this House have an obligation to remind the Australian people that, far from having learnt any lessons during the period that he was in office, the Leader of the Opposition would do it all again. He would return to the printing presses. He would increase government spending to a new level of irresponsibility. He would create once again the levels of unemployment, the levels of inflation, the lack of business confidence, the feeling of division between country and city, and the feeling of isolation in sectors of the Australian community that was so evident between 1972 and 1975. 1 have not the slightest doubt that if, during the next five weeks, the Australian people are reminded, as they have been reminded today, of what happened between 1972 and 1975 and also - </para>

              <para>-by leave-The 166th report comprises two Department of Finance minutes. The practice of presenting Finance minutes is a result of a long-standing arrangement between the Committee and the Department of Finance which ensures that the Committee's recommendations and conclusions are followed up and reported to Parliament. These minutes refer to the Committee's 158th report relating to expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer in 1974-75 and the 160th report relating to expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the same financial year. The minutes detail the action taken to rectify faults in procedures and controls discovered during the Committee 's examination of expenditure performance and the use of the Advance to the Treasurer by departments in the financial year </para>

          <para class="block">1974- 75. </para>
          <para>The 167th report relates to the Committee's inquiry into matters raised by the Auditor-General in his report for the financial year 1975- 76. In the inquiry the Committee found that in the Department of Administrative Services on-the-job training was deficient and there was insufficient supervision of subordinates. The Department of Construction also had been negligent in its responsibilities towards fire safety, and there were considerable arrears in inspections of government property for fire protection purposes, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, where cycle time for surveys had reached 56 years. There was evidence of disregard of financial instructions by senior officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and incredible incompetence shown in the purchase and renovation of a residence in Dublin for the Counsellor at the Australian Embassy. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Northern Territory electricity supply undertaking the financial results since 1971-72 clearly indicate that increasing costs of operation have not been matched by corresponding increases in revenue to recover the full costs of providing power to residents. The Committee records its extreme dissatisfaction that, as a consequence, more than $23m may not have been recovered and believes that a major contributing factor was the division of responsibility between the Department of the Northern Territory and the Department of Construction. A report on the electricity undertaking in the Northern Territory recently tabled in this Parliament recommended that a statutory authority be established to draw these responsibilities together. The Committee believes that in fact responsibilities should be unified and that a single authority should be created for all the utilities in the Northern Territory as a duplicate administrative machine will be wasteful and expensive for consumers. </para>
          <para>The Committee took evidence relating to fraud by officers of the Department of Social Security and beneficiaries. The Committee is concerned to note increasing trends towards overpayments of benefits and has sought a further submission on the matter. The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages in other areas such as health and immigration. The Committee also received evidence that short periods of casual employment were being refused by persons on the grounds that it adversely affects their unemployment benefit entitlements. The Committee believes that changes should be made in administering the benefits so that permanent job seekers are not disadvantaged by taking casual employment when the opportunity arises. </para>
          <para>The 168th report relates specifically to evidence taken in connection with items of expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer in 1976-77. As honourable members are aware, after the close of each financial year the Treasurer submits to the Parliament a statement of expenditure from the Advance to the </para>
          <para class="block">Treasurer showing allocations to heads of expenditure made by him under section 36a of the Audit Act. As our report shows, there were cases where expenditure from the Advance was confined to urgent and unforeseeable requirements for which provision could not have been made in the Appropriation Acts. In other cases, however, there was evidence of overtime being used to circumvent staff ceilings, inefficient estimating procedures, and unacceptable delays which caused expenditure to be charged to the Advance when provision should properly have been made in the Additional Estimates. In general, however, there was a reduction in the number of requests for funds from the Advance, and results of the Committee's examination suggest that the majority of those requests were confined to urgent and unforeseeable requirements. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>for the benefit of the House, I would like to recall, very briefly, the work of the Eleventh Committee, which concludes its work with the presentation of these three reports. Your Committee was appointed in March of 1976 and in the 20 months since then has met on 84 occasions and has presented 13 reports to the Parliament- a total exceeded only by the first Public Accounts Committee chaired by Professor Bland, M.P., which tabled 14 reports. These 13 reports have ranged in subject matter from tabling Finance minutes reporting the follow-up action taken in respect of the Committee 's recommendations, examination of the Auditor-General's annual reports and expenditure performance of departments, examination of the financial affairs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which we regard as a most significant report, and a special report on the conference of Commonwealth and State public accounts committees which I tabled earlier this week. Honourable members will recall that on that occasion I stated that the conference was of historic significance as it was the first occasion since Federation that similar committees from parliaments throughout Australia had gathered together to discuss mutual problems. Already we have begun to implement some of the initiatives outlined in that report. Because of the early prorogation of the Thirtieth Parliament the Committee has been unable to report on its inquiry into the former Overseas Property Bureau, and the Twelfth Committee will have to decide whether to continue a major inquiry into the use of automatic data processing in the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>
          <para>As this is my last statement as  Chairman  of the Eleventh Public Accounts Committee, I would like to thank my colleagues for their co-operation and the Secretary to the Committee and his staff for their devotion to their dudes and loyalty to the Committee. I would like to place on record the Committee's appreciation for the support given by the previous Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tom</inline> Devine, who retired at the end of August after four years with the Committee, and his successor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Talberg. I would like particularly to note the loss to the Parliament and the Committee which will follow the retirement of the Committee's vice-chairman, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean).</inline> He has made a most significant contribution to the work of the Committee and to the Parliament. When the Committee was re-established in September 1952 he was an original member. We are going to miss his wisdom in the next Parliament, but I know that all members of the Committee wish him well in his retirement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I commend the reports to honourable members. </para>

            <para>-by leave-I thank the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly),</inline> for his kind remarks. I thank him for the service I have enjoyed on the Committee. This Parliament has been a very difficult period because almost from week to week we have not known how many more weeks the Parliament was to sit. In the last couple of weeks the Committee has spent a great deal of time just trying to finalise what was on its plate. These matters tend to get lost if they are not finalised before the conclusion of a Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have appreciated the opportunity to come back on to the Committee. It has been a very valuable Committee in the 26 years or so since it was re-established. Actually there was such a committee in the very early days of the Federal Parliament; but it lapsed, I understand, for economy reasons in the 1930s. To my mind, that is simply typical of what can really be false economy. The  Chairman  referred to one or two matters. What sort of an economy is it when buildings worth hundreds of millions of dollars are the property of the Commonwealth and there are not enough firemen to look after them properly, and when there are insufficient people to work all sorts of mechanical devices satisfactorily? I think it is being rather absurd when, in the name of halting inflation, we cease to employ an individual who, if he were employed, certainly would return more in real terms than the cost of his wage or salary. It is time that this sort of thing was looked at more closely. </para>
          <para>I wish the Committee every success in the future, in the very important work that it has to do. I said a couple of evenings ago that I thought the first Budget that I saw presented in this House in 195 1 or 1952 was of the magnitude of a billion pounds or $2 billion. Now we contemplate Budgets of the magnitude of $22 billion. It is about time this Parliament gave far more serious attention to the work done in committees and, even at the expense of time spent in this House, made more time available during the week so that committees could sit for several hours at a time instead of having either to meet on days when the Parliament is not meeting or to try to scramble meetings either at luncheon or dinner breaks. That is not sufficient. </para>
          <para>The work that is done in committees is valuable. I think we get a far better relationship between members in close committee work than we do in the more intense atmosphere of this place. I found that where differences occurred on committees they tended not to be on political lines at all but to be differences of opinion about what are often technical and mechanical matters. I think all of us are better for the cross-fertilisation that can be gained through committee work. I thank the  Chairman  in particular for what he has done, and the staff of the Public Accounts Committee. I hope that the staff will be strengthened so that the work that the Committee is supposed to do can be more satisfactorily encompassed. </para>

              <para>-by leave-The two reports that I have tabled relate to the work of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in the Thirtieth Parliament. The first refers to the inquiry currently being undertaken by the Committee into planning procedures in the Territory. The second is a report from the Committee on a matter referred by the Senate on the extent to which the Committee's report of last December on 'Canberra City Wastes- a Long Term Strategy for Collection and Disposal' has been implemented. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The work of the Committee is now, however, limited to investigations and inquiries referred by the Minister for the Capital Territory or by the Parliament. Members will be familiar with the Committee 's reports on proposals to vary the plan of lay-out of the City of Canberra and its environs. In this Parliament the Committee has examined proposals relating to the 60th, 61st, 62nd, 63rd and 64th series of such proposals and has presented reports to the House on each series. As well as providing a source of information to Parliament about the planning of the national capital, the reports also provide a useful source of information for the local community. It also permits a degree of involvement by the Parliament in the overall planning of the national capital. </para>
          <para>The decision taken by the Committee earlier this year to conduct meetings in public, at which the National Capital Development Commission and the Department brief it on proposals, rather than in closed session means that details of proposals contained in the transcript of these proceedings are readily available for immediate and future use by Press, public and others concerned with or interested in Canberra's planning. The Inquiry into Planning Procedures and Processes in the Australian Capital Territory is well advanced and the Committee would have reported early in the next autumn session if the duration of this Parliament had allowed. Evidence has now been taken from 34 of the 63 persons and organisations who have made submissions to the Inquiry. The Committee also visited Darwin, Adelaide and Albury-Wodonga to obtain relevant background information for the Inquiry and had proposed to extend this to include other capital cities. </para>
          <para>The report I have just tabled contains a strong recommendation that the inquiry into Planning Procedures and Processes in the Australian Capital Territory be again referred to the Committee if it is re-appointed by the thirty-first Parliament. An election for the Legislative Assembly will take place in 1978 at which issues of future constitutional development for the Territory will be widely canvassed. The role that the Legislative Assembly should plan in planning and development is a central point in this Inquiry and will be an important consideration in the debate proceeding that election. The Australian Capital Territory Committee's conclusions and recommendations on the role that the National Parliament should play, the future role and structure of the NCDC and its relation with the Legislative Assembly and the community, as well as relations between the various bodies involved in the planning process and their various relationships with the community should be available for consideration by those involved in that debate. I would therefore emphasise this Committee's view that the re-appointment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory after the election, and the referral of this matter to it again, should be a matter of priority. </para>
          <para>I have also tabled a short report dealing with steps that have been taken to implement the report from this Committee of last DecemberCanberra City Wastes- a Long Term Strategy for Collection and Disposal'. This report simply informs Parliament of the actions that various Ministers and their departments have taken to implement recommendations made in the main report. Annexed to the report itself are copies of replies from Ministers to letters from the  Chairman  of the Committee, detailing the actions so far taken. </para>
          <para>The Committee notes in the report its general satisfaction with progress so far made on the recommendations in its report but expresses the view that proposals which have not been implemented should be matters for continuing review by the departments concerned, and that further action should be taken where appropriate. Particular matters which still concern the Committee are: </para>

          <para class="block">In relation to the Committee's recommendations for the establishment of a waste authority to integrate various aspects of collection and disposal in the Territory, the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> has commented that, in view of possible transfer of this function to the control of the Legislative Assembly, it would be wrong to pre-empt the Assembly by making a decision about future arrangements and authorities. The Minister has, however, established an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee as an interim measure. In the Committee's view, as an interim step, this is a satisfactory compromise but it holds to its earlier view that a waste authority is necessary if this matter is to receive the expert and co-ordinated attention that it requires in a city such as Canberra. </para>
          <para>Finally, I should like to express my thanks to all members and senators who have served on the Committee during this Parliament for the support they have given me as the  Deputy Chairman  and the contributions they have made to the work of the Committee.

          <para class="block">The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Trade Practices Act to enable parties to certain commercial transactions, which fall within the definition in the Act of a consumer transaction, to limit their liability above a minimum level. </para>
          <para>The Trade Practices Amendment Act, which came into force on 1 July 1977, extended the definition of a consumer transaction to include certain commercial transactions involving acquisitions of goods or services costing less than $15,000. Since that amendment, the Government has received representations from sections of industry expressing strong concern. This concern relates to the possibility that, in certain circumstances, a breach of the non-excludable conditions and warranties implied by the Act into relevant commercial contracts could present industry with enormous costs for consequential damages. Furthermore, the Government has been informed that the risk involved in such circumstances is, for the most part, non-insurable. </para>
          <para>The Government has concluded that in the context of commercial dealings in commercial goods or services it is reasonable to allow parties to a contract to negotiate their own arrangements regarding liability for consequential damages flowing from a breach of the contract. The Government is seeking to free Australian commerce from unnecessary straitjackets imposed by legislation. The present position is unnecessarily restrictive. </para>
          <para>In making the amendments to which I have just referred, the Trade Practices Act will continue to maintain a basic philosophy that suppliers of goods or services should stand behind the quality and title of those goods or services in their dealings with business as well as with the public. Accordingly, the Bill does not allow liability for repair or replacement of faulty goods or services or for a breach of the undertakings in section 69 relating to title to be excluded. Further, the Bill does not allow relevant liability to be limited with total disregard to equity between the parties. The Government believes that recent amendments to the law in the United Kingdom in this regard are appropriate to the Australian situation. Accordingly, a limitation of liability in a contract governed by the Trade Practices Act may be challenged on the grounds that the limitation was not fair or reasonable between the parties. </para>
          <para>The Bill gives a list of indications as to the determination of fairness or reasonableness. Apart from the question of limitation of liability there are a number of technical difficulties in the language of the present Act relevant to calculating the monetary limit. Particularly, these relate to situations where goods are hired or leased or there are credit charges involved in a transaction. The Bill remedies these technical difficulties. </para>
          <para>I now turn to another matter dealt with in this Bill. Honourable members will be aware that quality standards for, and information about, consumer goods is the central concern of the Australian consumer movement. The present Act provides for consumer product safety standards and consumer product information standards to be prescribed by regulations. This has led to substantial delays due to complexities in drafting which have been greatly criticised by the consumer movement. This is an important area and the Government has decided to provide for alternative procedures to enable consumer product standards to be brought into law more simply. The procedure envisaged by the Bill seeks to rely upon the very substantial work done in the field of consumer standards by private organisations in Australia, particularly the Standards Association of Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>in a Press statement I made two days ago I referred to the intention of the Government to amend the Trade Practices Act with respect to manufacturers' warranties.

            <para>That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House deplores the failure of the Government to abolish the seven day waiting period when introducing payment in arrears for unemployment benefit. ' </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I foreshadow that in the Committee stage of the debate the Opposition will be voting against clause 13 which concerns the payment of unem. ployment benefits for school leavers and those leaving tertiary education institutions. In dealing with the Bill I shall quickly refer to the proposed amendments. There is the extension of the eligibility for the handicapped child's allowance to less severe cases where the family income is low and financial hardship would otherwise be suffered. The Opposition supports this but has slight reservations about the manner in which the Government has made the amendment and the method that is being used to increase the benefit, namely, the widening of the discretion of the Director-General of Social Security. The Bill gives no indication of how the handicapped child's allowance will be applied or how the Director-General will decide whether a particular instance causes severe financial hardship to the family. Basically, we support the proposition that those families should be entitled to the allowance. </para>
          <para>We support the extension of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to those who are not at present eligible. Provided they can benefit by the services I feel very strongly that the service should be extended. The only questions I have are: Are the facilities adequate? How many people are receiving rehabilitation treatment at present? How many people does the Government estimate will be entitled to the rehabilitation service when the guidelines are changed? I now turn to one of the more controversial sections of this legislation. I refer to the doublespeak of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> representing the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> when giving the second reading speech he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Removal of a provision which discriminates against married women in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into line with that applying to unemployment benefit </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That sounds very impressive. The Government is removing some discrimination against married women. Anybody who heard the Minister making his second reading speech would have assumed that there will be a benefit for married women. In fact, what the Government is introducing is the removal of the benefit which husbands, who would be entitled to sickness benefit on all grounds, except when their wives were working, receive at present. This benefit will now be removed in the case of husbands. So it is the removal of a benefit and not the granting of a benefit at all. Let me give an example of the sort of doublespeak to which I am referring. If the Government were to grant equal pay to women to fight discrimination and so on it would do that by reducing the male rate of pay. </para>
          <para>The fourth item in the legislation gives effect to the Government's decision to make it impossible for school leavers to receive unemployment benefit until the end of January or early February. Honourable members will recall that last year the Government made that decision believing, I assume, that it was entitled to make that decision. One case, the Karen Green case, was taken to the High Court and the High Court ruled that that decision could not be made in an arbitrary manner although it was possible to make that decision in individual cases if the cases did not satisfy the guidelines. Now the Government is to make this decision apply generally. </para>
          <para>The Government is also introducing retrospective payments for unemployment benefit and argues that this was recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> in his report on the payment of unemployment benefit. What <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> actually recommended in his report was that retrospective payments should be introduced for unemployment benefit provided the waiting period of seven days is abolished. I quote from paragraph 4.1 1.7 where, referring to payment in arrears which I think is the official title, and the abolition of the waiting period, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Indeed, the two measures fit hand in glove, as fortnightlypayment in arrears without the waiting period would cause  hardship  in the period before the first cheque was received. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This would be fairly obvious to most people who have had any experience with the majority of persons who become entitled to unemployment benefit. The changes in the procedure for the </para>
          <para class="block">Eayment of unemployment benefit which have een implemented from the beginning of November will create considerable hardship for those people registering after that date. People will register. They will return a form on about day 15. The Government, on day 21 or thereabouts, will pay a cheque for seven days benefit. Then, on day 34 or thereabouts there will be another cheque. So for the first month all persons entitled to receive unemployment benefit will have received only one cheque. They are being asked to cope for a month or more on only one week's benefit. </para>
          <para>The main reason given for this change from the current system of payment in advance is that the system has led to over-payments. These seem to have been largely as a result of staff shortages. The penalisation of the unemployed seems very harsh. The seven-day waiting period has been retained despite the recommendation of the Myers inquiry that it be abolished. If the Government were to accept the recommendation for the abolition of the waiting period the first cheque would then be for two weeks payment in arrears. This is what the Opposition would urge. The assumption behind the waiting period is that people actually apply for benefit as soon as they are unemployed and will therefore have some carry-on money. There seems to be evidence that people often avoid registering as unemployed because they hope to avoid the stigma of being on unemployment benefit, or on what the </para>
          <para>Government calls the dole. These people therefore delay their application until they are running out of money. </para>
          <para>For these people the new changes will be disastrous. The long wait for the receipt of their first fortnightly benefit will leave them completely penniless. They will not receive their first fortnightly benefit until the second month of unemployment. The current system, with the inevitable problems of bureaucracy, has already placed additional strains on many agencies which are having to assist people waiting for their first cheque. The change in the system can only make the load on these agencies even heavier. I am now speaking about voluntary agencies or some agencies funded or helped by State governments. </para>
          <para>Let me state the Opposition's position on the question of unemployment benefit. Our policy is to pay unemployment benefit for the first week of unemployment. It is imperative now that payment of unemployment benefit is made in arrears after production of an income statement. We accept that proposition, but we say that that should be done only provided the other part of the Myers suggestion is also accepted- the payment for the first week of unemployment. Without benefit being paid during the waiting period beneficiaries are forced to live for a month on one week's income. It has been found by people who have looked at this situation that 67 per cent of the unemployed have less than $50 in savings. We cannot condone the hardship, the chaos and the strain on voluntary agencies without a national program of emergency aid. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has put a question on notice in an attempt to find the cost of paying the first week's unemployment benefits but, as far as I know, when I last looked for it, the answer has not been given. </para>
          <para>I would like now to make a few comments on the Government's announced intention, both by statement by the Minister for Social Security and by a foreshadowed amendment by the Minister for Health to amend this Bill in the Committee stage for the purpose of bringing in a lone father's benefit similar to the supporting mothers' benefit. The Opposition advocates this strongly. We announced some time ago that this was part of the Australian Labor Party's policy for the forthcoming election. We all know that we are sitting here at present and will be sitting here for at least one and possibly two days next week, for purely cosmetic reasons as far as the Government is concerned. </para>
          <para>The many promises that it made have not been carried out and it is trying to bring in some amendments and, as far as it can, it will try to introduce legislation covering the sorts of things the Opposition has promised. The Government has suddenly found that money is available after having said when the Opposition proposed the lone father's benefit that it was impossible to do this sort of thing and that it was irresponsible. The honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> nods his head in agreement. I am glad to see that. He knows that the Government has previously told him that certain things could not be done. As I understand it, the Treasury was asked to cost the lone father's benefit and the percentage range of its costing estimate was one of the widest ever. The Treasury estimated that the cost would be between $9m and $4Sm a year. That leaves a 400 per cent margin of error, which is quite considerable. It is one of the difficult things to cost because we do not know how many lone fathers will take advantage of it. </para>
          <para>Inasmuch as many lone fathers at the present time may be working because they have no alternative, this benefit will make it possible for them to give up work, in some cases at least, and to look after their children. The children will obviously benefit. The family situation, such as it exists m those cases, will obviously benefit. There will be, at least in theory, a clawback because one assumes that the jobs which then will become vacant, because the lone fathers are leaving those jobs, will be taken by other people. The net cost to the Government at a time of very significant or very high unemployment is, of course, less than the actual cost because unemployment is reduced and some people are enabled to receive benefits at the same time. I assume that it was a combination of these factors, the fact that there is an election coming on and the fact that the Government expects unemployment to get much worse next year- I suppose those two go together- which finally convinced the Government overnight to bring in this legislation which had been foreshadowed by the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>I do not want to take up the full time allocated to me, but there is one other point I want to raise. It is related to school leavers. Perhaps it will shorten the debate in the Committee stage if I make what to me is an important point. I heard the honourable member for Petrie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodges),</inline> when this matter was debated before, arguing that parents ought to be able to look after their children; that they ought to take the responsibility for looking after their school leaver children for the six weeks over Christmas and </para>
          <para class="block">January because to look after their children is just one of the obligations that parents accept. This may or may not be so. It is much easier for the honourable member for Petrie to say that or for me to say that than it is for people in much worse economic circumstances. I have received complaints from my electorate, and I am sure that other people received them last year, from persons who were completely unable to look after their school leaver children at that time. They include pensioners and other parents. What I find particularly unpleasant is the fact that the family allowance stops when the child leaves school. In the case of pensioners the dependant benefit stops when school finishes; yet those children do not become eligible for anything else. That is fair enough if the child can find a job, but we all know that it will be very difficult this year, as it was last year- it will be even more difficult this year- for young people to find a job. </para>
          <para>What does the woman who is on a widow's pension do for six weeks to look after her child who is unable to find a job? It is all very well to say that she can apply for special benefit or perhaps that the Director-General of Social Services will accept her as a special case. It will take a long time to obtain that benefit. It takes a long time to get it at ordinary times; but Christmas, with all due respect to the Department of Social Security, is not one of the times when one obtains the fastest response from any government department. There may be the case of a widow, or any other person receiving social security benefits, whose children have been entitled to a benefit of, I think, $7.50. The children have been entitled to a family allowance, depending on their position in the family, of at least $3.50 per week. The allowance can be affected if there are a number of other children. The other children then move into other positions and the family allowance drops. There may be a sudden drop in income of $1 1 to $12 for that family, which is probably a very large proportion of the total income. That child then has the additional costs of trying to find a job- the costs of going to the Commonwealth Employment Service office, going to the office of the Department of Social Security, ringing up, buying newspapers which advertise jobs and that sort of thing. I hope that the Government at least will give instructions to the departmental officers to deal with applicants in a sensitive way and not to treat them in the way that this Government normally treats these people, since it no longer will be facing an election on 10 December. Hopefully, by then, the present Opposition will be in government and hopefully new instructions will be issued by a new Minister for Social Security. </para>
          <para>The other point with which I have some difficulty is the proposition put by the Government that it will not pay unemployment benefit for school leavers until six weeks after the examination is due. I am not quite sure how that will be interpreted. Basically, it means that a school leaver will not be able to leave school before his or her final examination for the year. The same will apply to people with some tertiary training. I think this is a bit rough on a number of people. I know that the Director-General of Social Services is able to give this benefit for good and sufficient reasons, but I am not quite sure what these good and sufficient reasons would be. One of the other changes I would urge, with regard to this general question of unemployment and sickness benefits, is that they be bought into line with other payments as far as permissible income is concerned. The important point there, as those honourable members who try to claim such benefits for their constituents would be aware, is that, for example, in the case of a single pensioner the permissible income is $20 a week. In the case of a single person applying for unemployment or sickness benefit it is $3 a week. If that person earns more than $3 a week, or $6 a week in the case of a couple, there is a loss on a dollar for dollar basis. This means that only a very small income can be earned. People receiving unemployment or sickness benefit can get into strife very quickly. </para>
          <para>Finally, I am not one of those who argue that women who become unemployed should be entitled to unemployment benefit when their husbands are employed. I know that this issue has been raised by a number of women, but I feel that it would be too difficult to police and too expensive. I cite the case of a family where both the husband and wife have been working and it would be a very low income family if only one person was working. With both the husband and wife earning something of the order of $150 a week, the total family income would be approximately $300 a week, and probably around $260 a week after taxation. This would be a quite reasonable income for that family. If the wife suddenly loses her job, that income falls to $ 1 40-odd a week. That is a hell of a blow for that family and I am sure that none of us could survive for any length of time on that sort of income without drawing on our capital resources. This is one of the questions that have to be raised. I realise that in some ways it contradicts some of my other arguments about school leavers, but I invite honourable members to compare the income of that family with the relatively high incomes of people such as ourselves who possibly have working wives. When one of the children reaches the age of 16 or 18 years and leaves school, and after a period of six weeks has not found a job, that family, provided the child is under 18 years, will receive $36 a week, and if the child is over 1 8 years the family will receive, I think, $49.30 a week even though there is a parental income of $500, $600 or $700 a week. Is this a fair way of doing it as far as means testing goes? When the boy or girl is still at home and is looking for a job the question of means testing is a very difficult one. We talk about the family unit in the sense of two spouses with a total income inasmuch as one or the other is entitled to a benefit, but the children are not taken into account. </para>
          <para>I am not going to advocate a means test based on parental income which takes into account unemployment and sickness benefits for children. I want to emphasise that. Otherwise I will be quoted during the election campaign as saying that I was advocating that. I do not advocate it. But surely people here can see that possibily there is something wrong with our approach in the situation which I was talking about before, where a couple whose incomes drops suddenly from $260 or $280 a week to $140 is entitled to nothing, but the other family with no drop in income at all and with a boy or girl still at home, as he or she has been for the previous 18 years, will get from the state $49.30 a week I think it is, in unemployment benefits. I hope that whichever government is in power after 10 December will look at this for the purpose of possibly increasing the level of the means test for the unemployment benefit so that if a husband and wife really earn only a basic minimum income they still receive some subsidy when one or the other becomes unemployed. I commend to the House the amendment that I have moved. I emphasise again that we will be dividing on clause 13 of the Bill in the Committee stage. </para>

            <para>- I personally, and I believe this Government, have a vision of an Australia where social justice shall prevail and the needs of all underprivileged members of our community will sympathetically and effectively be cared for. I thirst for an era where poverty is eliminated, hardship and suffering are alleviated and all Australians shall not want for any of the basic fundamentals of human existence. Whilst I do not agree with all that the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> has said, I commend him for the obvious sincerity of his speech. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that it can be fairly said that the present Federal Liberal-National Country Party Government has done more to bring social justice to the Australian community than any preceding government. Whilst I do not want to go through an exercise of comparing the behaviour of one government with that of another, I simply want to say that for the first time in the history of this country the pensioners of Australia now are able to live in a climate in which politics has been taken out of the area of pensions. It was this Government which legislated for automatic indexation of pensions. I believe that legislation did a service to the pensioners because it meant that it was not a matter for government to decide how much it would throw to the pensioners each Budget time. Our Government legislated for indexation and the pensioners have received increases in accordance with the movements in the consumer price index. On 10 November next the pension will again be increased as a direct result of the legislation we introduced. The single standard rate pension will rise by $2.20 to $49.30 a week and the combined married rate will rise by $3.70 to $82.20. 1 must in all fairness say that it was the previous Government which introduced the 6-monthly indexation of pensions, and our Government has fallen into that pattern of indexing pensions automatically at 6- monthly intervals. I still believe-I say this as no criticism of the Government- that where there is quarterly indexation of wages there should be quarterly indexation of pensions. I hope that at some time it will be possible for this to be effected. </para>
          <para>One of the most interesting points is that as we continue to reduce inflation the need for indexation at more frequent intervals diminishes because in this situation where inflation actually is dropping the question of indexation on a 3- monthly or 6-monthly basis does tend to lose its relevance. Nevertheless, I contend that prima facie there should be no distinction between wages on the one hand and pensions on the other. While I am on that point I compliment the Government for resisting moves which were apparently put to it to do something in relation to Commonwealth superannuation. I know this is not strictly within the terms of this Bill but it was a move to change the indexation of Commonwealth superannuation pension payments from the consumer price index to average weekly earnings. I am delighted that the Government determined that it would not create a system of indexation in respect of one area of pensions and a different system of indexation in respect of another area of pensions. </para>
          <para>When this Government came to power the pensions payable were $38.75 at the single standard rate and $64.50 at the married rate. We have increased those rates to $49.30 for the single rate and $82.20 for the married rate. I believe that is an achievement of which we can be proud. More than that, we have taken a step to remove from the backs of the Australian pensioners the hardship of the taxation which was imposed on them by the previous Government because it was the previous Government, the Whitlam Government, which will go down in history as the first government in this country to tax pensions. </para>

              <para>- In 1974 your Government introduced taxation scales which were a bitter rip-off of the pensioners of Australia. I am proud to say that m this Budget of 1977 we have introduced tax reforms which will lift the yoke of taxation from 225,000 pensioners in this country. Also in our period in office we have abolished the property means test, as a direct result of which 155,000 pensioners in this country have received an increase in their pensions and many thousands of others who were previously ineligible are now in fact eligible for pensions. I do not know whether the honourable member for Prospect appreciates that as at 30 June this year this Commonwealth Government was paying benefits in age pensions, invalid pensions, wives' pensions, sheltered employment allowances, widows' pensions and supporting mothers' benefits to 1,673,000 people. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of the unemployment benefit alone is $61 8m, that amount being the total of benefits paid to 250,000 people. That is an increase on the previous year in which the cost of the benefit for 1 88,000 people was $5 14m. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I hope that the honourable member for Prospect will be interested in some of these statistics I am about to give. Because of the time available we have limited debate on this matter and my remarks will not be continuing at any great length. I point out- the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> has pointed this out in the Parliament- that Australia has an aging population. The increase of pensioners as a percentage of the work force is quite dramatic. In 1968 pensioners as a percentage of the work force totalled approximately 17 per cent. Today the figure is 27 per cent. Pensioners as a percentage of the working age in 1968 was 12 per cent. Today it is 20 per cent. So the pension bill- I do not regret this but this is a fact of life that we will have to live with- will continue to rise because Australia has an aging population. At the present moment 78 per cent of our aged population in Australia, that is all male persons over 65 years and female persons over 60 years, receive a pension. I do not begrudge that situation; I am simply indicating that the number of persons over the age of 65 who are working has decreased. In 1968 the percentage receiving a pension was not 78 percent, the figure I have just quoted, but only 53 per cent. Therefore our commitment to those people will continue. </para>
          <para>I draw attention to the fact that last year we had an increase of 10.4 per cent in the number of invalid pensions but the increase in the cost to revenue was 25.5 per cent. In the field of age pensions the increase was 4 per cent in the number of pensioners and 16.6 per cent in the cost to revenue. I could go on at some length. The number of people receiving sheltered unemployment allowances went up by 1 1 per cent and the cost by 41 per cent. The number of class A widows pensions went up 7.1 per cent and the number of class B widows pensions 8.4 per cent while the expenditure rose 13.8 per cent. </para>
          <para>The only other category to which I want to refer relates to a matter for which the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> has earned the praise and gratitude of this Parliament and the nation. I refer to the campaign that he has successfully led for the introduction of supporting benefits for lone fathers. He did a magnificent job and the people of Australia recognise it. I do not overlook work done by any other honourable members in earlier years. I simply say that the credit for this victory properly rests on the shoulders of the honourable member for Franklin, an indefatigible fighter on behalf of the underprivileged of this nation.  His  efforts have been rewarded. The increase in unmarried mothers pensions was 9. 1 per cent last year. The increase in deserted wives pensions was 8.4 per cent. The increase in separated-de facto wives pensions was 14.2 per cent. The increase in the other categories, which included additional benefits for children, mothers allowances and supplementary assistance, was 25.7 per cent. I draw the attention of the House to these figures to indicate the enormity of the burden of the cost of social welfare to the community. We would all like to see pensions increased and we would all like to see benefits extended but when do we reach a situation when we have to say to the Australian taxpayer: 'We will tax you higher to meet these benefits'? </para>
          <para>I notice that my time is fast running out, so I come to my concluding remarks. I refer to the Karen Green case. I say very quickly that I, Karen Green and her family deplore the political purpose to which her case has been put. Her mother has telephoned me complaining that this girl is repeatedly being thrown up in the newspapers and repeatedly being used for political purposes when in fact she has been at work since March of this year. I want to say something about the right to work campaigners who latched onto the Karen Green case and used it for purely political purposes. I wish some of these people would get onto the schemes that we have going, such as the Community Youth Support scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training scheme, the Commonwealth Rebate Apprenticeship Full-Time scheme and all those other things, instead of using unemployment and one particular girl for political purposes. </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying that as far as the honourable member for Franklin and I are concerned our consciences are clear on the question of unemployment in our areas. We have worked to alleviate unemployment. The figures show that the unemployment rate in Hobart is lower than in any other part of the State. We deplore people using the Karen Green case. We deplore the fact that she has been used for political purposes. This girl has been used malevolently. I would have hoped that members of the Labor Party would have adopted the sincere approach of the honourable member for Prospect rather than follow some of the publicity hunters who picked on a Tasmanian girl and decided to make her a national political pawn. I support the Bill and congratulate the Government. I congratulate the good  Samaritan  Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> who is one of the unsung heroes of this Parliament. She is repeatedly bashed and too infrequently praised. I hope we do not see a return to the wicked Hayden days when the pensioners of Australia were taxed and used as a political football. </para>

              <para>- There have been changes in quality in one way or another and changes in description. Family allowances, of course, are the direct descendants of such matters as child endowment and all the rest of it. There again are the distinctions without a difference upon which the honourable member thrives. He mentioned that more people are now on pensions and that a bigger proportion of people over 65 are now on pensions. He overlooked the rather important factor that the abolition of the means test for people over 70 years brought in a large number of extra pensioners. He used the term 'the enormity of the burden' and I will deal with that in a moment. He expressed the views of all of us, I would expect, when he said that he wants to see an Australia in which no human being will want for the substance of human existence. I think that is the objective of all of us. But we have watched him support consistently a government whose whole program has been to deprive the people at the lower end of the scale to the advantage of the people at the top end of the scale. I have not time this afternoon to debate that matter but the shift in the wealth of this nation back from the work force and the household to the business corporations has been quite dramatic in the last couple of years. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is another fact that I think we should not ignore. The honourable member said that the percentage of the pension in relation to average weekly earnings was now higher than it was when, the Government came into office a couple of years ago. The fact is that the Government has adopted the policy- and it has had it enforced through the various tribunals which decide these matters- that the rise in the consumer price index will not be fully applied to people's wages. So, there has been a fall in the relationship between the CPI and average weekly earnings whereas pensions have been indexed in full. Some of those arguments are not all that real either. An increase of 2 per cent on $200 a week is only the same in money terms as an increase of 2.6 per cent on $150 a week. I suppose that the lone fathers benefit is one of these things that is long overdue, but again it is a development of the system established in the past. </para>

              <para>-We did very well in three years. I do not have the time this afternoon to explain it all. I will write to the honourable member from here after the election. We support the handicapped childrens benefit. We support the extension of the rehabilitation scheme. I think the approach to the young people's unemployment benefit is totally immoral, callous and insensitive. I believe that the approach to married women and sickness benefits, which is put in the Bill as a demonstration of non-discriminatory tactics on the pan of this Government, is a specious exercise. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I want to deal with the general principles of what we are talking about. Social security at this stage in Australia ought not to be just something to do with the deserving poor. It is a right, not a charity. It has taken a long while for the community to become accustomed to it. We are accustomed to it in most areas related to pension benefits. We are accustomed to it in a good number of areas related to invalid benefits and things of that nature. But we are still not accustomed to accepting it in relation to people who are unemployed. I regard the use of the term 'dole' as offensive. I regard the use of the term 'dole bludger' as even more offensive. So I hope that members of this Parliament at least will stop using it. </para>
          <para>People who do not know any better cannot be blamed. I refer to those people who write for the Press and others but I think it is time we started to adopt an attitude' which has been expressed for a long while in legislation passed by this place, namely, that there are people in the community who are entitled to a certain degree of support from the community. When such support is given, the terms upon which they receive it have to be couched in such a way that they retain their human dignity. </para>
          <para>So our aim in this place should be to establish a reasonable standard of living for all Australians: We should, I suppose, examine the arithmetic of it for this year. I was calculating the figures only a moment ago, based on my own recent observations of statistics so I ask honourable members not to hold me to the arithmetic. What is the situation? I return to the statement of our friend, the honourable member for Denison, who referred to the enormity of the burden. There are some 14 million of us on this continent. About six and a half million are doing work of various kinds, and I suppose that includes us, all the people in the normal work force, all the people who are self-employed, and all the rest of us. That leaves perhaps six and a half million or seven million other people who have to live upon the production, services and goods supplied by those people. </para>
          <para>I suppose two and a half million of the 14 million population are at school; half a million are at pre-school, I guess. I expect that two million people are living at home in various circumstancesin retirement or in circumstances of that nature. Perhaps one million married women are not active in the work force and half a million people are unemployed. </para>
          <para>We have one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and we have at our disposal an enormous capacity to produce. We have accepted the principle that a great number of people ought to receive benefits without any means test being applied. We are accustomed to that situation. I suppose at this stage we should be looking at such techniques as a guaranteed minimum income, hardship supplements or benefits of that nature. But we still have a little way to go before we can drag such a scheme out of the great tangle of benefits which we provide at the present time. </para>
          <para>Whenever we are talking about these things we should remember that a very large proportion of the Australian work force goes into retirement on community-supported meanstestfree income. We are a part of that group. I suppose that we pay more towards our pension or our superannuation, call it what you will, in proportion to our income than almost anybody else in the work force. I pay $2,500 per annum. I have been in the Parliament for 20 years. I do not know what my average contribution would be over those years but it is probably of the order of $2,000 per annum. On that basis I would have paid so far $40,000. But, of course, I was paying only £500 or £600-say $l,000-during the first years after I entered Parliament so I probably would have paid in total about $30,000. If the electors of the division of Wills exercise justice and retire me instead of exercising mercy, I will go out on a pension equivalent to three-quarters of our salary; that is, about $18,000. After 2V4 years I would be getting to the position where I had got back what I had paid in. We all accept that. </para>
          <para>I was in the Victorian teaching service for 20 years. During that time I was paying into a pension scheme which would have provided me with substantial benefits upon retirement. Under that scheme it might have taken longer for me to get back the money I had paid in. I do not know what the figures would be, but there must be more than half a million people in Australia contributing to superannuation schemes of various government instrumentalities. There must be 100,000 people in the defence services and its subsidiaries. So we are talking about something like three-quarters of a million people at least who will receive a substantial means-test-free government-supported income. We should be applying ourselves continuously to the idea that the community should be able to provide that sort of benefit for the remainder of the work force, no matter how much it costs. I know that those people who put forward arguments about the means test are bedevilled by the sheer arithmetic of the situation. I do not claim to know the answer. All I ask is that on occasions such as this we do take time off to examine it. </para>
          <para>I want to spend a moment or two dealing with the unemployment benefit. I am one of those people who from 1932 to 1935 was unemployed. I know what it is all about. I left school and did not get a job and there was no unemployment benefit. I think that the system which is being adopted here this afternoon is most callous, insensitive and mean. I hope that those spirited defenders of the freedom of the individual and of humanity, such as my friends from Tasmania, will support us in this regard. A young person leaving school today is going into a very tense personal family situation. To add this to it is to compound the misery we have imposed upon them collectively by not being able to solve the economic problems of the country. It is not an economic question; it is one of humanity. </para>

            <para>- It is my intention to move for the insertion of a new clause relating to the means test. As the Committee will know, the present Government in its policy speech committed itself to the abolition of the means test. Indeed, I believe my friends in the Opposition have also been persuaded to adopt the same policy. It has been a little disappointing to the country that the Government has so far made no move towards implementing the policy which it has adopted. I believe it is fair to say in regard to the abolition of the means test that for many years I have been the prime mover, that is, apart from a former member, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Wilson, who for the past 25 years and more has also been advocating this. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When I was a Minister I was able to persuade the Government of the day-that was the McMahon Government- to commit itself to the abolition of the means test. That has been the policy of the Government parties ever since. I believe that it is time now for that policy to be implemented. Something should be done about it. It is of no use the Government saying: 'We do not have the finance to do it'. The amount of money is substantial, but it is not astronomical. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> earlier this afternoon quoted percentages of those who drew pensions. I think he gave a figure of 78 per cent. He was wrong, of course, because he did not allow for war pensions and other pensions of this character which considerably inflate that figure. Let us look properly at the figures and remember that pensions are taxable. In practically all cases those who would draw pensions if the means test were abolished but who do not draw them now would be paying tax at the rate of at least 33c in the dollar. Some would be paying more. The actual cost to the revenue is by no means as great as certain people have endeavoured to put about. I will not go into the merits of this reform now, as time is short. I move: </para>

              <para>-The money is there. I make no apology for saying that. The money is there already. There is a surplus in the revenue Budget. The trouble is that people are being taxed to pay for capital works. That is the reason for high rates of taxation in the community- this is one of the fundamental errors of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)-</inline> and for the delay in the implementation of reforms such as the abolition of the means test, which is one of the Government's planks for which a commitment was given in the last policy speech. I would have liked to have spoken to the amendment for half an hour. In view of the fact that honourable members want to get away, I will not go into the principles which I have explained over many years and on which I have been successful in carrying the Government parties with me. When I was Minister for Social Services I was able to force this policy on to the Government parties. That is no exaggeration. They have adopted it. They are committed to it specifically by the words of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his policy speech prior to the last election. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

          <para class="block">The amendment seeks to add to the Bill provisions whereby the benefits currently available to supporting mothers are extended to supporting fathers. This is to be achieved by inserting a definition of supporting father. Because the new benefit will encompass both supporting mothers and supporting fathers, it will be renamed 'supporting parent 's benefit. ' The new benefit will be payable to all fathers bringing up children on their own and will come into effect on the date the Bill received the royal assent. Fathers who have already been supporting their children for six months or more will become eligible immediately the Bill becomes law. </para>
          <para>The rates of the new benefit and the income test will be the same as for the existing supporting mother's benefit. A supporting father will be eligible for benefit of $49.30 a week plus $7.50 a week for each child, including a student child. In addition, a guardian's allowance of $6 a week will be payable where he has the care of a child under six years of age, or an invalid child- $4 a week if the child is over six years but not an invalid. Thus a supporting father with two children, one of whom is under six years of age may receive, subject to the income test, a total benefit of $70.30 a week. In addition, he will be able to have a separate income of $32 a week without any effect on his benefit. Where rent is paid, supplementary assistance of up to $5 a week may also be payable. Eligible supporting fathers will also be entitled to the range of Commonwealth fringe benefits that are available to supporting mothers under existing conditions. These concessions are a reduced rental on their telephone, free hearing aid and funeral benefit. </para>
          <para>The Government will be discussing the new benefit with the States to gain their acceptance of the inclusion of supporting fathers on the same terms as supporting mothers. Two States- Western Australia and South Australia- already provide assistance to this group. In the meantime, in those States in which State government assistance is not provided in the first six months, a supporting father will be eligible to claim special benefit which is paid at unemployment benefit rates and subject to the unemployment benefit income test. Due to the lack of data on supporting fathers- their number, the size of their families, their income distribution- and a lack of knowledge as to the number likely to seek assistance and the period for which they would seek it, it is not possible to estimate the exact cost of paying supporting fathers the same benefits as are available to supporting mothers. It is estimated, however, that the cost of a supporting father's benefit would be of the order of $ 10m in a full year,and$6.5min 1977-78. </para>

              <para>- Yes, without success. When the McMahon Government was defeated this matter was at the top of the list of priorities. In respect of each Budget since then I have protested at it not being included. I protested when I was in Opposition. I regret to say that at that time I did not get a great deal of support from my party in that regard. I protested when we were returned to office. I have previously described this matter as the greatest gap in our social services structure. I congratulate the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> who has been able to force this matter through. I think this is a great triumph. I know that the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> and other honourable members have been tremendously interested in it. As the person who, I think, was primarily responsible for putting this matter forward, I have the greatest pleasure now in supporting it. It gives me the greatest pleasure to note that the Government has seen fit to do this. My only regret is that it has taken so long to get a necessary, right and proper thing done. </para>

              <para>-Let me give some of the history correctly. The honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> of course is correct. During his career as Minister for Social Services he carried out some advances, and during his period as a Government back bencher he also did the things which he mentioned today. The fact is that the real breakthrough was when the Labor Government put the supporting mother's benefit in the book. We should congratulate those people who initiated the idea. The honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> who was Minister for Social Security at the time, persuaded all the people involved that it ought to be done. There are so many difficulties of definition and technicalities that people dredge up at times like this. To arrive at the stage when this Parliament is prepared to accept the fact that people may be entitled to benefits of this nature, whether or not they live together and whether or not they have been legally married, is a great social advance. It has taken a long time. </para>

          <para>From my own observations, one of the most disadvantaged groups in the community are the fathers, the men who have lost their wives, the supporter or other parent of their children. No matter what <inline font-style="italic">level of income</inline> they have or what status of employment they enjoy, it is tremendous hardship and a great blow. I hope we can take all these things a few steps further and make sure that we remove all such disabilities. I just say out of kindness to everybody here that all those people like the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> and all the other people who have taken part can exercise only a small amount of influence on the way the country is run. To those who will be leaving us as soon as the election is declared, I say that even if they feel that their contribution to the Parliament has all been very minimal, it has been for the nation, and that is a much bigger contribution than painting the back fence of the kindergarten on Saturday afternoon in a working bee. </para>

            <para>-The National Country Party supports this innovation of the Liberal-National Country Party Government. We are delighted to be associated with it. I believe it is appropriate in a debate such as this to give real credit where it is due. Over a lifetime the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> has fought to ensure that an injustice would be corrected. In the twilight of his days in the House of Representatives he has had the opportunity to compliment the Government on implementing this notable reform in the area of social justice. I believe it is necessary to have recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the names of other people who have shown a vital and continued interest in the matter. Notwithstanding the statements of the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> we must remember that in October 1974 the present Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> moved an amendment to an Australian Labor Party Bill seeking to ensure that what is now being done would be done. That was three years ago. On that occasion we did not have the support of the Labor Party. Those are the facts, and no clouding of the issue can ever distort that truth. Let us be fair and honest. </para>

              <para>- My colleagues the honourable member for Mallee mentions the wonderful contribution of the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd).</inline> I recall- I am subject to correctionthat on at least three occasions in this Parliament, in his usual forthright and forceful style, he advocated non-discrimination against lone fathers. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> a man of compassion and concern for the underprivileged, is on record on many occasions advancing the proposition that, in justice, lone fathers should have the same entitlement as lone mothers. More recently several other people also have been advancing the proposition. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I believe it is appropriate to recall that over many years the people who I enumerated were pressing very strongly for this amendment which has now been moved by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> It is good to see that in this modern day and age the Government, a government which will move with the times, is prepared to change its emphasis in the light of social and demographic change. There are changes in the concept of the family. Greater responsibilities accrue because we now have working mothers. The family is under greater threat because of easier divorce laws. Too often the father is the person who is offended against.  His  situation is particularly difficult. Unless benefits such as lone father's benefit are extended, it will be necessary for a lone father to work full time. What does he do with his children while they are waiting for him to come home from work? Unfortunately employers by and large have not extended to lone fathers the same consideration as they have been prepared to extend to lone mothers in the arrangement of shifts and working hours. </para>
          <para>The Finer Committee in the United Kingdom did a great deal of analysis on the matter. It was found that a third of the lone fathers in the United Kingdom were leaving their children to their own devices at weekends and after school, leaving them to wait for their fathers to return home. It is absolutely necessary that the father be able to arrange his affairs so that he is a full time guardian and custodian of the family. Too often, because of the many and pressing calls on his time, both as the bread winner and as the person responsible for the upkeep of the home, he has been placed at very serious disadvantage. It is not possible for him to find the time to do the necessary repair jobs. It is not possible for him, as it is for the ordinary housewife, to look for the bargains and purchase the cheaper foods. Probably because he lacks culinary skills and it is impossible for him to cook good nourishing meals, he has to resort to easily prepared fast foods. </para>
          <para>A lone father also has emotional problems with which to deal, particularly if he has teenage children. The problem is accentuated if the teenage child happens to be a daughter. It is not so easy for the lone father to mix in society. In effect, he tends to become socially isolated. That is a problem he can overcome if he has time on his hands to do the things he wants to do and he does not have to worry about being a full time employee. There has been a world-wide acceptance of the need for social benefits for lone fathers. Although I do not agree that South Australia is the most advanced State in Australia, it is good to note that on 1 July this year the South Australian Government extended to lone fathers of that State a lone father's benefit. Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand and the United Kingdom also make special benefits available to fathers who unfortunately are placed in this position. </para>
          <para>The amount of money involved will be quite large. A recent analysis indicated that there were at least 25,000 lone fathers in Australia who will be able to obtain this benefit. We of the National Country Party are delighted that the Government has seen fit to spread the umbrella of social justice to include people who have been discriminated against. It is unfortunate that the traditional standards of society have broken down and that so many fathers are placed in this situation. But it is not for us to criticise; we have to accept the position as it is and do what is possible to uphold the dignity of the people who are so afflicted. We are going to iron out the anomalies and give help where it is needed. Lone fathers can take some comfort from the fact that people have been pressing this need for them over a life-time. The voice of the honourable member for Mackellar was the lone voice crying out in the wilderness for many years. He was supported by the Prime Minister, the present Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Murray and now by other newcomers in the Parliament, particularly the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck).</inline> What was an idea in the mind of one person originally has been taken, hammered and chiselled into shape so that in the final analysis justice will be done a most deserving sector of the community. </para>

I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> for. bringing in this very important legislation which will assist many lone fathers in Australia and in particular their children, which is the most important thing. I shall outline very briefly a few of the reasons why lone fathers were due for this support. Whilst we live and breathe politics every day and whilst sometimes one party may beat the other party to the punch, we cannot get away from the fact that the legislation will be passed and lone fathers will get their benefit. That is the important thing. I am a little disappointed with the remarks of one leader of the lone father; I think he is the  president  of the New South Western Lone Fathers Association. He said that he is only 50 per cent happy - </para>

              <para>-I do not think he is ungrateful: I think that he just does not understand that political implications come into these sorts of decisions. The decision has now been made and the people in need will benefit. Also their children will benefit and that is the important thing. We could pick out members who have assisted so earnestly in the framing of this legislation, but why should we? I think everybody in this chamber has supported it. Now we have it before us: That is the main thing. All politicians should drive in the direction that will help the Australian public as a whole. I think everybody would agree that that too, is important. </para>

          <para>I should like to read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> part of an article which I wrote about nine months ago and which outlines my feelings and sentiments as to why lone fathers should get a benefit comparable with that of lone mothers. If we believe, as I do, that the family has the main responsibility for socialising the next generation, is an important agent for social control, and provides a unique opportunity for the satisfaction of emotional needs, it should be understood that an incomplete family is likely to find it more difficult to carry out these functions. Therefore, society is bound to be concerned, and concerned it should be. When a wife and mother is deserted or widowed and left without maintenance, the community, through welfare benefits, makes provision to take over the breadwinner's role. This leaves the mother free to pursue her accepted role of homemaker if she chooses, though often under great difficulty and strain. When a father is left alone, the struggle to maintain a full time job while still providing for child minding during the time he is away outside school hours is extemely difficult. When a woman remarries she is still able to stay at home with her children. Concerned fathers have told me that they must think very carefully before remarrying and consider the compatibility of the children with their prospective new mother, as she will be the one with whom they will spend most of their time. It can thus be argued that if the community is prepared to take the responsibility of breadwinner for a single mother then it should also take the responsibility for the provision of a substitute mother when a father is prepared, at all costs, to keep his family together. The necessity for a lone parent on both roles may arise suddenly. The widowed must learn to cope with their grief; the divorced and unmarried with any doubts. Above all they must face the task of convincing themselves and their children that they can manage alone. </para>
          <para>Invariably, tasks and responsibilities are given to children which are far too much for them. I can relate my own situation. Unfortunately two of my sisters grew up before their time because they were left with the burden of looking after their younger brother and sister. The point I make is that we have succeeded in a mammoth task of introducing legislation which is going to help not this generation, but other generations. As I mentioned before, we all believe in the family unit. I believe that as a result of this measure the family unit will be kept together, though perhaps not altogether satisfactorily and that this legislation is a move in the right direction. </para>

After the announcement about the election, we get the tearjerker that the honourable member for Franklin is responsible for getting this benefit for the lone fathers. He may get a few votes from the lone fathers of Franklin, but let me tell him that there are a lot of people unemployed through lack of work because of the things he and his Government have done. Those in his own electorate will vote against him. He will lose his seat. </para>

            <para>-I should like to state formally the Opposition's objection to clause 13. Hopefully the people of this country, particularly those who have children leaving school this year, will remember when they are voting on 10 December that because of the niggardly behaviour of this Government their children will not be able to receive unemployment benefit for six weeks after their examinations are completed. We have the ridiculous provision in this legislation that tertiary students will not be able to obtain unemployment benefit for six weeks after their examinations if they do not complete their courses, unless the Director-General is satisfied that the cessation of their studies was not due to a voluntary act and that there was good and sufficient reason for it. We will have more people continuously asking questions, people who are already in strife because they cannot get jobs. Hundreds of thousands of people leaving school or tertiary institutions of some kind will now be deprived of six weeks unemployment benefit. In some cases it will be much more than six weeks unemployment benefit, because even if they leave earlier the Government can rule that they left without a good and sufficient reason, that they left by a voluntary act, the voluntary act being trying to find employment Under this Government, of course, trying to get a job is not a good and sufficient reason. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These people will not be able to receive the unemployment benefit until some time in February, no matter what time they leave after about August. I think this is a very unpleasant way of saving money and of pretending that the number of unemployed in this country is much less than it really is. The Opposition therefore opposes clause 13. </para>

            <para>- I would like to make some reply to the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> on my own behalf because I believe that he is missing a point, that is that when school leavers leave school they have been accustomed to receiving pocket money of some sort. Under the old arrangement they went straight on to unemployment benefit. In some instances parents have complained that this was not good so far as the attitude of the children was concerned. In the parents' view, they were entitled to a social service unemployment benefit which tended to kill their desire or initiative to take a job. So I do not think there will be the objection that the honourable member for Prospect says there will be, because I have found that many parents were concerned that their children became eligible for unemployment benefit when they felt that the children should not be tempted in this way. I think that the honourable member will find that on 10 December the people will not be as sensitive to this issue or will not be as inclined to believe that the Australian Labor Party is the salvation that he believes it is. </para>

            <para>-The Minister might as well argue that lone fathers should not be entitled <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> benefit because it will take away their incentive for finding a spouse. This is ridiculous. The whole point of benefits is that if one qualifies for something specific one is entitled to receive it. This is a major discrimination against those families in the country who find it difficult to keep their children when they leave school and cannot find a job. </para>

            <para>- I wish to raise a matter which is of specific importance and which affects a relatively small number of people. It really relates to the need for a provision in the Social Services Act for discretion in regard to the sections of the Act which relate to the payment of pensions outside Australia. I think all honourable members would agree that the specific case which I will put before the Committee indicates the need for the provision which I am suggesting. Some time ago I had cause to take up with the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> the case of a widow whose husband, prior to his death, had been an invalid pensioner, this entitling her to payment of the equivalent of the pension on the basis that she was the wife of a pensioner, but not as of right. When the husband of the woman concerned died her entitlement ceased, although she was not aware of this fact. The family decided that the husband should be interred in Italy and his wife accompanied the body to Italy without filling in an application for widow s pension prior to leaving Australia. The husband- had been dead for about four days when she left </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australia. She was under the impression, as was her family, that she was in fact in receipt of a pension. They did not understand the niceties of the payment of a wife's allowance to the wife of a pensioner. </para>
          <para>When her family inquired why she was not receiving the pension they were informed that she was not eligible because she had left Australia before establishing eligibility by making the necessary application for a widow's pension. This is a matter of definition. I think it is just an oversight in the Act, although it may have been a deliberate oversight at the time. This is an area where, quite clearly, the Minister should have discretion to take action in order to allow the woman's application to be received as if it had been made prior to her departure from Australia. This is a matter where hardship was caused. In order to obtain eligibility for a continuation of the payment she was already receiving- it is largely only a technicality of applying for a widow's pension and receiving the same- she has to return to Australia or else be without that pension. I raise the matter because, although the Act will not be altered at this time, it ought to be altered at a subsequent time to give discretion to the Minister in cases where a quite clear hardship is created because of circumstances which do not arise very often but which should be able to be corrected when they do arise. </para>

            <para>- by leave- At present, foreign company groups usually conduct their operations in Australia through a subsidiary company which is incorporated here and is thus resident in Australia for income tax purposes. These investors pay company tax of 46 per cent on their Australian taxable income, plus dividend withholding tax on dividends remitted to their home country. The basic rate of withholding tax is 30 per cent, and this is reduced to 15 per cent where the shareholder is resident in a country with which Australia has a comprehensive double tax agreement. Some foreign company groups conduct Australian operations through a branch of a company that is incorporated overseas, and, for tax purposes, resident in another country. The Australian taxable income of these branches is liable to company tax of 46 per cent, but remittances of branch profits to head office and dividends paid to foreign shareholders do not attract Australian tax additional to the primary company tax of 46 per cent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government will correct the lack of balance by introducing a branch profits tax based on the Australian taxable income of foreign resident companies. The tax applicable to branch profits, which will be a broad substitute for the dividend withholding tax applicable to dividend remittances by subsidiaries, will be designed to ensure that the benefit Australia obtains from foreign investment by way of tax revenue is not reduced because of the form in which operations are conducted here. Other countries have branch profits taxes and the Asprey Committee recommended that one should be introduced in Australia. Consideration of imposing a branch profits tax began some time ago. </para>
          <para>The tax that the Government has in mind will be related to taxable income of non-resident companies, as distinct from a tax based on remittances of branch profits. As branches, unlike subsidiaries, are taxed on dividend income, it is not intended to apply the branch profits tax to the part of taxable income referable to such income; nor is it envisaged that it will apply to other income of non-residents taxed under special provisions of the income tax law, namely, film royalties, shipping profits, or insurance premiums. The tax, when introduced under Legislation to be brought forward in the autumn, will apply to income of the 1977-78 income year and subsequent years and, like company tax, will be due for payment in the year following the year in which the income is derived. I present the following paper. </para>

            <para>A contract worth about $3.4m for these craft has been awarded to North Queensland Engineers and Agents for the supply of 22 work boats; the $4.7m quoted represents the total project cost of introducing these boats into service. </para>
            <para>In April 1976 Australian and New Zealand firms in tendering for the supply of work boats were invited to register interest covering three options, namely: to a naval design package commercial design unaltered slightly modified commercial design and incorporating Navy supplied engines. </para>
            <para>Tenders were clearly advised that proposals submitted on the basis of a commercial design would be evaluated against proposals received for the supply of craft to the Naval design in aluminium. </para>
            <para>Tenderers were also advised that direct price comparison, economy of operation and other cost effective factors would all be considered in making a selection. </para>
            <para>Following an exhaustive evaluation of all tenders received covering all options it was decided that the offer by North Queensland Engineers and Agents would provide the Navy and Army with craft which met all requirements and particularly would be the most suitable for operating in the arduous service environment. </para>
            <para>The approach adopted sought the widest possible response from tenderers and did exclude consideration of any design or construction material. </para>
            <para>Navy's past experience with small GRP (fibreglass) boats indicated that it is not the most suitable material for the arduous duties planned for the twelve metre craft. However, by not excluding GRP from the tender schedule the possibility of Navy benefiting from technological development in the field was retained. </para>
            <para>None of the GRP designs offered had qualities which met the Navy requirements for hull construction. </para>

The following statement indicates action that has since been taken in respect of the items that were listed by the Board in its earlier statement </para>
            <para>Research Bureau (R. 29)- Guidelines against which organisation proposals relating to research activities can be considered are being drafted by the Board. </para>
            <para>Meetings of Statutory Bodies (R. 31)-In its statement of 13 December 1976 the Board indicated that it would convene such meetings from time to time as the need arose. </para>
            <para>Classification and Control of Ministerial Staff (R. 56 &amp; 57)- These are to be considered by Government in the context of recommendations 219 and 220 relating to the procedures for appointment and employment arrangements to apply to ministerial staff. </para>
            <para>Guidelines for Community Contacts (R. 93)- The need for guidelines is being considered by the Board in the light of comments by Ministers on related recommendations 91 and 92 dealing with contacts between community groups and departments. - Departmental Information Services (R. 304)- Consideration of this recommendation has been finalised and the Board indicated in its statement of 13 December 1976 that organisational arrangements would continue to be examined in relation to the particular needs of individual departments. </para>
            <para>Delegation of Authority within Departments (R. 96(a) )- Project assistance in this area will be provided by the Board to departments.

            <para>In line with the Government's policy of encouraging the establishment of Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) on an experimental basis, a working party on HMOs was formed early in 1 976 within my Department. </para>
            <para>Guidelines have been developed to assist planners wishing to establish an HMO to meet the requirements of the National Health Act in regard to the present universal insurance arrangements. These guidelines are available in handbook form from my Department. </para>

In January this year, following a report by the Federal Treasurer of the AMA on a brief study tour of HMOs in the United States of America, the Secretary-General of the AMA announced that the AMA is willing to co-operate with the Government or other interested parties in any pilot study to evaluate prepaid health programs (Le. HMOs) and that the Federal Council of the AMA has adopted no fixed policy for or against prepaid health plans at this stage. </para>

        <para>During the period 1974-75 to 1976-77 some residentially qualified invalid pensioners' reaching age pension age were not transferred to age pensions.

            <para>The Department already has in operation a rehabilitation assessment procedure which requires that all invalid pension applicants be assessed for rehabilitation suitability prior to the granting of an invalid pension. Even after a person has been granted an invalid pension, a post-grant referral procedure ensures that certain categories of pensioners, particularly those in the younger age groups, are reviewed periodically for rehabilitation purposes. These procedures ensure that every possible action is taken to assess a person for rehabilitation before he is deemed a permanent pensioner. </para>

        </list>
        <para>The Department has, over recent years, been endeavouring to increase the range of rehabilitation programs available to younger handicapped people, particularly those with an intellectual handicap. This has led to the development of two pilot Work Preparation Centres, which are designed to assist intellectually handicapped people, mainly in the 16-20 age group, achieve independent living status, including placement in open employment where possible. The Department is being assisted in the development of these programs by the Monash and Macquarie universities. Because of the success of these two pilot centres the Department is currently engaged in examining the extension of these programs against the particular needs of other communities. </para>
