Tourism and the export market development grants scheme</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to table on behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology the report of the committee's inquiry into the application of the export market development grants scheme to the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I presented this report to the Speaker by leave of the House on 14 July, so its contents and recommendations are already known to the government and to many in the industry. The need for the inquiry arose because of the peculiar treatment of the tourism industry in terms of its eligibility under the export market development grants scheme. There is a somewhat confused history behind this treatment. Between 1978 and 1985 members of the tourism industry were eligible to receive grants under the EMDGS on the same basis as those from other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1978 and 1985 members of the tourism industry were eligible to receive grants under the EMDGS on the same basis as those from other industries. Between 1985 and 1987 a separate scheme, the TOPS, was operated specifically for tourism. The TOPS was terminated in 1987 leaving the tourism industry, in effect, out in the cold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1990 tourism was readmitted to the EMDGS but only in a limited way. Eligibility for grants was confined to those who provided at least three of a range of five tourism service categories. In effect, this restricted the application of the scheme to one section of the industry&mdash;those who offer package tours for an all inclusive price to international tourists. Operators of hotels, attractions, hire car companies, and anyone else in the tourism industry who offers a single specific product are not eligible for marketing assistance under the EMDGS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justification used for treating tourism differently from all other industries was basically that the product promotion undertaken by, for example, hotels and tourist attraction business, is aimed at a market, so the argument goes, that has already decided to visit Australia. Therefore, such promotion is directed at capturing a percentage of an existing market not at generating additional export sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only submission which put forward this captive market argument was from the Department of Finance. The committee did not find the department's arguments very persuasive. It seems far more plausible to the committee that the decision by overseas tourists to visit Australia is influenced by a number of factors. These will include not only the generic type promotion of the Australian Tourism Commission and promotion by tour package operators, but also the promotion undertaken by single service operators. It is the total picture presented to potential visitors and the knowledge of a range of facilities and attractions which will persuade them to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of tourism products and services plays a vital role in the decision to travel to a particular destination. The international tourist requires extensive information about the attractions, products and services available in the destinations under consideration. Should this information not be available or be difficult to obtain, the chances are that another destination will be chosen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that there is no fundamental difference in the nature of the tourism industry as an export earner from that of any other industry which receives benefits from the scheme. Not only is it inequitable to have one sector of the tourism industry eligible for assistance and other sectors not, but it is also inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other service exporters are eligible for assistance while some tourism exporters are not. No other export industry under the EMDGS is subject to eligibility criteria which restrict assistance to sectors of its industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exclusion of part of the tourism industry from the EMDGS must encourage distortions in the allocation of investment resources. Resources may be directed away from tourism towards industries which qualify for the EMDGS assistance, leading to investments that are based on factors other than the merits and prospects of the particular industry. A redirection of resources may also result within the tourism industry because some parts of the industry have access to the EMDGS while others do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing industries. Few other industries can match its contribution to gross domestic product, foreign exchange earnings or employment. Inbound tourism helps expand and diversify Australia's export base. This reduces the impact on our terms of trade of the volatility in the price of our primary commodity exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has experienced unprecedented growth in international visitor arrivals over the past decade. Up to 6.8 million international tourists per year are forecast to visit Australia by the year 2000. Considering the spare capacity that currently exists in the economy, growth in international tourism has the potential to significantly improve Australia's balance of payments position and create substantial employment opportunities. The growth in employment in Australia attributable to international tourism&mdash;from some 56,300 jobs in 1981-82 to 143,900 in 1991-92&mdash;indicates that there is scope for substantial employment benefits. Tourism now earns more foreign exchange than does coal and has twice the foreign exchange earning of wool and meat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received evidence that increased promotion by the Australian Tourist Commission in recent years generated a 30-to-one return on expenditure. It must be remembered that industry operators have to make the initial marketing expenditure before they receive any grant from the government under the scheme. This helps ensure that the level and nature of marketing are based on commercial judgments about the likelihood of a reasonable return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, whatever the increased cost to the government of an expansion of the scheme&mdash;and the evidence indicates that it is likely to be in the order of $10 million to $15 million per annum&mdash;the claimants must undertake more than double that cost in increased marketing up front before there is any payment from the government under the EMDGS. Again, this helps ensure that commercial judgments are made about the level and nature of expenditure. If anything like a 30-to-one return is generated, then there would be a benefit to the economy far greater than the increased cost to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee accordingly recommends that the application of the export market development grants scheme be extended to include all of the tourism industry. The extension of the scheme should take effect in relation to expenditure after 1 July this year. At the same time, the anomaly in the act which results in joint ventures and consortia of tourism operators being excluded from the scheme should be removed. I note that the recent budget did not include an extension of the EMDGS, as recommended by the committee; and that is a matter which I will make some comment upon during the budget bills that come before the House at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as opposing the extension of the scheme to tourism, the Department of Finance suggested that any additional costs from its extension should be taken from some other part of the tourism portfolio, such as the funding for the Australian Tourist Commission. The committee rejects the idea that any extension of the scheme should be made contingent upon any corresponding decrease in the allocation of funds to other parts of the tourism portfolio. I was pleased to note that in the budget this week the funds to the Australian Tourist Commission have been increased, recognising the important role which tourism plays in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence received by the committee detailed the need for generic promotion of the kind carried out by the Australian Tourist Commission as well as for specific product marketing. Given the possible rate of return in export earnings from increased marketing within the tourism industry, there could well be an argument for increasing total government support for such marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central question of the inquiry was whether those sectors of the tourism industry which are presently excluded from eligibility under the EMDGS are in some way fundamentally different from the part of the industry or from other foreign exchange earning industries which are eligible under the scheme. The argument that the sectors which have been excluded are merely competing for a captive market with their overseas promotional expenditure rather than helping to expand the market did not convince the committee. Simple equity requires that that part of the industry should not be discriminated against in terms of its access to a government grants scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I convey my thanks and those of the committee members to the secretary of the committee, Paul McMahon, and to his staff, who assisted us very ably in the production of this report. I acknowledge the work of the members of the committee in the previous parliament who undertook work on similar terms of reference. I would also like to thank very sincerely all the members of the committee, who in a short space of time put a good deal of effort into consideration of the matters before them. I think the committee has produced a very commendable report. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in his comments this morning on this important report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas? Tourism and the export market development grants scheme</EMPHASIS>. Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing industries. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite rightly pointed out that few other industries can match tourism's contribution to the gross domestic product and the foreign exchange earnings of, or employment in, this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the Industry Commission estimates that a 20 per cent increase in the number of foreign tourists arriving in Australia which was experienced in 1987-88 would have resulted in a net benefit to Australia's balance of payments of around $235 million. That is a significant contribution to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the only ongoing member of the industry, science and technology committee who followed this inquiry right through from its outset, I know that the former chairman would be interested in this in his new capacity. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) is now the Minister for Tourism, and I am sure that the chairman of our committee will be pressing him for funding for the export market development grants scheme. We believe that it is important to Australia. Up to 6.8 million international tourists per year are forecast to visit Australia by the year 2000, and we must encourage and continue our promotion of tourism in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion that the committee reached was that not only is it inequitable to have one sector of the tourism industry eligible for assistance through the EMDGS and other sectors not, but it is also inequitable that exporters of manufactured goods and other service exporters are eligible for assistance while certain tourism exporters are not eligible. No other export industry under the EMDGS is subject to eligibility criteria which restrict assistance to sectors of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism, as I said, is the fastest growing industry in Australia. I want to place on record here that there is a great need for more international flights to come in and out of the Tullamarine airport in Melbourne. It is essential that people are attracted to Victoria and the wonderful tourist facilities that are available. I want to put a plug in for my own local area, naturally, because we have some of the most outstanding tourist attractions in Victoria in the Bendigo region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tullamarine airport, at the moment, does not receive the attention from international carriers that it deserves. It is a fine airport. A direct link from the Tullamarine airport via the Calder Highway&mdash;which needs to be upgraded&mdash;to the central Victorian goldfields area would be of tremendous benefit to that area and would certainly assist in the promotion of a wide range of tourist attractions in that area. It has much to offer. Recently, the government provided funds for the golden link, which links the Central Deborah Gold Mine in Bendigo&mdash;which is actually a living and working goldmine&mdash;to Bendigo's famous talking trams, which are a survivor of the original transport system. They are still operating now as a tourist attraction and carrying more passengers than they did when they operated as a transport system, and they are doing an extremely good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a whole host of attractions there which would be of interest to international visitors to Australia, including the finest Chinese artefacts museum in Australia. Some of the displays in that Chinese museum are unrivalled anywhere in the world. Bendigo is the proud possessor of the world's longest dragon. It comes out every Easter time and proceeds to parade in the Bendigo Easter Fair procession. International visitors come from all over the world to see this famous attraction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be associated with the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Undersold overseas? Tourism and the export market development grants scheme. </EMPHASIS>I endorse the four recommendations that the committee has presented to the House. Before entering this House, in an earlier life, I worked for five years with Ansett airlines&mdash;a major participant in the Australian tourism industry. From that vantage point, I saw that tourism was an industry that depended heavily on being able to move quickly to attract customers. Generally, this does not happen. Besides very large corporations, there are thousands of small businesses in the tourism industry. These small businesses can provide quality food, accommodation, safe and efficient travel and all other facets of a successful holiday in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, before the tourists get here they have to have sufficient attractive information about Australia. This marketing overseas can only be done by the efforts of larger groups with solid financial backing. The export market development grants scheme is a most valuable addition to the government's policy of promoting Australia as an outward looking economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is the world's biggest industry and Australia has less than one per cent of this trade. Our scope for improvement is right there in front of us. This scheme is a very good way for Australia to build on our less than one per cent. Most of us, if not all of us, have been overseas. It is very nice, though some bits are better than others. But it is not silly parochialism to say that Australia has a great deal to offer. What this scheme does is help our tourist industry market itself with more aggression. To do this we must move beyond the bureaucratic conception of the business. To succeed in a big way we must see our tourism industry as very serious. It is already our biggest export earner, and this did not happen by chance. It happened because a lot of serious people outside of this building and outside of the Department of Finance saw the real potential. They saw that one must invest first and then reap the dividend and they saw that investment and dividend do not always occur simultaneously. They saw the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole parliament is concerned about unemployment. Tourism is extremely labor intensive and for that reason alone this House should be enthusiastic that these four recommendations which will have a valuable effect on marketing Australia overseas. The labour unions are proving very constructive in their adjustment to this relatively new industry. This tourist industry has hours and conditions that do not always lend themselves easily to a more traditional approach to work and industrial relations. Nevertheless, the importance of tourism is widely understood and the labour movement is supportive of tourist industry growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opportunity to help our biggest export industry grow even bigger must not be lost. The committee worked together very well. It showed what can be done when we decide to work and to work together, and I commend the recommendations to this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to support the committee chairman in his commendation to the minister and the government of the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It is clear that this committee, in examining the export market development grants scheme, was unable and unwilling to examine the efficacy of the scheme as a whole. Instead, we took the approach of considering whether or not it was equitable to exclude a specific sector of a specific industry, in this case the general medium-sized and small players in the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry with respect to government assistance has really been a bouncing ball over the years. The fact that the industry is now included in this scheme, along with all other industries, is a positive initiative because, as honourable members before me have well pointed out, tourism provides a very positive benefit for Australia in terms of both employment and generating income from overseas. But in this industry, if persons are not a package tourism operator, if persons are running a hotel, a motel, a restaurant or a specific venue, they are excluded because they are unable to package their marketing programs with others in their region or in the industry in order to apply for grants under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that generic marketing by the Australian Tourist Commission has been successful. I commend particularly the Paul Hogan `shrimps on the barbie' exercise, which demonstrably proved that there is great benefit in positive advertising for Australia. There is no doubt that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crocodile Dundee</EMPHASIS> has played a positive role as well. Beyond that generic marketing, there is a need for people who want to visit Australia to decide on a specific location and specific venues and hopefully to have some idea&mdash;before they even think about getting on the aeroplane or the boat&mdash;of what they are going to see in Australia and where they are going to go. So the recommendations of this committee will help the industry itself&mdash;if the government were to accept the recommendations&mdash;to lift its marketing game: that is really what this report and our recommendations are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of La Trobe, we have very many tourism venues: a number of world-class restaurants, the Puffing Billy rail line, the National Rhododendron Gardens&mdash;and many package tours go there. But the marketing by individuals in my electorate is not acceptable, under this scheme, for return of grants. It is my belief that the government has erred in judgment in this respect. I have been through the budget papers at great length, and I think it is unfortunate in the extreme that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) was unable to accept the committee's report. I note that the committee worked very hard and under a strict timetable, with all members cooperating in order to examine this important issue and to complete a report well in time for the minister's deliberation before the budget. It was a great disappointment to me, personally, that I opened the budget papers to find that our recommendations had in fact been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the House; I would like to thank the secretary and others who worked on the report. It was a short-time report and we were under some duress to complete it and to give a positive balanced report: the committee achieved that, and I commend the chairman for running the committee well and efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to voice my support for the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. As a new member of the committee&mdash;having been elected to it since the federal election&mdash;I note that the inquiry had in fact been proceeding before the dissolution of parliament, and the bulk of the work in respect of the committee's deliberations had been undertaken by those members of the committee in the last parliament. I would like to thank the chairman, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), for his commendable determination to ensure that this report was received in the community and in the parliament well before the budget was completed by the government. I share the chairman's disappointment in the fact that there is nothing in the budget that picks up our recommendations: obviously, we will all be saying something in the budget debate in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to note that the tragedy of not embracing the recommendations of the report in this budget misses an enormous opportunity to achieve more growth and stimulus, particularly job-creating stimulus, in the Australian economy. We all know that tourism is our fastest-growing industry: we all know its potential, and we all realise that the number of import dollars from overseas that can be attracted is phenomenal, provided we package our promotion correctly overseas. I remind honourable members that a 20 per cent increase in the number of foreign tourists, at 1987-88 prices, is equivalent to an extra net $235 million to Australia's balance of payments, which is a very substantial sum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Indi we have many tourist attractions. These include the mountains, the alpine snow resorts, the wineries, the beauty of the area, the Murray River and the lakes. I have noticed an increasing number of overseas tourists looking for niche tourist attractions. Backpackers now are much different types of tourists in Australia than what we understood them to be many years ago. They now spend money in restaurants, they stay in motels and hotels and they use local businesses. Increasingly in Indi I see them coming in and spending money and thus creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is a typical region of Australia and has an untapped resource in overseas tourism promotion. Tourist operators are deprived of the opportunity to participate in the present export promotion schemes in tourism. That is a glaring omission. In any event in an industry as vibrant and diversified as tourism it is a nonsense policy to say that we will promote tourism overseas but we will not allow all tourist players to at least put up their proposals and participate in the bid for the promotion dollar. At least they should be able to, on a level playing field, put their submissions forward and have them evaluated according to approved criteria and not be excluded from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make is that too much emphasis is going on in Australia that seems to favour big business, big government and big unions and not enough emphasis has been placed on the potential and the contribution to Australia's future from the ordinary person, the small business. The 800,000 small businesses in Australia are the engine room of Australia and they are the ones that will lead us into a recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues&mdash;what a mouthful&mdash;or as it is more commonly known, the family law committee, was given a reference to inquire into the child support scheme in May this year. I am indeed indebted to so many honourable members and senators who by virtue of assisting their constituents have so strongly welcomed and supported this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided to operate a 008 hotline for two days on 21 and 22 July 1993 in Parliament House. My committee was concerned to allow the widest possible input into the inquiry and in particular to attract those people who might not have been inclined to put in a written submission to the committee or those people who might not have been comfortable about putting in a written submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no paid advertising of the hotline. We did not have the money. So I would like to sincerely thank the people of the media in general and radio in particular. Without their interest in and promotion of the hotline, I am sure we would not have been able to attract as many people to contact us. Radio talkback hosts who, because of their listeners, have long believed that all was not right with the scheme were just tremendous. I thank them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is history now that this maiden parliamentary hotline was an overwhelming success. It is estimated that more than 150,000 calls were attempted over the two-day period. Telecom estimated that somewhere in the order of 80,000 calls were logged for Wednesday, 21 July, and on Thursday, 22 July Telecom logged a low of 6,100 calls between 12.30 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. and a high of 9,477 between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to have their say, callers attempted to contact the hotline continually throughout the two days. However, because of technical limitation on lines, answering positions and staff, only 698 calls were able to be answered. Three hundred and fifty-two calls were taken on 21 July and 346 on 22 July. Some callers who were unable to get through on the hotline found many other ways of contacting the committee secretariat, and these callers were contacted during the following week. Indeed, the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), the minister responsible for the Child Support Agency, also received some calls about the agency on the first day of the hotline. They were so moved by the experience that a press release was issued. I am indebted to them for their continuing interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The downside of the success of the hotline is that it is obvious that people felt very strongly about the scheme, as people were prepared to persist in attempting to contact the hotline over two days. When they were finally placed in the hotline queue, they held on for up to an hour in order to have an opportunity to discuss the issue and say at the end of the call, `Thanks for giving me this opportunity. I'm so glad someone is prepared to listen to me'&mdash;hence the title of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hotline was in effect a litmus test of community opinion about the child support scheme and the agency. The response to the hotline has laid to rest the myth that it is merely a well-organised minority of disgruntled non-custodial parents that is dissatisfied with the scheme, the agency or both. Those who seek to peddle this myth can now be confronted with the overwhelming public response to the hotline and challenged to accept reality, however reluctantly. This dissatisfaction is felt by both custodial parents and non-custodial parents. Both groups of parents were equally vocal in their dissatisfaction with the scheme or the agency or both. Although the two groups, custodial and non-custodial parents, for the most part had different complaints, there were some significant similarities, particularly about the operations and conduct of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public has thrown down the gauntlet to the committee, and they are demanding that changes be made to the scheme to make it fairer, more flexible and user-friendly. Clearly, they are asserting that the child support scheme is good in concept but flawed in execution. My committee has accepted the challenge and I trust that we will be able to make recommendations which result in a better and more widely supported child support scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee desires to lay before the parliament and the public the concerns and issues raised by the callers to the hotline. The list is not exhaustive as yet. A comprehensive analysis is currently being undertaken of the hotline responses. Written submissions close at the end of this month and they are flooding in. It is expected that the committee will receive between 4,000 and 5,000 submissions, probably setting a new record for the number of submissions to a parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also propose to table at the earliest opportunity a further interim report that encompasses the concerns and issues raised by both the hotline callers and the written submissions, which will provide more detailed analysis. It is unfortunately true that the large number of submissions has caused an ambitious inquiry timetable to be extended. The committee now aims to have a discussion or issues paper by December 1993 and a final report by mid-1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hotline served to make the committee process of the parliament much more accessible, available and relevant to a whole new range of people who might not otherwise participate. Clearly, the hotline was less intimidating for many people than the more traditional committee process, which is so reliant on a written submission. It is my view that such endeavours are a useful means of gauging community opinion on topical issues, particularly those which affect those people less willing to write a formal submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all the staff who assisted with the hotline and express my particular thanks to the Speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), Mr Lyn Barlin, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Telecom staff and Tanya Baker from PISO, all of whom assisted with establishing and/or maintaining the hotline during a very busy two days. I would also like to thank my committee colleagues who assisted me in answering calls over the two days, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), Senator Kim Carr, the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and Senator Margaret Reid. I am sure we all benefited from this experience, gaining a better appreciation of the difficulties being experienced by many people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of all I wish to thank the hotline callers themselves for their patience, for generously sharing with the committee their often painful personal experiences, frustrations and anguish as well as for giving us the benefit of their ideas and suggestions. Without them this inquiry would not be possible. I commend this interim report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Attitudinal changes unleashed by the sexual revolution in the 1960s together with the introduction of the supporting mothers benefit in 1973 by the then Whitlam government&mdash;previously only deserted mothers could make a claim on the state&mdash;brought with it a new social phenomenon which displaced the shotgun marriages of former times, namely a sharp rise in the number of single parent families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1974 and June 1991, sole parent families increased as a proportion of all families in Australia from 9.2 per cent to 16.3 per cent. Contrary to popular belief only 20 per cent of these fit the stereotype of the young unmarried mum. The majority are the result of breakdown of marriage or de facto relationships. As around two-thirds of these seek social security at least for a period, the costs to government have been huge, rising from $160 million in 1973-74 to $1.7 billion in 1985-86 and to $2.9 billion in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the court system, financial support for children had become virtually a voluntary payment. The number of court orders or agreements for child maintenance were low, the levels of maintenance often trifling, not linked to the inflation rate and not enforced. In short, many former spouses had an appalling record of not paying for the maintenance of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 a parliamentary joint select committee on the Family Law Act recommended the creation of a maintenance and enforcement agency. A report of the national maintenance inquiry in 1984 made detailed recommendations for the creation of an agency. In 1986 the government proposed to introduce a system of formula based assessment of maintenance administered by a child support agency attached to the Taxation Office. Collection of maintenance was to be through the withholding of payments from wages and salaries by employers on behalf of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's stated objectives were, first, that non-custodial parents should share the cost of their children according to their capacity to pay; secondly, that adequate support be available for children of separated parents; thirdly, that Commonwealth expenditure be limited to what is necessary to ensure that those needs be met; fourthly, to ensure that neither parent is discouraged from participating in the work force; and, finally, that the overall arrangement should be simple, flexible, efficient and respect personal privacy. It is against these objectives that any assessment currently of the Child Support Agency can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme was also prefaced on the first detailed research to emerge on the economic consequences of marriage breakdown for both men and women. This showed that while women living alone or as single parents experienced a great reduction in their standard of living, men, alone, as single parents or in a new marriage without children, improved their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, before the scheme only 24 per cent of all potentially eligible women were receiving regular maintenance payments in 1982. The institute's survey of pre-scheme custodial parents in 1988 reported that 34 per cent of the sample were receiving child maintenance. In 1988 only 25.6 per cent or 62,100 out of 240,000 sole parent pensioners were declaring maintenance income. The amount paid has been increased from an average of $27 for each child prior to the scheme to some $50 in 1991-92. While the number of non-custodial parents paying maintenance has increased, it is still far from all of those parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman has pointed out, the parliamentary committee on the Family Law Act began an inquiry into this scheme this year. The Child Support Agency has been the subject of widespread complaint, including a series of complaints by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Custodial parents have pointed to delays, discriminatory attitudes, inadequate communication, slow enforcement, inflexibility, failure to exercise powers and continuing violence. A summary of these complaints is set out in the preliminary report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>, tabled by the chairman today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these problems stem from the rapid growth of persons using the scheme and the consequent under-resourcing of the agency. In July 1989, the agency received 65 applications to collect court ordered child maintenance and managed to collect 27 of them. Five years later, the agency has close to 200,000 cases registered with it. There are 21 branches and 1,200 staff. Applications are received at a rate of 2,700 each week and staff are taking around 9,000 calls a day at peak times. At the Box Hill office, just outside my electorate, for example, only two people are available to take some 1,800 phone calls a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the agency collects some 72 per cent of the debt registered, only 50 per cent of non-custodial parents pay the full amount on time. If the current growth in registered persons continues, almost a million parents could be registered by the end of this decade. In these circumstances, there is a real need to encourage and facilitate workable private arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-custodial parents, invariably fathers, complain about the maintenance formula in particular. Support percentages range from 18 per cent of taxable income for one child, through 27 per cent for two, 32 per cent for three children, 34 per cent for four children and 36 per cent for five or more children. Complaints often cite the levels as too high and mention inflexibility where one or both former spouses re-partner. Lack of consideration of property and other settlements between the couple is also a cause for concern. These are outlined in the interim report which has been tabled. However, maintenance must take account of the costs of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One consequence of the introduction of the Family Law Act in Australia was, I believe, to engender a community attitude that partners could simply walk away from a marriage upon its ending. The child support scheme challenges that attitude and requires ongoing financial responsibility for children. As the magnitude of the response to both the hotline and the inquiry indicate, the operation of the scheme has been the subject of widespread disquiet. We owe it to the children of Australia to find an appropriate balance between the rights and responsibilities of all parties in the resolution of family disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join with my parliamentary colleagues, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), and endorse their comments on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I certainly acknowledge the comments on the history of the operation of the child support scheme made by my colleague the honourable member for Menzies. I think this committee is another excellent example of the cooperative nature of the parliamentary committee system. It is a great committee to work on with colleagues across the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am strongly of the view that we must endeavour to make government accessible to the people. Therefore, when the honourable member for Chifley, who was our chairman, suggested the idea of the hotline, I enthusiastically supported the initiative and made the commitment to participate, together with my senior staffer who has been responsible for handling the numerous inquiries in my electorate office on this contentious issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My professional background as a social worker and family counsellor with considerable experience in this area rendered the transition to hotline attendee one of relative ease. It is possibly true that I spent longer on each call than some of my fellow attendees, but I considered that if people had spent hours trying to get through and then held on for up to an hour to speak to someone, they deserved some time to tell their story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheer volume of calls caught us by surprise. In fact, I had been concerned that we had not sufficiently advertised the hotline across the country. This was not the case in Capricornia, where I had gone to considerable trouble to let my constituents know that they might have the opportunity to participate from regional Queensland&mdash;something that was very important in the mining communities in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we need not have worried. Once the word got out via talkback radio, as mentioned by the chair, it spread like wildfire. One person I spoke with on the hotline from Western Australia had had a telephone call from a friend on the east coast. And a hotline it certainly was. What we call in the mining industry a hot seat changeover was difficult to achieve, because no sooner would we replace the receiver than the phone would ring again, and our ears certainly got incredibly hot. Remarkably, there was little hostility or impatience from our callers once their patience was rewarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we heard&mdash;from both custodial and non-custodial parents&mdash;were heart-rending stories of the pain of family breakdown, custody disputes and economic difficulties as the parents' dreams were crushed and they struggled to maintain their parental responsibilities. Added to this were the frustrations and difficulties of dealing with what many felt was an uncaring and unresponsive bureaucracy&mdash;the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnitude of the response to the hotline demonstrates that we are not dealing with an extremist fringe group. There are real difficulties with the operation of the scheme. The hotline response certainly vindicates the recommendation by the previous joint select committee and the minister's reference to the present committee. The specific concerns are summarised accurately in this brief report and, together with the thousands of written submissions the hard-pressed and dedicated secretariat staff are processing, they will help to inform our public hearings as we travel around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the many sad experiences I shared with my callers, a couple of situations stay in my mind. One concerns the mother who called to tell of her son whose second relationship ended in disaster when, having ended the brief relationship, his girlfriend, by now interstate and wanting nothing further to do with him, announced her pregnancy and obtained a child support order that he now struggles to fulfil in isolated, outback conditions, and with very little opportunity to have any contact with the child he fathered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there was the man who phoned to say that his second family relationship had just broken down under the financial strain of supporting his children from a previous marriage plus his second partner's children because she was not able to obtain child support from the biological father. His new partner, with whom he is still very much in love, had just moved out and back onto supporting parents benefit and his life was in pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To balance these and other stories of non-custodial parents who are forced to return to live with their parents or to be supported by their new partners are the stories of many women who are struggling to raise their children, wondering why the Child Support Agency is apparently incapable of collecting the child support to which they are entitled. Many said, `Even if I can't get any justice, I hope my story will help to change things for other people'. Certainly we did hear from women who were custodial parents who spoke very positively about the social security provisions that enable them to support their families with a degree of dignity. The child support scheme was an important social justice initiative. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to say a few words following the publication of the welcome interim report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>, of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I thank very much the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) for their remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the real anguish points in the community at the moment. There are enormous problems, of course, with unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, which are causing very great social difficulty and which are seen directly in members' offices and out in the community. But this particular area of family breakdown and provision for children is a matter of very grave concern. One of the most harrowing parts of one's electorate work is to hear the really terrible stories of people following the breakdown of marriage or de facto relationships. Of course, the stories come from both sides of the fence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is striking me the most is the number of women who are looking after children at, I might say, both ends of the income scale, where often the former spouse is able to manipulate taxable income declarations in the cruellest possible way to reduce maintenance payments. There is nothing really that the Child Support Agency is able to do about that under existing arrangements. I have become aware of a number of cases of unbelievable cruelty, where incomes have been halved artificially in some way amongst professional and business people at the top end of the scale, leaving women and children virtually destitute in relation to their previous standards of living. It can always be said that they can go right back to a pension level but we all know that in a social context that is extraordinarily difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other end of the scale is where the former spouse is a ne'er-do-well, often self-employed or partly employed, and moving from one place to another. One can send in as many sheriffs as one likes to try to recover assets and so on but the person has always moved off or the new defacto always owns the assets and so on. It is the most frustrating thing possible to try to track these people down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as the honourable member for Capricornia said, on the other side of the scale, some custodial parents are also misusing the system at the expense of the non-custodial parent. So the male&mdash;as it usually is&mdash;is in a really desperate situation and is certainly being squeezed in a way which is just inhuman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it brings home to us is that the poor people in the Child Support Agency, the people who are working there&mdash;honourable members would have heard the numbers given by the honourable member for Menzies&mdash;are under enormous pressure. They are having to deal with rules that they must follow within a law which does not give them the means to pursue a number of these cases adequately and they are dealing with people on the phone who are in a highly emotional and worried state. So I feel very much indeed for those people in the agency. When one considers the number of telephone calls each individual in the agency has to deal with and the nature of those calls, one can see that we have got here a monster of a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the honourable members of the committee on family law&mdash;compassionate, able and determined people&mdash;are looking into this as fast as they can and as best they can. The problem will never be wholly soluble because the outcome of human tragedy is beyond the reach of a lot of the actions of government. That is just one of the facts of life we have to face up to, but I wish them well in their future endeavours and hope that, as far as possible, they will be able to ease the enormous and dreadful pain of the clients of the agency who have the worst cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have very great pleasure in presenting to the House the first report by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, a report on the draft master plan for City Hill. Much of the work for this report was undertaken by our predecessor in the previous parliament, the Joint Committee on the National Capital, chaired by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I would like to place on record my appreciation for the work done by that committee and for the continuing high level of input by the honourable member to this new committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">City Hill is an important landmark in Canberra and an area of great heritage value, being a corner of the Burley Griffin parliamentary triangle, with plantings of trees by Thomas Weston. It is an area of green, largely untouched by the growth in Civic in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in Canberra would not be aware that successive plans for the area have contained provisions for the construction of more buildings on that land between London Circuit and Vernon Circle. Because any new building would tend to obscure the view of this landmark park and dominate the hill, contributing, of course, to traffic congestion and parking pressures, the committee was aware that any such proposal should be very carefully examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The master plan for City Hill arose out of consultations between the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority, which in turn were followed by community consultations, and the outcome of all these discussions resulted in draft amendment No. 5 to the national capital plan, which the committee reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the amendment was the proposal to reverse existing height limits on buildings in the area around City Hill, bounded by Vernon Circle and London Circuit. These would have allowed the construction of buildings up to the equivalent of six storeys in height along Vernon Circle, with a three-storey limit on London Circuit. Following extensive briefings and discussions, the committee remained unconvinced that at this stage in the development of Canberra such a change was warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed change in height limits appears to have been motivated by the need for a magistrates court building, which the ACT government had proposed be located in this area. Plans for a magistrates court drawn up by the ACT government assumed that the height limit would be amended. The plans were, therefore, for a building the equivalent of five storeys high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee supports the need for such a court to be built, the decision to design to standards not yet approved has meant considerable delay in this project. Construction of the magistrates court could have been started at any time in the last 12 months if the design had been within the current height limits set by the national capital plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, in its report, was critical of the planners' decision to go ahead and design a building higher than presently allowed, and that no action was taken to have the national capital plan varied until the architectural work was completed. The committee was not convinced that major changes to the building heights in this area of the national capital should be made to accommodate this one building proposal, however pressing might be the need, particularly as the building could be built in the same area within existing guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report contained a number of other major recommendations, including that the National Capital Planning Authority not proceed with the master plan for City Hill in its present form; that a conservation plan for City Hill be developed, taking into account its heritage values; that the master plan be deferred until two major studies on Canberra and its future transport needs are completed; and that further traffic studies be conducted to assess noise and pollution levels on Vernon Circle, alternative routes for through traffic and public transport arrangements around City Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the individuals, community and professional groups and government agencies that made submissions to the committee or appeared before it to give evidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up where the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) left off and begin by thanking the staff and members of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. The drafting of the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">City Hill: review of the draft master plan</EMPHASIS> was caught up in the preparation for the election and the election itself. We had hoped to complete the report before the election was called. We worked very hard on drafting the report over the December-January period, which is the time when people normally take their holidays. That drafting was, in fact, completed at exactly the time when the election was called. The completion and tabling of the report then had to wait until the committee was re-formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore owes a great debt to its staff. I would particularly like to thank Lindy Smith, Janet Thompson, Marlene Lyons and Di Singleton, who worked very hard to complete the draft in the December-January period. They did a splendid job. The report is very much the result of their fine work. I would also like to thank the new chairman, the honourable member for Dunkley, for pushing the completion of the report through so quickly as soon as the committee was re-formed. This report was urgently required by the Australian Capital Territory government so that it could undertake its planning for the Magistrate's Court building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was one of the most difficult that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has undertaken because there was such a division of opinion about the proposals that were before it. There seemed to be a division between the planners on the one hand and the community on the other, although the community was not entirely united in its approach either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The planners were persuaded that a six-storey Magistrate's Court building made sense. They believed that it would enhance the area and that it would not diminish the beauty or significance of City Hill. The majority of the members of the community thought that it was better to have a lower building, one that did not overshadow City Hill. They thought it was quite wrong for the ACT planners to have gone ahead and prepared architectural drawings for a six-storey building before approval had been given for a building of that height. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee wrestled with the issue. In the end, the decision was unanimous. It was the committee's view that a three-storey building was more appropriate in exactly that location because of concern that a six-storey building would overshadow City Hill. The committee's concern was that it would, in a sense, create a ring of large buildings around City Hill which would hem it in, cast shadows, make it more difficult for fumes to disperse and, in other words, really reduce the significance of that corner of the parliamentary triangle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the committee recommends that the limit be kept at three storeys, at least for the time being, until other changes are made to the plan for the whole area&mdash;and I will come to that in a minute. The committee was unanimous. It is my view that it has made the right recommendation. I regret that that decision delays the construction of the Magistrate's Court building because that building is definitely needed. It should be built as quickly as possible. It will save the ACT government funds as soon as it is completed, but it is our view that that corner of the parliamentary triangle is so significant that good planning for it should not be inhibited by immediate pressure for the Magistrate's Court building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee felt that the proposals that were put to it were inadequate in a number of ways. The honourable member for Dunkley has already mentioned them. I do not have time to go through them. They are well outlined in the report. Anyone interested in this matter should read the report because it very carefully describes the committee's reservations. The report is well drafted. I am glad to say that a number of people have written to me since it was published to say that they support our conclusion. I urge that the House accept the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the third time that I have introduced this private member's bill and I hope that it may be a case of third time lucky. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in March 1992 the federal government changed the Australian Design Rules so that all new motorcycles sold in Australia have to have their headlights hard wired if they are to be registered. In other words, whenever the engine is started, the headlight will automatically come on. This was part of the black spots program, and it seemed like a classic case of a minister looking for a 10-point program and trying to find some ideas to fill up those 10 points by saying, `Here's one. If we have compulsory lights on, then we may have an opportunity to fill up the 10 points'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the black spots program&mdash;although it has been praised in all circles and has been shown to be a very successful way of at least in part improving our roads but, more importantly, of reducing some of the high risk sectors of our roads and some intersections&mdash;is to be scrapped by this government, when it has just proved its worth. It seems an extraordinary bit of logic. If the government were to take a more sensible approach, then it might want to look again at this whole question of lights on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this private member's bill is to reverse that change to the Australian Design Rules, section 19. We have to look very carefully at some of the reasons that we should get rid of it. The first reason is, of course, that there is no compelling evidence that it actually increases safety. In fact, there are quite a few examples of where it could well do the opposite. The second reason is that, if you take the advice of experienced riders and experienced motorcycle instructors, they are very concerned about it: they believe that in some cases it has the opposite effect, and that it in fact increases the danger for a motorcyclist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern is that, by doing this, it is very easy to build in a false sense of security. It is very important that we put a lot of effort into road safety, particularly for motorcyclists. I do not believe that, by doing this, the government has in fact improved road safety at all, and that there is a very real risk that it could have been the other way round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other nonsensical things about this design rule. For example, all agricultural bikes that can be registered are going to have lights on. It just seems stupid to have a farmer riding around the paddock with a light on all day. Apart from anything else, when bikes are just idling behind a mob of sheep, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it probably flattens the battery&mdash;or else they have got to have a much bigger generator or alternator put on them. These are the sorts of nonsensical side issues that have come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that we have a new minister for land transport, it is an opportunity for the government to realise its mistake and to concentrate more on what issues can improve road safety, particularly for motorcyclists. I suggest that it starts with the attitude of all road users. It is really the wrong emphasis to keep trying to force things like this lights on rule onto motorcyclists, rather than looking at the whole question of how we improve the attitude and the behaviour of all users of the roads. That way, we might help to further reduce the level of road accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at some of the evidence on this, it is very pertinent to note that, as of January this year, the Italian government banned daytime headlight running for all vehicles&mdash;not just for motorcycles, but for all vehicles. The reason that the police in Italy have done this is that they believe that having lights on during the day, for cars or bikes, increases the risk of accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would think that if a country like Italy, where people take driving very seriously, has made that decision, it is time that this government had another look at it. Clearly, as I have said, there has never been compelling evidence put forward for this move. It seemed very much a case of a minister wanting to be seen to be doing something at the time. There still is no compelling evidence. There are a lot of examples, such as the Italian one, and there are riders and instructors with experience who say that it makes motorcycling more dangerous. It certainly runs the risk of increasing the false sense of security. I present this bill and I hope that this time, third time lucky, the government will take notice of it. </PARA>

<PARA>At the outset, I would like to say that it is not with any great joy that I find myself in the position this morning of moving this motion in the House. In moving the motion, I would first like to dispel some perceptions about my own part in the motion and my public statements regarding the situation, not only in Bosnia but in the former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say that I have an ulterior motive, but I can assure honourable members that no ulterior motives are in my mind. One of the perceived ideas is that I have association with certain ethnic groups, which is not true. I talk to all ethnic groups in my area. It gives me no pride to have to stand here and bring the horrible situation in the once beautiful city of Sarajevo to the attention of my colleagues in this parliament. In doing so, at the very outset I would like to say that when I mention certain ethnic groups&mdash;and I will be referring to the Bosnian Serbs&mdash;it in no way whatsoever indicates my hatred of the Serbian nation, because I have no hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not raising this matter because I am a warmonger; I detest war. I reckon that I am the only member of this House who can stand up here with the horrible record of losing 10 members of my own family, including my own mother and father, in World War II. It is not something that I am very proud to relate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the fact that one might think I am doing it for revenge, that is not so; I am not revengeful of anyone and have never shown revenge for anyone any more than the remaining members of my family. So it is easy to stand here and say that one hates somebody and that that is the reason I am associated with this motion. It is not true at all&mdash;which is more than I can say for some of the ethnic spokesmen in Australia who are saying that both I and other members of the parliament, on both sides of the House, have got our facts wrong. They seem to have all the hatred. They seem to be saying Herzegovina was this and was that before the First World War. We are going back all those years. If that is not hateful and revengeful, I do not know what is hateful and revengeful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My only concern is to bring to the world through this parliament the terrible situation that now exists in Herzegovina, and I do it completely on humanitarian grounds. If anybody distrusts my attitude, they have only to look at my record in the parliament since I entered it in 1984. Shortly after I entered here, I was chairman of a humanitarian group&mdash;indeed, I am still associated with it&mdash;on that terrible situation of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, so I have a long association with humanitarian groups. Some of my colleagues who would like to speak here today, I understand, are probably frightened. I am not frightened of any ethnic group in this country, in spite of the numerous telephone calls that I do receive and my wife receives which tell me to keep my mouth shut. I am not in the business of being silenced by anyone. As I said, I hold no hatred for any particular group in this country. My particular concern is to lift the blockade of Sarajevo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 3 of the motion `welcomes, in this respect, recent progress made by the Geneva peace talks'. Since this motion was submitted, things have moved fast in Sarajevo and it now seems to all intents and purposes, going by the publicity this morning, that some relief and some agreement will be reached. Unfortunately, we have to be on the alert. These agreements have been reached before on numerous occasions, and nothing has come of them. When one sees the terrible pictures on television of mutilated children and women and the reasons for their treatment, one is horrified at the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to remind honourable members of some of the facts, in 1990 and 1991 there were elections in the former Yugoslavia, in the states in that confederation. Croatia and Slovenia had a democratic vote, and the Communist Party was well and truly defeated. Some would say that the United Nations should have taken a stand then when that lovely little country called Slovenia was attacked for no good reason, just because the people of that country had decided that they wanted to run their own affairs and did not want to be subject to any other power. Some would say that the United Nations failed in its duty, and I would not argue with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would put the argument that the predecessor of the United Nations failed in Europe in the 1930s. Some people tell me today that we are witnessing a similar occurrence, and I would agree with that. The only statement I made in public that I was asked to withdraw, and I refused to withdraw, was a statement I made publicly in Sydney some weeks ago that, if there were an oilwell on the fringes of Sarajevo, the thing would have been sorted out. Much as it pains me to say it, I also think that, if the greater population of Sarajevo were other than Muslims, it also would have been sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the European nations are scared of a Muslim enclave in their midst and, when people put that to me, I could not but agree with them. It is disgusting beyond belief that such a state of affairs is allowed to exist. I am well aware also&mdash;and I probably will be reminded of it after this statement in the House today, as indeed my colleagues will&mdash;that there are other places in the former Yugoslavia. Of course there are, but somebody has to start somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want this country to go to war, for the reasons that I have given, and certainly would not want to see the remaining parts of my family, or the parts of my family that I have sired after the depletion of the family during the last World War, go to war. I would not want to see anybody else go to war. Nevertheless, that was the ultimate price that we had to pay in Europe in 1939. We kept putting it back and putting it back until in the end someone had to make a move. I would suggest that, if the move had been made earlier in 1935 and 1936, the horrible atrocities of World War II might not have occurred and the world would have been spared those horrible atrocities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot more that I would like to say, but I realise that my colleagues have come to the fore. I am not proud, as I said, to have had to move this motion; it is a necessity as far as I am concerned. But I am proud to be associated with it because it had to be done. I sincerely believe that Australia, with its strong diplomatic links with the United States and Europe, should endeavour to keep pressure on those countries to alleviate the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I close, I would like to mention the bouquet in paragraph 5 of the motion commending Care Australia. I did meet at a function a gentleman involved with Care Australia who had just come back from Somalia. I am quite sure that Care Australia is doing a darn good job over there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. In debating this motion here this morning, one can understand the tragedy now taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina only if one looks at the general history of what was Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was from the outset an artificial creation. It was pulled together at the end of the First World War out of the remnants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and out of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. It was from the beginning an unlikely combination of people with totally different cultural, linguistic and racial backgrounds. So from the very beginning there were going to be great internal stresses and strains in what was, from the beginning, a most unfortunate combination of peoples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the end of the First World War and before the Second World War, this artificial creation of what was at the beginning called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and later renamed Yugoslavia, was held together by a royal dictatorship; then during the Second World War by German occupation; and then by the communist dictatorship of Marshall Tito, who ruled what was then Yugoslavia for a very long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the collapse of European communism came about at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s Yugoslavia itself started to break up; and it went back to its natural ethnic groups. In the European summer of 1991 we saw Croatia and Slovenia formally break away from what was then Yugoslavia. Slovenia had to fight a very short 10-day war to affirm its independence from Yugoslavia, a war which it won very decisively and very efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The war then moved into Croatia, where a long and protracted struggle took place until quite recent times as what was Serbia attempted to re-establish a greater Serbia, the Serbians having, of course, been the dominant political and military influence in the old Yugoslavia. That then went on into Croatia, and even today there are significant parts of Croatia still occupied. The situation in Croatia is still not fully clarified at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties then arose in Bosnia-Herzegovina because that, too, was part of the old Yugoslavia. Whereas Slovenia and Croatia were basically homogenous nations and fairly distinct entities, that unfortunately was not the case in respect of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There were three distinct groups there, the dominant group being the Muslim group, but there are also significant Serbian and Croatian groupings. That is one of the reasons why the Bosnian situation is as complicated and as messy as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Serbians, in attempting to establish a greater Serbia, moved into Bosnia. They certainly had the military clout and wherewithal, including a very substantial armoured corps, upon which to base such an onslaught. From the beginning they also have made very substantial use of the local Bosnian Serbs as military irregulars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bosnian situation, despite the fact that some of the other situations elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia have also been quite tragic and horrendous, undoubtedly has been the worst of all. As part of the ongoing conflict there, we have seen the establishment of the notorious rape camps, where tens of thousands of women, mainly Bosnian Muslims, were systematically raped. There has been the ongoing siege of Sarajevo, with all the accompanying bloodshed and hardship that that has caused and, of course, there have been other difficulties in other parts of Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now, after much procrastination and inaction by the United Nations, has reached the point where last night the United Nations declared a protectorate over Sarajevo. The UN is going to endeavour, as proposed some time ago, to make Sarajevo a demilitarised zone. An arrangement has been entered into whereby that protectorate will be in place for up to two years. That is certainly a desirable development&mdash;if it works&mdash;but I agree with my colleague on the other side of the House that it is really quite appalling that the European powers and the United Nations have procrastinated for so long and been so impotent and inactive in trying to arrive at a solution to the problems in Bosnia. Because of that inaction and general impotence, many people have needlessly lost their lives in the quite tragic circumstances in Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangement in respect of Sarajevo will last only if it is properly enforced by the United Nations. There have been a lot of very dubious games played out in this situation which the UN should have actually cut short some time ago. For instance, I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that even as recently as two or three days ago, when the threat of NATO air strikes forced the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from Mount Igman and one other mount above Sarajevo where they had been positioned, some 3,000 Bosnian Serb irregulars moved off the mountain. But if we look elsewhere at what happened, we see that it really was not such a desirable development. All that happened was that, as those 3,000 Bosnian Serb irregulars pulled off the two mountains, 2,000 fresh troops were positioned in the lowlands surrounding Sarajevo, a move that removed them from the danger of air strikes by NATO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the declaration of the UN protectorate over Sarajevo, 1,400 heavy guns are still pointed at the city, and the city is still in a very difficult situation. If the demilitarised zone now declared by the United Nations over Sarajevo does work, if it is properly enforced and the city properly protected, then the people of that city will avoid what otherwise would be an absolutely terrible winter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What now has to happen is that a permanent and peaceful solution has to be negotiated between all the various warring factions in Bosnia, not only to bring the conflict to an end but also to guarantee the integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which I remind the House is a constituent state of the United Nations. In this respect, one also has to question the extent to which the United Nations has actually acted as an honest broker in the situation in Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members to consider, for instance, what happened earlier this year on 31 July when the constitutional agreement was being negotiated by the various groups that make up Bosnia, the United Nations and the various other parties involved. The president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, was forced on 31 July to write to Lord David Owen and Mr Thorwald Stoltenberg, the two UN negotiators, actually questioning the draft which they had drawn up for the constitutional agreement. On the basis of the legal advice he had been given, there was considerable doubt as to whether the agreement actually did guarantee the sovereign status of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That sort of duplicitous play and procrastination by the United Nations does not assist a speedy resolution of the terrible situation in Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as is stated in part (5) of the motion now before the House, I would like to heartily commend the tremendous work being carried out by Care Australia in its operations in that general area. It has 30 people there who risk their lives daily to help look after people who are far less fortunate than themselves. Fifteen of those 30 people are truck drivers, and Care Australia at the moment is moving something like 300 tonnes of food per week, clothing and medical supplies into Bosnia, mainly into northern Bosnia, out of Croatia to help relieve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Care received enormous help from the Swedish government. In fact, 140 trucks have just been donated by the Swedish government to Care Australia. I find it sad that Care Australia has not received the same degree of assistance from our own Australian government. It has received only $300,000 from the Australian government, which was a contribution to the world food program operated by the United Nations. Care Australia's appeals for further assistance, as far as this government is concerned, have fallen on deaf ears. I would trust that the government, particularly given the gravity of the situation there, will treat any further requests from Care Australia with more consideration than it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that this dreadful situation does now come to an end. Certainly, the declaration of the demilitarised zone will help, if it is properly enforced. But the only way that the dilemma can be permanently resolved is by a peaceful negotiation which guarantees the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

At that time I was representing a disproportionately Muslim electorate made up of Turkish and Arabic speaking residents, and I was confronted by a view that they put to me that I did not agree with that it was essentially an Arab problem that should be solved within the Middle East. While there are other reasons for disquiet, I do not agree with that argument because it is like saying that the ASEAN countries should look after human rights within their countries' borders, with the very different standards that exist, or that we should leave Timor to the ASEAN group of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, what has happened is that the United Nations has left this problem to Europe. Whilst there is a degree of truth in previous speakers' statements that it is a Muslim minority within what was the former Yugoslavia, and there is not the degree of financial incentive to protect oil pipelines, I think it rests more with the fundamental problem that the United Nations does not have the readily organised military forces; it does depend on the agreement of a large number of other countries and it has thought that the European Community would be able to move towards a solution, eventually, by negotiations, by financial restrictions on Serbia, et cetera. What we have seen, unfortunately, is an essential disagreement, a lack of purpose and a situation where the various European countries have very different attitudes about what should be done and whether there should be military action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Britain, in particular, has had a very sorry record. Not only has it been the most backward in taking humanitarian refugees, but also I would say it has gone so far as to show complicity with the Serbians in a series of protracted, pointless negotiations through which the Serbians and their Bosnian-Serbian allies have moved off a few inches and then grabbed another foot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week or so, when world attention has been directed towards the fate of very badly injured children, we have seen the spectacle of the United Kingdom, after refusing to take any reasonable number of refugees&mdash;unlike Germany and a number of other European powers&mdash;getting a lot of television time for evacuating a few people who had been very badly injured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the situation is that over a period of time, unfortunately, the comments of the Tanjug news agency of Serbia, formerly of Yugoslavia, as stated in May this year, will prove to be correct. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bosnia will go down in history as the state that never existed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the fundamental reality we are facing. From August last year, when the London principles were announced that there would be no border changes by force and that borders in the areas that were held would not permanently be held by that forceful taking, we have seen a very steady deterioration of the picture in Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has gradually gone through threats, constant claims that this or that would happen, that these embargoes would exist and this military action would be taken, et cetera, and the whole time there has been a very cynical exercise by the Serbian leadership, which has been controlling its confederates within Bosnia from behind the scenes. There has been a continuing deterioration in that negotiating position. It got to a point at one stage where the Vance-Owen proposals encompassed a 10-province idea, basically colluding with the concept that in actual fact, as I said, there had been a deterioration of the position from the previous year when they said there would be no changes by force. They colluded to the stage where they said that Bosnia should be stripped apart and that this UN recognised country, this country recognised by the European Community, should be split upon ethnic lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the situation now is that the Bosnian Muslims control about 10 per cent of the country. It has been gradually strangled by Serbian forces. Throughout this time, I think the Serbians have had reasonable grounds for a great degree of confidence that, at the end of the day, there would be a lack of will, there would be a lack of determination and a lack of cohesion between the various forces in actually doing anything about it. </PARA>

A number of the Islamic states, particularly Turkey and Pakistan, have taken a very responsible attitude facing internal criticisms for their failure to do anything about the situation.

Regardless of the other reasons that I mentioned earlier for the actual inability to act, there is a widespread view that the reason behind the scenes is this religious concept. </PARA>

But then it all started to go sour. We saw in the break-up of the USSR some terrible regional conflicts which are still going on.

Since then, as the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) said, I doubt whether we have seen a worse conflict, with such brutality, than that raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina now.

I think the worst thing that is coming out of this conflict is that, even if the Europeans can finally get themselves into a situation where they can cause the conflict to cease, the hatred that this has engendered among the various people living in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the surrounding countries will not be wiped out for generations. Terrible things have been done on both sides&mdash;absolutely horrific things.

Today, the United Nations seems to be unable to fulfil its central role of ensuring security and peace, rather than spending enormous resources to form legal organisations and committees that gnaw away at the sovereignty of its member nations. It has not been, and does not seem to be, able to protect the sovereignty of one of its member nations and, as such, deserves the condemnation of those who view that as a very serious failure of the objectives of the United Nations. </PARA>

The city will be a demilitarised city, governed by a powerful UN administrator to be named by the Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali. The administrator will be helped by an advisory body consisting of four Muslims, three Serbs, two Croats and one other from other minorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems tremendous irony that, in a world that can carry out the negotiations necessary for press crews to roam in a theatre of war and that can film at very close hand the atrocities that that war creates, we do not have the skill&mdash;we have not developed the expertise necessary&mdash;to approach the conflicting bodies and suggest that perhaps the conflict is unnecessary and should cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that perhaps the greatest obscenity of the communications technology we have developed was the reporting that took place in the Gulf War. I am sure that all people recall quite vividly how well we were kept aware of the advance of the Allied troops as they pursued the enemy. As a matter of fact, it would appear that we spent more on getting an army of technicians and television cameramen into the Gulf War region than we did on trying to prevent the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also suggest that we live in a world that has finite resources, both human and material. Does anyone think of the cost of this conflict that is taking place at present, which I believe, and previous speakers believe, is entirely needless? But it is one that I believe the world can no longer afford. War is the greatest waste of resources that the human race has yet devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our nation is increasingly cosmopolitan. We pride ourselves on the ethnic mix of our community and we pride ourselves on the way that we live in harmony. I am sure that everyone in this House on both sides hopes that that is the way that our history will continue forever. It also gives me a great deal of pride that this private member's motion is being supported by representatives of both sides of the House because that, I believe, truly represents the democratic nature of our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it is the duty of our country to use whatever good offices and means it has for convincing the conflicting parties that there should be a halt to the atrocities that are taking place today. One of the previous speakers mentioned that Sarajevo was a host to the Winter Olympics. This increases the obscenity of this particular war. As our country is looking forward to being the host nation at the turn of the century for the Olympics and all that they stand for&mdash;bringing people together, doing away with the idea of conflict and promoting the idea that we should all be living in harmony&mdash;the town that was the host of the Winter Olympics, which spread that philosophy throughout the world, is now the town that the world is focusing on in such a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we are about to go into spring. We are looking forward to a very happy summer. The people of Sarajevo are not doing that. They live in an extremely cold climate. Let us hope that they do have homes; let us hope that they have food; let us hope that we can bring whatever offices we can to bear to prevent this conflict so that by the time they are in winter the children that we are continually seeing on our television screens will have a home, a family, clothes and are suitably fed to survive that winter. Many of them will not have parents, they will not have loved ones and, of course, some of them will not have limbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have indicated, we must use whatever power we can bring to bear on the United Nations. At this stage, many of us must question its usefulness. It certainly appears that the attempts by the United Nations to cause people to sit down and talk have not succeeded. It certainly has not succeeded satisfactorily to this stage. It appears that there has been a breakthrough overnight but at this stage it is too early to predict the outcome of that. But I sincerely hope&mdash;as I am sure every other speaker does&mdash;that it will have the desired effect and that in a very short period of time this all will be history, it all will be past, and our country will be able to participate in helping Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs, the Croats, to go back to their homes and rebuild their lives so that they too can participate in what we all hope will be a very healthy and useful part of the European Community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, while the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was presenting the budget, I thought that this was no longer the lucky country. However, whenever I read the papers or watch the television news and I see the tragedy being acted out in the former Yugoslavia, and in particular in Sarajevo, I know that we are lucky to be living in a place that is as safe and as free as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter the other day from a constituent in Stirling concerning the anguish that is Sarajevo. All honourable members would be aware of the little girl from Sarajevo, Irma Hadzimuratovic, who was taken to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital in a medical evacuation. The constituent wrote to me asking what we were going to do to help people such as Irma. In her letter the constituent asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are we a nation so oblivious to the plight of these victims of war that we will sit on our hands and do nothing and just watch these people die?</PARA>
<PARA>We do live in another place, we do represent different people, but we can still take some responsibility in this war; a war in which innocent women and men, girls and boys are being mercilessly slain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members pick up any newspaper or turn on any news bulletin they will see continuing reports of the crisis, and it is getting worse by the day. Words cannot express the anger we should all feel at the awful loss of life being experienced in the world we share with the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is time that something was done. Even though we are a small nation, if we can do anything at all in our power it must be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One article I was reading recently brought home the message that it is time we acted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine of 26 July contains photos taken by a Bosnian photographer. The pictures were something I never expected to see in my lifetime, and certainly something I hope never to see again. The first photo in that particular piece of photojournalism was utterly chilling. It showed a mother and her child lying dead and bloodied, killed by a Serbian bomb. It is not an uncommon sight in that place, and it fits in with the photographs of burning buildings, hospitalised lovers, and the members of a family sitting around a fire in their bombed-out home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can go on about photographs in magazines and articles describing the situation, but that will not heal the pain or the suffering of the innocent victims of this cruel war. Words will not rebuild the destruction caused by this war, and words will not reincarnate those people who have lost their lives in this catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad fact that more outrage and concern was expressed for the animals in the reported stories of zoo animals starving or being killed for food in this godforsaken part of our world, than for the massive suffering and loss of the planet's supposedly highest life form, our fellow human beings in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is time action was taken: action to help the children live; action to stop this war&mdash;even if it means using force to stop it; and action to rebuild a nation which has come crumbling down in the wake of a grab for power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address individually each point of the motion moved by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). I do not think anyone, anywhere, could do anything but deplore the loss of life being suffered by the citizens of the sovereign Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It does not matter whether they are men, women, children, Bosnians, Serbs, or whoever, being killed; the fighting is wrong, and the resultant deaths are a tragic circumstance of this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that a conclusion cannot be reached. It has taken so long that I would not be optimistic of one being reached now. In view of that, it is time for other countries to bite the bullet, accept responsibility and intervene. Our failure to do so, as I was reminded in that letter from my constituent, would make us a party to the murder, the maiming, and the destruction. As she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we stand by and do nothing, should we not accept some of the responsibility for what follows?</PARA>
<PARA>I might add, if we do stand around and do nothing, what follows will be more deaths, more maiming and more destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the second point of the motion that the United Nations is experiencing some difficulty in protecting the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, letting the UN, in its present form, take control of the situation is like letting David take on five Goliaths. The UN's hands are tied behind its back and we are relying on it to resolve a problem which is further from resolution than at any other stage in the whole conflict. It is for that reason that I endorse the second point of this motion and that we support calls from the international community, including the United Nations, to take decisive action to end the continuing bloodshed and suffering in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Decisive action is a quite far-reaching statement. It can include anything from our parliament and parliaments throughout the world condemning the conflict to actually sending in our own joint forces in an action supported by the United Nations to take control of the situation. I would hope and pray that parliamentary condemnations will work but I fear, indeed I know, they will be absolutely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk about this until we are all blue in the face but our words mean nothing to some warmonger general many thousands of kilometres away. We need to be more decisive than making mere condemnations in this place and in similar places around the world. As a person who abhors the use of violence and as one who believes that war solves nothing, what I say to the House now I find extraordinarily painful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must as a world unite. We must, with a collective voice, condemn the massacre of the innocent victims of Sarajevo and other areas in this conflict. Then we must go further. Even if we are forced as an international community to send in the troops to solve this crisis, even if we must use violence to end the suffering, then so be it; we must do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, the Geneva peace talks which include the in-principle agreement reached by all parties to this conflict to make Sarajevo a city under United Nations protection are welcomed. However, I fear it will not make any inroads into ending the conflict. I fear that the next step must be to send real protection to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We can keep evacuating injured Sarajevians until the cows come home, but they will keep getting killed and injured if we sit back and do absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I am of the belief that we must instigate military action. We have United Nations relief work being conducted. We have the international community assisting with medical evacuations despite allegations of corruption and bribery being made in the midst of this whole ordeal. We have peacekeeping forces doing what they can. Yet, despite all of this, the war continues. Deaths are still occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yugoslavia is no more. It was once a land anyone could travel to and say they had experienced something they would not see for a long time, if ever again. The recent Sarajevo Winter Olympics is proof of how beautiful this place once was. Now no-one will want to go there with or without this conflict. That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is one of the many tragedies of this unforgivable and illogical war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just close your eyes and imagine Australia experiencing the same conflict. Imagine if one of our beautiful towns or cities were being bombed to rubble. If the gutters of one of our towns or cities were running with the blood of our beloved fellow Australians, we could not accept it. We should therefore not expect any other country to suffer similarly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, action to defend Unprofor in the former Yugoslavia so that it can carry out its mandate, the fourth point of the motion, is most worthy of support. Furthermore, the Western world with leadership from the United States, Britain and the United Nations should start preparing to invade areas of conflict. This should state categorically that we want the conflict to end and if it does not we will do everything we can to end it. No innocent person deserves to suffer in the way that those in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been suffering. If ending this conflict means invading and defeating and bringing to justice those who wish to prolong the conflict, then so be it. Let us commit ourselves to that cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I cannot speak highly enough of the efforts of the people of Care Australia. They are fine ambassadors for our nation and we should be awfully proud of them for what they are doing in the war torn areas of the former Yugoslavia. I do not think anyone could put into words the commendation they deserve for their efforts. They have been at the coalface of this war, and it is for them, if for no-one else, that we must vow to do more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this debate is not just another debate and that our government does see that we support any efforts to intervene to prevent the destruction of Sarajevo. It should ensure all encouragement is provided to the United States, Britain and the United Nations to work towards the goal of bringing peace and stability to the former Yugoslavia and ensuring the innocent victims in Sarajevo, and particularly the children with little hope for the future, are defended and cared for.

He was certainly a man who played a very large part in history, and was not a squeamish fellow by any means. On one occasion when his troops wavered before the French army he declared, `Rascals, would you live forever?', as he urged them into battle. The same man said that in his view the Balkans were not worth the bones of one single Pomeranian grenadier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have any message for the Balkans at all, if we have any message for Bosnia, it should be that they must solve their problems. The world cannot, and cannot be responsible for the problems of Bosnia. </PARA>

It was a horrifying experience and it really gets at your heart, but at the end of the day it is something which they must solve. Yet there are armchair warriors in this House wishing to send troops. Do they not realise that a conflict in Yugoslavia on the scale that they are talking about means 100,000 body bags for a start? Why should we impose this on ourselves? If we have any message for these people, it is `Heal yourselves. You must get your own act together. You must realise that you are destroying yourselves'. That is the message that the world should be giving to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asked to call on the United Nations&mdash;but what is the United Nations? It is a drum upon which little nations prance; little nations very often with very little regard for democracy within their own borders. With the security council, it is more the problems of large nations; large nations whose main interest is self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that has occurred in Yugoslavia. I grieve for it. I grieve that the influence of Tito had not lasted for another hundred years, because we may have seen some unity in the country and we may not have seen these ethnic groups warring. Let us bear in mind that ethnically the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs are the same people. But what have we had? We have had misrepresentation in the press universally. We have had this idea that you blame the Serbs&mdash;if you can put all the blame on them, it will go away. This is a nonsense statement. The Serbs are no more to blame than anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was brought home vividly to me when I saw a picture on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of a school with a caption that this was a Bosnian Muslim school destroyed by Serbian soldiers. Two days later I was in a house with some Yugoslavs just returned from Yugoslavia with news cuttings and videos of the news service. And there was that same school&mdash;a Serbian school, destroyed by Muslims. They interviewed the mother and the mother was telling how she had taught this student who had a knife to her son's throat and she implored him not to harm her son. She said, `He smiled as he cut my son's throat'. If I were that mother, I would kill and kill and kill, and all the deaths, all the killing I could render would not wipe out the hate, the despair, that I would feel. That is what we are inheriting, and yet it is suggested that we should send in troops to sort out the problem, which is clearly a problem of their own making and one which they must resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to come into this place and to speak with one's heart on one's sleeve in great compassion. The reality is that if we have any compassion, the greatest compassion we can show is to tell the people of these countries that they must resolve their own problems. We must also make it very clear to them that they must not bring their problems to this country. I must pay tribute to the Yugoslav community generally. By and large they have not done so, and I certainly hope that there is no attempt to do so in the future. But I say again that it is a problem for them to solve; it is not for our intervention. This is not the deserts of Iran; this is mountainous country easy to defend.

I make no apologies for saying that. The outcome of the Gulf War was to represent this new world order, this world peace. The brave new world, I am afraid, is the same sick world. It is the same sick world where greed and self-interest and hatred reign supreme. It is not about world peace; it is about protecting self-interest. We came out of that Gulf War and everyone said, `It has finished. Never again will the world be at war because the world community will fight to ensure that does not happen'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing at the moment in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is an affront to humankind: it is an affront of the worst possible order. I remind the House of those epic days in May 1945 when the Allies&mdash;the American troops mainly&mdash;came marching through the Nazi death camps. They saw barely alive skeletons; they saw gas chambers; they saw the horrific torture, the mechanisms of horrific torture, and the results of horrific torture, that an ungodly regime, the Nazis, had perpetuated against races right across Europe for nearly a decade. The free world said with one voice, `Never again will we allow such a thing to happen. Never again will we stand by and watch people persecuted, people put to death in their thousands, simply because of what or who they are'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in 1993, as we discuss this matter it is happening again. The people are not Jews in concentration camps; this time they are Muslims. They are not Poles being cut up; they are Serbs, Croats, Bosnians. And it makes no difference who they are, because a Bosnian putting to death a Croatian or a Serb is as bad as a Serb or Croatian or Bosnian doing it to each other.

My friend the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and I were in Europe last year on a parliamentary delegation from this place and we heard first-hand how the Dutch, the French and so many more were not prepared to spill one drop of their blood in the Balkans. But I say to this House that there is a higher call to humanity because it is a European problem. It makes me sick to the pit of my stomach to hear European leaders say, `Why doesn't Clinton do something about this? Why aren't the Americans doing something about this?'. This is a European problem: we are seeing that ancient European traditions&mdash;all the ancient European darkness&mdash;have again resurfaced. There are all sorts of excuses about it, not the least of which is the pathetic one poured out by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie a few minutes ago that Tito held down 25 German divisions, so how hard would it be to stop the crisis?</PARA>

It is something that to us is just incomprehensible. It is easier, however, from the distance of Australia, to pass judgment and to come to conclusions as to just how and in what way the matter can be resolved. I know that a number of Australians have relatives there. Many of those who have come from the Balkans to settle here have retained their allegiance very strongly. Whether it is in sport or in the social and cultural life of their own communities, they have made a mark which is as vital as that of any other Australians. Yet, inevitably, they have been torn by what seems to be the hopelessness of Australia's capacity to be able to do anything positive to achieve a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no easy solution: let us start from that basis. But there are a few things which I feel should have been done and have not been done, in terms of the involvement of Australians and others with the United Nations, to make sure that those things that can be achieved are successful. In this motion that we are looking at, some of them are identified; and I want to briefly refer to them, because in five minutes you cannot say a great deal and I do want to identify a few things that I think have been omitted. </PARA>

One of the tragedies of the Balkans is that, where there is an effort made internationally, we seem to be content to saddle and shackle those who are acting on the world's collective part with only limited capacity to be able to defend themselves. I am horrified to see the number of occasions&mdash;whether because of an inability to land at airports or an inability to take supplies and aid to aggrieved communities&mdash;on which the United Nations has been inhibited because of the lack of military muscle or, if they have the military muscle, their inability to retaliate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is essential and that I am concerned about&mdash;apart from my own concerns on a wider front about the command and control and the interface between the civilian and the military within New York, and the way in which the military commanders in the field seem to be shackled in the exercise of their responsibilities&mdash;is the degree to which we are going to empower a United Nations task force. Whatever its character, it must be able to fulfil its responsibility. I think it is essential that we therefore, within the Australian government, take steps to ensure that, where there is a United Nations task force, we give the commander in the field the power and the capacity to ensure that he can get aid through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that that is not going to solve the problems, but it means that we are at least getting some results from what we are doing. It is appalling that we find that not only are United Nations personnel killed or injured, but that they are unable to fulfil their task. If we are going to send a United Nations force to an area like Bosnia-Herzegovina, for goodness sake give them the authority, give them the fire power, and give them the capacity to undertake retaliatory action, if it so be, in order that they can deliver the relief that is so necessary. That is one thing that we could do which would help please so many of those here who are so aggrieved at what is happening in their former homeland, and please those of us who look on and say, `For goodness sake, can we not do something to relieve the situation?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I wanted to make is that I am certain that we need to look at those young people in Care Australia, for whom I have great regard and great respect: they are doing a tremendous job, not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also throughout the world. We should be very proud of the way they are trying to undertake their tasks in what are often absolutely hopeless circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the future of country Australia under the heartless government of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which obviously thinks that Australia consists only of capital cities. I want to touch on four areas: unemployment, education, transportation and government services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment levels in rural Australia are significantly higher than in the cities. I want to give an example, because I have probably one of the most seriously affected areas in Australia. The shire of Bet Bet, in my electorate of Bendigo, has a jobless rate of 29 per cent. The Bendigo area has approximately an 18 to 19 per cent unemployment rate. I will compare that to some of the city areas. In Melbourne, for example, Coburg has 15 per cent unemployment and in Bankstown, the Prime Minister's own heartland, unemployment stands at around 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has absolutely no answers to the unemployment in this nation, particularly in rural areas. I want to emphasise that because the government has told us quite clearly that unemployment will be no better in 12 months time. It is a dreadful thing for a returned government to say to the public of Australia and the people who are out of work, `We have absolutely no answers to this problem. All we can do is hope that things improve overseas and some of that impact will flow through to Australia and we will be able to see some economic growth, which will create employment'. It is an absolute indictment against the Keating government that it has not addressed this problem. It has avoided this problem now for five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural unemployed people are also seriously disadvantaged by the government's budget and its fuel tax increases. I want to give an example of that. Many areas&mdash;for example, the shire of Bet Bet&mdash;are not well serviced by public transport and many of those residents who are seeking work own older cars. Of course, the moment they hop into that car and drive to an area where they think there might be a job, they are incurring an additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has chosen now to even hit them further with another increase in costs on top of what they are already paying, purely and simply to seek out employment. In country areas they do rely on their cars as a means of travelling to find work and to continue that work. But the government policies that are available now mean there are very few jobs available, and this is a fact that has been admitted by the minister for employment, who should perhaps be renamed `the minister for unemployment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is another major area in which the government has let country people down. The government has encouraged, quite rightly, young Australians to stay at school longer, but it has failed to provide sufficient tertiary places for them&mdash;especially in rural areas. The Latrobe University College of Northern Victoria has had difficulties in gaining sufficient tertiary places for the students who seek them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increases in transportation costs will have a major impact on these students in country areas. They are required to travel long distances to school, to TAFE colleges and to universities. In rural Australia, where the recession we had to have has been particularly severe, moving 16-year-old secondary school students out of Austudy could make the difference between those students continuing their education or joining the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its typical socialist, cynical way, the government has repaid those student bodies which campaigned on its behalf at the last election by increasing the HECS fees and repayments and by making it more difficult for people to attend a tertiary institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transportation is a major factor in country life. The tyranny of distance is something that country people throughout Australia have to contend with every day. They have to contend with the cost of transportation of goods in and out of their area, transportation of their produce to export markets, and even transportation of their children to the nearest terminating point for the school bus. They also have the cost of running into town when their children want to compete in some sporting or cultural event. The increased cost of transport is a continuing and ongoing burden for country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That cost will impact heavily on every country area of Australia. The farmers will have to spend more to bring supplies on to their properties and to get produce off the farm. What a time to introduce increased fuel costs! We are trying to establish ourselves overseas in export markets which are there for Australia to get into, provided we can get our costs down and be competitive on the world scene, and yet the Keating government has imposed further costs on the rural community for the production of those commodities which can be sold on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delivery costs of merchandise into retail stores will rise, as will the price of these items as shopkeepers are forced to pass on the costs to their consumers in country areas. We can expect the prices of food, clothing and other basic necessities to increase, putting yet another burden on the unemployed, the pensioners and the low-income earners in rural areas. As I mentioned before, country people rely heavily on private motor vehicles for transport, but the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is again going to have his hand in their wallets, and they will be harder hit than city people who have access to some public transport networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to speak briefly on government services in rural areas. When it comes to the proper and adequate provisions of government services, country people are again viewed by the Labor government as second-class citizens. For example, unemployed people in St Arnaud in my electorate are forced to travel for interviews to Ararat, a substantial distance, because the Department of Employment, Education and Training does not have the appropriate computer equipment. So yet another difficulty is faced by unemployed people who want to gain an interview when they are genuinely seeking work. The costs for these unemployed people have risen again with the announcement on Tuesday of the budget introduced by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the reduction of government services in country areas is that the government has decided to close the Bendigo District Radio Inspectors Office, along with offices in 13 other districts&mdash;and they are all in country areas&mdash;and replace them with fewer larger offices. That removes the opportunity for Bendigo people to get a speedy resolution of a specific problem involving hearing aids: the interference that is caused to those hearing aids by mobile telephones. It is a very serious problem for people with hearing impairment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grieve that Australia has a government which does not care about the unemployed, pensioners and country people and which does not care to keep its promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I intend to present to the Parliament a petition signed by 1,618 citizens in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker, the Prime Minister, Ministers and members of the Federal Parliament, Canberra ACT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the undersigned citizens view with dismay the recent jurisdictions of `learned Judges' who advise or deliver verdicts on cases of domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We name these Judges who have outraged public opinion as Judge Bollen who advised the jury it was right for a man to use rougher than usual means on a reluctant spouse to enforce conjugal rights, Judge Bland who believes when a woman says `No' to an unwelcome sexual advance, she really means `Yes' and Justice Norman Bryant who decided a rapist (who pleaded guilty) did not deserve the maximum prison sentence because he bludgeoned a 17 year old girl into senselessness, cut her throat, and therefore, in this condition she was unable to experience the hurt and trauma of rape on her person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask your Government to establish a panel of eminent women jurists to establish equity before the law, and propose procedures to re-educate those within the legal fraternity who are unable to relate the spirit of the law to human dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further ask that your Government take steps to ensure a gender balance and ratio by the appointment of women Judges, endorsed by the Attorney-General, to give victims and the community the right to receive a better sympathetic and constructive understanding of the law in accord with natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we, your Petitioners humbly pray that you will act upon these requests as we, in duty bound will so ever pray.</PARA>
<PARA>The significant thing is that that petition was organised on short notice, it was signed by men as well as women and it reached across state boundaries. It was organised by Phyllis Johnson, a resident in my electorate and president of Women in the Community, Dr Genovaite Kazokas and Mrs Edith Hudak, and I pay a tribute to those women for organising that petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also to be on 31 August 1993 a day of action against sexual violence in New South Wales, and that has been organised by women's health centres in New South Wales. The Bankstown Women's Health Centre on that day is organising a planting of trees, commencing at 11 a.m., in the Bankstown old town plaza. The aim of the day is to raise public awareness about the continuing prevalence of sexual violence in our community and the prevalence of unacceptable attitudes which condone sexual violence, particularly against women and children. Importantly, the day in question will allow women to make a public statement against sexual violence, to commemorate the victims of and survivors of sexual violence and to do so in a context that celebrates survival, growth and hope. I commend those behind the day of action and encourage all members of the community to participate in that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) made the following statement at a book launch:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have indicated that as Attorney-General I will be examining the way in which we do select judges to take maybe some of the shroud of mystery out of the process, to make it more open and to ensure that the pool of people which judges are drawn from, where we find our excellence in terms of promotion to the bench, is not confined simply to the ranks of Queen's Counsel or senior members of the Bar, that we do look at academia, that we do look at the ranks of solicitors and indeed the public sector, and I hope through that process that we will see a bench over time more reflective of the makeup of Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not get up in the parliament today as part of a judge bashing exercise. The reason that I am getting up is that before I came into parliament I worked in the criminal justice system, firstly as a public solicitor and then as a public defender for some 10 years. What we need is an educated and informed debate in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem at a federal level is that all of the judges I have referred to that are mentioned in the petition are state appointed judges, so it is a situation where the state attorneys-general, I would suggest, need to come along and cooperate with the federal Attorney-General in the direction in which he has indicated that he wants to take the Commonwealth. Then I think it is imperative that state attorneys-general look at the pool of judges that are being appointed to the bench so that they are more representative of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no questioning the fact that women are under-represented in the judiciary, as indeed they are under-represented in the parliament. This parliament is not representative of the community. We have only a small percentage of women, which is not representative of the community, and that is also true of the judiciary. So we need to enlarge the pool from which judges are selected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would concern me, however, would be using this debate to turn on its head traditional values that have been put into the criminal justice system, and using it to abrogate the rights of accused that have been held for centuries. I do not agree with the response of the New South Wales Attorney-General, for instance, when he says that the problem can be fixed by abolishing the dock statement. He issued a press release on 16 August, indicating that the New South Wales government intends to move for the abolition of the dock statement. It is a reactive proposal, in my view, that really does not go to the heart of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of the cases that I have mentioned in the petition that has been presented to me, the statements were not made by the accused; they were made by judges, either in a sentencing process or in their directions to the jury. Yet the conservative government in New South Wales is using the uproar to further undermine the rights of the accused. The matter needs to be looked at in a calm, sensible and rational environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had an Australian Law Reform Commission evidence report in 1987, and a New South Wales Law Reform Commission report on unsworn statements of accused persons in 1985. In both reports there was support for the retention of the dock statement. The Evidence Bill of 1991 before the Commonwealth parliament and, indeed, the Evidence Bill of 1991 that the New South Wales parliament is looking at proceed on the basis that the dock statement should be retained, because it will be retained not only in these cases but in all criminal cases. The last thing that I want to see is the debate being used to shift the onus of proof onto the accused in criminal trials. But there is no doubt that the statements by each of those state judges that are referred to in the petition have undermined the standing of the judiciary in the community. The judiciary&mdash;and indeed the whole of the criminal legal system&mdash;should not be frightened to be subjected to scrutiny by the community. The debate needs to be balanced but, as I say, debates such as this bring out extremists on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that a lot of the accused in criminal trials would certainly be disadvantaged if the dock statement were taken away from them. I am referring to members of migrant communities and Aboriginal groups. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cross on Evidence</EMPHASIS>, an authoritative book on the subject, has a number of pages devoted to the arguments for and against the retention of the dock statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend those people in the community who signed the petition. As a parliament we need to listen and respond in the appropriate way. It is not just a question of the weight of numbers of people who sign the petitions&mdash;let us not forget that judges do make mistakes. That is why we have appeal courts and that is why there are successful overturnings of convictions or, indeed, overturnings of sentences that are imposed by judges. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that this is about the third occasion that the gallery has been cleared as I rise to speak in a grievance debate. Whilst I will not take that personally, it is perhaps unfortunate because today I am going to talk about unemployment, and unemployment is a serious social problem that does not really get the coverage in the media that it should because it is no longer regarded as newsworthy. It is important that the public understand, whatever one's particular perspective is, that it is an issue of concern to honourable members in this place. Although we may have differing views about what we need to do to redress the situation, nevertheless it is a concern that we are addressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about unemployment and in particular the way I believe this government over the last decade has treated the residents of my electorate of Aston. I say up front that I do not see that the government has treated my constituents on a particularly partisan basis. My seat was created about 10 years ago and for the first six or seven years it was held by a government member. I took it over in 1990, but I believe that, in general, the treatment of my constituents has been unacceptable over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable members an indication of what my electorate is all about. It is an outer eastern suburban seat in Melbourne, about 25 to 35 kilometres from the city. Overwhelmingly, its constituents are young, blue-collar and semiskilled white-collar&mdash;there are not a lot of high-flying people from industry or the academic world. Interestingly, there are very few public servants, and people predominantly are involved in small business, wholesale and retail, and those sorts of activities. It is a rapidly growing suburban area that takes in most of the city of Knox, some of the city of Ringwood and part of the city of Nunawading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years, during this government's administration, we have seen a number of major crises. One of the worst was the process by which interest rates in this country were kept very high for a long period of time, which had disastrous impacts on individuals in the housing area. In a growth area like my electorate, where there are more household mortgage payers than in any other electorate in the country, the devastating effect of high interest rates has been particularly appalling. Equally, the devastating impact of high interest rates on small business has been disastrous. The unique factors in my area, combined with the general economic problems, have generated a very unfortunate impact in terms of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago the unemployment level in my electorate was 1.4 per cent, which is phenomenally low, and it meant that we were a prosperous, hard working local community. In the last 10 years that unemployment level has risen by over 670 per cent. That means there is very considerable distress at a personal level in families: for example, the mature-age breadwinner who cannot pay his mortgage and who has a wife and kids to look after and perhaps no real prospect of getting a job for a very long time to come; the young people coming out of school and who, in spite of all the retraining programs and so on, have no job to go to in the end; or the migrants who come here with high expectations and in fact cannot realise those expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came to this country as a migrant some 16 years ago and I was very fortunate when I came here that we were in a period where I was able to get a job and to prosper and succeed. For those who come here and find that they are in a strange new country and cannot get employment, it is absolutely soul-destroying. I suppose one of my complaints about the government is that a number of the special schemes that it has dreamed up to deal with some of these problems have actually bypassed my electorate. Where there are special funding arrangements we are told, `In your electorate you do not qualify, the councils cannot have extra money or whatever, because your unemployment rate is not high enough compared with other parts of the country'. It seems to me that if somebody is unemployed and living in Knox, they have got just the same sorts of problems as somebody who is unemployed and living in another part of the country that happens by some statistical boundary to have a higher rate of unemployment overall. It seems to me that people living in my area are as entitled to assistance in that respect as anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other difficulties that unemployed people suffer from is what I can only describe as bureaucratic madness. It seems to me that when a person becomes unemployed&mdash;and many people in the last few years have become unemployed for the first time in their lives&mdash;it is a hell of a shock to their self-esteem, to their dignity, and there is a lot of emotional reaction. They get sent from pillar to post in terms of the agencies they have to deal with. They are asked to fill in the same information at different places and they often do not get consistent advice on what they can do and generally the support services have been deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go on and on in that respect. It seems to me that that is an area of government activity that needs some urgent attention to make sure that it becomes much more user friendly, to use that modern phrase, which I think is very important in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn for a moment to the current budget. It seems to me that it is an attack on university students, on Austudy families, on small businesses, and we are all going to suffer in terms of the fuel costs and the increase in wholesale sales tax and so on. What the budget has done is to give us more tax, more committees, but no more jobs because the unemployment rate is not going to change in the next 12 months, and a far bigger debt to boot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saddest thing is that we are not helping small business. Big businesses will not generate a lot more employment. They are into technology and efficiencies and all those sorts of things. But if the 750,000 small businesses in this country were each to employ one extra person then we would make one hell of a hole in that unemployment queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There used to be, a couple of years ago, 6,000 businesses in my electorate but there are probably about 20 per cent fewer now. I have visited many of those that remain. If each of them could provide one extra job, whether it was for a young person or a part timer or somebody who came off the long-term unemployment queue, a mature age person or a woman or whoever, we could start to get this country back on its feet again. Big businesses will not solve the problem but small businesses could. Small businesses are local so there is not the same transportation problems and so on and so forth as there are if we try to resolve it with major projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to small businesses? What has happened in this budget is that we have loaded the costs onto small businesses. They are going to be even less competitive now than they were before and therefore under more pressure rather than prospering and surviving and having the potential to grow and help fix that unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sometimes wonder whether anybody on the government side has ever worked out there in small business to understand what it is really like. We ought to be lightening the load&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UT4">Mr NUGENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the interjection yes. I would implore honourable members opposite to make the point to some of their ministers about what the reality is like. We need to lighten the load that we apply to small businesses at the moment to help them rather than to hinder them. They do not need extra fuel costs to make them less competitive than they have been. We do not need a situation where government is clawing back more money from Telecom and from Australia Post, firms which will pass that on to the public in the form of increased charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things will do damage to our small business base. If honourable members opposite have been out there in small business, as I have been, they will know that that is the truth. It is not a partisan statement, it is a fact of economic life. We need to do more for small business and not load up the costs because by doing that we will kill off more. The unemployment rate is currently at 10.7 per cent and in the budget papers it is forecast in 12 months time to still be at 10.7 per cent. So there is no projected improvement in the unemployment rate. That will get worse because the flow-on effects of the extra costs and charges in this budget are going to kill off a lot more small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would ask the government, I would beseech the government, to think again. I ask the backbench on the government side to apply some pressure to their ministers to change some of the things that have been proposed in this budget so that we can make small business more profitable and we can start to generate some jobs where very quickly we can make some inroads into unemployment. If that were to happen then I can assure honourable members opposite that they would get support from this side of the House as well. </PARA>

All of these things set up the infrastructure of Victoria and they are all being destroyed. Some of the things that have happened in my electorate are small things but, put together, they have a great impact. We were talking about employment before.

It is called `environmental duties'. All of this occurs because of the cuts that Jeffrey Kennett has made in the cleaning area. Our schools are becoming a health hazard in Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today relates to some banks' mortgage insurance policies, which are not worth the paper they are written on. My concern about these policies has been raised by one of my constituents, a Mr Brian Lakeman, whose life, having taken an unfortunate turn as a result of a work-related injury, is being complicated further by the refusal of the National Bank's financial management section to pay out the policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Lakeman, aged 44, strikes me as an admirable character who has handled the immense pain resulting from his injuries with dignity and a courageous spirit. Previously a self-employed bricklayer by trade, Mr Lakeman regarded himself as somewhat of an expert&mdash;despite his lack of paper qualifications&mdash;as he had trained with his father for 20 years. His total experience in bricklaying equated to 25 years, and he was extremely happy with his work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the very fact that he was self-employed that led the National Bank to sell to Mr Lakeman a mortgage safe insurance policy when he took out a mortgage for $35,000, in order that he might finish building a home which he had already started, using his own funds. He insists that, by way of compelling anecdotes used by the National Bank to illustrate the benefits of such an insurance policy, he was convinced by the bank's salesmanship that such a policy was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lakeman's trouble began on 8 November 1990, when the scaffolding on which he was working gave way without warning, causing Mr Lakeman to fall heavily onto a 44-gallon drum. This led to a string of severe medical complaints. The injuries were extensive. Mr Lakeman damaged his lumbar spine, lower left leg, left arm, chest, and the discs in his neck. The injuries were a direct result of the extensive nerve damage he had suffered, rather than being simple breaks or bruising. Despite two operations on his arm and one on his leg, and a series of nerve root injections and epidurals to the lower spine, Mr Lakeman says the improvement in his condition is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He cannot sit or stand for long periods of time and he relies on a walking stick for support, as his ability to move freely has been severely impeded. Psychologically, too, the impact of extreme and constant pain has been tremendous. The constant feelings of burning and aching in his left leg, day and night; the feeling of shock in his leg and of knives and splinters in his feet; headaches, and chest pain, have been devastating. He describes forgetfulness, insomnia, irritability, mood change, depression, hand tremors and tearfulness as a legacy of his injuries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has battled with suicidal tendencies, and has won against all odds and preserved his marriage, which he said had become rocky during his battle with his personal injuries. He has no choice but to avoid heavy activities&mdash;chores which we might detest, but which we take our ability to do for granted&mdash;such as gardening, mowing the lawn, or lifting the shopping. Every step and every movement has been a struggle with pain: much of Mr Lakeman's day needs to be spent resting to ease that pain&mdash;although lying in bed, or sitting for longer periods of time, do, as I have already said, exacerbate the pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coping with chronic pain has been a stressful experience for Mr Lakeman, exacerbated by the problem with the bank, to which I will come shortly. It was recommended that Mr Lakeman undergo further psychological assistance to improve his emotional functioning, and to teach him to deal more effectively with his chronic pain and to view his future more positively. Like anyone who can feel the pain and suffering of their own injuries, Mr Lakeman felt confident that the opinions of medical experts would be of the unanimous view that he was totally and permanently disabled and unfit for any meaningful employment for an indefinite period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, with a mortgage insurance policy which was, after all, sold to him on the basis that it would cover him in the event of such an accident, Mr Lakeman was confident that he would be financially secure with the payment of the policy; but he could not have been more wrong. Mr Lakeman's own specialist has stated emphatically that further improvements in Mr Lakeman's condition are unlikely. This specialist, having conducted an extensive range of tests including CT scanning, lumbar myelograms and isotope imaging, bone scanning, epidurals and nerve root injections, was conclusive in his view that Mr Lakeman's multiple injuries&mdash;including blood pooling in his left leg which could lead to an explosion of the muscles&mdash;were permanent. It was, in his opinion, most unlikely that decompressive spinal surgery would have a bearing on Mr Lakeman's pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Medical Officer who assessed the medical evidence, in order to process Mr Lakeman's claim for a disability support pension, reported that he was manifestly unfit for any form of work at all, including light clerical duties. The DSS deemed Mr Lakeman to be 48 per cent disabled, and he had no difficulty in obtaining that pension. His mortgage safe policy, however, was an entirely different matter. Mr Lakeman's battle with National Financial Management, through the National Australia Bank, has been going on for more than two years now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the small amount of money the bank's own policies appear to cost the client, they are, in most cases, cheap and nasty contracts which meet the need of the bank and not those of the client. In these tough times, with more and more cutbacks being made in important service industries such as banks, incompetence and a failure to provide full advice to clients have resulted. When consumers are basically ignorant of the mortgage or lending procedure, this places them literally at the mercy of banking staff; and their failure to consider taking independent financial advice&mdash;or the lender's failure to recommend it&mdash;can be the start of all their problems. This lack of advice, I feel, is completely inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition for business amongst banks is fierce, I know, but underhand sales tactics should not be tolerated. Consequently, as more claims arise as a result of personal injury or loss of income through other means, disputes such as Mr Lakeman's are becoming more and more common. Alarmingly, in the event of such income loss, less than two per cent of these policies are ever paid out. The insurance companies and their doctors come up with every possible reason why the policy should not be paid and why the insured party can reasonably expect to return to some form of income-earning activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of my constituent, the doctors who assessed him for the insurance company&mdash;an orthopaedic surgeon, a consulting orthopaedic surgeon, and a neurosurgeon&mdash;found that there was insufficient injury to Mr Lakeman to warrant a payout of the policy. Their vague explanation was that Mr Lakeman's condition would probably improve in time, although they had difficulty arriving at a definitive objective diagnosis. They agreed that it was hard to state whether Mr Lakeman would be left with permanent and total disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when Mr Lakeman sought to obtain a full copy of the reports to discuss with his own physician, he was stonewalled. The response from National Financial Management was that, as the reports were obtained on the understanding that they remained confidential between the company and the doctors, it was not possible to release the reports in their entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incredibly, the three doctors, from what can be learned from the release of partial information, found that Mr Lakeman was not totally incapacitated for other forms of work, that nerve damage was not responsible for Mr Lakeman's pain, and that he could walk about quite freely without obvious impediment. That is something that, as I have seen with my own eyes, is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, they acknowledged Mr Lakeman's inability to return to his usual occupation as a bricklayer. On those grounds, one might reasonably have expected that the loss of income from the usual occupation of the insured would have resulted in a happy ending. However, 10 years ago Mr Lakeman owned a video shop for less than 12 months and the insurer argued, and has continued to argue, that it would be appropriate for Mr Lakeman to return to owning a video store. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add further insult to injury, they also suggested that Mr Lakeman, who left school at 13 and has no qualifications, should become a clerk. To quote the National Australia Bank:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Company is of the opinion that Mr Lakeman would be fitted for other gainful employment due to his previous training, knowledge or experience.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lakeman and his doctor found this to be a totally implausible statement, as he can neither sit nor stand for long periods of time and his leg requires rest by elevation on a constant basis. The general interpretation of the bank's intention as encapsulated in this statement was aptly interpreted by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> reporter, Michael Holmes, to be that the bank will only pay if Mr Lakeman is unable to do any of the work the insurer thinks he is suitable for, and that could be just about anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, with the insurer's fixed opinion that Mr Lakeman could become a video store owner or a clerk, no payment has been made. Mr Lakeman is naturally very bitter, as the policy clearly stipulated in its definitions that permanent and total disablement means:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total inability of the Insured as a result of the Insured:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">sustaining accidental injury; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">contracting sickness or disease</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">from carrying out all of the normal duties of his or her usual occupation for a period of at least six (6) consecutive months and the Company being of the opinion that the Insured is unlikely ever to be able to follow his or her usual occupation for which the Insured is fitted by training, knowledge or experience.</PARA>
<PARA>Total disablement is further addressed in section three of the Mortgagesafe policy, again describing loss of the ability to perform the normal duties of one's usual occupation as the result of injuries sustained as a likely scenario for payment. However, the subsequent references to the need for certification of permanent and total disability by a legally qualified medical practitioner approved by the company have proved to be the most problematic in resolving the dispute and attempting to recover payment of the $35,000 policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in the view of the Commonwealth Medical Officer and Mr Lakeman's own doctor the case is so clearly cut and dried, it is incredible that the insurer has managed to obtain entirely contradictory medical opinions from its own doctors in an effort to evade payment. The question Mr Lakeman has asked, which seems perfectly valid, is why insurance companies can obtain the reports from other insurance companies with respect to the medical details of a policyholder&mdash;and that occurred, as alleged by Mr Lakeman&mdash;whilst simultaneously informing the policyholder that reports are confidential as a matter of standard practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he is correct in this allegation then Mr Lakeman feels that the assessments by the insurance doctors have completely negated the professional opinion of his own doctor. The cost of all this to Mr Lakeman has been a blow-out of his initial mortgage to $38,500. Mr Lakeman's income, which at one time peaked at around $2,000 per week, is now so paltry that it has little bearing on the mortgage. At least Mr Lakeman's wife has an income which is enough to pay the interest on the mortgage, but this is little consolation to the family when it thought it would be protected in the event of a tragedy such as this. This whole scenario demands urgent attention by the National Australia Bank. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Facts rarely influence what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> writes when it comes to shipping.

He just did not understand what he was writing about nor, indeed, did the editorial in the same paper of 16 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which I am a member, last year highlighted the condition of many ships coming to Australian ports. The report, aptly titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, highlighted, as did Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program of 16 May, in graphic detail the condition of many foreign ships. Yet these are the very ships that the vested interests who push for cabotage to be lifted want on Australian waters. Not only are these ships an international disgrace, they are a danger to the coastline of Australia, and a number of them have become coffin ships to significant numbers of seafarers. But such considerations must not be permitted to influence the push by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on behalf of vested interests. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite what honourable members opposite claim, there have been extensive and successful reforms to shipping and the waterfront in recent years. How can the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> talk about missed opportunities and not mention the reforms that have been successfully carried out? When these vocal claims for the removal of cabotage are made, we should look very hard indeed at the calls by vested interests, such as the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the International Bulk Commodities Group, for the relaxation of cabotage and the turning over to foreign flag vessels of the sea link in our domestic transport chain. If this massive distortion of our domestic transport chain were to occur, it would destroy forever the chance we may now have, slim though it might be, to build a truly efficient domestic transport system, but this does not worry those who want to make the short-term quick buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also look at the loss of Australian jobs, the increase in our balance of payments problem, and the damage to our environment and our economy that would result from such a move. Foreign owned ships, like foreign owned mining companies, rightly and properly have a duty to their overseas owners to maximise their own wealth, irrespective of any inefficiency or costs that this might impose on our domestic economy. Introducing a foreign owned link into the domestic transport chain would guarantee that it forever remains a series of separate industrial activities rather than an overall transport system. I believe that it is a right of Australia to carry an appropriate proportion of its trade in its own ships and that we have been denied that right for too long. Australian shipping makes a positive contribution to our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only difference now between Australian shipping and our foreign competitors is that many operate under flags of convenience from tax havens denied to Australians and often their crews do not pay tax. If that handicap were removed by properly structuring the fiscal circumstances of the Australian shipping industry, Australian shipping then would be seen in its true light as an effective, internationally competitive activity. </PARA>

Seafarers work about the same number of hours as a large number of other Australians.

This will be difficult to do in a democracy. I suspect that in order to do so we would have to rely on the solution of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and bring in the troops. It would be much better to choose the path the industry has been following and increase our productivity by totally changing the way in which we manage our ships and the crews operate our ships. </PARA>

I think all this has been confirmed by the budget that was brought down on Tuesday night, which is the worst in living memory, especially for country people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had massive tax increases, despite the government's promises back in February and March that it could do all that it was promising without making any tax increases at all. In fact, the taxes in this budget have gone on the poor. They have hurt, in particular, the true believers. They are certainly going to hurt the productive sector. While I think the Australian people would have accepted a tough budget, they would have accepted it only if it were tough in the right areas. The government has done nothing to wind back its profligate spending in non-productive areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can highlight a few of these areas. We are going to have unleaded petrol go up 5c a litre and leaded petrol by 10c a litre. I would just like the government to reflect for a little while on what this means to country people. In my electorate of Parkes most people who buy petrol are already paying 10c to 15c a litre more than their city cousins. They might be paying 75c a litre before the budget in Dubbo, 80c a litre in Broken Hill, and 85c in other more remote parts of my electorate. These people not only have to pay more, but they have to buy more petrol because they travel much further, with the greater distances out there, than somebody who lives in, say, Sydney, Melbourne or Newcastle. They have no public transport that they can resort to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps most cruel, because it is hidden, is the fact that freight costs are going to go up for country people. That will impact on the goods coming in, which will be built into the price of Kellogg's cornflakes and everything else we buy as well as the produce going out. Country people produce much of the export income wealth for Australia. So they are going to suffer a double whammy in that effect on their increased freight costs that they can look forward to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can compare this with the coalition policy at the last election. We were promising to reduce the price of petrol by between 19c and 26c a litre. Since the budget and after the increase, people are going to be worse off by somewhere between 29c and 36c a litre. Someone who may be paying, say, 76c today in Canberra, or wherever, could have been buying their petrol probably for 40c-odd a litre, had we won that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the proposed increases, someone who has the average 60-litre tank on his leaded-fuel car will have to cough out an extra $6 a tankful. If he lies in that under-$23,000 income bracket and if he is lucky enough to have a job&mdash;and 60 per cent of workers are in that bracket&mdash;the government is going to compensate him by slinging him an extra couple of dollars. That will go a long way, I am sure!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners, in particular, will be hurt. I have just had a fellow ring from Eumungerie this morning who is on workers compensation for an injury he suffered. He has to complete a 100 kilometre round trip to his physiotherapist once a week. His compensation payments do not go up as a result of this increase in the price of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we must not overlook that it is going to impact greatly on local governments, particularly in country areas where they use massive amounts of fuel and pay the full government charge. Many of the shires in my electorate have a rating base of only something like 1,000 to 1,500 ratepayers, and yet they will be forced to pay out extra tens of thousands of dollars with no compensation from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the worst areas of the budget was the savage cuts to road funding. The federal government is kicking in about $1,600 million at present, but it is going to take off $608.3 million next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful. That is a decrease of 37.4 per cent. And what is the government going to do the following year? Take off another 20.3 per cent, or $206.6 million. So over the next two years this government is going to more than halve federal road funding. That is almost unbelievable in a country as vast as this, where the roads are falling apart in some areas because of the cutbacks that have already taken place under this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optometry has received much publicity since the budget. The government is going to take the initial consultation out of Medicare and it will now cost $49 for the average family, regardless of income, to go to an optometrist. I say to the government that this is a false economy. Optometrists often pick up problems at an early stage when people go to them to have their eyes examined. They pick up things such as glaucoma, diabetes and hypertension, as well as vision problems in children which lead to learning difficulties at school, and they will refer people on to an ophthalmologist. However, I fear that fewer people will attend optometrists after this. One optometrist constituent in Dubbo in my electorate who employs eight people says that he believes his consultations will fall off by 20 to 30 per cent, and he will probably have to put off two or three of his employees. Of course, people who make frames and lenses also will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disappointed to see in the budget that the rural adjustment scheme grants are projected to fall by almost $100 million in the coming year, from $151.7 million to $53.2 million. That is going to impact greatly on farmers in difficulty. The wool industry in particular was hit for six under this government. Wool promotion funding, which had already been reduced to $20 million a year, is to be abolished totally at the end of this financial year. As stated in the budget, and as I highlighted in question time yesterday, the wool tax is to increase from 8 1/2 per cent to 12 per cent. That is absolute madness, yet the minister did not seem to be aware that this was in the budget papers. This increase, which is listed in the budget papers, directly contradicts what Ross Garnaut recommends in his report on page 106. He says that the 4 1/2 per cent component of the stockpile reduction levy could be done away with and, when the stockpile is sold off, there is a greater than 50 per cent chance that a surplus would result. So why the minister is proposing to actually increase the tax, at a time like this when woolgrowers are on their knees, is quite beyond me. </PARA>

The budget papers on page 3.11 say that the extra tax collected will go up by $95 million a year; page 3.169 says that the extra tax collected from the increase will amount to, I think, $80.6 million; and on page 4.6 the wool tax increase is going to be $68 million&mdash;so pick which figure is the accurate one. It is very confusing for woolgrowers to sift through this material to try to find out what the truth is, and the minister should make a clarifying statement as early as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, in the election campaign the government made the most ridiculous promises about tax cuts and said that they could be kept without raising taxes. Of course, all was revealed on Tuesday night when the Treasurer brought down the budget: the government has cut out most of the tax cuts and made massive increases in indirect taxes. It says it is going to introduce the rest of the tax cuts after 1998, I think. For goodness sake, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the rest of us will probably be on a pension by then. That is just code language meaning that the government is never going to bring them in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax is actually projected to increase by $32.2 billion over the next four years. Compare that with $5.4 billion over the last four years and we can see what this government is up to. Because of the indirect tax increases, we have ended up with a poor man's GST, without any compensation for those on low incomes and without the benefits of a GST. In fact, Ross Gittins in an article this morning makes the very good point that, by his calculations, this government is going to increase indirect taxes by 50 per cent more than we would have done with a GST. I would like to see more people pick up that particular point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The late Lionel Murphy was a great liberal democrat, a great visionary and a great humanist. One of the outstanding visions that he had was his concern that the opportunity be taken to both humanise and civilise the breakdown of marriage and the divorce proceedings that are associated with it. Many of those visions of Lionel Murphy flowed from his confidence in the capacity of people to respond properly if they are provided with civilised and sensible structures within which they can pursue their own interests and resolve their own problems. He sought to minimise the trauma and the concept of fault involved in divorce, to simplify the procedures and to abandon all of the legal trappings associated with it. An essential part of that humanising process was to remove divorce proceedings from the legal bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the great humanist who thought to give effect to that vision, the vision has finally been laid to rest. One could be forgiven for claiming that the vision has been betrayed. Nowhere is there better evidence of this than in the almost completed physical monstrosity on the corner of Castlereagh and Goulburn Streets in Sydney, that building costing $65 million to provide what is referred to as the centre for the Family Court. It is an intimidating building; it is an impersonal building; it is sterile; and it is part of the bureaucratic legal structure in Australia. It is everything that Lionel Murphy did not want to see, everything that he wanted to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jim McClelland, who was also a senator at the time that Lionel Murphy was the Attorney-General, was the chairman of the Senate committee that put together the legislation that gave rise to the Family Law Act. But what has happened over the past 20 years is that, by a process of gradualism, the court has achieved the status which Murphy's vision would have denied it. The judges sought and achieved equal pay with Federal Court judges. They wanted to achieve equivalent status. The court professionals are back into their wigs and their gowns. Layer has been laid upon layer of legal and technical complexities and, of course, a very profitable legal industry has developed around the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have the physical evidence of its coming of age, of its achieving its place within the judicial establishment&mdash;the provision of its own home, its own palace, its own symbol of elevated status.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As problems have emerged, they have not been resolved by streamlining and simplifying the procedures but by adding to their complexity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this case worse is that the minister is only making these threats because the Labor Party uses student guilds as training grounds. By making student guild membership voluntary, the guilds will be made more accountable and answerable to students. The guilds will be forced to truly represent their students if they want to attract members. Quite simply, if they waste students' money or partake in campaigns with which students disagree, then the students will, quite rightly, have an avenue of protesting through resigning their membership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!  It being 2 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. Before I proceed to questions, I would like to make a short statement to the House. With honourable members' collective minds firmly focused on the budget, I wish to take this opportunity to hopefully finally lay to rest some allegations regarding the availability of seating for the Treasurer's speech on budget night, Tuesday, 17 August 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 13 August 1993, it was reported that the Australian Labor Party was proposing to offer, for a fee, a budget package variously offering accommodation, access to ministers and, of particular concern to me, `specially arranged seating in the House of Representatives'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report prompted comment from both media and opposition members. The honourable member for Mayo is reported to have said Labor MPs were behaving like ticket touts. The honourable member for Bennelong is reported to have said he was particularly concerned, as Manager of Opposition Business in the House, about the Speaker's role in canvassing the sale of reserved gallery seats. The honourable member apparently went on to say on ABC radio that to auction gallery seating in order to raise money for a political party was a `tawdry abuse of that privilege'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member indicated that I had written to MPs recently asking them to notify my office if they were not going to use their tickets so they could be made available to others. He indicated that he wanted to know whether I had been aware of the ALP fundraising proposal at the time, and apparently said the whole affair raised questions about the impartiality of the Speaker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ryan, in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Times</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 17 August 1993, is reported to have said that for $3,000 `a privileged few' would receive special reserved seating in the House of Representatives chamber. Today in the Senate, in debate on a motion dealing with this issue, Senator Michael Baume referred to `specially arranged seating' in the House of Representatives chamber, and sought assurances on the availability of seating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to inform honourable members of a number of facts. First, the allocation of seats for the budget was in accordance with practice of previous years and that of previous Speakers. The 352 seats in the Speaker's galleries were allocated whereby each honourable member received two seats. The balance was distributed to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, a further 176 seats were available to the public through the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms. Bookings were accepted for 73 seats, with a maximum of five seats for each individual. The remainder of the seats were allocated to members of the public who were required to queue for those seats. Third, honourable members were advised that the allocation was not automatic: each honourable member's office had to make a request for the seats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, a list was kept of all honourable members requiring more than two allocated seats. Any spare seats available after bookings closed, and that was a week before the budget, were allocated to those honourable members in the order the requests were received. Some 52 seats were allocated as a result of this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth, a note to which the honourable member for Bennelong presumably has referred was sent to all honourable members on 9 July 1993 reminding them of the obligations in respect of booking gallery seating for Question Time, and on occasions such as opening day and budget evenings. Honourable members were requested to inform the Speaker's office when tickets previously booked were not required so they could be reallocated. In this way maximum use of the galleries would be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixth, no request for, or any allocation of, `special seating' to accommodate business people as mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article was received by or was made from my office. Seventh, I was unaware of any proposal from any political party to use budget night seats as part of any fundraising package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of my extreme concern for the innuendo and unfounded assertions regarding my office's allocation of budget night seating, I undertook extensive inquiries to ascertain whether any precedent may have existed which would have given rise to such obvious indignation on behalf of opposition members and some media. To my great surprise, my research revealed that indeed there had been a precedent, and that the fundraising event attributed to the ALP was not even an original idea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 September 1984, the then honourable member for Macquarie drew the House's attention to a letter and brochure sent to a broad cross-section of the community by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong. It was subsequently reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 7 September 1984. In that letter, as a postscript, the honourable gentleman had penned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I wish you could all visit Parliament House at Budget time, that's obviously impossible so I have asked my Committee to consider ways of three couples to be present on Budget Night as our special guests.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 3 of the brochure, which apparently accompanied the letter, under the heading `A truly unique experience' was the offer. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Feel the heartbeat of Parliament House on Budget night as the special guests of Andrew Peacock and the Liberal Party. Three lucky couples will win an all expenses paid trip to one of the world's exciting cities at its most exciting time.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You and a companion could win this exciting trip simply by supporting Andrew Peacock's campaign. Complete the coupon and post it together with your donation of $30 or more in the envelope provided . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps inflation has caught up. I reiterate that access to the galleries of the House of Representatives is open to any visitor to Parliament House at no charge. It should not be for sale, auction or raffle. Under standing order 313, honourable members are entitled to two seats in the gallery for visitors. I would expect that honourable members act responsibly in the distribution of those seats. I trust that this matter is now finally consigned to the dustbin of fundraising history.</PARA>

Firstly, to offset the tax increases, this man would get a tax rebate of $100 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He would also be compensated through increases in family payments. These payments are considerable. A family on this income and with three children would get $124 a week in family payments. If they are renting, they get an extra $42 a week. That is a total of $166 a week that that man and woman would receive. As well as that, from the budget, that woman at home would receive a home child-care allowance of $30 a week or $60 a fortnight.

I noticed Ross Gittins in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning fulminating about equity. He could have mentioned the $10 billion&mdash;the $10,000 million&mdash;in cuts to government spending proposed by the opposition to fund the tax cuts, which would have cut the family allowance supplement of $124 a week to pieces. There has always been opposition from those on the other side to extra support for renters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the remarks of Senator Coulter, a Democrat senator in the Senate, in the debate yesterday on that infamous resolution passed by the Senate. I have to say that I agree with Senator Coulter's conclusions. That piece of advice that he gave us, albeit advice given with a bit of commonsense from his point of view in terms of what he was prepared to support in the Senate, was firmly tendered on the basis of the impact he knew the Senate resolution would have on the proceedings of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just make clear for members of the House the impact of that Senate resolution. That Senate resolution states that all bills that this government wishes to have passed this session&mdash;that is, all the things that we consider of sufficient urgency to get through this session, and its budget legislation is included among that&mdash;must be introduced in this place by 1 October. The bills, having been introduced by 1 October, must be out of this place by 29 October&mdash;a couple of sitting weeks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members have had a great deal of experience concerning how much legislation the government considers is important in each session, including the budget session&mdash;and they are correct in knowing this&mdash;there are some 100 pieces of legislation to be introduced by 1 October and 100 pieces of legislation to be out of this place by 29 October. This, from the Liberal Party's point of view&mdash;because it is the Liberal Party that imposed this&mdash;is supposed to be good government. I have had to sit in this place and hear unctuous moralising from opposition members about how important they regard the House's consideration at the end of the session when we bring in the guillotine to deal with nothing like this level of legislation. They want two weeks worth of consideration for 100 pieces of legislation in this chamber. That is an act of contempt against this place; it is also an act of chicanery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the Liberal Party's position at the end of last year when a similar closure was suggested? What was the Liberal Party's position before the 1990 election when closure was suggested, and it was contemplating itself in the context of forming a government? Did members of the Liberal Party support any restrictions, although the restrictions suggested were much milder than those that they have subsequently passed? Not one whit. They would have not one bit of it; they would have none of it. But now, because their leadership is in a shambles, they have put this proposition through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be consequences. Senator Coulter is perfectly correct, in the generality of it, as to the direction that this government must take. This government must and will devote the activities of the House of Representatives to government legislation for the entirety of the period imposed upon us by the Senate. We will be applying guillotines. We will regard MPIs as hostage to that, and we will take Senator Coulter's advice on what we might do after this time has elapsed.

It is part of the government's strategy to expand job growth in tourism by providing an additional $38 million to the Australian Tourist Commission over the next four years. This extra money will include $8 million this financial year.

The funding will also allow us to overcome some of the problems which have arisen with the changes in the exchange rate with some countries&mdash;for example, Japan. I have noticed one report recently claimed that the golden age of Japanese travel to Australia had ended. I dispute that very strongly because in 1992 we had a 19 per cent increase in the number of Japanese travellers to Australia. So far, in the first five months of this year, we have had a further seven per cent increase in the number of Japanese this year compared to last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always have to ensure that we are providing the right sort of promotional activity that taps into the interests and needs of Japanese travellers.

In other words, we made it a requirement that new cars sold in Australia should run only on unleaded fuel. We made that decision essentially for health reasons. I would have thought that, for health reasons, the honourable medical member, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would have supported it. I would have thought he, more than anyone else, would have been concerned about the deleterious effects on the intellectual capacity of young children who live in environments where they are vicariously subjected to high levels of lead pollution in built-up areas of the cities as a result of the pollutants coming out of cars burning leaded fuel.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now decided to go a stage further and introduce a further measure to accelerate the process of the conversion of the car fleet from leaded to unleaded fuel.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dispute absolutely the figures that have been suggested. I think it is an entirely proper public policy measure for us to encourage the more rapid conversion of the vehicle fleet from leaded to unleaded fuel. We are phasing this in over a couple of years so that people have enough time to adjust to it and prepare for it. I might say to the Leader of the National Party that the estimates are based on a very rapid transfer. I do not deny that there are some revenue implications, but those revenue estimates are based on a rapid conversion from leaded to unleaded fuel. If the conversion were slower the revenue would be higher; but we want the conversion to be quicker.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last December, when the honourable member for Charlton and I made that statement, we did not have before us the report of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Only a few months ago a report from the National Health and Medical Research Council revealed new medical information based on research, both nationally and internationally, which shows that a detrimental effect on children's intellectual impairment is caused by much lower lead levels in the atmosphere than was previously thought. That is the fact that has been revealed to us by the health body that advises government and the community. It has said to us that there is new information available. Therefore, the goalposts have been changed, and it has recommended new goals for the amount of lead in the blood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous goal was set at 25 micrograms per decilitre. That has been moved to 10. Therefore, immediate action is needed. If no action were taken and the phase-out date continues at the progress rate at which it has been moving, we would not have a phase-out of leaded petrol and, therefore, we would have these high lead levels until 2002. What that means is that if we do nothing&mdash;listen to this&mdash;by 1996 33 per cent of children between the ages of nought and four will be subject to levels in excess of that new goal.

It is interesting to note that the rest of the developed world has reduced its lead levels in petrol. As a result of that information that became available to me and the community from the body that advises us&mdash;the National Health and Medical Research Council&mdash;I then convened a group which consisted of the oil companies, the health groups, the community groups, the automobile associations, the unions and the car manufacturers; and they came up with a package that they recommended to government.</PARA>

You as a community must have an education campaign to switch; you must look at the octane levels of cars; and'&mdash;very importantly&mdash;`the experience of other OECD countries has been that we must have a pricing differential'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That the House send a message to the Senate conveying the terms of this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, what we saw in the Senate yesterday was an attempt by the opposition parties in this parliament&mdash;that is, members of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, who are simultaneously members of the Liberal and National parties in the House of Representatives&mdash;to circumscribe and limit the power and prestige of the chamber in which they sit. This is an attempt by the Liberal and National parties to circumscribe the authority of the representative chamber of the country in ways that can only limit substantially the capacity of the House of Representatives to do its business. One could hardly believe that a leader of an opposition, and member of the House of Representatives, could support such a scurrilous attack upon the power, prestige and prerogatives of the House of Representatives by agreeing to such a proposal in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 100 bills are introduced into the House of Representatives in the budget period&mdash;about 80 originate in the House and, generally, about 20 come from the Senate. This resolution takes six weeks off the time in which we can introduce bills. At 1 October, the nominated cut-off date by the Senate, normally only about 20 per cent of the budget bills are introduced. This will mean that six weeks will be chopped off the time in which the House of Representatives can introduce bills and four weeks off our time for consideration of the legislation. So 1 October is the cut-off date instead of the normal time in about the middle of November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result will mean enormous pressure on parliamentary counsel and difficulties in trying to frame decent legislation, given the fact that in this country we do change our legislation often as we upgrade and improve public policy. We have shown a capacity in both houses to understand, firstly, the primacy of the House of Representatives, as the house of the people and the house of government, to be able to do such things where a government enjoys a majority in the House of Representatives; and secondly, that the Senate plays a role of review but should not in any way frustrate the business of the House or materially alter the fashion of its legislative program or its legislative habits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States no such authority can be guaranteed between the executive office of the President and his government and the legislature at the Congress. As a consequence, there are fewer amendments to legislation in the United States, and as a result so much is done by administrative order or by regulation. Often the distorting influence of legislation which lies on the statute books of the United States means that, in terms of the good governance of the United States, it often has great difficulty in governing with the legislative remit which it is given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not been a feature of our parliamentary system. We can upgrade and improve our tax laws, social security laws or environment laws as the government of the day agrees and as the House of Representatives, the people's house, agrees. What may happen here now is that the capacity of the House of Representatives to fashion good law and to write good legislation will be dramatically and massively circumscribed by this inordinately unreasonable cut-off date for consideration in the Senate proposed by Senator Chamarette and supported by the opposition parties in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twice in the half-years leading up to the last two elections, the Liberal Party in the Senate decided to not support such cut-off legislation. When proposed by other senators, they thought, with the opportunity of coming to office and becoming again a party of government, that they would not want to circumscribe their capacity to govern or the authority and prerogatives of the House of Representatives. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen is a sea change in the opposition. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, after five consecutive defeats, there is just an oppositionist mentality; there is no concept of government. The worst of that mentality is in the Senate. Of course, that is where leadership matters. The honourable member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) could have shown leadership and said, `We might have lost the election, but we're not stooping this low, to get into some sort of crazy scheduling problem in the Senate by circumscribing the prerogatives and the power of the House of Representatives, the representative chamber of the country, the people's house of parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of that, he supports these propositions brought by a senator from the Greens Party, Senator Chamarette. As a consequence, what we have today is the authority of the House of Representatives being substantially circumscribed and, of course, the vandalising of the processes of the parliament for good consideration and development of legislation and the reasonable development of proper and responsible law in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this will mean is that the period from now until 1 October will need to be devoted to government business almost exclusively. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) indicated, that can mean that matters of public importance can no longer be considered by the House of Representatives; that we will not schedule matters of public importance by the opposition through this period. If those opposite want to vandalise the houses of this parliament they will not come in   here as vandals and enjoy the privileges they formerly had because the time for that enjoyment will now need to be devoted to government business. The Leader of the House will have other things to say about the scheduling of government business and the way in which the House of Representatives will function now that it faces the vandalism of the honourable member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition,  his deputy and those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens say they are opposed to vandalism. They fight in the forests against vandalism. They say they fight for the seas, they fight in the cities and on the farms, but apparently parliamentary vandalism is okay, particularly when they think they can score a cheap political point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a pretence of respectability regarding this legislation. It was supposed to be that the Senate needed more time for review. Let me just make these points: in the last three sitting periods, going back to the beginning of 1992, only 48 per cent of the Senate's time was spent on government business, 12 per cent was spent on question time and 40 per cent was spent on other business such as MPIs, motions for the suspension of standing orders, general business and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence, therefore, is that, because the Senate is run the way it is run, with opposition senators trying to create as much mischief as possible rather than doing as they are elected to do and considering the legislation of the House of Representatives, only 48 per cent of the Senate's time is devoted to government business. Therefore, a proper operation of the Senate would have meant there was no necessity for these arbitrary deadlines to be introduced for the consideration of government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was supposed to be a haughty pretence of respectability for the consideration of this motion, but we found that, in fact, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) had apparently inveigled Senator Chamarette into this proposal. She met with Senator Hill. However, in the Senate yesterday Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of that, the idea of the double deadline was conceived. I am not sure who was the first to come up with the idea of a double deadline&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate was accused by government members; some have claimed credit&mdash;because it is really quite ingenious.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is Senator Hill saying that this arbitrary and disruptive device is really quite ingenious. That will give people some idea of how sick the opposition leadership in the Senate is, how morally bankrupt it is, how leaderless they are over there without any notion of what is good, decent and proper, and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;who, on two earlier occasions, said no to this tactic&mdash;found with his leadership so weakened that he could now not say no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, he has been pushed around by opposition senators over there and has not been able to exercise any principle. He says he stands on principle, but he never observes principle. In fact, he is now not able to lead the opposition at all. Today, and it is an absolute insult to his leadership, a notice on the media board in the press gallery says that Senator Bronwyn Bishop will present her Budget Address-in-Reply&mdash;with a capital `B', capital `A', capital `R'&mdash;to the Canberra Club at 12.30 p.m. today, and members of the media are welcome to attend. If that is not an affront to the Leader of the Opposition, the same day that he is to give his address, I do not know what is.

And this is all from people who have basically got, in their own right, just a small percentage of a quota to get elected as senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in a statement introduced yesterday by Senator Evans, undertook to see that at least half the bills proposed for passage this session will be there by 21 October. It further undertook to introduce in either of the House of Representatives or the Senate the remainder of the bills for passage by 18 November. It went on to say that the government would have the business of the government evenly spread, with one-third of the bills proposed for passage this session dealt with by 1 October; to have a further one-third of such bills dealt with by 18 November; and to have at least one-third dealt with in the remainder of the scheduled sitting period by 16 December. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to address the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We can always tell when the Prime Minister is in trouble. We can tell when he is having a bad week, when he is delivering a bad budget and when he has been caught out on hopeless management of the parliamentary process in this country for the last 10 years: he always starts to throw personal abuse. The last refuge of the failed politician from the government side is to throw personal abuse. That is what he did: he stood up here and threw personal abuse. He did not present any substantive arguments. It is absolutely typical. When he is under pressure and has nothing else to do, he throws personal abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also spent a lot of time this afternoon talking about leadership. This is a question of leadership. He has had an opportunity for 10 years to provide leadership in the programming of the parliament. We have had 10 years of a parliamentary shambles, 10 years of total disorganisation of the parliamentary process and disgraceful limitations on the time left for the Senate to debate pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will notice that, as is typical whenever he is under pressure, he is walking out. He walks out back to his room and has a sleep. He cannot stand the pressure. He has moved a motion that he does not believe in. He is stunned by the fact that the Senate will no longer be a body that will rubber-stamp his legislation and that he will have to earn his legislation through this parliament, as he should. Anyone who had any sensible understanding of the proper programming of this place would find no trouble with the motion that was passed by the Senate yesterday. They would find nothing wrong with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, is acutely sensitive as well because&mdash;boy!&mdash;does this motion from the Senate reflect on him. It basically shows that he could not possibly organise the legislative program in a responsible way, so it has been decided to set some conditions under which we will get some normalcy, some due process and some regular debate in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House has reduced this parliament to a shambles. Another important element is the broader issue of parliamentary standards. More than anybody else, the Prime Minister, who has just left, has reduced and demeaned the parliamentary standards in the last 10 years. His personal abuse of and disrespect for the Senate&mdash;for example, his description of the Senate as `unrepresentative swill'&mdash;and his total contempt for the proper process that should be given to debate in this place have been demonstrated time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are happy to talk about leadership if he wants to. This is an issue about leadership; it points to the fact that the Prime Minister has failed to provide the sort of leadership that is required to produce acceptable parliamentary standards and procedures in both houses of parliament. He cannot walk away from that basic responsibility. He has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument is being put that the government does not have enough time to get some of its budget bills through. Government members have been briefing the media that they may not have time to get their budget bills through. Why not? If they were running the budget process as a proper process, if they had been putting that budget together over a reasonable period, if they had not left everything to the last minute and just announced a whole host of decisions without any idea how they transfer into legislation, they would not be feeling any pressure by a constraint that asks for these bills to be in by 1 October. If the government were running the budget process properly, taking decisions in due process and developing legislation coincidental with the taking of those decisions, there would not be any constraint and it would be able to introduce those bills into the House in the time that is left between now and the cut-off date and be able to allow appropriate time for debate in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Year after year every budget has been a shambles. Everything has been left to the last minute. We had an example of the shambles on Tuesday when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) obviously did not know one of the key decisions that was taken in this budget on budget evening. As late as 11 o'clock on budget night, he still did not know and his office was ringing the office of one of our backbenchers to find out whether the decision had been taken. That is a clear indication of the sort of shambles that was there in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only got to look at the document, which I will say something more about this evening. But the shambles of that process is what those opposite are showing sensitivity about now. If they were running the place properly, programming the parliament properly and running the budgetary process properly, this would not be a significant constraint. They would have no basis on which to move this sort of motion that the Prime Minister has moved today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that those opposite, and particularly the Prime Minister, hold the parliament and, in particular, the Senate in total contempt. His view of the Senate is simply that it ought to rubber-stamp everything he does. He has never had any respect for the Senate. We have seen in recent days the detail of his secret agenda in relation to the Senate start to ooze out in the context of the so-called republican debate. We know it is part of his agenda either to dramatically reduce the power of the Senate or, if he could, to eliminate the Senate. We have had a number of Labor Party leaders and spokespeople over the last several months making precisely that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, though, that, now that the balance of power has moved in the Senate, the Senate is going to be able to play the sort of role it ought to be able to play. It is, after all, the states house, the house of review. In those circumstances, I look forward to the role that the Senate will play. As to my not being part of this decision making process and not supporting this cut-off date in the Senate, I was there at the beginning. I thought it was a damn good idea because it was about the only way in which we were going to get any sense and order into this place and to do something to contribute towards the raising of parliamentary standards, which are a very big issue out in the broader electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the motion, as it was moved in the Senate, was very simple: to set up a structure to enable both houses of parliament to have reasonable time for debate. I cannot see what those opposite can see is wrong with that intention of the motion. Surely the whole parliamentary process and our whole process of democracy can only benefit. Surely the legislation itself can only benefit from the fact that there is a reasonable opportunity in both houses of parliament for proper debate. To see the Prime Minister move this motion today in the form that he has moved just shows to me the contempt in which he holds the parliament in general and, of course, the Senate in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do make the point very strongly that the intention of this motion was a very genuine one. We are concerned to raise parliamentary standards. We are concerned to make sure that there is reasonable time for debate. We are concerned to ensure that the Senate is not just left to rubber-stamp lousy legislation that has come out of this House&mdash;as it has been forced to do on previous occasions&mdash;to fit in with the whims of the Prime Minister. We want to make sure that this parliament does perform the role it should perform and that debates have the place in this parliament that they should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure those opposite that it is going to be a sharp contrast to what we have seen in recent days, and on previous occasions, in the Senate where there has been a ludicrous limitation on the amount of time that the Senate has had to deal with legislation that has been introduced into the parliament, usually guillotined through the lower house at an incredible rate, with no time left for debate of those very important issues in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's 10 years in office are just littered with dozens and dozens of examples of bad legislation that has resulted from that sort of process. I can think of many instances, for example, in relation to taxation. Quite often the bills that have been brought in have been very detailed and very lengthy. We have had, more often than not, just a few days at most, maybe less, to look at them in terms of the lower house, and there has been very limited time in the Senate. The outcome of that process is that the bill usually goes through with a whole host of mistakes. What happens? Next year there is an amendment bill which comes into the House. That amendment bill is much longer again, picking up all the mistakes of the last year. That is the bottom line of the sort of process that those opposite have run in this parliament for the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we see, when finally we are able to exercise some influence over the programming and pull the government into line and make it start to program this place properly, an acute sensitivity today in the course of question time on the part of not only the Prime Minister but also the Leader of the House, who tried to whip himself into a frenzy&mdash;not an entirely believable one&mdash;to show some sort of concern about this limitation on the government's power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he was at all genuine&mdash;and a lot has been said about motives on our side of parliament today&mdash;and interested in the proper functioning of our democratic process he would welcome this change and use it to advantage within his own party to shake ministers loose, get legislation done in time and allow proper debate in both houses of parliament. I would expect the Leader of the House to welcome this change as a very important step forward rather than feigning indignation, ranting and raving, yelling and screaming, and raising his voice to try and convince us of his concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other feature of the Prime Minister's performance today that particularly offended me was that he was really about intimidation, intimidating not only our side of politics. We are pretty much immune to that. We are used to the barrage of abuse that comes from his mouth on a regular basis. Always when he is in trouble or has had a bad week or needs a diversion, up he gets. He uses words such as `vandal', `wrecker', `spoiler', because he knows that people will put them on the front page of the newspaper. The heading will be: `Hewson is a reckless vandal'. He said that Robert Hill was psychotic. He knows that such words will be picked up and will be run. It is all part of the intimidation to say, `How dare you?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he gets stuck he starts talking about leadership issues and other things on our side of the parliament. We do not take him seriously or at face value. We can see straight through him as, I believe, after the budget most of the true believers&mdash;as they are claimed to be&mdash;on the other side will be able to as well. The intimidation is really about the smaller parties in the Senate. It is really about intimidating the Green senators who have just arrived and intimidating the Democrats. Over the years we have seen the process of the parliament quite often develop with deals being done at the parliamentary level in the Senate to get legislation through. Now that is not going to be as easy because there are an Independent, two Greens, the Democrats, the National Party and us to contend with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a healthy thing for democracy that those minor parties, having won their quota, can play that role. To get up in this parliament today and try to personally intimidate those people and frighten them out of the role they ought to play&mdash;which, after all, they are elected to play under our democratic system&mdash;is an absolute disgrace. It shows just how low this Prime Minister will go to serve his own short-sighted political ends. This man, in 10 years&mdash;first as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister&mdash;has never had any sense of vision or sense of direction for this country. He sees the parliamentary process and his participation in it as a game to be played for his own personal benefit and that of a few of his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has demeaned the parliament, the processes of the parliament and most of the people in the parliament at every opportunity over that 10 or 11 years. He has established a reputation for that. It is always because he sees the process as a game to be manipulated for his own personal ends and for the benefit of his mates. He does not have a sense of direction for this country. He has no sense of vision. We saw the budget brought down. What an amazing document that was. What a budget of betrayal. What an amazing dereliction of his duty to provide a sense of direction for this country in very difficult circumstances. The fact is that he does not care. It shows up in the budget and the sort of approach he took in moving this motion today. It shows up in his attitude to individuals in this House and the other place, and it shows up in his attitude to questions relating to parliamentary standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The man does not care less about what really matters to the people of Australia. He has had questions in the last couple of days about how his budget was widening the gap, for example, between the rich and the poor&mdash;which it clearly does, and I know that is a matter of great concern to the backbench on the other side. I have never seen a set of more ashen faces than I have seen over there in the last few days in this House as ministers have got up and fumbled and stumbled and tried to defend budget decisions, some of which they had known nothing about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the many members opposite who have actually gone out and started to bag the decisions. I would love to be a fly on the wall in caucus when some of the decisions, such as the optometry decision, are looked at. It is going to be pretty important to see whether the democratic process works on their side because a lot of the so-called true believers on their side of politics will not cop this budget sweet. I know a number of them are concerned. It shows just how far out of touch the leadership is&mdash;the Prime Minister in particular. He is showing acute sensitivity to the fact that the Senate starts to play a more effective role in the conduct of this parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the issue is about having debate where he might have to win the issue on the force of his argument, where he might actually have to get out there and defend his legislation, he gets acutely sensitive and just drops down to the only thing he really knows: personal abuse. His performance today stands as a monument to all that is wrong with this government and its attitude to parliament and to the democratic process in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) stands as a monument to his complete ignorance of proper parliamentary procedure and the way in which government legislates. Let me point that out. There were times in his address, at least in the early parts of it&mdash;in the latter part of it he started to rehearse his budget reply&mdash;when he was actually addressing the issues of the proper treatment of this parliament, to which he devoted himself for about five minutes of his 15-minute speech. He effectively revealed support for the resolution. The point he made in the course of his speech was that there has to be proper time for both houses of parliament to consider legislation. This is the opposition's definition of what is proper time for the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

They know because, unprecedently, we have told them in advance about the vast bulk of those bills as a courtesy&mdash;a courtesy we were never given. As a courtesy, we have given them an indication of those bills. They know that those 105-odd bills must now be introduced into the House of Representatives by 1 October and be out of it by 29 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition's definition of what is sufficient time to consider 105 pieces of complex, technical legislation in the House of Representatives is one month. That is what the record shows, and he has amplified it here again today. He believes that one month is a sufficient time for the House of Representatives to consider this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because he felt the balance of power had shifted in the Senate, he went on to say that he could feel in his water that anything goes and that he was capable of using his numbers to do anything in the Senate. I have got news for him, in case he has not noted it in the past: it has always been up to the members of the opposition in the Senate as to the extent to which they will use the Senate to impose particular obligations on this House, and they have done it many times before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were in that position when the so-called Macklin motion was moved, which was a much less restrictive proposition for the House of Representatives.

They did not support the Macklin motion when elections were approaching. </PARA>

No. It indicates that, when members of the opposition feel that they are in a position where they may obtain government, they wish to ensure that the procedures of both houses operate in a way in which sensible legislation and a sensible legislative process are permitted. </PARA>

They do not support these restrictions. When we look at the record, we can come to no other conclusion because that is the position that they have adopted&mdash;twice now before elections. But at other times they have adopted with increasing severity, ultimately culminating in this, a proposition which at first imposed in a churlish way obligations on the House and now imposes in an utterly contemptuous way this set of obligations. </PARA>

The Leader of the Opposition attempted to portray himself as having actually been in the loop on this. Unfortunately, in this very lengthy press briefing of the processes which took place, the honourable member for O'Connor failed to get the Leader of the Opposition into the loop on this act of strategic genius.

But he, of course, was not himself. In the same way as the honourable member for O'Connor deprived the Greens of the dignity of their position in the Senate, he also&mdash;as is also his wont&mdash;deprived his leader of a degree of dignity in the process as his leader scrambled to find himself incorporated within the loop. </PARA>

If he thought laterally about the consequences of what he said and the fact that from time to time he will need to converse with the Greens on these subjects, he might have been smart and left them out of this particular revelation.

It is very difficult for this chamber, dominated as it must be by the executive, to hold up its head in public affairs. This is not simply a feature of the period of office of this government; it has always been so. As a government we have attempted to restore authority to this place by permitting an unprecedented amount of private activity in this chamber.

Now what has been imposed on us? I have been told by those opposite that it is a challenge for me to get the legislation in. So it is, and it will be done; we will get that legislation in. But it will be legislation which will be cowboyed through the parliamentary drafting process. How else will we get 105 bills up by 1 October if we do not cowboy it through? That is what will be done.

After all, it is government legislation that ultimately impacts most heavily upon the population. Parliament does not just have a sounding-board role in relation to issues of the day; it is legislation that counts. Legislation is the most important activity of the parliament. Of Senate time, 48 per cent is devoted to government business, 12 per cent to question time and 40 per cent to perambulating around the place striking attitudes. Instead of the Senate imposing a bit of discipline upon itself and devoting a little extra time to government legislation which it holds so dear and which it says it must consider at such great length, the opposition in the Senate might have regard to the amount of time the Senate spends not dealing with the business of the people of the country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real judgment that this House and the Australian public ought to make about the conduct of parliamentary affairs over the last few years is that the Hawke and Keating governments have shown a monumental indifference to the orderly procedures of the House of Representatives. Everyone knows that on any comparison there are now fewer questions asked during question time. In 1948 there were 75 members of the House of Representatives. In 1993, there are 148 members of the House of Representatives, yet question time has remained the same, at roughly 45 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On only three occasions since federation have we seen a guillotine introduced by a government in the first two weeks of a new session of parliament&mdash;three occasions since federation&mdash;and all three of those occasions have occurred under Labor governments: once under Whitlam, once under Hawke and once this year under Keating. That is redolent of a party that does not give a damn about this parliament. Yet this government has the nerve to come in here and say that the measure taken by the Senate is a terrible attack on the institution of parliament and challenge us on whether we are going to vote in a particular fashion. This is an illustration of its sensitivity to the role of the Senate and it is an illustration of how rattled it is about the adverse turn of political events over the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), as I have said to him on earlier occasions, that we will sit longer, we will sit on more days of the year, we will cooperate with the government in having a more rational legislative program, but we are not going to cop this absolutely phoney nonsense that in some way the Senate is trying to tell the House of Representatives how to behave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has a perfect right to determine the way in which it will process legislation. If under the constitution the Senate has coextensive powers with the House of Representatives, except in relation to certain designated matters, does that not mean that the Senate has a perfect right to say in what circumstances, in what time, through what process and through what procedure it will deal with legislation that comes to it from the House of Representatives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation has come about because the government has lost control of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were the first time that a Senate had flexed its muscles, if there had been no earlier occasion on which senates in our system had exercised their undoubted rights, and if there had in fact been an ironclad convention of the type the Prime Minister would have us believe, then perhaps some of his outrage would sound less confected and would be more believable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the Prime Minister knows&mdash;because he was a member of the opposition executive that resolved on the course of action&mdash;11 years ago the Senate exercised all of its powers to vote down certain budget measures contained in a budget of the former government. I do not remember the present honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) or the Leader of the House saying on that particular occasion that the Senate was exercising powers that it had no right to exercise. I did not hear Senator Murphy, when he led the Labor Party in the Senate, say anything other than extol the undoubted right of the Senate to exercise its powers as a coextensive unit of the federal system of government in this country. </PARA>

They are saying that opposition members will not have the opportunity to properly debate and consider 100 bills if the reality is that the bills have to go to the Senate by a particular date. That is what is going to happen, but that is what they are supporting and that is what they should understand is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a supporter of the green movement for many years. This crazy, impractical resolution of the Senate will only strengthen the arguments of those in the community who take the view that the election of single-issue candidates is not in the interests of democracy. I am not suggesting that Senator Chamarette's motivations were bad in putting this hopeless, ill-considered proposition before the parliament; I suppose the honourable senator merely wanted to lighten her workload and the Senate's workload at the end of the year, but she, and others who supported her, obviously have no experience or understanding of government legislative programs. Whilst the honourable member for O'Connor was obviously very successful in persuading the Greens to put this motion before the parliament, that is no excuse for the Senate trampling on the democratic process and interfering in the way in which this House, the people's chamber, conducts its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there is a log jam of bills at the end of the year. Every parliament in this country&mdash;indeed, every parliament in the Westminster system&mdash;has a log jam of bills at the end of the year. The reason is that there is a budget near the end of the year. Of course, a budget generates a great many bills; that is the nature of budgets. They are bills that are of vital importance and urgency and they must be put through the parliament straightaway. Of course, they have to be drafted. They cannot be drafted before the budget is brought down. As they are drafted, all other bills are put aside for that particular purpose. That creates the log jam and that is what has happened this year and every other year. That is what Liberal governments had to do; that is what all governments have to do. No magic formula has been found in the Westminster system to avoid this particular log jam. Obviously, if there were a solution, it would have been found by now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is for sure: Senator Chamarette's resolution will do absolutely nothing to help the situation. It reminds me very much of the situation when state governments want to avoid traffic jams on their highways, so they build a section of freeway at the point where the traffic jams occur. The end result of that, of course, is that the traffic jam is simply moved several kilometres along the road to the first bridge that needs to be widened. The state government cannot afford to do that, so the traffic builds up with a vengeance there. That is exactly what is going to happen with this particular resolution. All Senator Chamarette will be doing will be shifting the log jam from December to October every year. There will be no gain for the parliament, no advance to democracy in any shape or form, just a simple shifting of a log jam from one month to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, however, has some significance for democracy because we have a chamber of review that deals with legislation only half of its time. The rest of the time we have the likes of Senator Bishop conducting witch-hunts into bureaucrats day in, day out, asking rude questions of people who cannot defend themselves. We also have senators concerning themselves with the minutia of executive government, avoiding the important issues of the day and avoiding the great legislative measures that are being put before the parliament by this government&mdash;getting themselves involved in all of these other things. Less than half of their time is spent on the real work that they were elected to do by people in their states. They are there to defend states rights in respect of legislation, but they are not conducting themselves in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are spending half of their time on other matters&mdash;and that is their right. But I put it to the House that if they wish to spend more than 50 per cent of their time on matters unrelated to the work of parliamentarians, unrelated to legislation, then that is their right, but they should not prevent the government's legislative program going through. If they want to sit during the parliamentary recess instead of going on overseas trips, as most of them do, they should sit and conduct their investigation of minutia then and there. They can conduct all these inquiries into one thing or another that they so like to do then and there. But when the people's house is sitting, and bills are coming through, they have a duty and a responsibility to be sitting there, dealing with that legislation because that is what they were elected to do. However, they choose to deal with it in another way&mdash;by simply telling this chamber that deadlines will be set in a way that interferes with the budgetary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great damage will be done by this resolution. Already the parliamentary counsel is under tremendous pressure in this place because of the great volume of legislation that arises from the budget. By increasing that pressure, those opposite increase the possibility that mistakes will be made in drafting, mistakes that will not be picked up by the opposition because it is not going to have a chance to properly debate these bills, given the nature of this resolution. In the end, the taxpayer will only suffer because, naturally, if mistakes are made under pressure, some things will have to be brought back and dealt with again. So it is not going to achieve anything other than trying to wreck the system of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that has been the role of the opposition. On five occasions this opposition has been rejected by the people of Australia. Of course, it is starting to wonder whether it will ever get into government again. It is starting to question the reason for its existence, as is the Australian public. The opposition was rejected and it deserved to be rejected. But instead of finding some decent philosophy&mdash;they are philosophically bankrupt and leaderless at the moment&mdash;instead of sorting out their own house, the response of those opposite has been to take on the task of wrecking the government's legislative program. This is the opposition's revenge for its rejection by the Australian people. Clearly, the Australian people were right in their assessment of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we have a lame duck Leader of the Opposition. There is outrage that here is the Leader of the Opposition about to deliver his reply to the budget speech&mdash;the key speech of a Leader of the Opposition in the parliamentary year&mdash;and Bronwyn Bishop is down at the press club delivering an alternative leader's reply to the budget speech. At the same time, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is constantly putting out press releases contradicting his leader and saying that his leader is weak on issues or not dealing with issues. A range of other putative leaders, like the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), are running around suggesting that they should be running this philosophically bankrupt political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not get into government in this country by just wrecking and knocking; one has to have some policies. I thought that would have been a lesson learnt at the last election. The Australian Labor Party has policies that relate to social justice and to people's aspirations in this country. That is why we got elected. But those opposite are not going to achieve anything by interfering with a legislative program that was put to the people at the last election, and by interfering with budget bills that are carrying out promises of the government, delivering promises to the electorate. By interfering with that program and treating it with the contempt with which those opposite are treating it at the moment they are not going to win any accolades in the community; they are not going to get any additional electoral support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I used to think that a few people on the opposition benches were parliamentarians in the true sense of the word, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) always played such a role.

Instead, we now see the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;lame duck though he is; threatened though he is&mdash;prepared to use numbers in the Senate to tell this chamber how it should run its business. Then, by implication, he says to his own backbench, `I am sorry; because we are using all these tactics in the Senate, you cannot speak on bills. Your rights as private members will be taken away as we force this chamber to put through 100 bills in seven sitting days'. That proposition is ridiculous. It is also ridiculous to tell this chamber when to sit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been considering a series of proposals that might improve this logjam at the end of the year. We have been looking at bringing the budget forward to an earlier time, and at changing the sessions of the parliament in a way that might get a better and more even flow of business. That has been put before the Senate. The government has proposed to put half of its legislation to the Senate by a particular date, and the rest before another date. The government is prepared to make these compromises. That is a reasonable proposition; it is not unreasonable. The government understands the workload of the Senate, and it is trying to assist. That proposal has been rejected. Instead, the honourable member for O'Connor has been allowed to run riot and cobble together this devious and undemocratic proposition in the Senate. He should not really be doing that. That is not the way for someone to behave who is elected by people to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor and all of his colleagues were elected to represent people, to come into this chamber and debate bills. Now the opposition says that we cannot have time to do that because we have to rush 100 bills through in a couple of sitting weeks. That is a ridiculous proposition and something which this chamber will regret because no credit will come to it from that sort of undignified process. It is an undignified process to rush bills through in this particular manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition has decided that that is the way the game is to be played. It is laying down the rules, using numbers in the Senate to achieve that end. It is playing a despicable role at the moment; it has nothing to do with parliamentary democracy at all. I would be very pleased to listen to the Leader of the National Party explain how a Senate laying down rules for how this place is to be conducted can assist the democratic process in any way. It does not. It  only creates and aggravates problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can see the tensions that have been caused by this particular motion. That is not good for the parliament; it is not good for the decorum of this chamber in any shape or form. It will be a lot worse in October as we roll through those 105 bills&mdash;bills that are essential because they are part of the budget process that cannot be drafted until the budget is delivered and debated. Those bills must go through this year. There is no alternative to that. We have had a program which has been in place for a long time. One cannot tear up the way executive government is conducted, nor can one tear up the way in which the program of the House of Representatives is conducted. In short, the opposition will create a rod for its own back. This is a decision that it will regret sooner rather than later. In the end the whole process will be demeaned by what is a very cheap Wilson Tuckey stunt. </PARA>

On immediate reflection I realised this. I have apologised to the honourable member. I believe it appropriate that I should do so in the House.</PARA>
<PARA>Compare that quite magnanimous apology to Mr Spender by Mr Hawke, who is a giant of a man compared to the front bench opposite in this Labor government, to the squirmish, wimpish quivering apology that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave here today in response to my question to the Speaker in relation to a very similar incident relating in part to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). That is how much the standards of parliament have changed in eight years.

I simply read the title of the list: `Measures of an economic or financial nature including taxation and appropriation bills which have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party in whole or in part by vote in the Senate since 1950'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the thrust of the motions and the discussion at hand, let me reveal to the House how many days sitting in total the government had scheduled for the House in this budget session between now and the end of the year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have some really very bad news for the public of Australia in all of this. Not only does the public have an absolute right to be absolutely angry about the way in which the poor people have been betrayed, the way the motorists have been betrayed and the way that exporters have been betrayed by this budget, but the really bad news is that the public is going to cop another Dawkins budget in less than 10 months under this government's schedule.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government going to demand that its legislation go through on some strangulated schedule arising from the first ever month of June federal budget which is scheduled to be presented next year? In any event, will Dawkins still be Treasurer in June of next year, so great has been the anger and reaction to the budget which was introduced just two days ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say of that budget that it is an illegitimate budget. It breaches the mandate that the people gave to the government on 13 March when the Labor Party lied in order to obtain the result it did at that election. It will produce no real jobs in terms of getting this economy back on the rails. It provides a lot of pain for no real gain. We are still in a situation where there is a $16,000 million deficit, so there has been no real progress in getting the budget back into balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is truly regressive, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) pointed out very successfully today, along with other members including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge); its regressivity knows no bounds. It is going to affect the poor people; the people who are going blind. How generous of this government to choose to pick on the poor people, especially in terms of their transport arrangements with the leaded fuel imposts and the general fuel imposts and, on top of that, the increase in sales tax. So even if they do want to convert their vehicles&mdash;if they have the money to do so in the height of this recession&mdash;they will be unable to do that because there will be more sales tax on the new vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it creates the ultimate lumpiness in a taxation system&mdash;which is breaking down at just about every turn&mdash;when we see such an horrific impost in addition to the tyranny of distance in this country. Australia is a huge continent. We have the privilege of being the only nation in the world which occupies an entire continent. As such, we ought to recognise that that confers advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages are associated with the tyranny of distance across Australia and beyond to the rest of the world and to our key markets. Yet we manage to get that equation exactly wrong with transport taxation imposts, which the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, recognised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a senator under every lamp post on every corner in a state like Tasmania. His position did not improve overall. I remind the minister of some figures. In a Senate chamber of 76, the number of Labor senators has dropped to just 30. The Liberal and National parties have 36, the Democrats have seven, the Greens have two, and then there is Senator Brian Harradine who was re-elected from Tasmania. The government's representation has dropped away to just 30 senators in a Senate of 76, and it does not like that one bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that the government does not like it, but that does not give it the right to break down the Westminster conventions or to break down the mutual respect that should exist between the two houses of parliament&mdash;notwithstanding some robust advice that flows from time to time from a certain clerk in another place. It should not take away from the proper role of the Senate which, I must say, I respect. Not for one moment do I regard senators as `unrepresentative swill'. Only someone of the Prime Minister's ilk could address senators with that term. The Senate has, and does play, a proper role. I think there ought to be consideration of an extended role for the Australian Senate, especially with regard to treaty signing and the like. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the interjections from the Minister for Justice, who is at the table, in respect of Tasmania. I will say one other thing to the minister. I was sorry to hear his answer to a question two days ago on the floor of this House. Both sides of politics accept that this country must build up its links with Asia. Some of us work pretty hard at that&mdash;as, I concede, do many government ministers.

The minister might have thought in passing that it was a good throwaway line in the context of question time here in the House. He is a decent person, and I do ask that he thinks about that rhetoric and that terminology. Firstly, he is factually wrong; and, secondly, he ought to realise that giving that sort of gratuitous offence to our Asian friends is not needed. The minister really should know better. </PARA>

We can do that over a two-day period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is about time that this parliament had a fair dinkum debate about aspects of various key foreign affairs issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House send a message to the Senate conveying the terms of this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and which the House is debating. In listening to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), it was very difficult to find anything of great import in their contributions. All we heard was a lot of pious posturing and an attempt to add some respectability to their complete and utter sell-out of the rights and privileges of the House of which they are members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition did not say much in his speech, and that is what we have come to expect from him over his limited tenure of that office. It says a great deal for a party such as the Liberal Party of Australia, which was once held in high esteem in this country, that in the last 10 years it has continued to recycle failed leaders. So we will not listen too much to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked forward with some anticipation to what the honourable member for Bennelong had to say because he has frequently lectured me in the House on the Westminster system and the importance of the House of Representatives. He talked about confected anger. I have seen so much confected anger from him on this subject that I thought that deep down in his little heart there might have been a kernel of belief in what he was saying. But what did we get from the honourable member for Bennelong?  He gave a diatribe about the importance of the Senate. I do not know why the honourable member for Bennelong never ran for the Senate. It is a wonder to me that the man ever wanted to be the Prime Minister of Australia because all we heard from him in his 15-minute contribution was how important and wonderful the Senate was. The honourable member for Bennelong probably should have gone to the Senate rather than come to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech of the honourable member for Bennelong there were some rather interesting echoes of the speeches we heard in 1974 and 1975 from Peter Nixon, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and Doug Anthony about the importance of the Senate and, by implication, the lack of importance of this chamber. The Leader of the Opposition said that any reform that puts a deadline on the work that this chamber does is a useful reform. That is one of the most appalling statements I have ever heard in my life from a leader of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we heard the Leader of the National Party. The Leader of the National Party began by offering some gratuitous advice to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) about how he should not insult precious people such as the poor old honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), but then he launched into an attack on the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). So much for consistency from the Leader of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution, the Leader of the National Party demonstrated precisely why the opposition does not understand the implication of this matter. The reason that the House of Representatives cannot, and should not, comply with this decision of the Senate is not to do with sitting days but to do with good legislation. The real problem with allowing ourselves to be bound by this decision of the Senate is that the parliamentary draftsmen cannot deal with the amendments that will be proposed during the legislation process. We will then have hastily drafted legislation and amendments, and that is not for the good government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members of the opposition had listened to some of the things the Prime Minister said, they would understand that the kernel of this problem is that if we allow the Senate to impose this deadline&mdash;105 bills to be introduced and debated in 10 sitting days&mdash;we will have a legislative shambles. If they think that that will somehow solve the log jam at the end of the session, they are wrong. Indeed, it will produce something that is even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party had a little slip of the tongue when he implicated the real demon in this&mdash;the Clerk of the Senate. The person who has spent more time interested in how oppositions ought to work out ways of doing over governments was the Clerk of the Senate&mdash;a person who one could probably characterise more than anything else as an institutional anarchist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are seeing a slow and slippery slide by the opposition back to 1974. All the same elements are involved. We have had the hairy chested rhetoric about the power of the Senate: that the House of Representatives will be brought to account, will cease to have any relevance and the Senate will tell us what is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong went on at great length about section 53 of the constitution which, in his mind, gives the Senate coequal powers with the House of Representatives. Section 53 does not do that. In fact, it says that the House of Representatives shall be superior in matters such as money bills. Why is that so? It is because this is the house of parliament that is most directly elected by the people. When constituents have a problem, they do not go out and search out a senator. Most constituents do not know who their senators are, let alone where their electorate offices are. Most senators have their electorate offices in central city high-rise towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the House of Representatives on both sides of this chamber are accessible and do a job for the people. The people who have an understanding of what is inherently good or bad in legislation are members of the House of Representatives. That is the reason why they should be the people who should determine the legislative program of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I think the opposition should very carefully consider where it will stand in this piece of chicanery from the Senate that we are involved in on their behalf this afternoon. Members of parliament on both sides of this chamber should always have an eye to the day when, hopefully, from their own ideological point of view, they will be the government of Australia. The government of Australia is made in this chamber. To my mind&mdash;and surely to the minds of all fair-thinking members&mdash;whoever has the majority in this chamber should set the legislative program and the legislative timetable. To say that we should allow that to be subverted by a party of two in the Senate with the collusion of the Liberal and National parties and at the behest of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is a travesty on the way this parliament should work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might have been a funny little game to do this and it might have been seen as a victory internally in the Liberal Party for the honourable member for O'Connor, but the long-term damage of this action of the Senate&mdash;usurping the powers of this chamber and usurping the right of the elected government of Australia to go about its business and get its legislative program through&mdash;is something that in the end, on the unfortunate day in the future when the honourable member for O'Connor might be a member of the government, he will rue. I say to honourable members on both sides of the House that if we do not believe that this House is the superior partner in the partnership between us and the Senate I do not know why we are still sitting here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) made the right decision in coming to the House of Representatives. Today is the day for her to stand up for the rights of this chamber. I ask the House to give consideration to the Prime Minister's motion, to stick up for the rights of the House of Representatives and to allow the government, which has a majority in this House, to set its legislative program and ensure that we get good government and good legislation and not the type of legislative muck-up we will have if we try to force the parliamentary draftsmen to deal with 105 bills which might have amendments in 10 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the Leader of the National Party, which is that we should somehow or other go and sit down in the old Parliament House while the IPU conference is on, is probably in tune with the stupidity of the rest of his suggestions in this debate. The Prime Minister is right; the opposition is wrong. All honourable members of this House should ensure that they stick up for the rights of this chamber. </PARA>

To fix up a mistake, to save his government $500 million. When the government rushed it through the parliament last time, it got it wrong. What did we spend all yesterday doing? Fixing up little bits of bills that the government got wrong in the rush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this particular rush. I managed to take out a few statistics which have not been provided by the government, as we might think. I have looked at the bills declared urgent from 1918 to 1993. Between 1918 and 1955, 80 bills were declared urgent in this parliament; between 1956 and 1972, just before the coming to power of the Whitlam government, 54 bills were declared urgent; during the three years of the Whitlam government there was a total of 59; and, between 1985 and 1993, a total of 563 bills have been forced through this parliament as urgent bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a classic example of that, I draw the attention of these bleeding hearts to the fact that there were 1,500 pages of sales tax legislation. Those opposite say that this House has to dominate in these matters and properly has the right to represent the views of the people and deal with money bills. What contempt was shown to this parliament, the backbenchers of the Labor Party, and the opposition, when 1,500 pages of sales tax legislation were brought to this parliament, introduced on a Thursday, and guillotined through this parliament the following Tuesday in two hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue is not only the time available for debate in this place but the notice that can be given to the people. This arrogant executive has wiped this House out of existence. If those opposite think that is the view of a Johnny-come-lately, they can go to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and read my speeches on this matter.

At least the people will know what is going on. At least there will be some time to look at legislation. Instead of 80 and 100 bills being brought into this place&mdash;as happened in recent times&mdash;in the dying weeks of the parliament and jammed through both houses, with no consultation&mdash;</PARA>

It has progressively got worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention the very proud association that I have had with Senator Chamarette on this matter. Firstly, let me say that there was no conspiracy. Secondly, let me say&mdash;also to the journalist Dodd who thought he had got a scoop, which is only evidence of his and his journalist comrades' lack of observation&mdash;there has been no secret of those discussions. Senator Chamarette mentioned my involvement when she raised this particular matter during the last 10 sitting days of the last session when she first put the government on notice of her intention&mdash;which is another reason that those opposite should not be whingeing and screaming about it. She gave the government notice at that time by proposing a similar motion, which lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that she has said publicly, time and time again, that she responded to discussions she had had with me. Why would I not, as a representative of the people, recognising that two individuals in the Senate now have the responsibility of deciding the fate of all legislation in this place, point out to her that she needed more time than she was going to get under the government's ambush or log jam policies? I make no secret of that and of our discussions. They were held for proper reasons, such as making sure that two people, who, if they now abstain from voting, can cause the defeat of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite want to set an ambush. They thought they could rent the Australian Democrats by the hour. They have found out that they have got a couple of tough nuts&mdash;two very principled ladies who want to do the right thing and who want to know what they are voting on. The government knows that it has no chance of jamming the legislation at the end of the session. Who has the government's ambush always been about? The people. Those opposite do not want them to know anything. They certainly did not tell the people anything during the election campaign; they kept that a great big secret. While they were running around telling the people other things that were not true, they certainly did not tell them they were going to put petrol prices up. They ought to do an analysis of the interests of the poor people who drive cars using leaded petrol. They are usually women, because they drive the second car in the family. Those cars are also driven by university students. The government should go and have a look at the car parks of the people they are hitting two or three times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the people are entitled to know what the government intends to do by way of legislation. The first thing this motion does is to require the government to put its cards on the table, to put them where people can see them. If the government needs a little more time to debate the legislation after the date on which debate on the legislation should conclude in this place, it can go back and ask the Senate. I remind those opposite that not only the Greens and the coalition parties agreed to this; so did Senator Harradine, a man who is pretty careful in making up his mind on these matters. He, too, is fed up with the contempt with which the government's executive has treated this whole parliament and&mdash;I underline this&mdash;the people. There is nothing wrong with these proposals as long as the government gets its act into gear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the evidence. In no other parliament in history has the government had to stoop to the level that this government has in its 10 years of office to bring in 563 urgent bills. It is a conspiracy and it has been done quite deliberately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address the government's motion&mdash;its response to what the Senate is going to do. I am reminded of the boasting and the arrogance of the Leader of the House here one day when he said, `If you've got 85 votes, you may as well use them'. And he did. He works on the principle in this place that justice resides in numbers. He is learning a bit about that, and it is about time. If we succeeded only in taking a bit of arrogance out of the government, it would be a great success. It appears&mdash;I do not think it is any coincidence&mdash;that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) told us last night that he is going to give us an earlier look at the budget. I think that is the first positive response from the decision of the Senate. But the government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate order is a completely unwarranted interference by the Senate in the business of this House.</PARA>
<PARA>When have we as a house had any control over ourselves? We have not had any since those opposite have been in government. They have run over us roughshod. Ministers make their own backbenchers ask dorothy dixers. There is no proper representation from those people of the interests of their constituents. It is a farce. What is different if that is to be the conclusion? The second part of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate is a house of review and has no place dictating to this House, the house of government, on the conduct of its business.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate is not doing that. It is telling us how it will conduct its business. We have to learn to run our affairs in a way that complies with the way it does its business. It is not telling us to do anything. It is just telling us how it will conduct its affairs&mdash;because it has determined to do things properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two ladies who hold the balance of power&mdash;as they will when the Democrats line up with those opposite as they traditionally do&mdash;and who can change the decision if they abstain, want some time. They know after a very short time how they would run a parliament. They know that it is proper to go to the people with legislation and say, `What do you think about this?'. They do not have 30 or 40 advisers. They have to go out to the community interest groups and get advice. That is right and proper. I am very pleased that that argument was accepted by Senator Chamarette. I had no more involvement than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anybody wants to proceed with the conspiracy theory or the suggestion that I had to take away this victory from her, they should know that she rang me this morning for another chat and admitted that she had written in her speech some remarks to thank me for my suggestion but that time did not allow her to make them. She is not put out. Having put my view time and again in this House, I told Senator Hill, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, what I had done and he advised our leader. There was no attempt at a conspiracy. There was a simple discussion between Western Australian members of parliament. We had equal concerns. Mine have been expressed publicly time and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this conspiracy and secrecy rubbish is not sustained by the facts. Those opposite should check the public remarks of Senator Chamarette going back to, I think, last May to see that she has mentioned me in this context, certainly in public discussion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the order of the Senate is a gross discourtesy by the Senate to the people of Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How outrageous can those opposite be when they run 80 bills through this place in a week, 1,500 pages of tax legislation hitting every one of them, and then turn round and say that is not a discourtesy to the people when they are still running into brick walls associated with that and when the machinery dealers and all the others found, with the bill as presented, that they would have been in dreadful trouble? We have to use this device of sending things off to committees in the Senate just to get breathing space for the people, yet those opposite say that what the Senate is trying to do forces them to give people notice of what they are up to and is discourteous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have some funny definitions of courtesy. This is all about letting the people know, giving them notice and putting bills up early in the session. If they could ever get themselves organised to run the place properly, they would eventually see the benefit of laying out a sensible legislative debating program as a matter of practice. In that event, I think they would see these sorts of motions disappear. The responsibility is theirs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion goes on to say that the public interest is not served. That is exactly the same thing. The public interest obviously is served because those opposite will have to put down their legislation as soon as possible and the public will have the longest possible period to state their views on it&mdash;something those opposite do not want. They do not want the public to know what is in their legislation. They want to get it in and get it over with. They either bring it in two years before it is to happen in the hope that the public will forget about it&mdash;as they did with the pensioners' share scheme&mdash;or they dump it on people when nobody is looking, in the hope of stealing some more money from the pensioners and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what they are up to, but the Greens are too smart for them. They will take their time. They want the Senate to do that, and I support them wholeheartedly, as does our party. If those opposite can bring in 80 bills at the end of the session, they can bring them in at the beginning of the session or keep them for the next session. But give the public a chance to look at them and make sure of them. The situation is ridiculous and the evidence is there.

The third duty&mdash;that is what is at peril and at stake today&mdash;is that owed by every member to this institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition never fails to talk about political conventions and constitutional propriety, but at the end of the day we, as a group of parliamentarians, simply pass through this place. It is the institution and its development that we must care about.

<PARA>What is the constitution saying? Under the constitution, if there is a problem with the processes of the parliament and the way government business is presented, the responsibility on the Senate is clear: to make a decision in respect only of its own part but that where it is dealing with the rights and prerogatives of this House it has to come to some joint and appropriate arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where has that process taken place? Where was the request from Senator Chamarette or the Greens for that process to take place? There has not been one. I have been in two parliaments over 31 years, some 15 years of that time in opposition. I can well understand the frustrations of opposition. But look at state parliaments and the federal parliament and tell me when an opposition has not complained, as it is entitled to, about the use of the guillotine. Show me any major political party in power which has not used it. Going back over the history of this institution, I remember sitting on the other side making exactly the same complaint. There may well be an argument&mdash;and I believe there is&mdash;given the pressures on this institution, to modernise and update its processes. That is the right of members of this institution and this parliament. The constitution makes it clear. We have a situation where that is being done by another house, which has never fulfilled its proper constitutional function. After all, it was created to be a states house to represent the views of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat in a state parliament for something more than 17 years. Not once did I ever see any group of senators from any political party come into the state parliament or approach the executive government of the day to say, `What is your view on this issue?'. I sat there and heard a former Liberal premier describe a Liberal Prime Minister as `bodgying the books'. That is part of the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we adopt the course recommended by the opposition, we will erode one of the fundamental rights of this parliament. In my view this parliament has a clear duty to reject that proposal. If the Senate or any section of the Senate wants to propose changes, there is a due constitutional process. What has occurred here is due to the frustrations that exist within the opposition. The only thing one hears these days is who wants to be leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is trying to calm emotions and quote Sir Robert Menzies, who said that being in opposition is one of the great constructive periods in the life of a party. Irrespective of Menzies' political philosophy, he was a great parliamentarian and he believed in this institution. Does anybody believe that Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party, would have yielded to this sort of resolution from the Senate? Does anybody believe that he would have allowed the Senate to say, `You have to pass 10 bills a day or we will not deal with them.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about standover tactics, we have a couple of Greens who, by and large, have not had a great deal of political experience in the parliamentary process. This is an exercise in political manipulation, supported for purely destructive reasons by coalition members. That is singularly unfortunate because, given the problems facing Australia today, the one thing we do not need is another constitutional crisis. Playing that sort of game with our present level of unemployment and other problems puts our whole democratic fabric in great danger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this afternoon is an elaborate attempt to concoct some kind of crisis in relation to the powers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is an attempt to take the focus off the budget; it is an attempt to rally his troops. But it has nothing whatsoever to do with the way in which the Senate has quite legitimately decided to arrange its own business for the remainder of the sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what the Senate actually decided. It said that in the government of its own business, to give it time to look at legislation, it wanted to receive legislation from the House of Representatives before 29 October 1993. The Senate just said, `If you want us to be able to properly debate and examine legislation, consider amendments, take into account speeches and all of the things which senators are elected to look into, we would like to see it by 29 October. If we do not get it by 29 October, we will look at it next year'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that very simple procedural request, the Prime Minister came into this House and tried to fabricate a constitutional crisis. According to the Prime Minister, the resolution of the Senate is something that will threaten the very essence of government. According to the Prime Minister, it is an affront to the dignity of the House. According to the Prime Minister, it will now give him an excuse not to come into this House, not to participate in debates and not be here with his ministers to give full and ample consideration to the affairs of this House. Why? Because over the way the Senate wants to get legislation by 29 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is attempting to justify his own default in this House. Yesterday the opposition debated the economy and the budget. Where was the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)? He was absent; he did not come into the House. Today, during the response by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to the Prime Minister's own motion, the Prime Minister walked out of the House. He is a wilfully negligent Prime Minister when it comes to attendance and taking part in debate, and now he has an elaborate excuse. The reason why he does not have to come into the House of Representatives any more&mdash;he has said it&mdash;is that the Senate wants legislation by 29 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on a high horse of feigned indignation, he now has a wonderful excuse not to partake in debates and to excuse the attendance of his ministers because of what the Senate has allegedly done.

The Prime Minister's performance has undermined the dignity of his House for over a decade. Nobody has honed the language of the gutter, insults and blackguarding to the heights achieved by the Prime Minister in this place. That is undermining the dignity of this House, not the motion that was passed by the Senate yesterday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from justifying and excusing his own behaviour, the Prime Minister is trying to intimidate the Greens. Heaven knows, the Greens are not experienced in the business of government and they do not take an overall view of how government has to be run. I concede that point at the outset. The Greens have said that they would like a bit more time to look at legislation and they have passed this resolution. So what happens? The Prime Minister of the country gets up and tries to pull on a phoney constitutional crisis so that the Greens will think to themselves, `Good heavens, what have we done?', and start to worry about voting on other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an obvious attempt to intimidate the Greens. The Prime Minister is saying, `They have voted against something that does not count now; let's try to bang them around the head so that when something that does count comes up they're too intimidated to vote against it'. It is the most obvious, age-old tactic of the New South Wales right wing thuggish faction. The Prime Minister has probably been doing this since he was about 18. When he found a 17-year-old who did not vote for him in a ballot that did not count, he probably did his nana and worked himself up into a frenzy. He probably said to Laurie and the boys, `That's because we might need that vote next time. So you belt them around early. You belt them around in a practice round so that when the real round comes on they do the right thing'. So it is obviously an attempt to intimidate the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say to the Greens, `Don't be intimidated by this thuggery. What you have done is perfectly proper as a procedural matter. This is no constitutional crisis. This is no fight between the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is no attack on the dignity of the people's house&mdash;the parliament. This is ordinary procedural business. In fact, if it came into force it would help all concerned&mdash;those in the Senate and the House of Representatives and Green senators. It doesn't matter. Don't be intimidated. Whatever you do, do not be put off exercising your votes as you see fit by this concocted, manufactured indignation that the Prime Minister has gone on with'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has made it absolutely clear that he will try to use this manufactured indignation to cancel private members business. `Whacko', he has thought to himself, `here we have a procedural motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the consequences? The consequences are these: `I can cancel private members business, I can cancel debates on matters of public importance and I can use this motion as a means of shutting down criticism in the House of Representatives'. That is what the Prime Minister is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Prime Minister cannot abide the Senate; that is on record. He regards the Senate as unrepresentative swill. He wants to abolish it. He reaffirmed that at his old school association gathering in Canberra a year or two ago. We know that. The truth of the matter is that he also holds the House of Representatives in contempt. He is using this as a leg up to try to abolish all the things that really count in the House of Representatives: debates on matters of public importance, and debates on private members business. He has made his contempt clear over the years. He says that question time is a privilege extended by the executive to the parliament. He is now confirming, with an elaborate cover, what he has secretly been trying to do for quite some time, and that is to restrict the role of the House of Representatives to a tightly-organised, disciplined, party-controlled cipher&mdash;and he is trying to knock the Senate into the same shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He just hates the thought that we can have independently minded senators exercising their independent judgment and coming to conclusions that do not suit the government. He hates that. When it all boils down, he hates the thought of a parliament where people actually do move amendments, take part in debate and criticise government. He is using this motion to try to overcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is also trying to  manufacture a constitutional crisis. When the opposition said that we would be looking carefully at the tax bills&mdash;we would be keeping the government to its election promises, and that might mean voting against tax bills&mdash;what did the Prime Minister say? He said that is voting against supply. He said this is a rerun of 1975. I believe the Prime Minister and even the Assistant Treasurer, who is sitting at the table, now realise the differences between a tax bill and supply. We have never spoken about blocking supply. We have thought about blocking taxes&mdash;taxes where the government broke its promises&mdash;in the same way as the Labor Party blocked them in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tries to turn the blocking of tax bills into a supply crisis. He adds to this an overlay of a procedural motion, and he says that is adding to a supply crisis. He is trying to raise the whole issue to such a fever pitch that he intimidates the Senate. But there is no supply crisis; there is no argument between the House and the Senate that goes to the heart of the constitution. If one really wants to know what the constitutional position is, one ought to look up the constitution. The constitution says that the parliament consists of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no great constitutional crisis&mdash;as if something is happening outside the constitution. The  Senate and the House of Representatives are exercising a role.

Does anyone seriously think that? I think not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since election day on 13 March there have been three stages. First of all, prior to election day, we were told that opposition staffers were going around picking out their ministerial suites&mdash;making sure that they got the plum suites. We had the Treasury all lined up on the Sunday morning for the shadow Treasurer to come up to Canberra for a briefing to find out the state of Australia's books. The stage was set for a Liberal victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So stage one was the stun stage on Saturday night when the government was returned with an increased majority. We well remember that on that night the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did not even have the decency to concede that he had lost. We remember back to 1983. Not many of us have many kind words for Malcolm Fraser, but one thing we can say about him is that at least he fronted. He said, `Yes, I lost the election. I'll take it on the chin'. The old jaw dropped a bit, but at least we recognised that he did the decent thing. But that was not the case with the Leader of the Opposition; we did not see him until Sunday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the survivors do when they limped back to parliament?  They voted the Leader of the Opposition back in. He had just lost the unlosable election, and what is the reward?&mdash;another three years of the leadership. My own feeling is that, when they got back here and found that they were still sitting on the opposition benches, they were too stunned to seriously think about the leadership. We have all seen the effects of that decision. The Leader of the Opposition cannot even make a decision without looking over his shoulder. He keeps hearing footsteps. That is one of the main reasons why we are here today: weak leadership. So stage one was the stun stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stage two was: `It was not our fault. The government lied in the election campaign; it did not tell us about all these taxes'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is this: the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite made a charge that the government lied. Yet on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> about two weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition was confronted with the question, `When did they lie?' The blank look on his face told it all. It really is schoolyard stuff to suggest that the government lied during the election campaign, when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) stood before this parliament in September last year and outlined the government's proposals in relation to tax. The opposition is really saying that the people got it wrong. From time to time there are utterances from the opposition that, `We told the truth. We had a detailed plan. The people of Australia knew what we were going to do'. All I can say to the opposition is, `If you think it was so good, give it another run in three years time and we will see how good it is'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, we had stage one, the stun stage. Then we had stage two, `It was not our fault'. Now we get to stage three: revenge. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) talked about trench warfare in the Senate. We can see how it has moved along. The opposition uses its numbers in the Senate and takes advantage of two senators from Western Australia&mdash;one who was elected on 13 March and did not take her seat until a couple of days ago. Those senators could not possibly understand the impact of their decision, and the impact it will have on this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate I have heard a couple of opposition speakers talk about the fact that they are only getting their own house in order. But, to get their house in order, they put ours out of order. We have to understand that this is the prime house; this is the house where governments are made; this is the house where legislation is enacted. The Senate is supposed to be a house of review. The Senate is supposed to be a states house&mdash;that is what it was set up for. As a result of this decision in the Senate there is potential chaos in the government's legislative program. </PARA>

<PARA>not the House of Representatives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have power&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and there are placita enumerated under section 51. We might look at the second point, the exclusive powers of the parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It refers to the parliament, not the House of Representatives. Thirdly, the only area where the Senate is exclusively removed from having prerogative powers of the parliament is in section 53 which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us initially understand that all this arrant nonsense about being offended, about the House of Representatives being distinguished, is all poppycock. The Assistant Treasurer and every other member on the government side of this place&mdash;who so rarely attend in this parliament&mdash;are described equally with the members of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More fundamental, and what I want to go through today, are the circumstances of what I see as the abject failure of the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the relationship that that has to this afternoon's motion. First, he has obviously lost his cool. I have never heard anything more pathetic than the statement that he made that he will not honour the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), or the parliamentary tradition, by being here tonight when the Leader of the Opposition responds to the budget. As far as I am aware this will be the first time since Federation that a Prime Minister has been so ashamed of himself, so inadequate in his capacity as a person to lead a government, as to be not prepared to come in here and listen to the alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look back to why that is so. It must first be remembered that he lost the numbers. On 3 June 1991 he resigned in high dudgeon. He thought he had the numbers, but he lost them. Bob Hawke was re-elected as leader of the Labor Party, and Keating went to the back bench. The important part about that period, that is from 3 June 1991 to 20 December 1991 when Paul Keating was elected Prime Minister, having been elected leader of the Labor Party, having rolled Bob Hawke, is that Keating went out and spoke in a number of public forums&mdash;he did not speak here but he spoke out before the press and various interested groups&mdash;and laid down a number of ideas that seemed to suggest a new direction should he be elected leader of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Come his election as leader, what happened? He ran for cover. We heard statements about him observing party traditions and about how he was not out there to introduce any new ideas&mdash;which, indeed, he did not. We had a succession of failed attempts with One Nation and all that followed to divert the attention of the Australian people from the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period when the now Prime Minister was on the back bench, producing a few ideas, people thought that he might have in mind some new direction for Australia. Then he became leader of the government. Does anyone remember why? It was because he rolled the then Prime Minister, Hawke. It was not because of any intrinsic merit but because the then Prime Minister, Hawke, was unable to handle the very forward looking and comprehensive Fightback document that was produced by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback really put the coalition in the position of being the economic leader of Australia. People are still talking about Fightback. Why? Because Fightback provided the parameters of opportunity, it provided a change of direction, and it provided hope. It was going to overcome the problems of all those people at the bottom of the financial heap&mdash;the very people that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has damned in the budget this week. They are the people whose margins of differential are being increased, not reduced. The people whom the Treasurer is driving into poverty are the very people being let down by Prime Minister Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback, we had answers. We provided a new dimension. Over that period Paul Keating proved himself a very good leader of the opposition. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, there is no doubt that as a leader of the opposition during that period Paul Keating really proved that he was probably not a bad operator. One has to pay tribute to the honourable member for Blaxland in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion this afternoon, however, is a natural sequent to all that, because the man who sees himself as emperor today has no clothes. Today, that man who is Prime Minister has been caught short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was in opposition he had ideas, when he was a backbencher he had ideas, but he had none when he became leader of the Labor Party. What did he do before the election? The whole of the election campaign was essentially concentrated on trying to prove to the Australian electorate why the GST was bad or why Fightback was not going to provide the solutions that the people of Australia needed. The government did not expect to be elected on 13 March, and from that time until today the government has been moving from one direction to another, trying to find out where to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget demonstrates that fact. There is no single economic course. There is no plan of opportunity. There is no hope given. There is no light on the hill, to use the old Chifley phrase. There badly needs to be recognition by the government that the resolution in the Senate is a product of the government having no ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the 11th day of sitting since the parliament rose at the end of 1992. The reason this resolution has particular significance is that the government has found itself unable to produce the legislation in that hotchpotch of programs that have been adapted and modified, with increased charges here and there, represented by the 1993-94 budget. The reason the government is embarrassed by the resolution of the Senate is not that it is not intrinsically good for the running of the parliament and not that it thinks there should not be a better opportunity to debate legislation. After all, that is why Treasurer Dawkins tells us he is going to bring down his budget in June next year&mdash;so it can be debated and considered before the end of the financial year on 30 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the government has been caught short. As I said, the emperor has no clothes. The Prime Minister and the government have no policy. As of 19 August, they have been trying hard to catch up. It is no use members of the government coming in this afternoon and saying, `Look, we do not have time to draft the legislation and get everything ready by the deadline'. That is absolute rubbish. They would have had time if they had had ideas and if they had not been elected on the basis of a total misrepresentation of truth to the electorate of Australia on 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date of 13 March saw the election of a government without ideas. It saw the Labor Party assume the office of a Prime Minister and a government of this country on the basis that Fightback had not been sold successfully. They were not elected on the basis that they knew where Australia was going. The resolution from the Senate pins them. This resolution says to them, `You have to produce the policies that you told the Australian electorate you would be able to handle in government. You have to demonstrate now why you are able to be a better government than the opposition'. That is where the government is failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that this will embarrass the government. Of course it will make it difficult. Even the National Party said that it could meet more frequently. That is what our amendment does. The honourable member for Bennelong produced an amendment which said that we have to meet more often. If there is a reason the House of Representatives is failing in the eyes of the people in the electorate of Australia, it is that the government is not allowing this parliament, the legislature, to be relevant to the major issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important not that the people look narrowly at the restriction of debate because suddenly the budget is having to be produced on 17 August and there is a deadline applied by the Senate resolution but that they look at the wider perspective of a Prime Minister unable to exercise  efficiently and adequately the responsibilities of a leader of the government and Prime Minister&mdash;a Prime Minister who essentially did well as a leader of the opposition during the period that Fightback was the economic opportunity that people were looking at and commenting on. There was never anything from him about government policy; it was all Fightback prior to 13 March. Now the government has been re-elected and it must bear the responsibility. The government has been caught short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the problems of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I have been there and done that. I know how difficult it is. But he must understand that if the budget were genuinely the product of long-term consideration of what is best for this country the legislation should now be finalised. It is no use the Leader of the House saying that he does not have all the legislation prepared. It should all be ready. By now, there should be a significant volume of budget legislation&mdash;not the two or three bills that are before the House&mdash;on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. The first reading speeches should have been made and, had they been, there would have been little difficulty in the government meeting the requirements of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the consequences of this resolution are twofold. The people of Australia have to understand that the diversions that the Prime Minister has pursued on the matter of the republic and the flag are now being followed by a third, which is the elimination of the Senate. Because it has followed those diversions, it has been caught short. Instead of trying to get on with the legislation, it has been worrying about all these other things, forgetting about the people who are suffering. It is trying to widen those divisions, not resolve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia need to know that the resolution of the problem of the status of this House is by our meeting more frequently and considering matters which not only are legislative in nature but also affect the very essence of this country. We can do that by meeting more frequently. I do not believe that a properly managed parliament would be in any way obstructed in its affairs by the resolution passed in the Senate. I completely support the amendment to the motion moved by the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite also swore right through the election campaign that they would not increase the burden of tax on the people of Australia. Remember that wonderful line they developed&mdash;that as the economy started to grow the budget would `whirr back into balance'? In fact, they had a lot of trouble convincing people about their integrity in relation to tax cuts. Do you remember the final play where the Prime Minister came into this parliament and said, `I'm going to put those tax cuts into law&mdash;l-a-w&mdash;so you know they will be delivered'. Who can forget those words? I will quote them to you tonight. He said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not a promise. They are law&mdash;L.A.W.&mdash;law. And the difference between a legislative tax cut and some Opposition speaker's manifesto is all the world of difference . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went out of his way to say that they would be delivered, they would be funded, and there would not be any new taxes, any increase in taxes or any increase in the tax burden. When the people of Australia think back over that period they already have the key characteristic of this budget. It is a budget of betrayal. It is a budget that has betrayed the people of Australia; it is a budget that has betrayed ordinary Australians; it is a budget that has betrayed the unemployed; it is a budget that has betrayed Australian women. Who will ever forget the Prime Minister's boast on election night that he had got Australian women to vote for him? It has betrayed Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a budget that has betrayed the young people of Australia; it is a budget that has betrayed the older people of Australia; and, most significantly perhaps, it is a budget that has betrayed rural and regional Australia. It is a budget of betrayal. It is one of the most dishonest documents that has ever been put down in this parliament and before the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a cowardly budget. It is a budget which reveals the extent to which those opposite were not prepared to tell the people of Australia the truth. Notice their solution to their bind. When they cannot pay for their tax cuts, what do they do? They resort to hidden taxes, such as sales taxes and excise taxes, hoping that people will forget that those taxes have been increased to pay for the promised tax cuts. It is a cowardly budget because it relies on those hidden taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, rather than look at themselves and cut the fat out of government, what is more cowardly? They have cut the living standards of average Australians. It is a budget of betrayal; it is a cowardly budget; and it brings into place a massive tax slug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget alone over the next four years will raise nearly $17 billion in tax. When we add to that the fact that the government will also collect about $3 billion in bracket creep and will keep the second half of the promised tax cuts, we see that over the next four years total tax revenue will rise by $32 billion. That is a 36 per cent increase in total tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set that in context, over the last four years tax revenue went up by $5 billion, or about six per cent. But the people of Australia are looking down the gun barrel at a 36 per cent increase in the overall burden of tax in the course of the next four years. As I say, it is a cowardly budget. It is a budget of betrayal; it is a budget that brings with it a massive tax slug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia should understand the nature of some of the tax increases that are in prospect under this budget. For example, if you go out and fill up your car&mdash;as a lot of Australians do about once a week&mdash;and you use leaded petrol, it will cost you about $5 per week more to fill up your car. If you use unleaded petrol, it will cost you about $2.50 per week more to fill that car up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the sales tax goes across the board and affects the price of everything. It affects the cost of everything you wear, the cost of everything you eat and the cost of everything you use. I think it is instructive to have a look at the magnitude of these increases. For example, there will be a tax on fruit juice, biscuits, ice-cream and flavoured milk, and that tax will go from 10 to 12 per cent&mdash;a 20 per cent increase in the tax on those basic necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are building or furnishing a house, the tax on many items in that house will also rise by about 20 per cent. There will be a 20 per cent increase in the tax on toilets, bathroom fittings, hot water systems, blinds, furniture, carpets, stoves, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, kitchen utensils, blankets and curtains. Of course, if that 20 per cent increase in tax is not enough to force you out of your home, the government still has you covered with this tax system because there is a tax on sleeping bags that will go up by 20 per cent, a tax on tents that will go up by 10 per cent and a massive increase in the sales tax on wine, which will go up 55 per cent. That gives you some idea of the magnitude of the tax increases that are foreshadowed under this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that it was a budget of betrayal. It is very important to recognise the significance of that, not only to the people of Australia as a whole but to Labor Party supporters and the so-called true believers in particular. I will never forget the night of 13 March, particularly for the speech that the Prime Minister made about how this was a sweet victory for the true believers. In recent days&mdash;particularly since this budget&mdash;a lot of true believers, like a lot of average Australians, have been ringing my office and all of our offices to register their views. There are a lot of people on the government back bench who are worried about this budget as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it is particularly interesting to read a letter that I saw in today's newspaper. I just happened to notice this letter. I do not know the person who wrote it, but he obviously did not vote for me, as he says in the letter. But I think it is instructive to understand the way the so-called true believers, like most other Australians, are going to run a mile from the Keating government because of this budget and the monumental economic mismanagement in the last five months. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My father taught me to vote Labor and I think his father taught him. I am a true believer who couldn't have voted for Dr Hewson and when Mr Keating spoke about Labor's true believers on election night, I thought he spoke for me. I thought that after the long time when my party gave all the best things to the like of the stuffed shirts that go to operas and universities, my sort of Labor voter was going to get a go.</PARA>
<PARA>He thought for the first time he was going to get a go. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I'm not smart, but I have got a trade, and I've never been on the dole and neither have the kids yet. They don't see it like the lady and I do and things are changing in ways we don't like. I don't think they'll change back until Labor again believes in things like Cocky Calwell thought.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is interesting that Calwell was one of his Labor Party heroes. He says that he does not think things will change under Labor governments until Labor again believes in the things `like Cocky Calwell thought'. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got an old petrol truck and a 1972 Holden and we own our house now. I don't drink much but I smoke a fair bit. I reckon that I'm the sort of true believer that believed in Cocky Calwell, and a fair shake for people who worked if they could and brought up their kids proper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I don't want a handout, and I suppose I don't even mind Keating taxing my smokes and petrol when all is said and done. Or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the crucial bit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't mind if I thought he cared about the likes of us who were believing true when he was in short pants.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement of a self-confessed true believer that summarises the feedback we are all getting in our offices not only from your true believers but from a very wide cross-section of the Australian community. The fact is that you do not care. The writer of that letter is dead right: you do not care. You stand up, you put your hands over your hearts and talk about social justice and compassion, but you do not damn well care. You do not care about the people of Australia. You could not have brought down a budget like this if you did care about them. You could not have brought down a budget that widens the gap between rich and poor the way this budget does if you cared about people. You claim to care for the disadvantaged, the low income earners and the poor. Who do you hit to leg? It is the low income earners, the poor and the disadvantaged. Of course, they are the big losers. Some of your wealthy mates do okay out of the budget, but some of these people&mdash;the true believers down the bottom&mdash;are absolutely hit to leg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That letter by that gentleman clearly exposes the myth that you are a caring and compassionate government. I think it is very instructive against that background to look at some of the changes in the budget. Let me pose to the few frontbench ministers that are here a series of questions to determine whether they do care and whether they do really have a sense of social justice. What is just about hitting the poor at the petrol bowser while you are paying out to the wealthy? What is just about slashing the value of older cars owned by low income earners while reducing the price of luxury cars? What is just about making a person on $20,700 a year $92 worse off while making someone on $50,000 a year $616 better off? What is just about forcing struggling families to pay up to $75 each time they want to get their children's eyesight tested? What is just about forcing 80,000 Australian families to fork out another $10 a week to pay for their much needed prescription drugs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is just about retrospectively slashing the accrued leave entitlements of millions of Australians by increasing the tax rate by as much as 46 per cent? What is just about ripping money out of the pockets of thousands of pensioners and retirees whose only crime is to happen to own a few shares? What is just about slashing road grants, which of course results in making our roads even more dangerous, while ripping off hundreds of millions of dollars at the petrol pump? What is just about creating one million unemployed and telling them that they had better get used to it?  What about that insensitive remark the other day by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when he said that the chances of a long-term unemployed person in Australia getting a job are about as good as their chances of discovering the Loch Ness monster?</PARA>

The concept of those opposite of social justice is a classic.

What was the solution? It was $2 a week&mdash;guilt money. This is your concept of compassion; this is your concept of decent. Do you remember that word the Treasurer used&mdash;decent? What is decent about $2 a week for low income earners? If they happen to drive a car and they go around the corner, it costs them five bucks to fill it up. They are already three bucks behind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are not interested in the business of politics and government for actually improving the Australian community and the lot of average Australians; they are in it for themselves. They play a game in this business. They see everything as a game. One of the Prime Minister's economic advisers could not have said it better. He said that their process of economic policy making:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . involved a good deal of opinion management, often of a sophisticated kind, especially the exploitation of public fears or widely held misconceptions to advance objectives which would otherwise be difficult to obtain.</PARA>
<PARA>They play on fear and they exploit misconceptions. There is no better testimony to that than what we saw in the course of the last election campaign. He went on to talk about Labor's process of manipulation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with one rationale for action giving way to another more sophisticated one as each one was successfully undermined by fact and by experience.</PARA>
<PARA>Damned out of the mouths of your own advisers! The other thing that this letter to the editor today convinces me that the concerns of the so-called true believers are the concerns of a lot of Australians is that you have no sense of direction for this country; you have no vision for this country. I am reminded of some great leaders in the past, such as Ben Chifley, who did have a genuine sense of vision, who did put a light on the hill. You have substituted a hand in the till for that light on the hill. That is your concept. No less a figure than Peter Walsh, one of your ex-senators, said recently, and I could not agree more:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . mouthing Chifley rhetoric is a poor substitute for implementing Chifley's policies.</PARA>
<PARA>When we move on to look at the impact of the budget on the economy, we start to understand the full magnitude of the fraud that has been perpetrated on the people of Australia. The government says that it is fiscally responsible. It says, `We built up surpluses in the 1980s and we can now spend them'. It has built up about $18 billion worth of surpluses. In the last few years it has already run up about $24 billion of deficits&mdash;you are behind&mdash;and this budget adds another $44 billion to the deficit. Nearly $70 billion of additional public sector debt is going to accrue as a result of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the numbers what do we find? The numbers have been fiddled. The deficit is not $16 billion. As some market analysts say, it is closer to $25 billion when all the innovative accounting and the special fiddles and the one-off benefits that it has managed to extract are added back. In trying to solve the economic problems of this nation, the budget is a monumental failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find about unemployment? There is no improvement over the year, and it strains to make that one add up. What do we see with debt? There is very little mention, but it blows out dramatically. What do we see about the balance of payments? It admits it is going to blow out further. What do we see about national savings? This budget takes us backwards. What do we see about inflation? Up we go again. Its concept is no determination, no vision and no sense of direction to solve the economic problems of this nation. The government has absolutely no idea of what needs to be done to turn our circumstances around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians tonight are very uncertain and very anxious about our economic and social circumstances. Many of them have seen in recent years a decline in their personal living standards and have watched in frustration as their country has lost its economic standing in the world. They have watched in frustration as one of the world's most egalitarian societies has become increasingly divided between the rich and the poor. They know in their hearts it does not need to be so. They know, with our natural resources and with the skills of our work force, there is no reason why we should have record unemployment. There is no reason why we should have foreign debt. There is no reason why we should have declining living standards. They want an economy where everyone who wants to work can do so. They want their range of opportunities expanded. Parents want their children to be better educated and to be better off than themselves. But all they see now is kids becoming poor people in a rich country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They want a clear sense of direction in a world that they know is changing and is uncertain, and they want fairness. There is a profound sense of disillusionment amongst the Australian people about politics. The fact is that no party has contributed more to that sense of disillusionment than this Labor Party in government in the course of the last 10 years. No single act has contributed more to that disillusionment than this budget that was just brought down a couple of days ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances the immediate responsibility of the opposition&mdash;of our side of politics&mdash;is absolutely clear, that is, to act on behalf of the people of Australia, to protect them from this government that is acting contrary to the public understanding of their mandate. The simple message is: you have no mandate to increase tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So tonight I give clear notice that the coalition parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate will vote against the following tax increases that were announced in Labor's budget of betrayal: the increase in petrol taxes; the increases in wholesale sales tax except for the luxury car; the increases in sales tax on wine; and the retrospective tax changes with regard to accumulated long service and holiday leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has no mandate for these tax increases. It went to an election just five months ago promising the Australian people no new taxes and two nights ago it imposed on the Australian people a massive tax hike. These increases hit hardest at those in our society that are least able to afford them and they had no indication, of course, of what was coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the tax increases we are opposing are clearly against the national interest. They make our industries less competitive in the export market where they desperately need to be more competitive. Transport in particular is a major area of cost disadvantage as a result of those tax changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let me also make it clear that our action in opposing these tax increases has nothing to do with the blocking of supply. Our action is consistent with that of the Labor Party opposition back in 1981 when it voted against some sales tax legislation. Finally, I make it clear that we will vote against these tax increases in the House and the Senate whenever the government tries to pass them into law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great failings of the Labor Party is its lack of vision. Let me just share with you, in conclusion, my vision for an independent, proud Australia built on real economic achievement and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look to an Australia whose independence is secure from crippling foreign debt. I look to an Australia which is owned by our kids and not one in which they are tenants of foreign landlords.

It was a right upheld by the late Senator Murphy when he was the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate; it was a right upheld by the Leader of the House when he was a member of the Hayden opposition that voted against the tax measures of 1981; it was a right upheld by the current Prime Minister; and it was a right  upheld by the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). All of them were members of the opposition front bench that collaborated in that particular decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these facts be laid out. If I am any judge of the tricks of the Labor Party, the minders and the spin doctors will now be up in the gallery saying, `Oh, this is 1975, this is terrible, they are trying to revisit the circumstances of 1975'. We are expressing the outrage of the Australian people about having been so misled and deceived by the government which was less than candid in the lead-up to the last election. That is what we are doing. </PARA>

We have the Leader of the Opposition announcing something that one of his Labor predecessors, the now Governor-General of Australia, announced on behalf of a then Labor opposition. What is the response of the Leader of the House? The response of the Leader of the House is to say, in a fit of childish pique and vituperation, `From now on you cannot move for the suspension of any standing orders'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all very well for the honourable member for Newcastle to wave the blue around. There are lots of things that sit on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, and the juxtaposition of the action of the Leader of the House is very revealing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition opposes this motion because the opposition supports free speech. In this House the party which has a record of authoritarianism is the Australian Labor Party. One of the things that always amuse me about the Australian Labor Party, and it is very relevant to the context of this debate, is that it poses as the great defender of free speech, but whenever the pressure is applied the Labor Party reveals a deeply authoritarian streak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take honourable members through some of the Labor Party's actions over the last 12 months. What has it done to confirm that deeply authoritarian streak? Which party was it that tried to prohibit Australians advertising on television and radio their political views? It was the Australian Labor Party. Which party was it that, having won the last election, as retribution ignored those bodies that had campaigned against the Labor Party during the election campaign? I am delighted that the National President of the Australian Labor Party is present to hear this because I know that he is genuinely concerned about issues of free speech. I say very seriously to the national president, and through him to all the rank and file members of his party, that what they are doing tonight is of the same genre as their other actions which have revealed that authoritarian streak that lurks beneath the surface of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever those opposite are in a corner, what do they do? They cut off the basic rights of free speech. They tried to do it with television and radio because the party was broke. The state divisions came crying to the federal ALP and said, `If we have to advertise on television and radio, we cannot get any money at the present time'. What was the response of the Labor Party? The response of the Labor Party was to say, `Don't worry, we'll pass a law prohibiting radio and television advertising'. Fortunately, in the name of free speech, that law was struck down by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the other example in the last 12 months of that authoritarian streak that lurks beneath the surface of the Labor Party? It is the response to those bodies that dared to exercise their democratic right to campaign against the Labor Party in the last election campaign. Surely it is the democratic right of any organisation in this country to put its money where its views are and to campaign in an open fashion against a particular political party. The trade unions did it against us; they poured millions behind the Labor Party. They worked day and night to bring about the re-election of a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the outcome of the election on 13 March had been different, one can just imagine the outcome if, for example, I as industrial relations minister in a Hewson government had said, `Look, as a result of what the ACTU, the metalworkers union and all these other unions have done in the election campaign, I am not going to talk to you lot for the next six months; I am going to send you to Coventry; I am going to totally ignore you'. I would never have done that, but if I had done it I would have been quite rightly criticised the length and breadth of Australia for having behaved in an undemocratic and un-Australian fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what the Labor Party and its representatives in this parliament have done over the last six months. Organisations such as the Housing Industry Association  and the ACCI have been treated as though they were lepers in the body politic. They have boasted about it; they think it is clever. They think it is absolutely clever to say to somebody, `Right, you campaigned against the Labor Party'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Housing Industry Association campaign against the Labor Party? It campaigned against the Labor Party because it genuinely believed, and it is right, that the contractors legislation sponsored by this government and passed by dint of numbers through the parliament actually adversely affected the interests of the members of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, why would the HIA not campaign? It used some fairly vigorous advertisements. It had a few of the big union bovver boys arriving to help fix the barbie. I know that some of the Labor candidates and members in marginal seats did not like that. I suppose there are a few ads that the government ran that some of my colleagues did not like either. But we are supposed to be a robust democracy. We are supposed to cop all of this, bounce back and be part of the democratic process. But, oh no, that is not good enough for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party singles people out and if they do not agree with the party it persecutes them. That is what it has done with the HIA and the ACCI; that is what it tried to do when it came to television and radio advertisements; and, basically, that is what it is trying to do with the suspension of standing order 399. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is really saying that free speech is all right while everything is flowing in its direction, but the weather is getting a bit rough at present. It did not think that it was going to be re-elected. It was re-elected and it has not really had its hand on the tiller since. The budget has gone down like a lead balloon. It has had a worse reception than any budget in the last 20 years. What is the response of the Labor Party? It spits the dummy and says that it is going to tighten up on free speech; it is going to take away the basic rights of an opposition in a democratically elected parliament; and it is going to take away the right to move for a suspension of standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were given very clear notice today by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House in question time that, as far as they are concerned, there is going to be a jackbooted approach to the rights of the opposition in this place from now on. This motion is completely in the same genre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition rejects this motion&mdash;rejects it completely. The circumstances in which it has been put forward are totally unmerited. I have been handed a note which indicates that this device has been used on only three occasions in recent times: on 6 May 1971, on 26 September 1979&mdash;I stand corrected, and I am not reluctant to acknowledge that correction&mdash;and on 19 December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances do not warrant the use of this motion. The government is tonight displaying that deep authoritarian streak that lies beneath the surface. Labor loves liberty until it becomes uncomfortable. When it becomes a bit uncomfortable it cranks up the numbers; it runs a rigid caucus system; and, metaphorically speaking, it kicks its political opponents around. This motion is very much part and parcel of that process. That is why the opposition totally rejects it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual the poor old honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has missed the mark. The motion we are currently debating has nothing to do with the rantings and ravings of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his reply to the budget tonight&mdash;a shallow attempt to prop up his failed leadership. It is interesting to note that he could not even hold the attention of Senator Bishop, who was in the gallery&mdash;she left with a portion of the speech still to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is a direct response to the motion passed by the Senate yesterday. In October 1990, I seconded a motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) calling for the abolition of all state and territory governments and the Senate. In that debate I confined my comments to the need to abolish the Senate. The actions of the Senate yesterday in imposing on this chamber cut-off dates for the consideration of legislation only confirms my belief that it is an anachronistic, undemocratic institution that has outlived its usefulness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the mover of the motion, Senator Chamarette, is the only person in that chamber who has not faced the electorate in an election&mdash;she replaced Senator Vallentine, who was elected at the 1990 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that Senator Chamarette was well intentioned in her motion, but the reality is that it will act as a hindrance to the operation and procedures of effective government. More importantly, the opposition has seized upon the opportunity to disrupt the government's legislative program. For this reason the actions of the opposition should be seen as nothing more than cowardly, opportunistic spoiling tactics aimed at furthering its own agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it particularly objectionable that the Senate, acting as a house of review, can impose its will on this chamber. Put simply, the motion passed by the Senate yesterday dictates to this House what legislation it will and will not deal with. No longer content to be a chamber of review, the Senate has decided to impose its will on the government. This motion is by way of the government striking back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian electorate passed its judgment on the opposition on 13 March this year. The electorate overwhelmingly rejected the opposition and its policies, and it was banished to a further three years on the opposition benches. The opposition has no mandate. Its support for Senator Chamarette's motion was not motivated by a desire to improve the operations and procedures of parliament but motivated by the bitterness and frustration of a further three years in opposition. That is, indeed, what we saw tonight from the current Leader of the Opposition&mdash;bitterness and frustration at having lost the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as the opposition is now suggesting, its support for Senator Chamarette's motion is based on a long held and deep-seated belief in the need to improve the function and operation of parliament, why did it not support two similar motions proposed in 1989 and 1992? The fact is the opposition was not interested then because of upcoming elections and the possibility that it would have to work with what it knows to be an unworkable requirement. In other words, it did not suit its interests to do so, and that is the message that should be broadcast to the Australian electorate. However, for grossly opportunistic reasons, it now suits the opposition to support Senator Chamarette, and what its support for the motion has done is to disrupt this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I asked a question of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), quoting Senator Coulter. In effect, Senator Coulter said that we should have a guillotine and that the House of Representatives should sit for one day only, because that is basically the effect of Senator Chamarette's motion. What we are seeing with the motion before us is the first instalment of the effect Senator Chamarette's motion will have on the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition cannot come in here and complain. I agree that this is the people's house but the motion moved by the Leader of the House is a direct response to the constraints placed on the House of Representatives by the opposition in the Senate. This is the way that the House of Representatives should appropriately respond. It is the only way to respond. I would imagine&mdash;and I will quote some statistics shortly&mdash;that it is a direct result of former Senator Macklin's motion imposing time limits on the House of Representatives in passing on legislation to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a blatantly opportunistic and hypocritical exercise by the opposition. The government has no problem with exploring ways of improving the operations of parliament, and is actively looking at measures which will achieve that, but the motion by Senator Chamarette, resulting in tonight's motion, is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a similar resolution was moved by Senator Macklin and passed by the Senate in 1986, it had the opposite effect to what was intended. Indeed, Senator Macklin's resolution is partly responsible for the problem confronting both houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it is no coincidence that when Senator Macklin's resolution was passed the number of bills declared urgent immediately increased to 40. Prior to Senator Macklin's resolution, in the period between 1918 and 1985, a total of 236 bills were declared urgent. Since 1986, a total of 539 bills have been declared urgent. I say to those senators who supported Senator Chamarette's motion that if they honestly believe that it will in any way facilitate a more efficient running of parliament, the figures prove otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government is formed in the House of Representatives. This chamber should not be made subservient to the Senate. As a consequence of Senator Chamarette's resolution, passed yesterday, the Senate has effectively told this chamber that any debate on legislation in this chamber is hindering the effective operation of the Senate. The quicker we get the legislation through this House, the more time the Senate will have to properly review it. In other words, the Senate is telling us that debate in the House of Representatives is a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that sounds alarmist, then people do not fully appreciate the implications of yesterday's Senate resolution. Tonight's proposed resolution is a direct consequence of that, so it is no good for the opposition to come in here whingeing and screaming. I will be interested to see how many of the members in this chamber who support the Senate resolution go back to their electorates and tell their constituents that they believe the House of Representatives is irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure I can attest to the work currently undertaken by the committee in looking at improving the operation and procedures of this chamber. The same work is being undertaken in the other chamber by the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure. Both committees will report back to their respective chambers with recommendations which will improve the overall functioning of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened yesterday in the Senate was a hijacking of the work of both committees and will soon be recognised as ill-conceived and unworkable. It is no good for the opposition to come in here tonight kicking and screaming and objecting to what the government is now doing, because it is a direct result of the actions that those opposite initiated through the approach of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to Senator Chamarette which was exposed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is that, unfortunately, there will be more of this. That is why it is important that we take a stand now, and continue to take a stand, in relation to the timetable that the Senate is imposing on this chamber.

The fundamental issue is that there will be an occasion when something dreadful occurs, something that might be of interest to the government to know&mdash;a matter relating to crime or corruption&mdash;and the only means by which it can be introduced to this House in the public interest is by way of a suspension of standing orders. The government will have a blanket decision that says it cannot be raised. It might be a matter of sickness in the community; it might be, for example, the government's dreaded leaded petrol poisoning. It is preventing members with a genuine concern for the people from raising matters.

I do not think I will even use the rest of my time, because it is so silly that we find ourselves debating this while the Leader of the House puts himself up as some sort of schoolteacher with a stick who will teach us a lesson for having the temerity to question the way he runs this place in such a disastrous way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have got to give it to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) because they both share a common trait&mdash;gall. With due respect to my friend from Kooyong, I will not put him in the same league&mdash;one has brains and one has not. I will let honourable members choose which one has the brains and which one has not, and also which one is the person who has taken up a great deal of parliamentary time. I have been in this place since only 1987, but I have seen more disruption in this House brought about by the honourable member for O'Connor than I have from any other collection of members. He made comments about the relationship of the government and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and of our understanding of the forms of the House. One thing is for certain: one bloke in here knows how to abuse the forms of the House, and that is the honourable member for O'Connor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to understand the proper context of this current debate about this particular motion. There is no question that the honourable member for O'Connor may be correct in his assertion that he spoke to the new Greens party member some months ago to advise her on the appropriate tactic to screw the House of Representatives. This is his House; the honourable member for O'Connor suggested to the Senate that his own House ought to be knocked over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the history of the Senate's relationship with the House of Representatives, we can clearly see that there has been a lot of tension over the years&mdash;since Federation, in fact&mdash;about the respective roles of those two places. It is also clear, as has been said on a number of occasions today and tonight, that the Senate was a states house. But any ideal that it was a states house went long ago. It is now a party political province which is being used to obstruct and hinder the role of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to not delude ourselves about the intentions of the Greens. They may be well intentioned, but what is certainly clear is that their objectives&mdash;in collusion with the coalition&mdash;are not well intentioned. They are about giving room to the idiosyncratic nonsense which comes out of the mouths of certain conservative senators in order to try to frustrate the forms of this parliament and suggest that we should give support to a resolution which has the result of shackling this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has said, the arguments for this motion are obvious. There will be no opportunity for this House to consider properly the legislation in the way both sides of this parliament would want to, were it not for this ridiculous resolution coming out of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be concerned that there has been a fairly unprincipled attack on the ability of the parliament to carry out its business. There have been tensions over the years, but we have to look at those tensions. Some of them have been very constructive, and there is no doubt that there is a legitimate role for the Senate as a house of review. But it is not there&mdash;and it should not be there&mdash;to frustrate the people's house. There is no difficulty at all in seeing it having a role as a proper place of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the arguments of the honourable member for O'Connor are perfidious. They are presumptuous and pompous. They do not do him credit; they do not do this House credit. As the government of this country, we have a responsibility to pass appropriate, well considered legislation in the appropriate way as we have done previously. We should not be forced into this position by a Senate which sees its self-interest being served by the modes of frustration which it now wants to enter into as a result of a motion passed at the behest of the honourable member for O'Connor&mdash;aided and abetted by Senator Bishop, it appears, who today spoke about her vision for the coalition at the Canberra Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporate mind of the opposition has been fractured; of that, there is no doubt. It is wandering about in endless circles, trying to seek leadership. But leadership will not come from the inconsistent, ill-thought out and intemperate approach which has been proposed by the Senate to try to frustrate this House. I urge the House to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 6 to 9 (1993) and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1993).</PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. As required by law, customs tariff proposals Nos. 6 to 9 and excise tariff proposal No. 2 formally place before parliament tariff alterations made by notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> during the recent parliamentary recess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly outline the amendments contained in these proposals. The changes contained in customs tariff proposal No. 6 operate on and from 1 July 1993. They give effect to the government's decision to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences, ASTP. This decision applies to textiles, clothing, footwear, chemicals, plastics, rubber and leather goods, sugar, dried fruit and fruit juice imported from all countries listed in schedule 1 to the customs tariff, except forum island countries and those countries identified by the United Nations as being least developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The developing country rates of duty for these goods have been frozen at the pre-1 July level until the general rate falls to that level. Thereafter the general rate of duty will apply. Item 53 in schedule 4 was previously created to provide phasing rates for certain goods which otherwise would be regarded as components for passenger motor vehicles and duty held at a rate of 15 per cent. The present amendment to item 53 provides appropriate phasing rates of duty for these goods, some of which are subject to the government's decision on the ASTP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to certain tariff subheadings covering spirits and liqueurs are consequential on a rationalisation of these subheadings contained in Customs Tariff Amendment Act No. 2 of 1992. The amendments apply the consumer price index adjustments of February 1993 to the rationalised subheadings which became operative on 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes contained in customs tariff proposals Nos 7 and 8 also operate on and from 1 July 1993. In proposal No. 7 the change to the new item 53a is an administrative one to clarify the government's intention that the phasing rates of duty provided by this item should apply only to goods with a duty rate of 15 per cent at 1 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal also contains a reduction of 1.013c per litre on aviation gasoline. This decrease in duty completes the phasing out of the collection of that part of the duty on aviation gasoline attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. Local community authorities will in future levy costs directly on aviation users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs tariff proposal No. 8 (1993) contains a further reduction of 2c per litre in the duty rate for aviation gasoline. This is made up of 0.7c per litre attributed to the provision of fire fighting services at aerodromes and 1.3c per litre attributed to the provision of meteorological services. In future the cost of these services will be charged directly to aircraft operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change contained in excise tariff proposal No. 2 1993 operates on and from 1 July 1993 and is complementary to the reductions in duty on aviation gasoline contained in customs tariff proposals Nos 7 and 8. In this proposal, the two reductions are combined in a single reduction of 3.013c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change contained in customs tariff proposal No. 9 operates on and from 5 July 1993. It contains a further administrative amendment to item 53a to clarify the coverage of this item. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

The Secretary to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff has advised me that, although the words in question were in the first draft of the answer dictated by the reporter, they were deleted as part of the reporter's editorial review of the answer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one whose early love of politics was nurtured in those august days of Fadden and McEwen, my journey to this place has been one of amazing satisfaction and great friendships. I have been privileged to enjoy the challenges and fellowship of the National Party of Australia and its members for over 35 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father, a country lawyer and a partner of a former Attorney-General, Sir Neil O'Sullivan, was a great lover of C. J. Dennis on the one hand and Edmund Burke on the other. More importantly, he had a great love of people&mdash;and especially those in distress. He was a friend of, and campaigned for, Artie Fadden, and it was his proud boast that literally everyone, from the Prime Minister to the paperboy, knew him by his christian name. Though he died when I was still a child, it is not surprising that some of his love of debate and people should have rubbed off on me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though no one mentor stands out in my life, I owe a debt to many tonight, not the least of whom is my mother. These include the Sisters of Mercy, the Sacred Heart Priests and the Christian Brothers, who cultivated my love of history, literature and debate. In an age when it has become fashionable to criticise the religious because of the extremism or weaknesses of a mere minority of their number, I am an unashamed apologist for what these unselfish men and women represented and their contribution to the Australian way of life. Might I also say that the right wing of the ALP has no monopoly on the Irish vote, if indeed such a thing still exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I owe a debt to my early days in the Young Nationals, whose state president I was fortunate to become in 1969; to the marvellous characters of the party in Warwick, Bundaberg, Wide Bay and, more recently, Hinkler&mdash;not least amongst whom was Clarrie Millar, a former deputy speaker of this House whose divisional council chairman I was for many years&mdash;and to those who saw me safely to this place, my campaign director, Rod Wilson, and his deputy, Kym Mobbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite speak of the light on the hill. We all have our beacons, some ephemeral concepts, some gutsy, unsung Australians. In this latter category, I place my electorate council chairman, Dick Bitcon, who, without the least personal gain, steered the National Party in two federal divisions through the rigours of the Whitlam years and Queensland's post-Fitzgerald trauma, never at any time losing sight of the goal or the role yet to be played by conservatives in conservative politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swing to the National Party in Hinkler against the tide of the election was a combination of the hardworking branches on the one hand and the good judgment of the electorate which was not going to bow to the scare and fear tactics of the anti-Fightback campaign on the other. Their verdict was vindicated in the horrendous budget of just two nights ago. A two-party preferred swing was evident in 70 of Hinkler's 79 booths, and no less so than in the industrial suburb of East Bundaberg, my home suburb, which voted conservative&mdash;to the best of my knowledge&mdash;for the first time in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in politics no-one comes to this place or survives happily in it without the support of a loving family. In this regard, I am singularly fortunate to have a loving partner and co-worker in my wife, Margaret, who campaigned fearlessly for me, and my five children of diverse and individualistic character, two of whom are with me tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in terms of the election itself, there are forces beyond us that give us the drive and ability to be here. I share very much the philosophy of the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) as to why we are here. There are few prizes in life that a loving God has denied me. The thing which is hardest to accept is that it is more often in his time scale rather than mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to state my personal political philosophy in not seeing success as steps on a ladder or the manipulation of circumstances or friendships for personal gain, but rather being a participant in the quest for the hearts and minds of men&mdash;the great mass of the silent majority of Australians.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in turn, leads me to the character of Sir Thomas More who, paraphrased by Robert Bolt, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When statesmen forsake their private conscience for the sake of their public duties they lead their country by a short route to chaos.</PARA>
<PARA>Never, might I suggest, have these words been more apt in an Australian context than at present. While all parties share a degree of blame in this regard, there is no more shameful an example of it as the March federal election and what we have seen in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was reinforced, in my mind, by the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS> series. It was great TV and brilliant drama but, as an insight into the honesty or otherwise of politicians, it was a chilling indictment. That the environmental movement could have been manipulated so cynically or that economists with sound ideas, honestly held, could have been branded and dismissed as economic illiterates must surely weigh heavily on the `private' consciences of those who ran that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I add that if we subjugate our traditions, practices, conventions and laws to concepts which we know will not be honoured by those who would impose them on us, what is gained? I accept that there are certain conventions which affect Australia's near neighbours and our place in the world at large&mdash;the environment, laws of the air and sea, matters of trade&mdash;to which we must, of necessity and responsibility, subscribe. However, when it comes to standards of behaviour, human interaction, rights and the practice of faith, we should not become the playthings of the social engineers and the twisted practitioners of political correctness. If we have the will or, as Thomas More put it, `the spittle' to enhance the status of the woman and the child, to dispense social justice more equitably, to eliminate racial vilification or to enshrine freedom of religion, we need to do it in our way. These are distinctively Australian responsibilities and should be exercised by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries have diverse social, religious and legal traditions which we respect but might not necessarily adopt. I suspect that many lofty concepts enshrined in the external powers treaties are likely to be honoured more in the breach or in the manipulation of their real intent. Reducing Australia, its character and independence to a spirit of wimpish subservience is, to me, totally offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In belatedly congratulating Mr Speaker on his elevation to high office, and thanking his predecessor, the honourable member for Watson (Mr McLeay) for his many courtesies and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for giving me his timeslot tonight, may I outline a thumbnail sketch of my electorate of Hinkler. It is an electorate of some 41,000 square kilometres. It is a comparatively new seat, having been carved out of the old seats of Wide Bay and Capricornia in 1984. I have the good fortune to be its third member. Its principal centres are the cities of Bundaberg and Gladstone and 10 shires. Tonight I wear the tie of the shire of Gooburrum as a tribute to those 10 shires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, in 1982, in conjunction with history and aviation buffs Lex Rowland and Tom Quinn&mdash;the presence of the latter I acknowledge in the House tonight&mdash;we were commissioned by the Bundaberg bicentennial committee to investigate the removal of Bert Hinkler's house from Southampton in the United Kingdom to Australia as a bicentennial project. Fortuitously, but not without some difficulty, we were successful. The house was painstakingly dismantled brick by brick, loaded into two 20-tonne containers and, on 20 June 1983, transported to Australia. It was rebuilt to the original architect's plans in what is now Bundaberg's botanical gardens. It has become a repository of priceless Australian aviation memorabilia. Replete with exquisite 1920s decor, it captures the mood of a man who excited the world with his daring solo flights in the 1920s and the 1930s. It is a living memorial to the indomitable spirit of Hinkler, who ranks with Charles Kingsford-Smith as Australia's greatest pioneer aviator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I interpose here that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) has long been a dedicated supporter and ambassador for this project over many years. It was out of this process that Tom Quinn and others were possessed to suggest that one of the new seats in the 1984 redistribution be named after Bert Hinkler. Honourable members can imagine then the strange sense of irony and humility I feel here tonight in representing the electorate that only nine years ago I played a part in naming. But, far more than this, Hinkler is a symbol of the spirit of the communities I represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one over-riding characteristic which distinguishes Bundaberg from the other communities of Australia, and that is its extraordinary commitment to excellence and innovation. As if it was not enough that people like Hinkler, Moncrieff and Tallon emerged from humble beginnings in that town, each in turn electrifying the world with their talent, it has yet another dimension&mdash;that of unbelievable home-grown innovation. Let me name a few: Bundaberg Sugar and Bundaberg rum; Austoft, dominating 70 per cent of the world's sugar cane harvester production; Bonel Ltd, a new player in waste disposal technology; Eric Bauer, a pioneer in genetic behaviour control in floriculture; Avtech, the aviation engineers who pioneered Australia's first certified fibreglass aircraft; and Electra Breweries, which exports to New Zealand and Asian markets&mdash;wait for it Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;180 containers of ginger beer per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said for the city of Gladstone, but it has its own distinctive character of youth, drive and enthusiasm&mdash;the envy of other cities. Often called the `engine room' of Queensland, it is marked to become a new industrial leader. There is no empty rhetoric in this: Gladstone and its adjoining shire of Calliope are host to the emerging giants of Australian manufacturing. Queensland Alumina and the Boyne Smelters each boast a value adding factor of 10 to their finished products, an enviable performance by any standards. The importance of this group and Comalco's $1.75 billion expansion make the resolution of the Mabo and Wik claims all the more relevant and urgent, though the substance of this debate is a matter for another time. Minproc with its cyanide technology, and ICI whose ammonium nitrate plant will be opened by the premier tomorrow, are major players in an industry adding a new dimension to central Queensland, as is Stickmakers, and Queensland Cement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A host of other companies in the resource and processing areas have been attracted to Gladstone by its abundant power, gas and electrified rail system. But its great linchpin is Gladstone harbour and the progressive Gladstone Port Authority. This is Australia's fastest growing deepwater port, responsible for 5 per cent of the nation's export earnings, and I appeal to government not to look on it as a convenient hollow log or a corporatised milking cow, but rather as an independent and highly motivated authority which provides a regional stimulus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the west of the electorate lies one of Queensland's most dynamic townships, Biloela, a comparatively new player in some respects, but already playing a pivotal role as the commercial centre for the coalfields of Moura and Theodore, and the agricultural wealth of the Dawson and Callide valleys. It is here that another unique tourist attraction lies in waiting&mdash;the Advance Australia Fair project. This has the potential to be to agricultural Australia what the Stockman's Hall of Fame was to the outback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Successive federal governments have paid lip service to the concept but have refused funding through supposed inability. In the light of the $26 million allocated to the museum of Australia and an increase of 12 per cent in funding for the arts on Tuesday night, the case against it by this government just does not hold up. I will be pressing for the completion of this unique Australian project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I go on to the hardy people of Monto. It was just four weeks ago, after storming a Queensland railways train, that 600 angry citizens served notice on the state government in their public hall that their railway line was not going to be closed. Monto is now synonymous with the movement that says the denuding of country centres by thoughtless and uncaring governments must stop. Monto, Eidsvold, Mount Perry, Childers and Gin Gin are all indicative of those marvellous towns that epitomise the spirit and character of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the closing of court houses, the downgrading of police stations, the removal of DPI officers and the selling off of post offices are testament to an insensitive bureaucracy. These facilities are the human face of government in remote areas; they are part of the fabric of the community. It has never been more so than now in times of recession, rural debt, low commodity prices and drought. I join with those who say enough is enough: hands off rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to my final theme: regional development. No more nonsense has been spoken of, and no more sins have been committed, than in the name of regional development. It is no less so than in the current regional development task force of the government. While not reflecting on the individual capacities of its members, it is scarcely believable that a committee of 11, charged with examining regional development, could be made up of seven from capital cities with only one professional regional development practitioner amongst their number. Hopping as they do from one part of Australia to another, they are developing a recipe for superficiality. The government would do well to reflect on the workings of the Kennedy inquiry into the QTTC and to examine its methods of submission, consultation, inquiry and interaction with key players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ingredients for regional development are not bureaucratic lines on maps, the selective picking of winners or setting up so-called regional government offices. The bases for regional development are the need for a wider community of interest, a commonality of purpose, a set of local authorities that can work together, a focal administrative centre, an integrated transport system, and a range of media networking in and over the regional area. Above all, the region must have the confidence and contribution of commercial, manufacturing and rural enterprises in the area. It cannot be imposed from above. While these criteria may seem self-evident, they are seldom invoked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regions can be based on economic development, tourism or both. This is my field of expertise where I have spent the last 22 years. I take great pride that two of Queensland's, if not Australia's, most successful regional organisations cover my electorate&mdash;the Bundaberg District Tourism and Development Board and the Gladstone Area Promotion Inc. Both are joint tourism and development boards and cover between them 15 local authorities. I make a plea to state and federal governments that support for these organisations should be delivered in three ways: sales tax exemption on resource and promotional items; core practitioner funding for their research and development activities; and targeted government programs which are not stifled by endless bureaucracy and reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, OLMA has worked most successfully through these organisations, and I commend ministers Beazley and Free for the creative and unobtrusive programs that are being delivered. These programs are capable of sourcing opportunities, testing feasibilities, structuring projects and driving up employment and training based incubation projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism plays a pivotal role in my electorate, as well it might. Over the last decade the area has emerged as the southern gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. The focus of this anchor product are three coral cays, Lady Elliot Island, Lady Musgrave Island and Heron Island. As fuel prices are driven skywards and disposable income tightens, southern demand for these unbelievably beautiful gems of the Barrier Reef is certain to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four surf clubs service eastern Australia's most northern surfing beaches stretching from Woodgate through Bargara and Agnes Water to Tannum Sands. This is a region in which water sports and maritime activities are paramount&mdash;be that fishing fleets in Gladstone and Bundaberg, rowing, sailing, boarding, or an ocean classic like the Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race. At the electorate's gateways, the Port Curtis Historical Village and the Childers Pharmacy museum are samples of the wide ranges of natural and man-made attractions that include Australia's leading herb farm, a tropical winery, a koala park, a cooperage, museums and national parks. Add to this the turtle rookery of Mon Repos, the whales of Platypus Bay, and the Group A motor racing circuit planned for Gladstone and we have all the ingredients of a great region.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can understand then, Mr Deputy Speaker, the obvious pleasure I have in representing such a desirable and progressive area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, we live in changing times. I have outlined earlier what I consider is Australia's responsibility to itself. The ingredient I have not mentioned is honesty and truth in government. So many beat-up minority issues have clouded the body politic as to make it unrecognisable.

<PARA>In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building On Strength</EMPHASIS> the government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a seniors health card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soon after, the government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill will meet the second part of that commitment by introducing a seniors health card from 1 July 1994 that will give certain older low income non-pensioner retirees access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits and to hearing aid concessions. It is estimated that this initiative will assist 200,000 people. Other health related legislation will also mean that seniors health card holders will be entitled to dental and optometry services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of the pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for persons who had previously received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. At that time, the government decided that as an interim measure certain persons were to be eligible for payment of advances of that allowance. The government has now decided that the period in which advances of payment of pharmaceutical allowance will be payable should be further extended until 31 December 1994. This bill gives effect to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since coming to office in 1983, much has been achieved in assisting Australian families. For example, the government introduced the family allowance supplement and later integrated family payments for children so as to reduce poverty traps, improve work incentives for low income families, increase the take-up rate of the family payment for low income families with children and help families to budget better. The government remains committed to protecting and enhancing the interests of families. However, it is important that this be achieved equitably and targeted towards those people who are most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that the use of taxable income alone might not be a reliable basis upon which to determine entitlement to certain social security payments. For example, some people receive benefits from their employer such as a car or rent-free housing but do not pay any tax on them because the definition of `taxable income' in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 does not exclude the value of such benefits. Instead, the employer is subject to fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for a family payment under the Social Security Act 1991, a person must satisfy an income test. Similarly, a person aged under 18 who applies for a jobsearch allowance or a sickness allowance is subject to a parental income test. At present, both of these income tests are based on taxable income that is defined to mean the same as in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. As a result, these income tests do not take account of employer provided fringe benefits. This means that some people who have a high income in real terms can still pass the income tests. This gives an unfair advantage to those people who receive income in the form of fringe benefits rather than as wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the government decided in the 1992-93 budget to amend the Social Security Act 1991 from 1 January 1994 to make sure that the income tests for family payment and the parental income test for jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance claimants aged under 18 take account of certain employer fringe benefits. The benefits that will be assessable are employer provided motor vehicles, housing, loans, school fees and private health insurance. The value of the benefits of a person and the person's partner, or parent as the case may be, will be added together and anything in excess of $1,000 will be taken into account. If the combined total is less than that amount it will be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of where inequity can arise is where, despite having similar levels of income, one family can be advantaged over another merely because the source of some or all of their income is overseas. The foreign income might not form part of their taxable income upon which entitlement to family payment is based. This can occur, for instance, because one parent works overseas and is not resident in Australia for the purposes of Australian taxation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, the Social Security Act 1991 is to be amended with effect from 1 January 1994 to allow certain foreign income to be taken into account when assessing a person's entitlement to family payment. This measure will not affect families receiving social security pensions or benefits or service pensions as overseas income is already taken into account in the assessment of their rate of pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many social security pensioners receive foreign income. That income must be converted to Australian dollars to calculate the rate of Australian pension payable. Currently, unless exceptional circumstances prevail, the foreign currency provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 enable the exchange rates used for this purpose to be changed only four times a year. However, due to the needs based nature of Australia's social security system, we must be more flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the foreign currency conversion provisions in the act so that they will be more responsive to frequent or sudden movements in exchange rates. A new exchange rate for each nominated currency will be set every pension pay day, based on the market exchange rate available at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on the previous pay day. If there is no such rate for that pay day, for example, because of a national public holiday, the rate used will be the market exchange rate that applied on the last working day immediately before that pay day. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight this chamber and the Australian people were treated to a pathetic and shrill tirade of abuse from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) against a budget which set out to bring sound economic management to the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition began his speech by inviting his listeners to think back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought back to Fightback, his policy that was launched before the last federal election&mdash;Fightback, with its goods and services tax of 15 per cent on everything except the basic necessities of life. I thought about the education policy in Fightback of up-front fees. I thought about his attitude to Medicare and health care in this country contained in Fightback. I thought about his pledge to cut $10 billion from budgetary expenditure which was set out in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought about defence. We have an internal document prepared by the Department of Defence which shows convincingly that $850 million would have been cut from defence expenditure over a three-year period under Fightback. I thought about unemployment under Fightback and the threat to cut off the dole after nine months. I thought about industrial relations and his threats to the award and arbitration systems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, I thought back. The Leader of the Opposition said, `Think back', and I thought back to his policies contained in Fightback. The Leader of the Opposition then went on with that slangy little slogan of his to falsely accuse the government of not caring. I thought to myself: what utter hypocrisy, coming from a speaker who conceived and developed the Fightback document wherein there is not one essence of care, sympathy or vision for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition talks about justice. I challenge him to tell me where is there justice in liberal party history; to tell me where was the justice during the Fraser years of high unemployment; to tell me where there was justice in interest rates when business people, including myself, were paying interest rates of 23 per cent on commercial bills over a three-month period. Talk about justice under the Liberal Party. It is the antithesis of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response we had from the Leader of the Opposition tonight was simply a whingeing, whining, shrill, pathetic tirade containing no policy at all, but full of histrionics and virtually word for word what he gave to the rabble crowds that he gathered during the lead-up to the election. Indeed, the attitude of some of the more ambitious Liberals was shown by Senator Bishop who came into this chamber to hear the Leader of the Opposition's response to the budget, but she walked out during his speech, obviously full of contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has brought down a budget that is the essence of good government. The opposition would do well to study this budget intently&mdash;it might learn valuable lessons in preparing itself before it takes its new policies to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's budget expertly balances the constraints of economics with the legitimate aspirations of the Australian people. It is a budget that meets the commitments made to provide sound government. It provides compassion and hope to those impacted by economic restructuring, and sets out a strategy to bring the deficit down to around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a budget that has introduced a $2 billion extra stimulus in 1993-94 to aid economic recovery. It will maintain and sustain moderate growth in the economy, which at 3.3 per cent per annum is the best in the OECD countries. It will do this, while keeping inflation at the lowest level for 30 years, and interest rates at their lowest in 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much deceitful comment from those opposite that this budget is unfair to low and middle income earners. When the Treasurer's tax cuts take effect from 1 November, those on $600 a week will be $8 a week better off&mdash;more than $400 a year. After November, a middle income earner on $600 a week&mdash;$31,000 a year&mdash;will be $6 a week better off than had the coalition won government and implemented its tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been ill-informed comment about the supposed regressive nature of the budget's indirect tax increases. Let us take tobacco. Fightback proposed a 25 per cent immediate hike in tobacco excise compared with the Treasurer's responsible staged three per cent approach. Fightback 2 detailed a $257 million tax grab for 1994-95&mdash;well over twice that implemented by the government. The coalition's bedfellows, the Australian Medical Association, called for a 40 per cent increase in tobacco prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lead is an equally serious health and environmental problem in our community. It is equally serious because of the involuntary nature of exposure, the insidious effect of lead on young children and the particular impact on lower income groups, especially&mdash;but not only&mdash;in inner city areas. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Treasurer are to be congratulated for their approach to tackling this problem which involves lowering lead levels in leaded petrol, as well as providing an incentive for motorists to use unleaded petrol. It is important to keep petrol prices in perspective. Australia has, and will continue to have, one of the lowest prices for petrol of any nation. Just recently in my electorate the price of petrol plummeted to 54.9c per litre for super grade petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has, and will continue to have, one of the lowest prices of petrol for any nation. The increase in the price of petrol of 3c a litre for the average motorist travelling less than 17,000 kilometres a year will cost less than $1 a week. The coalition's user-pays philosophy to road charging, while promising cheaper petrol, could have led to toll roads being established all over the country, and registration fees for the likes of a Commodore or Falcon well in excess of what we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the opposition's response to this budget&mdash;apart from the irrational tirade we heard this evening from the Leader of the Opposition? The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as reported by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 18 August, said that we would have been better off with a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House of what would have happened if the Australian people had been incautious enough to let the coalition implement its GST package. On its own figures in Fightback, the government would have already spent $10 million on GST administration, and would be intending to spend $94 million next year and $125 million the year after. Anyone who has experience in establishing computer systems of the complexity needed to run a national GST would be aware of the probability that these figures would have grossly underestimated the administrative costs. Having had some experience with the GST and its administration in Canada, I can vouch for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, these costs would have been only the tip of the iceberg. Every small business in Australia would have been swamped with paperwork in keeping track of GST costs and discounts. A new billion dollar accounting burden was ready to be inflicted on Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 March the Australian people rejected the GST; they rejected the notion of burying Australian business in barrow loads of paper. They knew that the costs of this would ultimately be borne by consumers&mdash;as it is in every country where there is a GST. The Australian people rejected the inequity that wholesale sales taxes on luxury goods would be reduced, while a 15 per cent tax would be introduced on basic goods and services, with the exception of basic necessities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo has learnt nothing from the election. He reads the Treasurer's fine budget and says that we would have been better off with the GST. That remark was published on page 12 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on 18 August 1993. I table the document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo says that it is a nasty budget that attacks low income Australians in particular. The truth of the matter is that Australians have been spared the sight of the vicious budget that the coalition had planned. The coalition would have ripped $3 billion out of the government expenditure this year, and $8 billion in 1994-95. These cuts were to be made mainly to the social security and health system. So much for the opposition's skin deep affection for the less fortunate members of society. So much for the Leader of the Opposition's pathetic cry tonight that the government does not care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policies on youth wages of $3 an hour for 15- to 17-year-olds, rising to $3.50 an hour for 18- to 20-year-olds, would have drastically impacted on youth income from part-time work&mdash;income essential to many students to remain in education and training. The coalition's policies on vouchers and fees would have priced higher education beyond many students. The coalition's plans to axe training programs for long-term unemployed would have confined many active, capable people who have lost their jobs through economic restructuring to the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight the Leader of the Opposition talked about lower standards. The lower standards occurred under the previous Liberal administration from 1975 to 1983. They were the times when there was a very low participation rate in higher education. In my own area of North Queensland the participation rate for tertiary education was less than one-third; today it is one-half. There has been a 117 per cent increase in participation in higher education at James Cook University. For the fifth month running unemployment is falling. That is what is happening. That is the reality. </PARA>

An OECD analysis of the problems of unemployment throughout the developed world has highlighted the importance of active labour market programs. Most of the long-term unemployed in Australia that have regained employment have participated in government training programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's approach of cutting off the dole after nine months was spiteful and ignorant. Given the continued need for micro-economic reform to overcome the residual stagnation of 30 years of agrarian socialism of this country&mdash;I have said this before about the National Party&mdash;the proper role for government is to provide support and to facilitate the early return to the work force of those who have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the opposition's response? It is to blame the unemployed; it is to call for the restructuring the coalition is so anxious to claim credit for promoting. It is harder to undertake the restructuring, taking proper consideration for those who are adversely impacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's industry policy was as bereft of understanding as its social policies. The management consultant McKinsey, in a report for the Australian Manufacturing Council, pointed out that much of the impetus for our recent export growth has come from 700 small to medium sized manufacturing exporters. These companies earned over $8 billion in 1990-91, double the level of four years earlier. McKinsey reported that 90 per cent of Australia's manufacturers, over 6,000 firms, are not exporting but could be. McKinsey found a fundamental gap between exporters and those not exporting. There was an information gap and a role for government programs to address this gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the coalition's response to the needs of small to medium sized companies, firms that potentially could enjoy the growth rates of the McKinsey exporters?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to this. Mr John Prescott of BHP has played a major and important role in transforming the culture of Australian industry. Yet again, the coalition has totally ignored the significance of this culture, which is important in commerce, just as much as in any other aspect of life. It touches not only workplace practices but also management practices. The Australian Manufacturing Council has played a significant role in the evolution of a new workplace culture in Australia, one based around best practice in all aspects of the operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This transformation is just as important for the non-trade exposed sector of the economy as it is for the import competing and export sectors. The Australian Manufacturing Council, which the coalition would have abolished, has played a distinctive and meritorious role in the transformation of Australian industry. I salute John Prescott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) should be congratulated for his role in gaining a $94.5 million package to address the needs of small and medium sized firms. In my own electorate, I am aware that small and medium sized businesses often do not have access to the information and consulting services more readily available in metropolitan cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key element of the minister's expanded industry services is the establishment of an on-line computer service called Business-link. Business-link will provide firms with ready access to information about government programs, services and potential export markets wherever they are in Australia. Business-link and the associated first-stop shops, which we heard the minister refer to at question time today, will receive funding of $7.9 million over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business-link will add a new dimension to one of the most successful Commonwealth-state programs, the national industry extension service. NIES, as it is known, is administered at a local level by the states and frequently involves services delivered by the private sector and industry associations, particularly the Confederation of Australian Industry. The Commonwealth, through the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, has provided NIES with national leadership and has coordinated a national program design. The coalition would have abolished NIES funding and left it to wither as an uncoordinated set of state programs without national leadership. By contrast, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development has been able to attain an extra $12.5 million for NIES to expand its services to small and regionally based firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry programs announced in the budget build on 10 years of established and sound industry policy. It is worth while taking the time to reflect where we were 10 years ago. In 1982-83, manufactured exports were slightly over $4 billion, only a fifth of all merchandise exports. Agrarian socialism, as practised by the National Party in particular through its influence on the Fraser government, had led Australians to wonder whether the nation had a future in manufacturing, whether we could participate in the fastest growing area of world trade. Our industrial technology was so decrepit that only with one of the highest levels of protection in the OECD could our manufacturers compete even on domestic markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years we have seen the revitalisation of our manufacturing sector. This is not only in export performance but also in quality, technology, price competitiveness and import replacement. The government does not see increased exports as the sole objective of industrial restructuring. International competitiveness is just as important in the domestic sector, but exports are fundamentally important in the economic revitalisation and the long-term growth and sustainability of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important budget. It is a budget for the future of Australia that will succeed. It will succeed because it has been crafted with great care and on the best professional advice that is available in the interests of Australia as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget document presented by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on Tuesday night was tough, but so are the economic times. It was therefore appropriate. Since Tuesday night there has been a tremendous hue and cry, as in every year, about how the world will now end. Indeed, so many people are running around saying that the sky is falling in one would think that they are students of the henny penny university doing a field exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, there are two ways in which a budget can be framed. First, one can view 18 million Australians as economic units of labour; secondly, one can view 18 million Australians as real people with real lives. This government chooses the second course. As I understand it, the coalition chooses the first course. Many honourable members opposite will insist that this is not so. They will insist that they do care, and I am sure that some of them do&mdash;some of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, I am sure that the coalition frontbench believes that Australia is only an economic machine. Feeding this machine are economic resources: money, oil, metals, men, women, plastics, pork belly futures. They do not differentiate between people and things. If one thinks like the coalition front bench, it is very clear that our budget problems can be dealt with quite easily: cut education and training, tell the unemployed to get on their bikes and get a job, scrap all independent protection for employees and tell them to look after themselves, compete with workers in south China, while simultaneously taking a pay cut because humans are cheaper in south China factories, and privately pay insurance for health. It is simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big flaw with this coalition view of life is that people will not allow themselves to be treated with contempt. If people are treated as objects and dumped when it suits&mdash;when there is a better offer or when some glorious future beckons&mdash;those that have been treated badly will fight back. The Australian population did. They voted for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amazed that the coalition has not learnt this lesson and applied it to Australia as a whole. Honourable members on this side of the House realise that people will not let us treat them with contempt. This knowledge is the great constricting force in drawing up a budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all the difficult external and economic factors current today, the budget has done credit to the Treasurer. Very piously, honourable members opposite accuse the government of being dishonest, so let us look at the achievements contained in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government promised to lower the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, and that has happened. That reduction in the tax burden on companies will enhance the ability of companies to invest in Australia. With respect to the personal income tax cuts, the government very honestly rejected the calls to abandon them. Instead, it took the advice of Dr FitzGerald and brought the first round of cuts forward to 1 November 1993. That was done to reduce economic overheating in the medium term, and those on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major trading nation, we are extremely exposed to outside forces. I never hear members of the opposition speak about this major economic fact. I never hear them admit that some less than perfect results in Australia have come about because of factors outside the control of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition presents itself as a body of economic geniuses. It is all so simple for the opposition. I invite someone from the coalition to speak eventually on the topic of how foreign factors really do have a major influence on economic outcomes in Australia&mdash;outcomes that are unfavourable and over which we have no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's economic policy a general investment allowance was promised. It was delivered. The allowance was designed to encourage an upturn in investment by providing a short-term incentive for business to purchase new plant and equipment. This general investment allowance operates in addition to normal rates of depreciation and the 10 per cent development allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members will be aware that the work and home situations of women in Australia have dramatically changed over the last 20 years. This government's child-care programs are a credit to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the cabinet. The programs recognise the real needs of working parents for high quality, accessible and affordable care for their children. It is an industrial issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period from 1983 to 1993 the number of government funded places has risen from 46,000 to 208,000. Commonwealth child-care assistance now makes child care affordable for over 175,000 families&mdash;low income families. The government has constantly supported this policy and has not backed away. The benefits of this policy are direct and immediate for large numbers of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's budget contained four further initiatives in this field. In a move to meet the demands of work related child care places by the year 2001, the government will enter into direct partnerships with local government and community groups to provide 500 centre based community long day care places. In addition, 7,000 out of school hours care places and 4,000 family day care places will be provided. These will contribute towards the expected overall increase in 1993-94 of 29,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that a cash rebate, free of incomes test and providing up to $28.20 per week for one child and $61.20 for two children or more, will be introduced on 1 July 1994 for all work related child care expenses for children up to 12 years where both parents or the sole parent are working, in training or looking for work. This initiative is expected to benefit 230,000 families and 358,000 children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that, following the evaluation of a pilot program, an emergency care scheme for sick children will be implemented over the next three years. The fourth and final point is that, because of the rapid growth in this field, the standard of quality care will now be established and supervised by a national child care accreditation council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These four points are an indication that the government does stick to its word. This policy may not impress those opposite but for the hundreds of thousands of Australian families and children who will benefit from it they are very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in its modern and decent approach to society, the government recognises that many women choose to stay at home to care for their children, especially while their children are young. This government recognises and responds to the different patterns of women's lives and supports their choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From September 1994 the government will pay the home child care allowance of $60 per fortnight. My only wish is that this payment could be higher. Certainly, the work that is done by mothers at home is often not appreciated, and yet it is the most valuable. I assure honourable members that no matter how tired they get it is not a jot on the tiredness and hard work of mothers who choose to stay at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because some women move in and out of the work force and often do part-time work, this allowance will be available for part of the year. This flexibility will assist around 120,000 families at one time. We should certainly give support to those mothers who stay at home nurturing our young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further $1.5 million will be spent over the next three years to help provide 300 new playgroups, and this will benefit 50,000 families. The Prime Minister made a promise to the women of Australia and he did not let them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The easing of the pensions assets test for older Australians will be a great boon in my electorate where I have many non-pensioner retirees who are income poor but assets strong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the opposition has reflected the anger of all Australians by signalling its intention to vote against the increases in petrol excise, the increases in wholesale sales tax incorporated in the budget, the increase in the tax on wine and the retrospective taxes on long service leave. This move has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the opposition to reflect that anger felt by all Australians that they have been let down by this government having regard to the promises that were put forward during the election campaign. I also make it clear, on behalf of the opposition, that it is not the intention to block supply. Let us be absolutely crystal clear about this intention. Let no Labor member or any commentator suggest that that is the intention of the opposition on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The 1993-94 Keating-Dawkins budget has provided a golden opportunity, immediately after the election, to put Australia on a better course than had been the case over the last 10 years of this Labor government. The Keating government went to the people on 13 March on a platform of not increasing any taxes and a clear promise to give cuts in personal income taxes in two stages. This budget sees fuel excises increase dramatically, raising $5.2 billion over the next four years, with no regard to the owners of older cars who will largely bear the cost and who, I have no doubt, have been ringing members of the government to express their anger and frustration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a budget of over $115 billion, with revenue of $99 billion, the overdraft of $16 billion is a further increase from last year's deficit of $14.6 billion. There has been a further slide in the government's budgetary position, not an improvement as government commentators and government members have been trying to make the Australian public believe. The revenue that this government will collect from taxpayers is nearly a quarter of Australia's gross domestic product, 23.5 per cent to be exact, and this is only one-tenth of one per cent less than last year. So much for the government's tax comparisons with other nations to which it has been so keen to draw the House's attention, to take away the impression that the government has not increased taxes. The government has put great store on the projected deficit, which is 3.8 per cent of Australia's yearly output, and it hopes to get the figure to around 1.1 per cent by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Use of the word `around' in Treasury's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Overview and Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> booklet is a change from the government's previous position that it would get the deficit down to an unqualified one per cent of output within four years. The difference is not just a case of being pedantic. Higher government spending, particularly when it is on consumption and not on infrastructure, adds billions that Australia already owes to the bankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is increasingly trading with the world, although we are only increasing our exports to them at a rate which is about half as fast as many of the East Asian nations are growing. Although the performance of the world economy is important, we must not forget it was the maintenance by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of unnecessarily high interest rates through part of the 1980s that also contributed to our long running recession, not just a slowdown in the world economy. The world economy affects Australia, but it is not the final arbiter of Australia's financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States there has been some recovery, but it still has some severe problems with its twin deficits difficulty&mdash;domestic and international. Japan, now a major trading partner of Australia, has changed its government of 28 years and has responded to the collapse of its share market last year with a major transfer of the people's savings to that particular capital market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 340 million people now in the European Community's single market form a trading bloc dominated by the Brussels bureaucracy. The failure of the exchange rate mechanism will lead to further pressures in Europe which could be good for Australia and build on some of our strengths. Asian growth rates are good, but there is some overheating with interest rates and inflation, although generally mild compared with some of Australia's past and present difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his budget speech laid the blame for Australia's economic difficulties on world trading conditions rather than on his own government's policies and ineptitude. Max Walsh in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Wednesday this week agreed with my view about this latest budget, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government has ducked the tough decisions in the vain hope that it will be rescued by Asian dynamism and a wider world recovery. . .  A round robin of stealing from Peter to pay Paul on the tax front falls far short of that challenge . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the smoke and mirrors act, there is almost a complete absence of any praise for this budget as possessing any long-term vision. Labor backbenchers are appalled at the virtual lack of any tax cut for lower income earners. Just as importantly, many Australians are deeply sceptical of the ability of the government to deliver the reduction in the federal deficit that the government claims it can do over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth is the engine room of recovery. A short 18 months ago the One Nation statement predicted Australia would grow by 4.75 per cent in the year just ended. In last year's budget, this forecast was lowered to three per cent. We now find that the nation increased its output of goods and services last year by only 2.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that, for this year, the Prime Minister demanded that the original growth forecast in the budget be revised upwards from 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent, despite his Treasurer's objections. The most crucial component of economic growth, private sector net investment, fell by 3.8 per cent last year, despite having been predicted to grow by two per cent. The fall in new private capital expenditure has been almost 20 per cent over the past two years, and there is little sign of any recovery in this private sector investment, which is crucial to encourage any recovery. Without increasing business investment, no new jobs will be created and there will be no lasting recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing fall in the trade-weighted index is of concern to all thinking Australians. It measures the value of our currency against those of our major trading partners. It has halved since May 1970. Its decrease might deliver some temporary benefits to our export industries as it makes Australian goods and services cheaper for overseas buyers, but in the long term, Australia desperately needs a strong currency, which would be the best stamp of economic approval that the rest of the world could deliver. They would be concluding that Australia is a good long-term investment for their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second stage of the tax cuts that the Prime Minister said were law, l-a-w, in statute, and immutable, have now been placed in the political never-never, saving the government $1.4 billion in 1995-96 and $3.5 billion in 1996-97. The 3.6 per cent of Australia's output that this budget deficit represents is an historically high figure. There is hardly any cause for joy even if we can believe all the government's forecasts, because the supposed $5.8 billion budget deficit in 1996-97, at 1.1 per cent of gross domestic product, is above the one per cent that Dr Vince Fitzgerald, author of the recent report on savings, said was the bare minimum required to stabilise foreign debt. However, the Treasury's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Overview and Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> report says that the government&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has committed itself to reducing the budget deficit to around 1 per cent by 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Prime Minister said in this House yesterday that it would be irresponsible, fanatical, extremist and wrong to impose further spending cuts, and called anyone who wanted to reduce spending still further `an extremist or a fool'. The Prime Minister should remember that all Australians, including exporters, have to eventually pay the interest bill on our $170 billion overseas debt that keeps increasing over time. The government has increased its spending by a further 3.9 per cent after inflation this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol excise price rises of an immediate 3c a litre, with the price of unleaded fuel going up by a total of 10c a litre by two years from today, as well as the immediate increase of one per cent in sales tax, will increase inflation. Less than six months ago, the coalition promised to end fuel excise, with the Prime Minister replying that, under his government, there would be no increases in indirect taxes. Honourable members could well recall that during the election campaign the Prime Minister made such a claim. Yet this budget document gives a lie to that particular policy promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government admits that these tax rises will heighten inflation, now forecast to rise from one per cent to 3.5 per cent. This will be mainly due to the rise in these indirect taxes. Treasurer Dawkins makes much of Australia's low inflation and what he calls a low interest rate. However, included in the budget are indirect tax increases which will raise Australia's inflation rate above that of many of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol and diesel price rises will hit rural industries the hardest. Evidence presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure inquiry on aspects of heavy road vehicle charges, which reported in December 1992, suggested road freight costs, as a proportion of total industry costs, were high for the meat and milk industries, at 6.7 per cent, for petroleum products, at 6.25 per cent, and for food processing, at five per cent. As members of the House would be aware, transport costs are a very important factor in how competitive Australia is. The raising of these fuel taxes adds to our lack of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Mining Industry Council made a number of pertinent points in its April 1993 submission to the government's Economic Planning Advisory Council. Mining and mineral processing accounts for about 10 per cent of Australia's total output, against only two per cent 30 years ago. Mining provides 51 per cent of our merchandise export earnings. Therefore, AMIC's views are very worthy of consideration. AMIC had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An alternative approach to addressing the Budget deficit based on raising indirect tax revenue and perhaps deferring tax cuts is inferior to the expenditure restraint approach in terms of its implications for economic efficiency, investment incentives and economic growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Yet we find that this government has gone directly against that very sound advice from an industry which, in earning export dollars, faces great uncertainty due to the government's inept handling of issues arising from the two Mabo High Court decisions. The budget papers contain an interesting discussion on the recession and its aftermath. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Analysis suggests that external factors operating through trade in goods and services . . . may have been less of an influence on the timing of the recession than on the subdued nature of the recovery . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is Treasuryspeak for suggesting that Prime Minister Keating was responsible for leading Australia into the recession, but we cannot continue to blame the rest of the world for our difficulties in climbing out of the black hole into which Australia has been thrown by the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are always saying that Australia is part of Asia, especially because nearly 60 per cent of our exports go there. Why should we not therefore compare our economic performance with that of east Asia? Comparing ourselves with Asia confirms just how poorly we are doing. How we can we give maximum encouragement to our mining, agricultural, service and manufacturing industries when our real interest rates are seven per cent against a 4.5 per cent average for the 10 nations in east Asia? Consider east Asia's average taxation rate of 15 per cent as against Australia's rate of 22 per cent. Achieving the six per cent economic growth that east Asia enjoys, instead of the 2.75 per cent that we achieved last year and which is forecast by this government to be achieved this year, would cover three-quarters of the government's deficit for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need more savings and investment, as Dr Fitzgerald pointed out in his recent report. The government's approach of continually increasing the percentage of wages that employers have to pay in compulsory superannuation is not the answer. Such a strategy will merely divert funds from other investment and cost jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge for Australia is to achieve a level of economic success similar to that of the 10 east-Asian nations. We should not necessarily copy them; however, we need to build on our comparative strengths and minimise our weaknesses. The chances for success are greater in a growing economy. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) spoke of that on Monday night in a speech at an ANU seminar on employment and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of long-term unemployed persons has increased from 120,000 in 1990 to 350,000 in 1993. A well-known academic and respected commentator, Professor Judith Sloan, says there is a real danger of there being 500,000 long-term unemployed persons by 1995. What an indictment this is of 11 years of Labor government here in Australia. Consider the possibility of having half a million persons on the long-term unemployment list in two years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Beazley then claimed that 80 per cent of the participants in the labour market training programs find jobs, but he did not explain how, despite $1.1 billion being spent by his government on these courses last year, only 3,000 more people were added to an Australian work force of 7.7 million people. Could this not be partially because Australia's wages system is not flexible enough to pay people for what their skills are rather than the level that an archaic award or unrepresentative unions say they are supposedly worth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasing expenditure on labour market programs by another $120 million to $1.3 billion will do little to reduce the level of unemployment or create real jobs. The Treasury says in its budget overview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reducing unemployment is the main policy challenge facing Australia . . . lasting reductions in unemployment will require sustained growth in economic activity, and more flexible work practices and wage setting arrangements, supported by training programs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, the budget overview does not comment on the massive expenditure on training programs last year that failed to dint unemployment. Treasury's only comment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the lack of employment growth to date mainly reflects the weakness of the recovery itself . . .</PARA>
<PARA>However, Treasury warns that Australia needs to do more in reducing tariffs, privatising public utilities, tax reform, financial deregulation and labour market reform. Again, I say savings and investments are the key to job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A related issue, although appearing in another part of this budget, is the gradual way in which Australians are becoming more and more dependent on the government. Five million Australians are now on some form of government handout. The budget chart shows that the proportion of the budget outlays in the social security and welfare function continues to increase, and now stands at 36.2 per cent. More than a third of the budget, therefore, is now spent on social security. Just two years ago this figure was only 33.9 per cent. Some increases in social security funds spent may be due to the effects of the Prime Minister's deliberate recession, such as the doubling of expenditure on unemployment beneficiaries in the last three years to $7.8 billion. It is a statistic for which this government will long be remembered, if ever there were one to mark a reign of 11 years of a Labor government. Much of this increase relates to how the government cannot get its own house in order by properly targeting welfare payments or, even more importantly, encouraging the economic growth that will allow some of the employed to obtain work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to rural Australia, a one-line announcement in the budget says that the wool tax will rise from 8.5 per cent to 12 per cent from July 1994. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not even seem to understand that this line was in the budget papers, as was clearly demonstrated here in the parliament yesterday. What is the policy of the minister and the Prime Minister towards the woolgrowers after the implementation of the Garnaut report? Nobody is quite clear what the policy will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to match the great economic gains of much of east Asia over the past few years, we must get away from  the  govern-</PARA>
<PARA>ment's idea that it can keep putting off the difficult decisions. If we took the opportunity to properly reform the taxation system, the industrial relations system and the rate of change in government itself, we would reap the benefits after a few short years, just as New Zealand is now doing. This budget will be remembered for its generally broken election promises, the increases in indirect tax, the lack of reductions as promised in income tax and, more importantly, the absence of a clear vision for Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be quite misleading to look at simple comparisons of changes in Commonwealth payments over time as financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories frequently change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mid to late 1980's, Commonwealth assistance to the States was reduced in an attempt to reduce the overall level of public sector spending and encourage microeconomic reform. Furthermore, there were a number of changes in the arrangements for general revenue assistance that affected the reporting of Commonwealth assistance between 1982-83 and 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988-89 the payroll tax exemption for Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) was removed, with 90 per cent of additional revenue available to the States to be recouped by the Commonwealth by reduction in general revenue assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional revenue accrued to the State and Territory governments in 1989-90 as a result of the decision to remove exemptions from State taxes and charges (other than payroll tax) for a range of Commonwealth GBEs, including Telecom and Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 1990 Premiers' Conference/Loan Council meeting there was a request from the States for a more certain environment to facilitate medium term budget planning (against the background of the recent real annual declines in general revenue assistance). As a result, the Commonwealth established a real  terms guarantee for general revenue assistance for 1991-92 to 1993-94, conditional on Australia not experiencing a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. This agreement was met in 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An agreement was reached at the 1990 Loan Council meeting for the States to make additional payments to the National (and Northern Territory) Debt Sinking Fund sufficient to redeem the debt as the Commonwealth securities currently issued to finance it mature. This arrangement will mean that the debt will be fully taken over by the States and Territories by 2005-06. Therefore, additional payments are made to the Commonwealth as the securities mature.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Upper Mount Gravatt Tax Office in Queensland, which you refer to in your question, has issued nearly 12,000 swimming pool refund cheques to the value of $9.4 million as at 30 June 1993.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any delays experienced are occurring largely for two reasons. In some cases the pool builder is disputing the right of the purchaser to a refund on the basis that the price paid by the purchaser did not include sales tax. In these cases the pool builders argue that they are entitled to a refund because they did not pass the tax they paid on to the pool purchaser as a component of the price of the pool. The legislation provides them with the opportunity to prove their case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the appropriate processes are being followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second situation resulting in processing delays is a refusal by some pool builders to provide to pool purchasers and the Tax Office information about pools needed to correctly process refund claims.

Nevertheless any such foreign investor must operate within the context of Australian laws, including our industrial relations laws. The Industrial Relations Act 1988 currently contains protections in relation to discrimination against union members and officials. In addition, as part of its industrial relations reform package, the Government has announced its intention to further legislate to protect workers from unfair dismissal.</PARA>
