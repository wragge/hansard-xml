<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for his continuing interest in matters of the environment. The 45th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission is being held this week in Japan. Australia takes to that meeting a very clear and unequivocal position. We oppose all commercial whaling and support worldwide protection of all whales and dolphins. We also support the French proposal for a whale sanctuary in all the Southern Ocean south of 40 degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of media speculation about the possibility of the International Whaling Commission supporting the resumption of some commercial whaling. I wish to assure this Parliament that, if such a proposal is put to a vote, Australia will oppose it. We will continue to lead the push to maintain the global moratorium put in place in 1985-86 and I am confident that we will get enough support from other countries to ensure that that ban remains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been quite a lot of interest and support for the French sanctuary proposal for the Southern Ocean. Australia, of course, fully supports that proposal but, unfortunately, I am not confident that it will receive the 75 per cent majority needed for it to be implemented this year. If that proposal is defeated&mdash;and obviously I hope that it will not be&mdash;I and the Government are determined that Australia will lead the campaign to ensure that it is successful next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our job will be to make sure that the proposal is kept alive and refined to secure the support of enough countries at the next meeting. If this is the case, we will be seeking International Whaling Commission agreement for further work to be done on the sanctuary proposal, including the development of a timetable for its implementation and agreement on management issues. Australia will offer to host an intercessional planning meeting to facilitate that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has always taken a leading role on this issue of protection of whales and dolphins and we will continue to do so. Once again, there is significant international pressure to allow limited commercial whaling of some species and we think it is absolutely critical that Australia keeps the position it has and absolutely holds firm to that moratorium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to assure the House and the people of Australia that this Government will continue to be at the forefront of efforts to secure the worldwide protection of these magnificent creatures and that we will do everything in our power to ensure the eventual establishment of a secure haven in the Southern Ocean.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implication of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is that the process is a shambles. His shadow Minister, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> last night, said that small industry players had told him they would be able to set up a pay TV system for a fraction of the cost suggested by network applicants. He said that American networks miscalculated their bids when vying for pay TV licences in the United States&mdash;and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may well be the case here that these licences are worth much more than the major players were prepared to bid.</PARA>
<PARA>Oh dear! Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Smaller players will say the networks are going for a Rolls Royce system costing $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA>But here is the punch line. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can do it for a fraction of the price. Therefore we can afford to pay more up-front in licence fees.</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Alston thinks that, what does he think is wrong with the process? If he thinks that the process will reveal more in licence fees, what is the basis for the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that the process is a shambles?  Senator Alston is saying that the process is likely to produce more proceeds for the Commonwealth because the smaller players say they can afford more money for the licences. I should have thought that was a total endorsement of the Government's policies.</PARA>

Can the Minister inform the House of the take-up rate of school leavers by universities this year? How does that take-up rate compare with previous years? What is the sectoral balance between universities and TAFE colleges?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="393" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. On the matters raised by the honourable member, there is basically some very good news in the statistics that have come through. Total enrolments for 1993 have risen to 583,000, an increase of 20,000, or four per cent, on 1992. That reflects growth of 40 per cent in the system since 1988 when the Government signalled its intention to significantly expand the higher education system. Total commencements in 1993 are 218,000, which is up four per cent. It is good to see that school leaver commencements have risen to 69,000 in 1993, an increase of five per cent over 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it reflects the fact that the majority of institutions have recognised the importance of providing greater opportunities for school leavers to go on to higher education. I think that bespeaks very well of the activities of the previous Minister for higher education in his efforts last year to encourage the universities to up their percentage of school leaver intake. The Government also assisted that by providing some 11,000 additional places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the school retention rates were substantially increased to some 77 per cent, and we have about 36 per cent of that group of year 12 high school leavers finding their way into the tertiary system. That is really where the numbers ought to be&mdash;about 36 to 40 per cent. The recent Finn study outlined that as an appropriate level of participation in the higher education system and encouraged the Government, having reached that level, to ensure opportunities were available for others in vocational education and other aspects of training, which, of course, the Government is doing. There was a very substantial increase last year too in the opportunities available for young people to attend vocational education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comparative statistics are quite interesting as far as our higher education system is concerned. I mentioned the figure of 583,000. Of course, about 550,000 of those enrolments are Australians. If we take the equivalent figures in the United Kingdom, for example, there are some 760,000 students in institutions equivalent to our universities. But the United Kingdom has a population about four times larger than ours. If it had our participation rates in higher education it would be looking at about 2 1/2 million students in British universities. By contrast, were we in the United Kingdom's situation, we would have about 200,000 students in our universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a reflection of the extraordinary extent to which the Government has been prepared to invest in the development of our higher education system, which is producing those statistics. There are greater opportunities available to young people in this country for higher education than is the case in virtually any other member country of the OECD.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I ask the Minister: will he reconfirm that it remains the Government's commitment to reduce the Budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97? Will he also confirm that target will not be achieved through either the introduction of new taxes or through increases in existing taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="393" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is yes, it is the Government's intention to achieve a Budget deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The Government has made that declaration many times, and it adheres to that objective. It is important to do that because, as we all realise, Australia has, in relation to its economic problems, a considerable deficiency in relation to its saving efforts. A major reason for that has been that, with the economic cycle, we have had a considerable amount of public dissaving. In the medium term, it is important for us to address that so that the public dissaving is reduced and the national savings effort is improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government accepts, therefore, that it is important for us to have a fiscal objective which gives us that savings outcome. It recognises that if that is not the case, then the balance of payments current account problem will remain a severe one for the future and will constrain growth. So it is important for us to do it. How we get to that is a matter for the Government to decide in its Budget considerations. The Government has made it clear in statements in the past by the Treasurer that in relation to taxation it does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation. The Treasurer made that quite clear in a statement to this House on 16 September in which he said that we would not increase the overall burden of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that we would not introduce a broad based consumption tax, unlike the Opposition which wanted to impose a $20 billion tax on the whole of Australia. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to design tax policy to support saving and investment, responding as necessary to new opportunities and changing circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>At no stage have we said that we are not going to change any tax at any time. It is part of the Government's considerations in the Budget preparation process to address both sides of the Budget, outlays and taxes, and just how that comes out will be seen in the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is currently engaged in negotiating the question of fringe benefits with the States. The Government announced earlier its decision to extend fringe benefits to all part-pensioners, and in part those fringe benefits are Commonwealth, relating to pharmaceutical concessions, hearing aids, access to the new dental scheme and so forth. There is also a range of State concessions, one of which the honourable member referred to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached agreement with the States on this issue for the period to the end of this financial year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. There are few areas of the Government's responsibilities that more typify its commitment to social justice than the area of disabilities. Honourable members will recall that last year the Government passed disability discrimination legislation ensuring that over time we will be able to remove areas of discrimination in Australia where it exists within the Commonwealth Government and in terms of our national responsibilities. Honourable members would also be aware that we will very soon reach agreement with each of the States by means of the Commonwealth-State disability agreement, which will provide ongoing guarantees of funding and a much clearer outline of Commonwealth and State responsibility in the area of disability. It will also enable us to build on our commitments under the Disability Services Act to ensure that, even in very difficult economic circumstances, there are more opportunities made available for those with disabilities to participate in the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on the disabilities services program has increased by 136 per cent from $207 million in 1985-86 to $489,000 million in 1992-93 and services have increased from 1,551 to 2,300, or by 48 per cent. The number of people assisted by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service has risen from 15,000 in 1988-89 to an estimated 32,000 in 1992-93, an increase of 102 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very high proportion&mdash;about 50 per cent&mdash;of clients being cared for or being counselled by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service have effectively achieved full-time or part-time employment. Some 82 per cent of people completing programs in the special psychiatric rehabilitation units, which the Government set up in 1991, are now employed. In a week in which we are celebrating national rehabilitation, a commitment to rehabilitation in the Australian community, the Government is able to report considerable progress in achieving its objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a very strong reputation internationally for the reforms that have been carried out in recent years. Few other countries have such a record in developing integrated services for those with disabilities. Few other countries have a record comparable to Australia in developing overall national policy, translating that policy into cooperation with the States, establishing new services, and encouraging thousands of Australians, who otherwise would have been excluded from the work force, to take their place in society through employment, to be independent and to have a better quality of life.</PARA>

Is it further a fact that the federal police have admitted knowledge of Takumi, his frequent visits to Australia and his recent purchase of a luxurious penthouse in Surfers Paradise for approximately $800,000, which appears to be well below its real value? In the light of general public concern as to the growth of such organised crime in Australia, I ask: why has the Government failed to respond to this federal police information by refusing Takumi entry to Australia, or by deporting him?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. He is a member who has had a long-term interest in the future of the Australian fishing industry. It affects his own electorate very strongly. The southern bluefin tuna is an industry that is very important to Australia since last year it earned $180 million in export earnings. It is very important, therefore, for Australia that only sustainable catches are taken each year. Southern bluefin tuna are distributed throughout the Indian and Southern oceans and in the past they have been heavily over-fished, which is not in the long-term interests of Australia or many other nations. The result has been that since those stocks have been depleted, the future of the species and of the industry are under threat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that in recent years New Zealand, Japan and Australia have worked together to reduce catches to sustainable levels. Since 1986 annual quotas have been set for southern bluefin tuna, and they have been agreed to voluntarily. I am pleased to announce to the House that we will go a step further when later today my colleague the honourable Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will sign the International Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna with the Japanese and New Zealand governments. The convention will provide a legally binding framework and will include mandatory allocation of the total allowable catch. The honourable member for Higgins will be interested to know that this will be the first convention signed by Australia to control fishing for southern bluefin tuna, not only in Australia's national fishing zones, but on the high seas as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention will create a commission for the conservation of southern bluefin tuna which will meet each year to determine the management measures for the fishery. I am also pleased to say that Australia has offered to have the commission's headquarters established in Australia. With the large quota reductions in recent years Australia's southern bluefin tuna industry has had to undergo a major restructuring, which has not been easy. It has included the conversion of vessels for long-line fishing to increase export returns from the lucrative Japanese sashimi market, which I know you, Mr Speaker, are very keen to encourage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All States are, of course, concerned about the implications of the Dietrich decision. That decision has major financial impacts on the provision of legal aid because, in short, it treats the provision of legal aid as essential for a fair trial in serious criminal matters. The response of the Victorian Attorney-General has caused some concern. I wrote to her on 3 May to raise those concerns with her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am sympathetic to the need for all governments to respond to the funding issues that the Dietrich case causes for the States and the Commonwealth, a working party has been established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General which will report to the next meeting in June, then the Commonwealth and the States will be able to take a national approach in relation to the Dietrich matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes (Criminal Trials) Bill undermines this consultative process in which the Attorney-General of Victoria has agreed to participate. Under the proposed legislation, in certain circumstances, courts in Victoria will be able to order the provision of legal aid from the Legal Aid Commission on terms specified by the courts. What is particularly alarming about this matter is that a judge would be able to make that order on the basis that an accused is unable to provide the full cost of obtaining private legal representation. That would have the effect of undermining the independence of the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria and therefore put at serious risk the Commonwealth funds provided to the Victorian commission under the Commonwealth-State agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will take away from the commission the power responsibly to manage its own budget. There is no doubt that were this legislation to be enacted, considerably more legal aid funds would be diverted away from family and civil law matters to meet the cost of legal aid ordered by the court for criminal matters. The Commonwealth provides a very substantial component of funding for all legal aid commissions, and we cannot simply stand idly by if the outcome is to apply most of that funding to matters which ordinarily would have been the responsibility of the States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Victorian Legal Aid Commission is being told to administer a scheme where it will have no control over expenditure, the Victorian Government is also threatening to remove up to $2 million in funding, which places the commission in an almost impossible situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most apposite remark that I think any of us heard in the last few weeks about the Australian economy was made by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths)&mdash;part of the great new young talent of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;on the Channel 9 program yesterday morning, when he likened our economy to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> and said that it would take a long time to turn around. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> sank in April 1912 and there is no sign of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>'s being turned around. Our economy hit the iceberg of the high interest rate policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back in 1989-90 and our economy is still resting on the bottom of the ocean, unmoved by the Government's rhetoric and unmoved by the wish lists that it came to the election with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider the economic statistics of the last few weeks, there is no doubt that the depth of our economy's problems, the depth to which it is stuck in the mud at the bottom of the ocean&mdash;to follow on with the metaphor of the Minister for Industry Technology and Regional Development&mdash;is very great. In the month of March we had a current account deficit blow-out of $2.1 billion. Our foreign debt is increasing day by day. There are still around one million people unemployed and the Government, including the Prime Minister, is claiming with unexpected honesty that its policies can do nothing to get those people back to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, this is a country which is uncompetitive and we have a government which has no plan to improve that competitiveness, to get people back to work, to stabilise our debt and to reduce our current account problems. In this very damaging climate for our country, we have a government that has been re-elected, not only as a result of the scare campaign but also partly as a result of going on a spending spree trying to buy support in the community. The consequence is that it is building up&mdash;as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table, knows&mdash;a more and more serious Budget deficit problem. His department has been advising him since election day, and the Treasury has been advising the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) since election day, that this is a massive problem that the Government has to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one issue that Ministers outside the public eye have been agonising over during the last few weeks it is the size of the Budget deficit that they have created as a result of the election bribes they made. It is not surprising that even the Governor of the Reserve Bank, in an almost unprecedented manner after the election, came out and simply hammered the Government for not having an effective policy to deal with the Budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what the Government did during the election campaign, we can see that on top of the One Nation promises, there was something like $2.6 billion worth of spending promises in the invest in the nation program between 1993-94 and 1996-97. That $2.6 billion assumes that the Government will get $1.6 billion in revenue from selling part of the Commonwealth Bank and $1.7 billion from bringing forward company tax collections. So if we strip away those one-off benefits, we are talking about a blow-out of something like $3.6 billion from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Invest in the nation</EMPHASIS> alone between 1993-94 and 1996-97. On 24 February, the Labor Party launched its policy and there was well over $1 billion worth of spending commitments in the same period in that policy launch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we get to this year's Budget and the deficit expected is something in the vicinity of $16 billion. That is about four per cent of GDP&mdash;a big blow-out from the $13.4 billion that the Government proposed in its phoney figures at the time of the Budget. When we look at the cumulative Budget deficits&mdash;and this is the critical point&mdash;that the Government has been building up between 1991-92 and in the period to 1996-97, the figures are just staggering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macquarie Bank estimates that the cumulative deficit will be somewhere in the vicinity of $88,000 million. Access Economics estimates that the figure will be very similar: $83,000 million. Taking the Treasurer's best case scenario, the figure could be no lower than $65,000 million. These are Bills which will have to be paid for by future generations in this country and are Bills which, above all, have been accumulated in the cause of getting the Labor Party re-elected. If ever there was an example of fiscal recklessness, it is the policy and strategy that the Labor Party has undertaken over the last couple of years in order to try to stay in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this fiscal recklessness on our country will simply compound the enormous fundamental problems that we have. For example, nobody is arguing with the proposition that running an enormous Budget deficit, as the Government is, is a drain on our national savings. No-one is arguing with the proposition that running enormous Budget deficits is keeping interest rates higher than they need be and that real interest rates in this country are amongst the highest in the OECD, which of course is not conducive to ensuring that there is a recovery of investment and, therefore, employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has the Government been saying about it? At the end of last year, the Treasurer, who for some reason is absent today, put out a press release exhorting Australians to go out and spend. `Spend, spend, spend' was the cry of the Treasurer at a time when national savings were at crisis point. Then four months after the election the very same man put out a press release saying that Australians should not be spending but saving. Within four months we went from `Spend, spend, spend' to `Save, save, save'. They are not the words of a Treasurer, that is not the mind of a politician, who is set towards building confidence in this country and confidence in the way the economy is being managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This enormous Budget deficit is contributing to the major savings problem that Australia has. A week or so ago the ANZ bank produced a paper showing that we have the lowest level of savings in this country since 1974, that all of our investment at the moment is being financed from overseas and that we are also borrowing from foreigners in order to finance some of our current consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, with this large number of problems that the Government has created for itself, what is it proposing to do about, above all, its gigantic Budget deficit? There are really two things that the Government has been talking about since the election. The first is its commitment to break some of its election promises. The second is the perfectly clear indication we now have both from answers in Question Time today&mdash;including the Prime Minister's dorothy dix question that he arranged through one of his advisers passing a question back to one of the backbenchers&mdash;and from leaks that have been strategically directed to different newspapers that the Government will increase a whole range of taxes. As I will explain in a minute, it will do that in a very regressive and damaging way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the broken promises. On 24 February, included in the policy speech of the Prime Minister was the promise that no age pensioner would pay tax by 1995, yet within a week of the election the Treasurer came out and said that he would renege on the promise that the Government made that by 1995 no age pensioner would pay tax. A week after the election the Treasurer explained that, in the words of the Watergate saga, that promise was `inoperative'. We had the promise during the election campaign that $100 million would be spent to buy private hospital places to try to reduce the hospital waiting list. In the last few days, Senator Richardson has explained that that promise too is likely to be `inoperative'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see on the other side of the ledger an increase in a raft of different taxes. Today, at an Evatt Foundation function, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), one of the Government's most senior members, made some very revealing remarks when he said that Australians had to learn to understand that high levels of unemployment will be with us for a very long time&mdash;a great indictment of his own management and the management of the Labor Party. He also said that we had to accept that we would need to revive the welfare state in this country and that that would have to be funded&mdash;this is the revealing thing the honourable member for Bonython told the Evatt Foundation at lunchtime today&mdash;from increases in taxation. The honourable member for Bonython, one of the most senior members of the Government, has already let the cat out of the bag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But so has the Minister for Finance, who is at the table. When he was asked a question today about higher taxes, we had in his answer that mealy-mouthed stuff about how the Government was not going to increase taxes&mdash;as a proportion of GDP was what he really meant. He said the overall burden of taxes was not to be increased. That does not mean we will not all end up paying taxes but that the Government will not increase taxes as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Minister really saying? What he is really saying is that the Government is going to go ahead with the tax cuts in 1994 and 1996, if it is still in government. It is perfectly clear what the Government is going to do. It is going to finance those tax cuts with a range of new, imaginative, indirect taxes and through increases in some indirect taxes that already exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at it another way. What the Government is really saying is that to help our economy it is going to spend a whole lot of extra money and&mdash;we promise, we promise&mdash;we are going to pay for it one day. The way the Government is going to pay for it is by introducing new taxes. This particular strategy, as Allan Greenspan recently pointed out to the Economic Club of New York, is a strategy that would stagnate the economy eventually and all the gains that might possibly be made through this very staggering, very slow, cyclical upturn would simply be lost. The truth is coming out day in and day out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper today there is a leak of a speech given by the deputy secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Sims. He revealed to a CEDA meeting last Wednesday that the Government indeed was considering new taxes. What is it considering? It is considering a so-called energy tax. Put green clothes on it and maybe it will not matter so much. But the energy tax constitutes a hike in petrol taxes and new taxes on electricity, gas and other forms of energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is proposing to change the wholesale sales tax system. What does that mean? That is code for broadening the wholesale sales tax base and increasing the rates of wholesale sales tax. The Government has also decided to take a leaf out of Mr Cain's and Mr Wran's books. Remember Mr Cain and Mr Neville Wran. They used to have a practice which was called hollow logging&mdash;saying to business enterprises that they wanted higher dividends from them and sucking more money out of them. The Minister at the table is a great fan of this scheme. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the present Government is going to do is suck higher dividends out of these government business enterprises. Organisations like Telecom, Australia Post and the Federal Airports Corporation are going to compensate for that by increasing their charges. It is just another form of taxation. The really interesting thing about these new taxes is that they are hikes in indirect taxes and business costs because there is no input credit on these taxes. They are simply going to increase business costs. They are more than that. These taxes genuinely are regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that people are going to get income tax cuts but the people who are not going to get those tax cuts are those earning less than $20,700 a year&mdash;that is, over 40 per cent of taxpayers&mdash;and people on fixed incomes. Those people will pay the higher taxes, but there will be no compensation. That was the burden of the Government's argument against the GST. That argument was wrong. The Opposition provided compensation but the Government is increasing indirect taxes which will increase costs to business in this country, at a time when Australia is uncompetitive, and increase costs to low income Australians and pensioners and others on fixed incomes, making their lives all the more miserable than they already are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that a senior Minister of this Government is using the metaphor that this country is like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. He is right. The Government's policies are not designed to turn the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> around because nothing will turn it around. The Government has no policies and no idea how to improve this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to that speech, one would not think that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was talking about a country that is just about leading the industrialised world in terms of economic growth. No-one says that is an exceedingly rapid rate of growth, but it is certainly not an economy which is stuck in the mud, to use the term of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy, like the rest of the industrialised world, has been through a recession. It is leading most of the other countries out of that recession and had a growth in 1992 of 2 1/2 per cent. That is in excess of the rate of growth for the industrialised world, which is less than two per cent&mdash;1.8 per cent on the International Monetary Fund figures. For next year, 1993, we would certainly again be ahead of the rest of the world because the IMF forecast is for the world economy to grow at about 2.2 per cent in 1993, and we will certainly do better than the 2.4 per cent that we recorded in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy is far from being stuck in the mud. It is an economy coming out of recession. It might not be screaming out of recession, in the way it did in the early 1980s, but neither is any other country's economy at this time. Many countries are finding it exceedingly difficult to get out of recession at all. Some, such as Germany, are still stuck in it&mdash;countries with the most dynamic post-war economies in the industrialised world. The situation must be put in some perspective. What the Opposition is saying is just ludicrous. It is still in election mode, trying to tell the people about the economy in a way that is totally out of whack with reality. The Opposition should realise that the election is over and that it can afford to be franker these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer also said that we have an uncompetitive economy; that we are not doing anything to improve competitiveness. Since the Government came into office, Australia's international competitiveness&mdash;and indices published by the Treasury bear out this fact&mdash;has increased by 30 per cent. We have one of the lowest inflation rates in the Western world. Productivity is increasing with the introduction of the enterprise bargaining approach to wage fixation, together with the micro-economic reforms that have been taking place at an unprecedented rate for the last several years. As a result, our competitiveness has increased very considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore absurd&mdash;those opposite are away with the fairies&mdash;to suggest that we are not increasing our competitiveness. We have been doing it year after year. The Australian economy is much more competitive now. That is the major reason for the development of a high rate of growth in manufactured exports, one of the great features of the economy in recent years. If the Opposition cannot recognise that that is happening and why it is happening, then it has a terribly long way to go before it can claim to be a true alternative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is really about the size of the Budget deficit and what is to be done about it. It is true that there has been an increase in the Budget deficit. We have moved away from the surplus of the late 1980s when, for three years, we recorded the only Budget surpluses in Australia since the introduction of the modern form of Budget accounting in the 1950s. The only Budget surpluses, therefore, have been recorded under this Government. We have moved away from those surpluses in recent years under the effect of the recession. That naturally happens because of loss of revenue and the additional expenditure that must be outlaid by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, as in every other industrialised country, the Budget situation has deteriorated. There is no doubting that that is the case. In some countries the deterioration has been infinitely more rapid than in Australia. For example, the United Kingdom had surpluses at the end of the 1980s but, as the latest International Monetary Fund figures show, it had a deficit equal to 6.2 per cent of GDP in its 1992 general government fiscal balance. The figure for Australia was 4.5 per cent, so there has been a much greater deterioration in the United Kingdom. In Italy the figure was 10.2 per cent; in Canada, 6.4 per cent; and in the United States, 4.6 per cent. Those figures represent a deficit as a proportion of GDP, and all of them are higher than Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's argument proceeds on the basis that there is something unique happening in this country. It is saying that it is only because we have a Labor government that we are seeing a deterioration in the Budget outcome; that we have such a terrible Budget deficit solely because of the fiscal irresponsibility of the Labor Government; that if only the Government had more appropriate policies then there would be a nice Budget surplus. That is a total delusion and it is totally out of step with the reality that faces every Western industrialised country, all of which have had a deterioration in their Budget outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that Australia has that figure. As I said at Question Time, that is not something that we can nevertheless be relaxed about. It is not something where we can simply say, `We do not have to worry about that', even though the results of that outcome are largely unavoidable. They are not entirely unavoidable; we could have had a better Budget outcome in terms of a lesser Budget deficit if we had not put a stimulus into the economy&mdash;if we had not taken the measures that we took in the One Nation package and in the Budget to provide some stimulus to the economy to get it growing again. But, in my view, in the view of the Government and, I think, in the view of most people, that was a very appropriate policy, because it was designed to give the economy the impetus to get back onto a growth path. If we had not done that, we would have had much lower growth than we have at the present time, and more unemployment. Apparently that is what the Opposition thinks we should have. It thinks we should stick to the toughest possible Budget outcome, and in the process not care about the fact that it does not give the economy any growth, and that we have higher levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the Government's position. The Government, having taken that step to have responsible stimulus&mdash;as have most other countries in the Western world&mdash;recognises that that has to be taken back in the course of the next few years as the economy grows out of recession. Some of the stimulus that we have given in One Nation and the Budget will automatically come to an end because it is only there for a couple of years. So, as the economy recovers, tax revenues will pick up, budget outlays will start to decline as unemployment levels fall, and so the Budget will go through a process of some automatic repair, just as it went through a process of automatic deterioration with the recession.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can see that in the medium-term there is going to be an improvement in the Budget outcome simply by the processes that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question is: can we get back to a deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 simply by relying on those automatic features, or will some further steps need to be taken by the Government to ensure that that is the outcome? It is important that that is the outcome because, as I said at Question Time, this is a factor which is related to the need for a better savings effort by the nation, and that in turn is very important in ensuring that we do not have a current account problem. There is a direct relationship between the investment savings gap and the balance of payments current account gap. Unless we address that feature, then we must recognise that we are not going to address the current account, whatever else we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important. The question then is: do we need to take any further steps? As I have said previously, we recognise that we probably do need to take some other steps. The question then is: what sorts of steps do we need to take? At this stage it is not possible or appropriate for the Government to answer that. The Government will certainly be aiming to ensure that it achieves that one per cent outcome by 1996-97. In the forthcoming Budget for this year we will outline not just a Budget for 1993-94, but also a Budget scenario for the next few years to indicate the ways in which we will be likely to get to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, and to indicate what steps we will be taking to ensure that that is the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has already decided that that means that there are going to be big increases in taxes, and it is even telling us what those taxes will be and how unfair they will be. This is just lulu land stuff and totally absurd conjecture. The Government has no intention of introducing unfair taxes of the kind that the Opposition wanted to introduce in the form of the goods and services tax, and we have made it clear that that is definitely not part of our agenda; nor is it part of our agenda to make the tax system less fair. In the time that this Government has been in office it has been repairing the tax system to make it much fairer, tighter and less open to rorts&mdash;hopefully not open to any rorts at all these days, compared with when we came into office&mdash;and to make it much more equitable. We are not about to undo any of that in the process of putting together a fiscal policy to achieve the medium-term outcome that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is the case that this Government is facing up to the need to adopt the appropriate fiscal policy. It has taken the appropriate fiscal stance in looking at the needs of the economy in recession, and has been prepared to provide stimulus at a time when that was greatly needed. The Opposition condemned us for doing that and clearly would rather have had much more unemployment. We recognise that in the foreseeable future we have to repair that Budget outcome so that it will give us a much better savings outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have appointed the Fitzgerald committee, which is to report to the Government by the middle of this year on savings, and clearly that may have some implications for the Budget. The Treasurer indicated last September that we would be looking to take steps in that direction, to improve our savings performance, and not just in relation to public saving but also in relation to private saving. We hope that the Fitzgerald report will give us the opportunity to take further steps in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget obviously will remain an important feature of the savings outcome because public dissaving, which has been a feature of the poor savings performance of the country in the last couple of years, clearly has to be addressed if we are to have a more productive savings outcome. We need to have positive savings as a nation&mdash;not to be dissaving as we have been recently&mdash;and therefore be able to rely on those savings to finance our investment rather than have to import funds with the concomitant feature of a continuing current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd for the Opposition to condemn the Government for taking steps to introduce new taxes when the Government has made no such decision at this stage. As I said at Question Time, taxation is an issue that has to be in the ring, but that is a long way from saying that there are going to be any increases in taxes at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this MPI is based on a number of absurdities from the Opposition&mdash;a belief that the economy is going nowhere; that it is not growing; that there is nothing being done to improve productivity or competitiveness; that nothing is being done to improve the savings performance of the nation; that nothing is being done to improve the current account outcome. They are all patently absurd. The shadow Treasurer probably, in his heart, realises this. If he does not, then he has an awful lot to learn. </PARA>

Everybody knows there is. We have only got to step outside this Parliament House, or outside Canberra, and everybody will tell us that the country is in a mess, that it is performing much worse than it should be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister says that we are competitive. Everybody knows that the competitiveness of Australia has slipped markedly over the last few years. We only have to look at how we rate on the OECD scale. We used to be very near the top of the list on all indicators; today we are very near the bottom. On many of the indicators we are only ahead of countries such as Turkey, Finland and perhaps Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a specific example, I was talking recently to a director of a company, A.L. Vincent Industries Ltd, which makes water hydrants, washers for taps, and brass pins for brake pads. He told me they have just shifted their foundry overseas to New Zealand. The product that they previously made now comes back into Australia and is landed here, after freight, and of a comparable quality, for 30 per cent less than it could be produced in Australia. That particular company has reduced its employees to doing things like unloading the container on the wharf and distributing the product within Australia. That is a specific example, which could be mirrored a thousandfold right across Australia, of what is happening today under this Government's policies. </PARA>

Country Australia, and in particular the wool industry, is in a shocking situation, and the economy as a whole is in a mess. We have one million people unemployed whom the Minister for Finance does not even seem to be aware of. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)&mdash;or probably more correctly the Minister for unemployment&mdash;admitted the other day that the long-term jobless numbers will just about double in the next two or three years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is devastating indeed. Exports were down seven per cent; imports were up 16 per cent, and the imports flooding into this country today are at a record level. Not since January 1990 have we had a figure of this magnitude. When we cast our minds back to those sorts of figures, we remember that is the reason the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer as he then was, put us into the recession that we had to have. We have gone through all this pain and we are virtually back where we started. Goodness knows what the Government now has in store for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said, our savings policy is absolutely shot. Savings in this country are at their lowest level since 1974. I do not have to remind honourable members who was in power then. Last year's December quarter figures showed that savings had fallen by another $850 million, which was the seventh successive fall in a row. They had fallen on only one other occasion in the last 20 years, and that was over two quarters in the 1982-83 recession. Now we have had seven successive falls. It is an unbelievable position. We have unprecedented levels of borrowing from overseas, not just for investment but, more alarmingly, also for consumption. In a sense, we are selling off Australia's interests to overseas interests for the simple reason that we are spending more than we are producing and we are spending more than we are earning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes back to the old adage: the Labor Party cannot handle money. We have seen it in Western Australia, we have seen it in Victoria and we are seeing it today in South Australia. The only reason Queensland is doing half decently is because it inherited government from the National Party and nothing has been done since. We are seeing it all over Australia today and I believe those figures I have just trotted out are convincing evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, the policies that the Government is pursuing are anti-Australian policies. I think that is pretty ironic in view of the current agenda that the Prime Minister is running. Everybody knows what the solutions should be: industrial relations reform which overseas countries are putting in place, but which the present Prime Minister has no stomach for; micro reform which is needed urgently and at a pace which is faster than glacial; reform on the waterfront which should be occurring but is not; and also cuts in spending in non-productive areas. But this Prime Minister's solutions involve pretending that this Government is doing the above things and pretending it is making industrial relations reforms, although he virtually read out the coalition's policy, but then tacked on at the end&mdash;after a few phone calls from Bill Kelty&mdash;that the unions must be involved, which almost ensures that it will stall again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For heaven's sake, a year or so ago it was the flag; the Prime Minister was going to change the flag. That got the economy off the front page. During the election campaign all he talked about was coalition policy&mdash;I guess because he had no policy of his own. Since the election all he seems to have talked about is changing Australia to a republic. His bog Irish dislike of the British and his hatred of Menzies has forced him to become a sort of military historian and revisionist of history to peddle this line. But the media has fallen for it and presumably we are to take it seriously. He is going to spend more on a referendum than the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has just offered the woolgrowers of this country. I think nothing more indicates the sick state of this Government's priorities than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time the deficit mounts and there is upward pressure on real interest rates. It is true that we have a low inflation rate in this country because the economy is comatose; it is about one per cent. But interest rates are about 10 per cent and that is making us uncompetitive. The Minister for Finance, who is at the table, might deny it, but it is making us uncompetitive in the business world, particularly compared with overseas countries. So we have the Prime Minister preaching nationalism while at the same time practising anti-Australian values. I believe that his actions will, in effect, ensure that we will be less independent, that we will be more beholden to overseas interests than we have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all this is going on, the problem worsens. Just about every Government forecast since I have sat in this place has been shot to pieces&mdash;and who would forget that famous one, `If you can't make 4 3/4 per cent growth, you ought to give the game away'. Even if we could make three per cent growth now we would be standing still or falling behind in many areas. Our trade balance worsens every day. The Prime Minister, in nine different statements since he has been Prime Minister, has made 153 promises amounting to thousands of millions of dollars over and above what the Government was spending before. The position is totally untenable. The Government knows it. It knows it has to break those promises. It has already broken some&mdash;the one about pensioners paying tax and ones like that. It is going to have to break others. In particular, it will have to break its biggest promise&mdash;the personal income tax cuts. It has deceived the people to get into office and it will continue to do so in the lead-up to the next election.

It kicked off in the 37th Parliament with the same degree of skill. We know we are in for a serious economic debate in this place when the Opposition trots out the National Party to run as its second speaker. We know we are in for a serious, in-depth discussion about the issues confronting the national economy when the  National  Party  is  up  there  as  the second string speakers&mdash;and second string they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the issue before the Parliament at present is the question of how much the Government spends, how much of the national resources we are consuming in Government, how much of the money that we are collecting we are spending, and whether or not we are spending too much. Let us look at Government expenditure as it now stands, as well as the central government deficit. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has already mentioned, the 1992-93 Budget sets out a central Government deficit of 3.3 per cent. The December 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OECD Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> records a central government deficit in the United States of 5.8 per cent, which is substantially higher than in Australia. The United Kingdom, adopting the sorts of policies which those opposite are still espousing, has a central government deficit of 6.3 per cent. Italy has a central government deficit of 10.6 per cent and Canada has a central government deficit of 3.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of life in OECD countries is that private sector investment has gone down and sensible, responsible government action has been taken in all of them to generate increased economic activity. At the same time we must recognise that revenues of all those governments, including Australia's, have fallen. The facts of life are that our 3.3 per cent deficit in this financial year is well below the OECD average, lower than any of the G7 countries. It is a very modest stimulus to the economy, but one which those opposite would not have delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the election just past those opposite went to the people of Australia promising not to increase economic activity but to choke it&mdash;to withdraw funds from the economy and to top that off with an inequitable tax&mdash;which the people of Australia have resoundingly rejected. If we look not just at the present but at the past, it is interesting to note what the philosophies of those opposite in practice have delivered to the people of Australia. Since the current methods of accounts were kept in our Budget documents from 1951 to the current time we have had 42 Budgets. Those opposite have delivered 29 of those 42 Budgets. I ask the question of those opposite: out of the 29 Budgets that they delivered whilst they were in government through that period, how many balanced Budgets or surplus Budgets did they deliver? The answer is zero, nil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not since Bob Menzies got the thought of forming the Liberal Party have those opposite delivered one surplus Budget. In fact, the record shows quite clearly that the only surplus Budgets that stand on the record since the current methods of account have been kept were the Budgets from 1987-88 to 1990-91, delivered by this Labor Government, by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the stark facts of life that the record shows and which those opposite would do well to learn by. Their performance today demonstrates that they have learnt very little from it. In those four Budgets in which we recorded a surplus, we amassed a surplus of some $18 billion; that is $18 billion effectively saved in the Commonwealth coffers which, coincidentally, is about the same amount as those opposite overspent during their last period in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other yardsticks that is important in this debate about how much money we should get through taxes and  how much we should spend is how much of the total cake, how much of the Australian domestic product, do the Government outlays consume? This year the Budget provides for government outlays of about 27 per cent of GDP. Let us measure that against past occasions. In 1982-83, the last Budget that those opposite delivered, government outlays as a percentage of GDP were higher, at 28.8 per cent. The record shows quite clearly that this Government  has  ensured  a  modest  slice  of  the gross domestic product going to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there is good argument in a whole range of policy areas why government outlays might be increased. But the facts of life are, and the record shows, that this Government has been about reducing the size of the economy consumed by the public sector, in spite of the protestations of those opposite mentioned earlier in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has contributed to that reduction has also been the fact that Australia now ranks as the third or second lowest taxed country in the OECD. Putting those things together we find a Labor government record in which government outlays as a percentage of GDP have shrunk since we came to office, not grown; a tax regime which has seen Australian tax now at the third lowest rate in the OECD; and a central government deficit lower than the OECD average and well below those of our trading partners with whom we like to compare ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are areas of the economy in which the Budget is directly involved. But, of course, in all of these things the critical factor at the end of the day is what is happening out there in the wider economy. The most important yardstick of that is what is happening with growth in our domestic product. Again, the record demonstrates the positive performance of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The December 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">OECD Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> records economic growth in real terms in GDP in Australia at two per cent for the calendar year 1992. That compares more than favourably with the OECD countries and is better than any of the G7. The United States, by comparison, is projected to grow at 1.8 per cent;  Japan  at  1.8  per  cent;  Germany at 1.4 per cent; France at 1.9 per cent; Italy at 1.2 per cent; and Canada at 1.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom, adhering to the sorts of fundamentalist right-wing conservative policy espoused by the Opposition in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, is projected not to grow at all this financial year but to remain in recession to the tune of minus one per cent. That is the OECD's December forecast for the last calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the sorts of prescriptions that the Opposition put to the people of Australia, and that were rejected by the people of Australia, have seen the United Kingdom stay in recession longer than any of the other OECD countries with which it would want to compare itself. The United Kingdom still finds itself running at a negative growth of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we have been in Government we have seen this nation's economy grow substantially. Today our gross domestic product is some 25 per cent larger than it was when we came into office. At the same time we have not only made more, but we have also increased the percentage of that product which is being exported. In 1983-84 we were exporting about 14 or 15 per cent of what we made. In 1991-92 that had grown to just under 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are making more as a nation and we are turning more of that into revenue for the nation by selling it to the rest of the world. All of that has happened at the same time as the Government's slice of gross domestic product has fallen; at the same time as we have reduced the tax burden across the board; and at the same time as we have seen the tax revenue or the tax base broadened so that the responsibility is shared more evenly&mdash;none of which the Opposition was able to do in office and none of which it was able to come up with as alternative policies when it went before the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have seen the fishing expedition in the lead-up to the Budget session, and those honourable members opposite have given a pretty woeful performance in trying to get anything useful out of it.

Now we are invited to support a guillotine on the basis that the Government is in a desperate position at the beginning of a parliamentary sitting.

If it were really interested in the future of the Australian wool industry, it would set aside two days to allow a full-scale debate on the wool realisation legislation, because every Australian worth his or her salt knows that for decades the great basic industry of this country has been the wool industry. It is in an enormous crisis at present; a crisis which very few people can see the end of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dare say there are many people on both sides of the House who would like to have a very lengthy debate on the wool industry. How can the Government possibly justify the bare half an hour, hour and a half, or whatever it is going to allow for debate on the Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill? How can honourable members opposite seriously go around the countryside when this Parliament gets up at the end of this week&mdash;as it will, because the Government has the numbers to ensure that it will&mdash;and pretend to the Australian people, many of the farmers who are going broke and the constituents of my colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who made such an impassioned maiden speech on the suffering of primary producers in Australia, and say, `Look, we are concerned about your situation. We are worried about the future of the industry and we have spent many hours debating it and spent a lot of time trying to find a solution.'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done nothing of the kind. It treats the industry with contempt and the measure of its contempt for the industry is illustrated by the fact that it is prepared to include this legislation in a guillotine. I make an appeal to the Leader of the House. As the reasonable man he claims to be, if he is so intent on having a guillotine I will do a deal with him: he can have his guillotine in relation to every piece of legislation except the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He should bring the Parliament back next week and make a gesture to the primary producers of Australia.

<PARA>interested by bringing the Parliament back so that we can have a decent debate on the future of the wool industry. At least that would demonstrate that the Leader of the House and the Government are receptive to the fact that what they are doing is insensitive to the concerns of the people who have elected them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the re-elected Government, those opposite are entitled to feel politically smug. They are entitled, as the re-elected Government, to implement their program and to attack the policies of the Opposition. That is their role and their right in a parliamentary system. But they are not entitled, as a re-elected government, to run roughshod over the body that is supposed to be the clearing house of the nation's political ideas. That is not my expression; that is the Prime Minister's expression. Last week when he congratulated the Speaker he said that we should not pay any hypocritical lip service to this idea that we always have to be nice to each other in this Parliament. I would have been amazed if the Prime Minister, of all people, had said otherwise. He is right, and I agree with him: we should not engage in any phoney hypocrisy about undue politeness in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if he really believes that this is the clearing house of the ideas of the nation, that this is where it all happens and where it all matters, and that when people come together here they are really interested in debating issues that affect Australians, why on earth is the Government denying the representatives of the Australian people&mdash;in the midst of the worst crisis the wool industry has suffered perhaps in its existence, and certainly since the end of World War II&mdash;an opportunity of seriously debating that issue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no answer to that. The only reason it is doing what it is now doing is that when it comes to the crunch it does not care about parliament. As far as this Government is concerned, parliament is a necessary evil and is something it has to put up with. The Government sits for the shortest possible time and the only thing it is interested in is Question Time because Question Time is loaded in favour of the Government and dominated by the Government. The Government is demonstrating its utter contempt for the parliamentary system by introducing a guillotine within the first two weeks of this Parliament's sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were the eve of Christmas, we had been sitting month after month, and we had had plenty of time to debate all the important issues and the Leader of the House came in and said, `Look, John, you really have to agree to this because we won't be able to go home for Christmas', there might be some sense in it. Politically speaking, the Government has the ball at its feet because it has just won an election. Yet what does it do? It makes the Parliament sit for a contemptuously short period of two weeks, puts up a guillotine motion like this one, tells the representatives of the woolgrowers of Australia they cannot have a decent debate on the future of their industry and expects us to believe that it takes the Parliament seriously. This completes a trifecta of contempt for the institution of parliament as far as the Labor Party is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding the House again that in the 93 years of Federation, on only three occasions&mdash;and this is the third&mdash;have governments moved guillotine motions in the first two weeks of a parliamentary sitting, and all of those have been moved by Labor governments. Of course, this is the second time in a row. The motion was moved in May 1990 at the convening of the 36th Parliament and it was moved on this occasion at the convening of the 37th Parliament. The Opposition will oppose the motion because it represents an expression of the Government's contempt for the role of parliament in the constitutional processes of this country. </PARA>

It is outrageous and, as the honourable member for Bennelong has made so clear, unnecessary. It is absolute rubbish to stand up in this place and say, `I need these Bills by 30 June', when we are seven weeks away from 30 June.

The Government is not really sure whether the two people who will have a say in the final decision in that place will be as easy to manipulate as some of their old mates who are departing this place, particularly those amongst the Democrats. The Government is just not taking any risks. We have Bills such as the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1993 and others where the Government is not really trying to promote the cause of the people of Australia but to clean up its own little messes and get itself out of some embarrassment. I do not know what the Government will do if some of its ambitions are not met within the time that it is allocating.

Of course, the record is full of evidence of where the Government has messed legislation up and the Parliament has had to help it out. The Leader of the House will make some remarks on that if he has time&mdash;after he has made all his remarks about how he won the debate at Ascot racecourse.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Government needs to take a different attitude in this regard. It needs to be prepared to look at its legislative program and give the public a go.

Frequently, we get that advice from members of the public because we are not experts on everything.

What did the Government do when the Bill was before the House? We did not debate it as one would expect a matter as important as that would be debated. We had a guillotine. I think the total debate allowed for the Australia Card in this House was an hour and a half. Government members were not prepared to face up to the views of other people in our society who were opposed to the Australia Card.

Why? Because the Government has made a complete mess of the pay TV issue&mdash;an issue involving the investment of billions of dollars and affecting the future of communications in Australia into the next century and beyond. What is the Government doing about it?

There is no urgency in introducing the legislation because it does not need to be enacted until about the middle of next year when other States enact similar legislation. There is no reason for the Bill to be enacted in a hurry. Likewise, the substance of the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1993, the last item on the list provided by the Leader of the House, is a very minor amendment which would allow the Dairy Board to borrow money and make hedging arrangements so that it can act in line with other  statutory  authorities under  the Government's wing.

The joking and laughing that are going on over on the other side of the House makes that fact very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter indeed. I do not want to come back here next week, but I take the view that I have been elected to come here to do a job which entails giving proper consideration to matters put before us. A large number of matters have been put before us today which are to be subjected to the guillotine. I do not know whether any one matter is ultimately more important than another. I personally take a great deal of interest in matters concerning veterans affairs, and that is one matter that is listed. What concerns me is that when the guillotine has been applied on previous occasions there have been consequential delays in enacting the legislation. To think that decisions can be made and votes taken without any debate at all is absolutely disgraceful, and that has happened on occasions. It has also often occurred that proper consideration has not been given to matters and we have had to come back at another time to correct the problem that we have created. There are numerous examples that I can cite of such unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Leader of the House gets the chance, I would like him to justify what is going on here. I feel that the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) takes this place seriously, and I respect him for that. Perhaps he will not acquiesce to this sort of activity. He has said on more than one occasion that we should be able to debate things properly. This House of the Parliament is what represents democracy to the people of Australia. Perhaps the people do not know what I have learnt over the past three years: that the proceedings of this House are a farce. I object to that. I am paid to come here to do a job. The guillotining of these Bills precludes me from carrying out my responsibilities. The people of Australia should be aware that it is the Government that has created that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, for the people watching and listening to the proceedings of this House, this House represents democracy. I say to them that it does not. What we are witnessing today shows that the Government treats democracy with contempt and treats it as a farce. I ask the Leader of the House to give a reason&mdash;a reason that we can take back to our constituents&mdash;that explains why the Government is preventing us from properly doing the jobs we are elected to do and, perhaps more importantly, paid to do. If I am not here to debate and take part in the process properly, what am I here to do? Will the Leader of the House answer that question for me? I do not ask that question facetiously. I seriously challenge the Leader of the House to answer it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, we could dispense with the proceedings in this place, and perhaps that is what the Government intends. We could sit outside and the Government could go on its merry way. It might yet come to the point where, by way of protest, I will stay away. Why should I participate in such a farce? Why should I acquiesce to the contempt in which the Government holds this process?</PARA>

However, because I am paid to do a job I would happily come back next week to do the job properly. I am prepared to do that, as are all honourable members on this side of the House. Why is the Government not prepared to do so? I ask the honourable member for Brisbane, because we often participate in debates, how he views this process. How does he justify this process? The Government shows by what it is doing today&mdash;as the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) have both said&mdash;that it has contempt for the process. But it goes beyond that: it shows how little consideration the Government has for propriety, for convention or for tradition. It wants to change everything. It is no wonder that the people of Australia are concerned about the Government's agenda. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) would like to be not only president but also dictator. The people of Australia should be very concerned about anything he proposes. Those opposite should tell me why we cannot debate important matters&mdash;whether it concerns veterans affairs or wool&mdash;otherwise, they should change their minds and do the decent thing by the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days and weeks we have heard a lot about raising debate about fundamental institutions in Australia; about the way in which Australia is governed; about who should be the head of State and what powers that head of State should operate under; and about what should be the relationship between the Federal Parliament and the States, and between the States themselves. These matters were raised by the Prime Minister, and we are talking about questions that relate to the institutions of society.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join in expressing dismay that the Government is once again using these guillotine procedures, and doing so in the very first days of this Parliament. Over the years we have become used to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) coming into this chamber towards the end of each session and announcing that, because of the great pressure of Government business and the enormity of the Government program, it will be necessary to limit debate on Bills. In the life of the last Parliament over half the Bills were subject to a limitation of debate. Over half of all the legislation that came into this place could not be discussed adequately. It was therefore inevitable that much of it would be recirculated; it would come back into this chamber when the obvious defects in it were discovered in the other place, or through a brief passage of implementation of that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House always demonstrates how sad he is that the guillotine is occurring, but that it is tragically inevitable. None of his excuses will hold good this time. Here we are after only three sitting days, but two working days of this Parliament, and we are told that 30 Bills must be guillotined. When the Leader of the House introduced the motion, he spoke about the list being smaller than on some previous occasions. It is true that there have been longer lists, but the reality is that in this instance this list of 30 Bills represents virtually 100 per cent of the real legislation coming before the Parliament. All of it will be subject to the guillotine. There will be not one piece of legislation before the Budget session on which all members who wish to speak will have the opportunity to do so. In every instance there will be a curtailment of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some new members here a few moments ago, and even they have deserted the chamber. They are obviously embarrassed that they are being asked to support their Government. Almost the first division that they participate in is one to curtail democracy, to curtail the opportunity for the Opposition to speak. What those new members need to remember is that, whilst every opportunity will be provided and every courtesy will be given to them to make their maiden speeches in these early days, next time round they will be amongst the people who will be denied the opportunity to speak. They will be amongst the people who will not have an opportunity to put the views of their electorate on a particular issue. No matter how important a matter may be to their constituency, the guillotine will be used to prevent them from exercising what they would have regarded as their right, as a member of parliament, to contribute to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is a Parliament that is scheduled to sit for only nine days in eight months between before Christmas last year and the bringing down of the Budget in the third week of August. What an abysmal record. I can remember years ago some people being critical of the Queensland coalition Government for not sitting very often, but if it had ever dared to sit for only nine days in eight months there would have been riots in the street. But nine days is what this Government considers to be adequate. One of those days, of course, was a ceremonial day taken up by the processes of the opening of the Parliament, so in fact we will have eight days of actual debating time in eight months. So it has been decided that 30 Bills will now be guillotined through by the end of this week. That is really an unsatisfactory state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people have referred to hidden agendas, the real reasons why the Parliament is sitting for only eight days when there are probably something like 50 or 60 potential days available. Some people have referred to the need for government members to undertake overseas trips. The other obvious reason why the Government is anxious to shorten the number of sitting days is to reduce the number of Question Times. They hope that maybe the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) can survive three or four Question Times but know there is no way he will ever survive a dozen or 20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read the comments of the Minister for Communications in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> that he had in fact erred by providing too much information during Question Time. I would like to know what titbit amongst the paucity of information he supplied was greater than the public had a right to know. Indeed, there is a real denial of opportunity for Ministers to be put under scrutiny, particularly those Ministers who have demonstrated over a long period of time that they have not got a grasp of the issues in their portfolio, and this provides them with a further opportunity to run away from the sort of scrutiny that they really ought to be subject to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the guillotine motion. It is quite clear that this one does not come as a result of pressure of government business or any inability to adequately deal with a comprehensive program. Two debating days after the commencement of the Parliament we are being asked to agree to a guillotine. We can come to only one conclusion: that the Government's management of its legislative program is not accidental or something that is beyond the capacity of the Government. It has not been forced into a guillotine position. It is clearly a deliberate program to curtail debate. It cannot be regarded in any other way. It is a deliberate action to ensure that the legislation proposed is not subject to scrutiny, that the Opposition is denied the opportunity to raise issues, and that members of Parliament are denied the opportunity to put before this place matters of significance to their electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make an appeal particularly to the new members of the Government.

He will only get that opportunity if he is prepared to stand up early in his career and demonstrate to the Leader of the House and to the Government that he stands for democracy, that he believes in freedom of speech, and that he believes that this chamber should be used for its intended purpose&mdash;to thoroughly scrutinise legislation and to ensure that matters that are passed and become the law of the land, are indeed in the national interest and are likely to achieve good things for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the people of Australia do deserve better. The ivory tower that this place has become under the Labor Party over the last 10 years has indicated that it is totally removed from the real world. Parliament has never been held in lower regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of debate in this new Parliament has no doubt stooped to a very new low because, quite frankly, this guillotine means that 30 pieces of legislation will indeed be voted on without real debate. There will be division after division after division, and there will be no real discussion. The Labor Party, as part of its hidden agenda, as part of constitutional reform&mdash;it is not going to tell us openly about this&mdash;wants to do away with the Senate. After all, the Prime Minister refers to senators as pansies and unrepresentative swill. What does the Prime Minister intend to do about making the so-called unrepresentative swill more representative? It is part of his agenda to do away with the Senate. The Senate is the house of review, and if ever we need a legitimate reason for a Senate, for a house of review, we only have to look at the Government's practices here. Where would we be as a nation if we did not have a house of review when the Government bulldozes legislation through the House the way these 30 Bills are destined to be bulldozed through over the next few days?</PARA>

Why does she not come over here and join us and vote for reasoned and rational discussion? I know that deep down the honourable member for Grayndler believes this place should mean something. I know she does not like it to be used as a rubber stamp; I know she has a basic respect for convention even though she is in the socialist left faction of the ALP. It is usually hard to see how anyone in that faction&mdash;yourself excluded, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins&mdash;could possibly have respect for convention. It is a tragedy and a disgrace that this Government has come back here on the third real sitting day and is showing such contempt for basic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, this is the Government which tried to stop the relevant ceremonies occurring on opening day in the Senate. The Prime Minister in this Government ordered Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to stand up and give way to him. This is the Government under which, this year, the Parliament will sit for only 12 weeks. Can honourable members believe that this Parliament will be sitting for a period of a mere 12 weeks? I am told that in some other years the Parliament sat for 18 weeks, but it will sit for just 12 weeks this year. Is this the quality of representation and accountability that the honourable member for Lilley talks about ad nauseam in the media? I think it is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the great traditions of the Westminster Parliament. I know that this Government does not want to talk about Westminster, and I know that this Government does not like to talk about the wonderful inheritance of parliamentary democracy we have from that place. The Westminster Parliament sits quite regularly. In fact, the Westminster Parliament is a forum for debate. The Westminster Parliament is a place where there is real democracy. I should also take the opportunity to mention that the Westminster Parliament is a place where the role of Speaker has been entrenched as a neutral, impartial person. Indeed, Miss Betty Boothroyd was elected Speaker and as a Labour member she received the support of the House. At Westminster the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Social and Liberal Democratic Party have a great respect for the institution of parliament. I wish our Parliament enjoyed similar respect. </PARA>

I would have thought that after 10 years this Government would have said, `Although we have the numbers, we should extend the parliamentary sitting by a week. We should sit for more civilised hours and we should sit for more days'. After all, this nation has a million people out of work, half a million people on the long-term unemployed list and a massive foreign debt. Twenty-five per cent of our young people are functionally illiterate on leaving primary school.

It is patently clear that this Government does not have the capacity to dodge the criticism we are directing at it. It is patently clear that the reason this Parliament is being closed down is that the Government had a bad week last week. Every time a member of the Opposition&mdash;whether it was the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) or the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer)&mdash;went to the dispatch box and proceeded to ask a question, we could see the pathetic expression that flowed across the face of the honourable member for Rankin. He seemed to be saying, `Oh no, not me again'. He got up; he stammered and he stuttered; he was totally lacking in eloquence. Indeed, from the way he was deserted by honourable members on his side of the House, he should know that he does not have a bright future. We saw the bravado of the Prime Minister; we saw his smile and his swagger; we remembered the con tricks on 13 March, which fooled the people of Australia into giving the Government another term.

In those 10 years I have watched many a guillotine applied. In fact, I heard the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) very eloquently point out that in the last Parliament over half of the legislation had been subject to the guillotine. He expressed some indignation at the simple fact that in this Parliament we will sit for only eight days in eight months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise now because in the 10 years I have been here I have never seen the guillotine applied as unnecessarily as I am seeing it applied this afternoon. The indignation of members of the coalition is simply because the guillotine is unnecessary. In the best of circumstances the guillotine is a form used by the Government that ought to be used hesitantly, that the Government ought to be reluctant to employ. We are here at the opening of a parliamentary session in which, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stressed, it is intended that we will sit in May and not in June or July, and with debate being subject to the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why members on this side of the House are so incensed at this application of the guillotine, the reason why people in the gallery and those who read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> ought to be incensed at this application of the guillotine is that it is so unnecessary. In this, the second sitting week of a term in which the Parliament will not even sit in June or July, we are being forced to hurry through legislation which we would like to debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made of the scornful way in which the public treats this chamber, but more should be made of the scornful and derisive way in which the Government treats this chamber and all arguments ventured by the Opposition. Why do I rise to make this impassioned plea when I know that the outcome of this debate is inevitable? Why has the coalition been so anxious to have this decision reversed when it knows that everyone on the other side will vote following party lines? It is simply because debate was never as necessary in Australia as it is in May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we face? We face an unexpected blow-out in the balance of payments. We face a very uncertain economic future. We face a real reluctance by people to get into that which we most need, that is, export markets, a lethargy hardly surprising by private enterprise. They are the very people we most need to soak up the enormous one million unemployed. We who are elected to represent the people of Australia, elected to come into this chamber and put a point of view, find not only that our point of view will be ignored but also that we will lose an opportunity to put it&mdash;not because there is no time, but because the Government chooses, by this technique, to curtail parliamentary sittings. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that some of the comments made, in the light of practice elsewhere around the country, do seem a little insincere. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who has not stayed for the entirety of this debate, stood up in this place and complained about the fact that the Government was elected a couple of months ago, has come in here for a few weeks of sitting, will come back for the Budget session, and has made only a very small amount of time available for consideration of affairs of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might, however, have taken a leaf out of the book of his State colleagues to whom he renders a great deal of support when the time comes for their elections. They were elected, of course, six weeks before us and have yet to meet. We are told that they will go rocking into the Western Australian Legislative Assembly some time around June, if and when they feel like it. So, if the honourable member has strictures in that regard, he might, as well as delivering them in this House, give his State colleagues a bit of a phone call and suggest to them that there might be one or two things that it is worth their while talking about. Of course, what they are doing in Western Australia is substantially day by day jettisoning every single one of their election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) that we did not pay enough attention to the very detailed policies of our political opponents. I think that we gave them very detailed attention, actually. We gave honourable members opposite the courtesy of a very solid debate during the course of the few months leading up to the last election. The problem for those opposite is that those detailed policies no longer exist&mdash;at least in their pristine purity. One of the advantages to those opposite of a period of reflection in June and July will be an opportunity for them to devise a policy. When they get that opportunity&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there are to be sanctimonious stakes in this debate, I think we have heard about an hour's worth of it. Those opposite can cop a bit of it from me if that is their only concern. They will have an opportunity to sit down and reflect on their non-existent policies. In this chamber they lecture us day in and day out when they are sitting now with policies that have some sort of $22 billion funding hole. If they think that they are worth while and ought to be listened to, they might actually do something about that and then they might be taken a little bit seriously; and we might have a thing or two to say to them about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other rather graceless performances was from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), an unsuccessful contestant for Deputy Leader of the National Party, who suggested that the reason for a guillotine was that everybody on this side of the House intended to take off overseas. I have not noticed, when there are parliamentary breaks, an excessive presence of members of the National and Liberal parties in this place when the various parliamentary delegations are overseas. There is also the opportunity to take advantage of an account which is available to backbench members of the Parliament to travel overseas. I have not looked at that account lately, but I do not know that it is underspent by the Liberal Party or the National Party, nor do I note that any of those overseas parliamentary delegations have been ill-attended by members of the Liberal Party and the National Party. Before they try to make a point about this side of the House allegedly pork-barrelling, they should look to their own records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that was made by the honourable gentleman was that the take-off would be next week. If it is, I shall be very disappointed, because this Parliament is coming back the week after next for consideration of the material that comes forward to us from the Senate. I would hate to sit in this chamber and not see colleagues on the other side of the House or, more particularly, colleagues on my side of the House when it becomes necessary to deal with whatever it is the Senate sends back to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit depressed by the sort of self-loathing that seems to have taken over our honourable members on the other side of the House; there is no need for that. I do not believe that they are members of a house of ill-fame, as one of them characterised their situation. I do not believe that they are jokes, as two of them characterised their position, nor do I believe that this place treats them as a joke. Again referring to the unsuccessful contestant for Deputy Leader of the National Party, on the subject of parliamentary chairmen, he sought to deride them on the grounds that for the work they did as parliamentary chairmen they get an extra allowance of about $10,000 a year. Those positions actually exist because of one of the very substantial changes which has taken place in the way in which the affairs of this House have been conducted, courtesy of this Government. Far from disrespecting the House of Representatives, it is this Government that has put in place, enshrined in Standing Orders, a whole series of policy committees and surveilled policy activities. Certainly as a Minister who has had dealings with one or two of those committees, they have met to discuss items that I have sent to them; they have arrived at conclusions on items that have been sent to them; and many of those items, arrived at as a result of bipartisan decision making, have been implemented to my certain knowledge by the Government. So, far from being irrelevant, that is one of the many attributes of this Government's attitude towards the Parliament, which shows that we do not have the contempt for it that the Opposition seems to feel we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, many of those opposite seriously believe that we have that contempt. There is an element of self-loathing here which is very worrying and troubling to me. We have three years to go before the next election and I would hate them to exist in that state of psychological disrepair. If we are to put up with those opposite in this place operating with that state of psychological disrepair for another three years,  there is only so much nursemaiding that we can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that arises from the fact that this Government does not feel contempt for this Parliament but respects it greatly is that we do have a very extensive arrangement now in place for the creation of private members business. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) asked why we operated the guillotine. Let me confess that we do operate the guillotine far more frequently than the Opposition has ever done, although the guillotine was devised, I think, by a conservative government and certainly perfected by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he was Manager of Government Business. I always have a feeling, as I stand here and move the guillotine, that still resident in the House is the patron saint of guillotines. As he is the patron saint of this entire process, I always pay slight homage to whatever corner the National Party leaves him in as it works him up to the ultimate element of the back bench. Having assumed that position, we ought always in these guillotine debates show proper deference to a great parliamentarian for having invented it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have had recourse to the guillotine and have not had recourse to closure in the way in which those opposite did for a time is that there has been a very substantial change in the sitting patterns. Honourable members will find&mdash;this year being an exception, as an election year always is&mdash;as they examine the non-election years that the numbers of days on which the Parliament sits is virtually no different from the time of the Fraser Government or governments before then. Those opposite need to ask themselves: when we have the same number of days each year that the Parliament sits, why does the Government keep moving a guillotine? The answer to that is quite interesting, if they have ever bothered to ask themselves that question. The answer lies partly in the amount of time we allow for private business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came to this place, general business Thursday beyond the first two Thursdays in a sitting never took place. There would be notices of motion for general business Thursday which would stay on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for the entire parliament. General business Thursday disappeared and was taken over exclusively by government legislation. That is the first notable difference&mdash;because we do not treat this Parliament with contempt and, particularly, we do not treat backbenchers and private members business with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that we sit as often as we did previously but have a guillotine applied more rigorously is the application of time limits on sittings. Even with the guillotine, we do not sit much past 12.30 of a night. When I first came to this place we regularly sat until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, even though the 11 o'clock rule had been put in place by the Whitlam Government. So the second reason that we do have these extensive guillotines is that the Government is reluctant to sit the Parliament night after night until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason why we sit as much as we did before but have more frequent recourse to the guillotine is the way in which those days were arrived at. It is easy for those opposite to trip off their lips, `Well, we will sit seven days only in the month', and then carry that through into an analysis month by month and say at the end of the period, `That is only 70-odd days'. This Parliament decided that pattern: honourable members had responsibilities in their constituencies; the parliamentary committee system was then more well-developed and there needed to be opportunities for those committees effectively to be able to operate&mdash;those parliamentary committees do not sit while Parliament is sitting&mdash;and the business is, if you like, on the side of the entire Parliament. The Government also found it convenient and useful because of the great deal more burdensome task of budgetary formulation. Our Government operates by committee much more extensively than did our opponents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the old system did was this: when it was three weeks on one week off, albeit with only three days in each of those three weeks&mdash;it is now three days and four days and then two weeks off&mdash;a frequent Friday sitting would be made possible by the fact that there was only a three-day sitting. As well as the frequent Friday sitting, honourable members were much more cavalier with the 11 o'clock rule than we were. So the combination of all those factors, whilst producing no formal increase in the number of sitting days, created an enormous capacity to expand time at the expense of the health and the participation of the backbench members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite do not like that, they need to sit down and think it through. If they sit down and look through the timetables of the various sittings of the Parliament, they will find a couple of days in the year at a time they were on this side of the House when they sat more often than we did. But they will not find the difference is weeks or months; they will find the difference is a few days. That might indicate the odd one or two sitting weeks at the very maximum, but they will not always find that. I have gone into the reasons why they will not find that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been guillotined not because we fear the new composition of the Senate; every item is on this list because of a midyear start-up date. It does not look as though that is the case with some of the Bills on that list because they address sunset clause issues. While it looks as though some Bills are just a continuation of something that has existed before, if that is not the case, they will drop out. We do not particularly fear the composition of the Senate and, even if we did, we could do very little about it over the next few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this material is very important legislation; it  includes the wool legislation which, importantly, will substantially benefit wool producers. But the fact of the matter is those wool producers will want a conclusion by the end of next month. They will not get a conclusion by the end of next month unless this legislation goes to the Senate in the next couple of weeks. While the Government does not have the numbers in the Senate, and the Opposition does, there is a tendency to go through the legislation at a fairly leisurely bat. That consideration must be concluded by the middle of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has asked for an explanation of why the Government has put a guillotine in place. This is the explanation. No other government of this country will be able to operate on any other basis unless it substantially cuts into private members' time; alters the two week on, two week off sitting pattern to something like it was before; and, having altered that two week on, two week off sitting pattern, it would then have to suspend the 11 o'clock rule massively and continuously and add additional days' sittings in the process. If that is what Opposition members want, they had better stand up and say so. But, as I remember it, Ric Charlesworth's reforms went through with the unanimous support of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to refer to four of the Bills on the special list tabled by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)&mdash;a total of 30 Bills. This is the first time that the list setting out the times allotted has been available. I point out to new members of the House that if they vote to support the motion relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993, they are allowing a maximum of one hour for debate. Let us get down to detail. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993, which I would have thought the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) would have some passing interest in, has been allotted five minutes for debate: from 9.25 p.m. until 9.30 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wanted to highlight for the Leader of the House the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which is very important legislation. It is to be dealt with on our side of the House by the Deputy Leader of the National Party and shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). The Parliament is allowing just two hours of debate on the restructuring of the schedule of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. This is at a time when the Parliament should be giving more careful consideration to the future direction of the wool industry, to possible solutions in dealing with the wool crisis and in getting the vital wool industry back on its feet as a matter of priority.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw the attention of the House to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which is listed for just five minutes of debate. The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1993&mdash;yet another important Bill&mdash;is also restricted by the guillotine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not overly delay the House because I know a number of honourable members on both sides of the House have maiden speeches pending and I do not want to interrupt the timetable that they have entered into for those important maiden speeches. I will not sit down before I emphasise to the House that embarking upon a guillotine as savage as this is the worst approach of any government at the start of a new parliamentary term. It is for this reason that the House divided a moment ago. We express our total opposition to the method of this particular guillotine and especially to the restriction of debate on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which should be addressing far more than it does and which should allow a comprehensive debate on the heartache and heartbreak facing many woolgrowers across Australia, especially those in drought affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Leader of the House will learn from this particular effort. Notwithstanding his defence of the provision of private members' business on Thursday mornings&mdash;I commend the Government's action in that regard and note the comment&mdash;it goes deeper than that. There are 30 Bills listed that are all being guillotined, including the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, and it simply is not good enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter because I understand that during the last interval it was suggested that I was the father of the guillotine. As I regard that as quite a slur on my integrity, I thought it was necessary to say that it is really quite the reverse. I felt&mdash;and I still feel&mdash;that when there are measures such as this, debate is allowed, but then the gag is moved&mdash;and there is a subtle difference. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) needs to understand that, under the system which I used to run in this House for many years, we allowed people to speak on significant and sensitive issues. Indeed, a little while ago my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) mentioned a response that the then Leader of the House, Mick Young, made to one intervention on my behalf when I was in the position that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) now enjoys. The then Leader of the House said that he felt it was always desirable for members of this place to be able to speak on sensitive and significant legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of that, and this allotment of time, that I wish to speak now. I know that the Government is in trouble about broadcasting services. We all know that the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) has made a mess of things. If he does not resign today, it will be this week and, if not this week, it will be soon. His senior Minister should have resigned yesterday or last week because the nature of these changes is to retrospectively require the Minister to do what he should have done in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 also worries me. Too little has been said by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), but it has been said because of the urgent need to address what for so long has been the industry that has carried Australia on its back. We have a limited time to speak on this Bill: until 11.20 p.m on Tuesday, 11 May. Have honourable members ever heard anything more ridiculous? We will be able to talk about wool from 9.20 p.m. until 11.20 p.m&mdash;two hours. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, there are more rural members on this side of the House than there are on the Government side. Frankly, given the nature of the rural industry, and given the fact that honourable members on the other side of the House represent the wool industry, they ought to be up supporting me. I think it is absolutely ridiculous to allow two hours for a Bill of that character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if there are matters of this character, it is the responsibility of the Leader of the House to ensure that the opportunity is given to individuals to speak when feel they can make a contribution on issues of major moment. I do not believe the guillotine is the answer. If the Leader of the House wishes to preclude debate, he can do what I used to do: allow a reasonable time for debate and then move the gag. The gag is different. The gag does not impose an arbitrary limit; indeed, it allows for flexibility. Above all, I think to do this on the fourth day of sitting of the Parliament is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Government did not believe it was going to win the election, but there is no need for it to run into hiding quite so soon. The Government has won the election&mdash;much to the nation's regret and our chagrin&mdash;but there is no reason for it to run scared. Frankly, if the Government prides itself on being able to run this House, it has not demonstrated its ability to do it, either in those very flawed responses last week in this and the other place, or in the moving of this motion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend to you&mdash;and particularly the Leader of the House&mdash;the reconsideration of, above all, those two pieces of legislation: the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993. They are particularly sensitive and important. To pass over them blithely in the way the Government has I think is absolutely ridiculous and to be regretted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the difficulties that one sees in terms of the conduct of the House this evening is that if this debate were to finish too quickly, one of the new members would have his maiden speech interrupted by the dinner break. Therefore, I rise in defence of his need to have an uninterrupted flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and, through you, to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)&mdash;that to apply the guillotine like this is totally unsatisfactory. Let us face it: after all, from 1 January until the Budget comes in on 17 August we are having nine sitting days only. I suggest to the Leader of the House that the appropriate thing to do is to sit for more days. That is why we are elected to the Parliament. We are not elected to race off all the time; we are elected to be here in Parliament and to consider legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I believe it is totally inappropriate that so many of us on both sides of the House will not have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to consider legislation which is vitally important to the people of Australia. In particular, I know that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has referred to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. I echo what he said and support him in his comments, because it is vitally important that there should be debate on this particular Bill. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own case, I am more than concerned that the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 will be debated for only a short period of time. If we are considering road transport in Australia it is vitally important to consider the charges that will apply and the way that funding should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it will come as no surprise to you if I make particular reference to the Pacific Highway. As all of us in this House know, the Pacific Highway is regarded by most Australians as having a specific and special priority for funding. We have seen in recent years two disastrous and catastrophic bus crashes which claimed a total of something like 55 lives. Twenty lives were lost at Cowper in the seat of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods)&mdash;who I regret to see is not in the chamber&mdash;and another 35 in that horrifying and dreadful bus crash at Clybucca in my electorate of Cowper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the appropriation Bills, which again are under guillotine and are vitally important, we need to look specifically at funding for the Pacific Highway because we have the track record of so many deaths. It is the major highway of Australia. It is not part of the national highway system, but the usage of the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane attracts the most traffic of all highways in Australia. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you&mdash;and indeed to the House as a whole&mdash;that it would be very appropriate that we dedicate more funding to the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), I am concerned that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will be subject to the guillotine and have only five minutes allocated to it. I think this is an absolute disgrace. I make reference in passing to the recent report of the Auditor-General into the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which suggested that there should be cutbacks in the rights of veterans. I say to the House, as I have said before on many occasions: the returned service men and women of Australia need to be protected and to have their rights sacrosanct. They risked their lives for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are looking at the need to maintain that their rights are not taken away. I say most definitely that under no circumstances should there be retrospective legislation affecting the veterans of this country. In fact, it is vitally important that this Parliament sit more to give plenty of time to debate the legislation adequately, not to rush it through by guillotining it and chopping everybody off. It is in the interests of Australia that all members should have the opportunity to debate in full all of these Bills which are so important to our future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak for all the residents of Cowan&mdash;the more than 7,000 unemployed, the residents who join the 3,600 students unable to find a place at our universities, and the 11,144 on the waiting lists at our hospitals. I speak for Jack Tanner, a self-funded retiree, who over the last two years has had a real reduction in living standards. I speak for Tess MacLean, a proud mother of four whose husband, Ian, has served this country well in the services and continues to serve the community yet finds it difficult to find a job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak for Van Phat Nguyen, a Vietnamese refugee who has made Australia his home, yet is concerned about the current direction of its politics.

I am concerned for the future of my new country'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also speak for my children, Anthony and Kaitlyn, very young Australians who are relying on their father and every other elected representative in this place to accept their responsibility to provide an Australia that will be fit for them to live and prosper in in 50 years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak for that silent majority of the Cowan electorate&mdash;the forgotten Australians&mdash;who have lost, or are losing, their self-regard, their vision, their hope and their enjoyment of all things Australian. Certainly in Cowan, as 13 March would indicate, they have had enough. They are tired of the belligerent nature of the collective social reforms of this Government which does not provide social justice, but rather insists upon social inequality; where the disadvantaged in our community are encouraged to weaken the providers of our country's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, is it just or equitable that a single income family paying its share of tax whilst raising children has less disposable income than someone on social security benefits? The injustice is not in providing social security for those Australians who need help. The injustice is in our country, with all its natural wealth, not providing a structure which allows all Australians to provide for themselves if they have the will or the capacity to do so. But, more importantly, the injustice is in the way this Government's social policies are bludgeoning those Australians prepared to have a go and create their own and this country's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example I quoted is the same for all those families who earn $400 a week or less. This figure represents approximately 1,800 families in Cowan. No wonder family care givers in Cowan are forced into work to help retain a just standard of living when they would rather be developing a family social structure that could enhance their own values and just perhaps reduce the ever-increasing juvenile crime rate in Cowan. No wonder this pressure has caused 465 personal bankruptcies in Western Australia since January this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, is this just or equitable? Any fair-minded Australian would think not. This country's leaders would have us believe that destruction of the family unit by encouraging government provided child care is the answer. They believe forcing parents into work is healthy for this country's future. Do they not realise that our future is not with enterprise agreements, increasing indirect taxes upon small business or even introducing a scurrilous death duty tax, as I am sure they will? Our future lies with our nation's children. Yet our leaders believe in a hire purchase social structure, a buy now, pay later mentality towards government expenditure that is ripping apart this country's heritage and social stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going on? Why are not the plans, theories and decisions being made by this Government working? Why is there an injustice developing within our community, and why is this Government seemingly ignorant of the future? The vision this Government espouses will ultimately be an apocalypse for the light on the hill their true believers of 50 years ago believed in. This Government's prophecy is based on old world thinking, where revolution was the way in which progress was achieved&mdash;revolution where the socialist core described as the `haves' class are against the so-called `have-nots'; the workers against the bosses; the community against the doctors; everyone against the police; women against men; indigenous people against new settlers; and, sadly, the us against them cry is ever increasing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world, as we know it, is rapidly changing. Who would have thought six years ago that before 1993 we would have seen the breaking down of the Berlin Wall, the destruction of communism and apartheid and the re-emergence of the long forgotten eastern European countries. The world's lifestyle is changing, through the rapid development of technology. The protection and insular national boundaries are breaking down through technology driven information. They say, for instance, that by the year 2000, some 80 months away, there will be 60 times more information available to us. As much technology would have been released to us as there has been in the last 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are heading towards a global village where new industries, not even yet considered,  will replace those that have served us so well. The world is in a period of transition&mdash;a transition from the industrial age to the information or technology age, a period of rapid change. This transition is changing culture, social structure and the way we do things. A new set of community values is emerging. As an example, the last period of such a transition was 200 years ago, with the Industrial Revolution when the world changed from the agricultural age to the industrial age&mdash;a period in the world's history that saw the rise and fall of many economies&mdash;with those countries prepared to look to the future and embrace the industrial age being the ones that prospered; and those countries that wanted to reflect on past glories and hang onto the past ways of doing things missing out on the opportunities that industrialisation provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So too do we see the same examples during this period of transition to the information age. Those countries not prepared to move with the future are being left behind in development and progress and will, in my view, lose the advantage they may have previously held in the world as those that did 200 years ago. Yet those countries that are prepared to seize the opportunity of change will adapt and then adopt the ways of the information age; they will grow and then they will prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, what does this mean? Can Australia succeed in this new information and technological age with its current industrial age thinking and attitudes of this Government? I think not. Whilst our education system remains based upon industrial age thinking, we will continue to train our youth for industries, professions and employment which are rapidly becoming outdated. Whilst we pursue the outdated social justice agenda of the industrialised union movement, we will continue to drag current industry to a Third World ethos and withhold investment in new world thinking industries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the revolution is over. It is now time for esprit de corps, a time for all our institutions to work together to increase the value of our country; to develop our community for its communal self-help and problem solving; to increase the worth of our future by improving our education system to allow for new world curriculum; to develop a synergism amongst all Australians; to work to a better future; to reject government control, in particular this Government's control and take the opportunity of determining our destinies; to provide a future for us and our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the world is rich with opportunity we have a government more concerned with revisiting the past, more interested in changing our heritage than in establishing our future. Not for us should be the divisive, belligerent nature of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) more interested in ego and his place in history than the future of our great nation. Not for us, Mr Deputy Speaker, should we allow our country to fall victim of subservience to the growing world economies as our most frightening Prime Minister would have us do. Nor should we allow our family based community to break down and become unjust through the inequalities of the social reforms and tax system of this Prime Minister. This ongoing one-man's revolution against Australia's future must stop. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disappointment at not fulfilling the hope of many Australians last March sits uncomfortably with me, as I am sure it does with my colleagues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet it is not the end but rather just the beginning of an emerging energy which will be gained through our defeat. More determination to help Australia find its proper place in a 21st century is building, a place where all Australians can gain increased pride in working together to make this nation the envy rather than the ridicule of the world. The future is not with the policies of revolution and an ongoing community injustice, for we, and ultimately the children of our nation, will have to pay the price. The future is with vision and the will that we, the coalition, will provide, not the policies of ego and filibuster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This energy of which I speak is already growing in Cowan. Community based employment programs are about to be established, programs that encourage community self-help and problem solving and move us towards a 21st century social structure, programs from a community tired of waiting for action from this Government, action they have come to realise will never come; forgotten promises for the forgotten people. The energy of the future is growing, not only in Cowan but also here amongst my colleagues who represent Australians who have had enough of a government not fulfilling our country's full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not be confused by the self-interested who would have us believe the passion for the future has left us, for it has not. Do not think for one moment our energy will diminish over the next three years to rid this country of a leader who is self-obsessed, for it will not. The full potential of our country will only be realised with the dawning of a new age: the age of community responsibility, of social equality, of 21st century education, of industry unafraid to adapt to the new world and the new power, the power of the Australian individual. The dawning of this new community power can only and will only be facilitated by our side of politics, for the other side has neither the will nor the leadership to do so. Learn that we on this side of the House have the energy; and we will never relent in our struggle to ensure our country does not fall victim of this, our darkest parliament, for we have a Prime Minister intent on dividing our community and denying our proper future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask my fellow Australians: why not reject the frightening, divisive policies of our Prime Minister? Why not look to the future and embrace its opportunities? Why not stop the social inequalities developing within our community and seek a fairer tax system? Why not have a better education system, one that is preparing our children for the 21st century? Why not create employment rather than continue with policies that reduce it? Why not protect our family structure? Why not say no to the ongoing industrial revolution of our unions and reject their ideas of social justice and the destruction of small business? Why not ask for&mdash;nay, demand&mdash;leadership? The people of Cowan have, and I will not let them down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A first speech in the national Parliament only gives me a few minutes to express gratitude to colleagues, as well as to place on record my primary interest in national and local affairs. Since I was in my early twenties, politics has been the overriding concern of my professional life. I have been very fortunate&mdash;indeed, I think some people would say lucky&mdash;in my political involvement. Over the last five years as State campaign director for the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party, and as State secretary, I have had the privilege of participating in a new era of political reform in my State. The election of the Goss Government in 1989 heralded a long overdue era of reform in my State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In carrying out my responsibilities in this House, I draw upon some 19 years of political involvement in the Australian Labor Party. Today I take the opportunity to place on record some of the people who have played a part in that development. To begin with, I would like to pay tribute to my late parents, whose retirement was cruelly cut short by ill health. Neither my mother nor my father thought that the world owed them a living. They taught their family the value of hard work, to have respect for their fellow citizens, and to always help those in need. They believed in an Australia where every person had the right to a fair go, where ordinary people would be able to fulfil their dreams, regardless of where they came from or the social group they were born into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father, an old Labor man, was distrustful of big banks, big entrepreneurs, big companies and the media. He believed that most of the institutions in our society were rigged against people who earned a wage for a living. He believed that the conservatives used social background as a brick wall, blocking opportunity for ordinary people. My parents, and many of their generation, did not get a fair go. I was fortunate enough to get a fair go, and I got that fair go from the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined the Labor Party in 1974, following the May double dissolution. At that time I was at university on a scholarship and beginning to reap the rewards of Whitlam's expansion of tertiary education&mdash;as did many other people from my background. The sacking of the Whitlam Government in 1975 pushed me into deeper political involvement. In 1978 I went to work for two of the great warriors of the Labor movement&mdash;Mick Young and Bill Hayden. With them I received much of my early schooling in politics. They taught me the traditions of the Labor movement, and they taught me the fundamental importance of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Mick Young, Bill Hayden and my father, there was always one pre-eminent issue for the labor movement&mdash;jobs. Not just the number of jobs, but the quality of jobs&mdash;career structures, technological change, levels of pay, training, and all of the issues associated with developing new industries in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate enough to be born into a privileged generation that took full employment for granted. It is an awesome responsibility to enter this Parliament at a time when unemployment exceeds 10 per cent and long-term unemployment is approaching half a million. The social cost of unemployment places enormous responsibility not just on politicians in this House but also on academics, industrial leaders and everyone in our community not to tap the mat and say, `There is nothing we can do'. We should never resort to the pathetic bleating that we sometimes hear from sections of our community that there is nothing that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our duty, as national leaders, to ensure that the inevitable sacrifices flowing from unemployment are equitably borne; that fundamental principles of justice are preserved and applied; that all the nation's resources of intellect and expertise are drawn into the struggle to combat unemployment. That must be our foremost task. With unemployment, Australia faces the fourth greatest challenge of its first century of federation&mdash;a challenge as great as those presented by two world wars and the great depression. This Parliament must have a decisive role in reshaping Australia, in recharging the economy and in restoring employment. I therefore applaud the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to tackle this problem head on. It is the most fundamental thing we can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, hindering the development of appropriate interventionist policies over the past few decades has been the unhealthy dominance of laissez-faire economists in universities, in the bureaucracy, in private industry and in the conservative parties. To those people, greed is good and taxation is theft. As for helping people, we have all heard what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has had to say about that form of compassion. He said, `If you bend down to help people they drag you down'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These ideologues believe that as the rich get richer they generate something called the trickle-down effect. After 12 years of Presidents Reagan and Bush, most of the United States is still waiting for the first few drops. In America, a decade of laissez-faire economics has produced even greater inequality and appalling social services. This evening I refer to the bastion of laissez-faire dogma in this country. It is found not only in the conservative parties but also in the Industry Commission. We should consider that in some depth. From reading the reports of the Industry Commission, it seems that the only role the commission would have for government is building barbed wire fences and providing police around the suburbs to keep out the non-existent unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to members of this House a recent paper by John Quiggin of the Australian National University in which he convincingly demonstrates that the economic models used by the Industry Commission are significantly flawed. There is a kind of callousness about the Industry Commission language which makes the early Scrooge look very generous. In his paper Quiggin picks up on the wording of a section of the Commission's report in 1990-91 referring to structural change in the economy. The Industry Commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of those displaced will quickly find new jobs. Finding employment will be harder for others. In special cases, however, Government sometimes feels compelled to provide additional measures which places some individuals in favoured positions compared with those facing hardship from other causes.</PARA>
<PARA>The implication of that statement is that no unemployed person should ever receive any special assistance. In other words, forget about the unemployed&mdash;just find the level playing field and all will follow. I believe the commission never asks the essential questions. I think we should take some time to ask them here this evening. On the commission's dream level playing field what balls are the players playing with? How many are in the teams? Are there  any  injured?  Is  the  wind  blowing?  Did  it  rain  last  night? Finally,  Mr Speaker, as you would appreciate, on the level playing field is there a referee to be found?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, just as in any football match, so in economic conditions there are many factors which need to be considered. The problem is that to the ideologues of the Industry Commission these are variables which do not compute and therefore do not exist, and they never recognise the injured on the field. The best societies are those where the Government is always working to create conditions in which markets and industry can function, and where there are strong government social policies. The great strength of the Keating Government, and the Hawke Government before it, was that unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, in the 1980s Australia did not throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely adopt laissez-faire economics in all of its economic policies. In the 1980s we led the world with a national health care system and a financially sustainable social security net. We maintained the belief in a strong industry policy, and we succeeded in creating an outward looking, export orientated framework for our industry, as the recent McKinsey report demonstrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These achievements mark the Hawke-Keating governments as great governments. But unfortunately in the 1980s in certain areas of the economy there was excessive domestic and international borrowing by paper-shuffling entrepreneurs. To avoid the mistakes of the 1980s, in the 1990s we must subject the laissez-faire economists to the same scrutiny to which they have subjected everybody else, so that we can move towards developing an even stronger industrial base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, as a product of our existing industry policy, there have been some notable success stories in research and in innovation. In a number of these cases quite modest amounts of government assistance have had far-reaching effects. It is this sort of assistance that is frequently opposed by the ideologues in the Industry Commission, and always completely opposed by the Opposition parties. If the assistance is given, it can produce exports and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to one firm in my electorate, Sastek, located at Hamilton. Sastek is developing software and computer equipment for abattoirs. Throughout the 1980s it has gained increasing export markets all over the world. It openly acknowledges that it has done this through government assistance and government grants to do with market research and many other aspects of its operation. Today Sastek is an expanding firm in Lilley with 60 employees, and it has done so with considerable assistance of an interventionist industry policy and grants through that policy from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Building exports in specialist markets from small manufacturing enterprises is crucial to our future. I believe this is the positive agenda for the 1990s. But, beyond industry policy there is a range of very important social policies that must be developed. I want to refer to only one or two this evening. The development of language skills, especially Asian languages, will be crucially important in this coming decade. Here, Queensland has developed a world leading program where it matters&mdash;in primary schools where there are currently something like 60,000 students learning a language other than English. Queensland is now leading Australia in foreign language education. I believe foreign language education is an essential ingredient to us becoming an export orientated trading nation, as well as one that is culturally tolerant and understanding. I believe it will be in firms like Sastek in the 21st century that many of these Asian speaking students will be located and will find jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative from the Queensland Government is yet another sign of just how much our State has changed since the election of the Goss Government. I believe Queensland was once an enclave, setting itself apart from the rest of Australia. Queensland is now a national leader, economically and socially, and the program of foreign languages in primary schools is but one example of that leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to one other not sufficiently appreciated matter in the national capital: Queensland's path-breaking land rights legislation. This is a reform which is largely unacknowledged on the national stage, particularly in the ill-informed cafe society of Canberra, comfortably removed from the practical problems of delivering progressive programs on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sitting in this House is not just about our personal experience, or our philosophical beliefs; it is also about representing the people in the communities in which we live. No group of people in my community is more deserving of representation than the aged. People who have worked and contributed to our nation throughout their lifetime are deserving of our support in their retirement. The record of the Labor Government in aged care over the past decade has been very substantial. Just over 22 per cent of the population of Lilley is aged over 60 years, which is about 50 per cent above the national average. So aged care programs are vital in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times one particularly impressive program of dramatic effect has been the extension of assistance for home based care for the aged. Many in my community have no alternative but to enter other accommodation. In Lilley there are 110 nursing home beds per 1,000 residents&mdash;about double the State average. The rights and conditions of people living and working in these homes are deserving of the highest scrutiny and protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe most of the aged, as well as the young, see that a republic is inevitable. All but a few trenchant critics understand that the true symbol of our independence is an Australian head of state. Many of the older generation, including the war generation like my father, are quite happy to accept the republic, but they do feel uneasy about changes to the flag. Much of this stems from sentiment about fighting under the flag in past wars. The sentiment about the flag in the older generation is there. We should not ignore it; we should take note and take care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vital industry for the electorate of Lilley is racing, centred at Eagle Farm, Doomben, Albion Park and Deagon. The racing industry means jobs in Lilley. It is not only important for those jobs; it also contributes significantly to the national economy. For too long there has been not sufficient consideration of the economic importance of sport, but this was the case with the arts as well. We need to have a look at the economic importance of sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Labor Government which commissioned the first survey of Australian racing in 1991. The financial impact estimated by that survey of the racing industry was $6 billion. It is almost as big as the car industry, and bigger than the printing industry. I believe that the racing industry is ideally placed to participate in our export drive into Asia. The survey I referred to earlier recommended a one-off conference involving selected industry representatives to chart the future of the racing industry in this country. I assure the industry that it has my full support in that endeavour, and I will also be seeking the support of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the largest employers in Lilley, and a major focal point for commerce and environmental pollution, is the Brisbane airport. Brisbane has the most efficient airport in the FAC network, which is a tribute to the productivity of its staff. While the airport's capacity on present calculations will be sufficient for the next couple of decades, we should be thinking about a second airport now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aircraft noise is a significant problem for residents on both sides of the river, particularly in Hamilton, Ascot, Hendra and adjacent suburbs. In working to reduce aircraft noise we must make sure that community groups continue to have effective consultation with airport representatives. </PARA>

They are examples of typical Australians, produced from a need to survive in a harsh environment which in turn has produced characteristics such as resilience which we as Australians have been renowned for but, sadly, I think are losing. Their courage in tackling the countless problems faced by many rural Australians like them enhances my commitment to work hard to ensure that they have in this House the best representation which they so justly deserve.

I relish the challenge of following in his stead. Over his long career he asked 144 questions and made 310 speeches in this House&mdash;a creditable performance. I believe Peter Fisher will always be remembered on both sides of the House as a sincere person, as a man of consistency and as a man of persistency, particularly in his advocacy on behalf of the great grain industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the new member for Mallee comes to the House after a 20-year career as a civil engineer, over half of which has been practised as a private consultant. I wish to be able to play a constructive part in my country's development and in the massive rebuilding we need to do right across our society and community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend, Mr Speaker, that Mallee is the most significant of all the seats represented in this House. I would like to justify that bold boast. It is a rural and provincial electorate, 67,000 square kilometres in area, in the north-west of Victoria, stretching from the Grampian mountains in the south and the Glenelg River right up to the mighty Murray River in the north; and from the South Australian border in the west to the Avoca River in the east. It is one-fifth, or 20 per cent, of Victoria, which is the first point I make in regard to its significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to mention that this huge area of Victoria was once represented in this House by 2 1/2 seats. In addition to the original seat held by Sir Winton Turnbull, was the seat of Wimmera held by Bob King. I certainly mean no disrespect, either to the current honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) or the former Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, by referring to that part of the Mallee once held by Mr Fraser as the other half. The representation of 2 1/2 seats in this House is now reduced to one and, sadly, such electoral redistributions are reducing the voice of rural Australians in the House. It means that those of us who are here on both sides of the House need to shout much louder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mallee has enormous significance and yet still untapped potential. Its value is reflected in the diversity of its agriculture and its horticulture. These primary industries are complemented ably in Mallee by three magnificent provincial cities&mdash;Horsham, Mildura and Swan Hill&mdash;as well as 67 rural townships. All provide an opportunity for any variety of small business and employment in industry, manufacturing, processing, retailing and tourism. All of these small businesses exist in vital co-dependency with the rural industries that surround them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what is produced in Mallee in food and fibre is exported. This serves what has to be Australia's area of greatest need these days&mdash;a dramatically accumulating trade deficit. Virtually anything can be grown in Mallee if it suits the harsh climate. Already it has a proven capacity to rise to such challenges as providing world's best practice, particularly in grain, especially in wine&mdash;including those wines that are enjoyed in this place&mdash;and wool. To these can be added dairying, many forms of horticulture, eggs, beef and poultry. As in most areas of Australia, Mallee offers the advantage that what is grown is good, clean food, free from the contaminants suffered by our competitors in the more densely populated Northern Hemisphere. I believe this is a marketing tactic we need to be much more clever at exploiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mallee, and other electorates like it in rural Australia, have the specific function of providing a substantial part of the export earning capacity of our nation to pay for the excessive appetite that we as Australians&mdash;particularly those in our capital cities&mdash;seem to have for consuming imported goods. Mallee has been performing&mdash;and I say this with an enormous amount of pride&mdash;for many years. Of the big ticket commodity items, it produces four per cent of the national wool clip, nine per cent of the nation's grain, one per cent of dairy produce, 79 per cent of dried vine fruit, 12 per cent of citrus, 15 per cent of wine, and a whole host of other commodities I wish there was time to mention. In total, this amounts to an export earning ability from Mallee alone in excess of $550 million per annum. To this can be added income from tourism and many other earning capacities, but that would have to be regarded as a significant contribution to the nation's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring a message through you, Mr Speaker, to the House. Many of Mallee's industries are struggling, as are the small businesses that depend on them. Not just farmers, but everybody, is doing hard time. I bring that message in an appeal to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, there are 15 shire municipalities in addition to the three cities in Mallee. I believe</PARA>
<PARA>local government is an indispensable link in the structure of our democracy and is essential to a sound community. I will work steadfastly to preserve that function. There is a strong sense of community right throughout Mallee, which is the hallmark of country people. Often such valuable projects as aged care hostels, nursing homes, education centres and community centres would simply not occur without the sacrificial contribution of the community, and local government is the facilitator of this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In pre-Federation times people would have arrived in Mallee by paddle-steamer, coming upstream along the mighty Murray River. That was the principal mode of transport in those days, particularly for the then emerging wool trade. Those people would have arrived at the inland port of Mildura which, owing to the vision of the Chaffey brothers from California in the late 1800s, now presents the magnificent spectre of hundreds of square kilometres of irrigated vineyards and orchards&mdash;a sight to be seen&mdash;producing some of the world's best wines, dried fruit, citrus and vegetables. The district has become famous as Sunraysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of this district is the city of Mildura which is a vibrant provincial and regional centre with a population of 22,000 people. Sunraysia boasts an international reputation as a tourist destination not to be missed, and if you, Mr Speaker, and honourable members have not been there I encourage all to do so. Tourism is a valuable industry centred around the recreational value of the Murray River, but the surrounding horticultural pursuits provide the base for that activity. Intensive horticulture exists along the whole river frontage of Mallee, including extensive private schemes as well as government sponsored soldier settlements. Horticulture extends to include nuts and stone fruits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, recent years have seen many struggles for these horticultural industries of the Murray Valley. The growers have to compete not only with the elements and pestilence, which are the common bogies of those who attempt to work the land, but also the uncertainty of commodity prices. They are now being forced to bear the brunt of an agenda in respect of the world trade scene. Taking on the rest of the world is very difficult when you are right on the margin, have trouble paying your rates, have to struggle to educate your kids&mdash;if in fact you can at all&mdash;and even put food on the table. I will have a lot to say about preserving their interests and in fact trying to ensure that the vital horticultural industries of the Murray Valley survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these developments along the river have created some problems and salinity is a constant threat. More and more growers are taking an active role in community based salinity management schemes, but the requirement to contribute financially is hampered by their current difficulties. The initiative for the establishment of a mid-river fresh water research institute based in Sunraysia should be supported by this House in recognition of the significance not just of the Murray River, but of the Darling River as well. The Murray-Darling basin covers an enormous area of the Australian continent, embracing the major food bowl. As well, it embraces 14 federal electorates, from Queensland extending right through to South Australia. </PARA>

Indeed, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) is also part of this because the whole of the treated sewage effluent from this great edifice and this great city ends up in the Murray River. In fact, there are many of my constituents who take quite strong objection to receiving the nutrient effluent from this place. I suspect that that is not just in their coffee, but also over the airwaves. The real point is that we must be much more serious about how we treat such a magnificent asset as the Murray-Darling River system and be committed to funding ongoing research into blue green algae and the impact that nutrient rich loads from sewerage have on it, as well as research into salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other of Mallee's river based provincial cities is Swan Hill, where I reside. This city has an international reputation as a tourist Mecca, attracted by the pioneering heritage museum known right across Australia. This museum really captures the heart and the spirit of Mallee. It stands as a poignant reminder of the courage needed to build vision and make it a reality. It suffered substantial financial difficulties and the actions by the Swan Hill city council to assume responsibility for its fragile financial state to preserve it there for future heritage ought to be commended. The Swan Hill district supports a wide area of dairying, stone fruit and even boasts the largest potato grower in the Southern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Travelling south of the Murray River, though, reveals what Mallee is most famous for&mdash;the grain belt. It extends all the way to the fertile Wimmera plains in the south&mdash;oceans of grain in the sun, a sight to see&mdash;producing the best hard wheat and the best malting barley. The growers there have demonstrated a willingness to survive by their own efforts. They have already diversified into other crops, demonstrating a versatility and an adaptability which should be the model for all Australians in these days of need for radical reform. This past season the growers were cheated of an opportunity to climb out of their financial difficulties by seasonal elements beyond their control; even the best farmers in the world have no control over the elements. It is an aspect of their activity that city dwellers need to better understand, because the grain industry also is in enormous difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is vital that a resolution is found to the practices of international trade corruption if Australia is ever to continue to compete against the USA and other large players in the grain commodities export area. I am committed to the unified marketing strength of the Australian Wheat Board, which must be retained, and threats to its existence by multinational traders masquerading as Australian companies must be resisted. How else is it possible to unify the geographic diversity of growers across such a vast continent as Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the base of the Mallee electorate is the city of Horsham which provides an attractive provincial centre and is the heart of the Wimmera. Again, it has an international reputation as a tourist destination centred around the Grampian Mountains and the Little Desert National Park, and Mount Arapiles rises as a granite monolith above the fertile plains. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has challenged me to climb it with him. Its sheer rock cliffs provide opportunities for mountain climbers from all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you would be impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Mallee. I am proud of every single one of them. There is a willingness there to advance new ideas, characterised by a large casting foundry and duck exporting. There is a huge duck farm with a population of 160,000 ducks producing 15,000 ducks a week, the majority of which go into Asian export markets. There is value added processing of cereal competing with the big players. Wool and trim lamb are the predominant products of the land to the south-west of Horsham across the Western District. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no need to remind you, Mr Speaker, of the difficulties being faced by woolgrowers. When one contemplates its 200-year history, all Australians owe to this great industry an enormous amount. In fact, I would say that it has been historically the most significant contributor to our status as a nation and a major provider of our wealth and standard of living. I believe it is now time that Australians stood behind this flagship, rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are growers at the very southern tip of Mallee whose only means of putting food on the table is to cut firewood for $40 a tonne. Do honourable members know how long it takes to cut a tonne of firewood? Sadly, there are many Australians who would refuse to do such abysmally paid menial work, but they are, because such is their spirit. Urgent action is needed to halt the alarming downward spiral of the price of wool. I believe that a strong message needs to be sent to the marketplace, a signal which says that we as Australians are prepared to stand behind that stockpile and finance it or, in some form, to remove it as an impediment to good and orderly marketing. I believe that sincerely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be positive, Mallee provides an opportunity to achieve that missing link in our production chain, which is to value add not only to what is produced there, but also to what is produced in other places in our great nation. The proximity of ports in the south, the existence of a fine rail infrastructure which must be maintained and, in fact, enhanced offers openings for wool scouring and a starch industry out of the magnificent grain industry that already exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of additional exotic industries such as goats, deer and ostriches has already been taken up and other interesting industries being researched include goat and sheep milk, but I think the greatest impediment to the sheep milk industry is convincing farmers to milk their sheep. Salt, which is the great scourge of the dry land of the Mallee and also of the river, must be regarded more as an asset than a liability and opportunity taken to use saline discharge for agroforestry. There are also great opportunities for saline aquaculture with huge markets in Asia, and other industries, including fruit leather, tissue culture, vegetable powder and barley powder are being researched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Mallee, as I present it to you, represents a group of Australians with a determination to survive by their own efforts. What they need is encouragement from this House. They need policy which assists them to reduce their costs of operating in order for them to compete in the international trade arena. It is incumbent upon this House to provide the leadership, to instigate the reform that is necessary to achieve that, but I would encourage the House to ensure that it is delivered with an empathy consistent with the circumstances in which industries already find themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal more I would like to say, but time dictates that I must leave that to another occasion. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity. I trust you and the other members are better informed about Mallee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now the seat of Paterson has not existed since 1984. Research shows that initially it was named after colonial explorer and undoubted royalist and right wing establishment supporter, Lieutenant William Paterson. That seat was only ever held by the conservatives. However, the new seat of Paterson is said to be named after Banjo Paterson, the renowned balladist and republican who gave us <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clancy of the Overflow</EMPHASIS>. I believe Banjo Paterson is a fitting namesake because of that independent, national and free spirit that he inspired. It is also fitting that the first representative of the new seat of Paterson is a member of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;the party that shares those same ideals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paterson is a very diverse electorate. Its southern border is the Hunter River. It extends up the coast past Port Stephens almost to Forster. In the north there are small rural towns of Dungog, Stroud, Bulahdelah and Gloucester. It contains the historic city of Maitland in the south-west. We have the largest aluminium smelter in the Southern Hemisphere at Tomago, and our local community is enriched by the many families at the RAAF base at Williamtown. We have a large oyster and fishing industry, strong beef, dairy and broiler industries; and of course a troubled timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am here not only in support of those industries but also to seek new opportunities for the kinds of development that will bring jobs compatible to the skills and lifestyles of our residents. We who live in Paterson know that we have one of Australia's best kept secrets. It is an area of unparalleled beauty and we have the untouched wilderness areas of the Gloucester and Barrington Tops, the Myall Lakes National Park, the magnificent inland waterways of Port Stephens, and kilometres of some of the best beaches in the world. That is what the Paterson residents want preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live in an environmental jewel with areas of great ecological significance, many of which have been preserved through the initiatives of local citizens. Our Landcare groups are an active growing voice in environmental protection. Our coastal areas are under great pressure from rapid urban growth. Much of my electorate is a water catchment area and provides all the domestic water for the lower Hunter. There is a great need that the purity of this supply be maintained for future development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are home to one of the largest koala colonies on the east coast of Australia and community pressure has resulted in innovative reforms in koala management. Special corridors will be constructed under the Raymond Terrace bypass for koala safety and protection. Nelson Bay has two resident schools of dolphins, and whale watching, fortunately, is becoming a seasonal activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the people of my electorate to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who has just entered the House, for her prompt response that saved over 100 acres of natural bush coastline at Fame Cove. As national park, this will become part of Australia's heritage forever, but we are willing to share all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is our growth industry. We are poised to take advantage of this Government's major initiatives for tourism development. I am grateful for the efforts of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) in securing funding from the previous government to develop the Hunter's first regional airport. This new facility holds great promise for our region. We already host the largest game fishing tournament in the world. The Myall Prawn Festival is one of the top 10 non-metropolitan festivals in New South Wales. Oz Ski in my own home town of Raymond Terrace attracts world-class water skiers from every nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not only our natural attractions that bring visitors to the Paterson electorate; it is also steeped in history. The Hunter River in the earliest days of settlement was the only means of accessing the colonial hinterland. Outside Maitland is the largest preserved historical village of Morpeth, a port last century for shipping timber and produce to Sydney and then overseas. Only this weekend Maitland was the host to 40,000 people for the 10th annual Australian steamfest where we could relive the engineering marvels of a bygone era. My colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and I will be approaching the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) for promotional funding. We will be a formidable pair. There is no doubt that together we will add considerable weight to any argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every corner of my electorate has a story to tell and local historians like Maitland's colourful character Harry Boyle can attest to the excitement of the legends and the richness of our heritage. To me, it is the greatest irony that, in times when we are just starting to value our heritage and to seek symbols of our own national identity, one of Australia's first female activists and humanitarians, Carolyn Chisholm, who assisted stranded and penniless immigrant women and set up a home in the frontier town of Maitland, has been removed from our $5 note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, European history is only a small part of the cultural and historical heritage offered by the Paterson electorate. We are home to representatives of the Mindaribba, the Worimi, the Birupi, the Kamarah and the Awabakal people. Our local artist, Mini Heath, has an international reputation. Representatives of our land councils are making a valuable contribution to the diversity of our communities. I am particularly pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in this International Year of the World's Indigenous People, has taken positive steps to address two centuries of social injustice. I believe he shows his sincerity that something will finally be done by taking personal responsibility for this in his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another and major initiative of this Government that I particularly welcome because of its significance for the residents of my electorate, and that is the decision to set up a portfolio for regional development. No electorate is a separate entity. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) will be well acquainted with my views not only on the needs of the electorate but also on just how we can address the long-term neglect from which the Hunter as a region has suffered. Since the first loads of coal and wood were shipped to Sydney in 1801, the Hunter has continued to provide much of this nation's wealth. It generates 85 per cent of New South Wales's electricity. It has the only rail lines that earn a profit in New South Wales, hauling coal down for export&mdash;of course, using diesel locos chewing up imported diesel fuel. We have a highly integrated metal industry. We are a major service centre. National Textiles at Rutherford is one of the most progressive textile plants in Australia, and of course the Hunter has the biggest earning port in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the productivity of the Hunter has always been enhanced by the many successful small businesses using innovative and progressive methods. A good example is a Maitland margarine manufacturer, William Caine Pty Ltd. In 1986 this company was granted the first margarine production licence in 30 years. At that stage it employed four or five people. Today it has captured eight per cent of the national market. It is exporting margarine to New Zealand and it is looking to export margarine to Asia. It currently employs approximately 30 people and is growing. This country derives enormous wealth from the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that one of the basic concepts of any business is to nurture that part of the business that is making a profit. The Hunter must have a fair share of reinvestment from all levels of government. The pride which we might take from our high productivity is tempered by a level of unemployment which is intolerably and unacceptably high. We are also sadly lacking in land transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry and commerce, backed by local government, is seeking an upgrade of the Dubbo to Newcastle road link. This will join two of the most highly productive areas in Australia and I strongly support this concept. It opens enormous opportunity for business. The Pacific Highway, which bisects my own electorate, is one of the nation's black spot roads and that is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many of the main roads in the Paterson electorate there are single lane bridges built in the last century and we expect our school children to travel daily over these roads in buses&mdash;roads that were better suited for the bullock teams that built them. The timber truss bridge on the Karuah River was built in 1877; the Hinton bridge in 1904; the Dunmore bridge at Woodville in 1899; and as we approach the 21st century I must admit that I wonder which will last longer in the present form&mdash;our bridges or the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet much of the other infrastructure is already there. We have small towns such as Dungog, Gloucester and Bulahdelah. They have schools, hospitals, commercial centres, serviced land and playing fields&mdash;they are magnificent places in which to bring up a family. Actually, I am very proud that I had the opportunity, together with my wife, to bring up our two daughters&mdash;and they are present here this evening&mdash;in such a town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what these towns do not offer&mdash;and there are towns like these all over Australia&mdash;is jobs. Economies of scale have closed the mills, the factories and the railways. The transport system is so bad that people have difficulty getting to the larger centres for work. When kids leave school they leave home, and that makes country residents second-class citizens in this the greatest of nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate at which we are depopulating our rural areas of young people is accelerating. The city of Sydney grows by 50,000 people a year; that is, a city the size of Dubbo is assimilated into Sydney every year. The environmental cost is enormous. I believe that the Metropolitan Water Board of Sydney is currently buying large tracts of land in the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River, so that water supply for Sydney will be guaranteed for the middle of next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been Australia's pattern of short-sightedness, based on the belief that it was good business practice to get the best return from the least investment in the shortest time. This principle has left us with a disastrous legacy: Australia now has one of the most highly centralised patterns of industrial development and settlement. Our major cities, which our great poet A.D. Hope described as `teeming sores', are bleeding our rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only now that we are starting to realise the long-term and environmental costs. So, Mr Speaker, I again warmly welcome the initiative of regional development. I want to see the roads, rail links and port facilities built to service our regional centres. I want to see the Hunter get its reward for being one of the most productive areas in Australia. I want to see broken the monopoly that big cities have on industrial development, warehousing and shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me inform you, Mr Speaker, that beef grown and sold in my electorate is transported more than 100 kilometres to be slaughtered. Then it is transported back past the shipping centre of Newcastle, to be shipped out of Brisbane or Sydney. Wool sold in Newcastle&mdash;and some of the best wool in the world is sold at Newcastle&mdash;is then put on a truck and sent to Sydney. Sydney, our most congested city, with its correspondingly high real estate prices, is where this country has its biggest wool dump. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government must give incentives for industry to relocate to regional areas and, as a government, set the example. I embrace this Government's commitment to regional development as a step towards commonsense and justice. I hereby serve notice on the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) that the Hunter team has an extra voice. The Hunter is hunting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also warmly commend the previous Government's local government capital works program under the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons). This was a major initiative and only now are the jobs that it created beginning to reach fruition. It provided some fulfilment of the wish list that all small shires have. I hope that it will become a permanent feature of our relationship with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have enormous potential for job opportunities from far-sighted projects such as the completion of the Gloucester to Walcha road. This would provide a major link to the New England region, open up job opportunities in Gloucester and at the same time provide a major alternative to the New England Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is more that this new and exciting Government can bring to my electorate&mdash;and this is in its policy towards our finite resources. In the past if a forest existed it was there to be cut down. If it regenerated we cut it down again and, if it did not, well, what the hell, there were plenty more. And of course in the past this brought us great wealth, but it is no longer the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forest areas in the Gloucester, Dungog, Bulahdelah and Stroud areas, where logging and milling were major industries, are now in urgent need of replanting and of new jobs in new fields&mdash;a whole new concept to our traditional rural industries. One of those might well be in the area of energy generation. Today energy controls the world, and I believe that Australia is in a unique position to rewrite the energy equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Energy must be obtained from renewable resources. For that reason, I welcomed the grant approved last December by the then Minister for Resources, now Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, for a trial ethanol plant in my electorate, the ethanol to be distilled from forest waste. This technique has been developed by a resident of my electorate, Dr Russell Reeves. This new fuel will not increase greenhouse gases. Hopefully, it will be economically viable and will reduce our dependence on imports. Australia has a great opportunity to be a world leader in other areas. I support the Government's view that we should look to Asia&mdash;it is where our trading future lies. We should also promote understanding and cooperation with all neighbouring nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at the reports by Amnesty International of continuing human rights violations in East Timor.

In those circumstances, I appreciate acutely the special privilege I enjoy in offering this speech from the dispatch box.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have arrived in this House having contested and won my seat as an endorsed candidate for the Liberal Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tangney, the electorate I represent, is an inner metropolitan electorate straddling the leafy southern suburbs of Perth. It is largely a residential area with some light industry. The northern boundary is formed by the southern sides of the Swan and Canning rivers. It is named after Dame Dorothy Tangney. Her career was detailed and the electorate was described as it then was in the maiden speech of my immediate predecessor, Mr Peter Shack. The warm welcome I have received from the residents of Tangney as their new representative has been humbling. I thank them and the many people whose efforts ensured my election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tangney has sent four representatives to Canberra before me. Mr Peter Shack made a substantial contribution to public life over many years, a contribution which has not, in my view, been acknowledged adequately. Mention could be made of two other former representatives. Both occupy positions on the government front bench: one as Treasurer and the other as Assistant Treasurer. Despite being rejected by it, the latter, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), is so attached to the electorate of Tangney that he continues to reside in it. In fact, his residence is within a very short distance of my electorate office. I want to assure the Assistant Treasurer that if he, as one of my constituents, ever has any problem with the Federal Government or any of its instrumentalities, the services of my electorate office are available to assist him. This applies particularly to any difficulty he might encounter in his relationship with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) or the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, in giving the call to new members for the first time, just as you did with me, you have requested the House to extend the usual courtesies. This is a laudable practice which enables new members unfamiliar with the House and its ways to crawl before they are called upon to walk. The price exacted of a new member for the courtesies is that he or she is expected to be non-contentious. In the past week there have been some instances of new members accepting the courtesies and sailing close to the limits of non-contention. The non-contentious remarks of one new member caused a member of long standing to exercise his right to give a personal explanation in reply to criticism of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is wrong that courtesy should be abused. It would undermine the practice of allowing a new member to speak undisturbed and could result in the practice being dropped. In case anything I will say might be considered by others to be contentious, let me say that I will not complain if honourable members feel able to curb their natural propensity for courtesy. I will not complain if I am treated as if I am delivering a second speech rather than a maiden speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why a person deeply immersed in a business, profession or in particular employment decides to leave that calling and offer himself or herself for election to parliament is usually complex.

My perception, and one which I shared with many Australians, was that the Parliament was a place in which entertainment, derision and abuse featured at the expense of rational debate. Whether or not that perception was accurate, it is one of my aspirations to participate in the decision making of this House by contributing to a reasoned discussion of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek to contribute to a process which all Australians can be confident enables the serious, substantive questions facing Australia to be properly dealt with on their merits.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My parents grew up in the 1920s. I was a teenager growing up in the 1950s. My children are teenagers now. My parents lived through the Great Depression and, before recovery from that was complete, the Second World War. Neither had the opportunity to finish school. In their youth, opportunities for employment were limited. In my youth, Australia was a place of great stability and of great optimism. Education was both available and free, and finding a job was not difficult. With hindsight, there was much that could have been improved, but at the time most Australians thought they had a fortunate life in a lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like many of the electors of Tangney, I am concerned about the future of my children. I want young Australians to be able to look forward to an appropriate education of their choice and to have the prospect of getting a job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament is the crucible in which the essence of our democracy is distilled. The democracy, however, derives not only from the parliament. The complex relationships of the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government form the foundations, and the powers which each arm of government exercises ultimately depend not on any coercive capacity but on the support, express or tacit, given to it by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s I was employed by the Asian Development Bank and my wife and I lived in the Philippines, a nation then proud of its democracy established after the war. In September 1972 we had a vivid demonstration of the fragility of democracy. We woke on a Sunday morning to find that there was no newspaper. The radio, with its innumerable stations, was silent. The television ran no programs. We found the roads were almost empty. A policeman on a motorbike stopped our car. He was unable to explain to us what was happening, but did indicate there was a curfew. Later that day we learned that, having on Saturday night been living in a democracy with presidential elections approaching, we were now on Sunday living ostensibly under constitutional martial law with elections suspended. In fact, we were under a militarily backed dictatorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My work took me to many Asian countries. What I saw made me realise how fortunate Australians are. In many countries there was no suggestion of democracy; in a number there was war or insurgency. Even in those Asian countries with democratic governments substantially based on the Westminster system there were subtle differences from our system. Those subtle differences can determine whether there is a genuinely free democracy or one in which there is no defence to repression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An essential element of a true democracy, of our democracy, is an independent judiciary. I do not suggest that Australia's democratic system is presently under direct threat, but Australians should always be vigilant to ensure that any threat to the independence of our judiciary is firmly challenged. The independence involves freedom of the judiciary from the influence, by fear, favour or otherwise, of any agency and particularly the executive government. Essential to the independence of the judiciary is a strong, independent legal profession. The role and functioning of the legal profession continues as a subject of public discussion. In those discussions, the importance of the profession in the maintenance of the judicial system should be neither underestimated nor undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intrinsic to the performance by this House of ensuring government is accountable to the people is the principle that no member should mislead the House. In a similar way, the efficient administration of justice depends on members of the legal profession as officers of the superior courts not misleading any court. In parliamentary elections, there is no equivalent obligation, and the opportunities for distortion and deception are abundant. In practical terms, the means of preventing dissemination of misleading information and the means of remedying the consequences of it are quite inadequate. This is particularly the case where those involved are not candidates or are not acting in the name of a political party. That, in my opinion, constitutes a significant potential threat to democracy. It is a matter, in my view, which warrants the attention of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to the proposed Address-in-Reply, I wish to refer to some specific matters. First, the Constitution of Australia provides for this to be a constitutional monarchy. The Government has no mandate from the electorate for a change from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Australians can indicate their desire for such a change only by a referendum. Historically, Australians have shown themselves to be very reluctant to amend the Constitution. In those circumstances, it would be presumptuous for anybody to assume what would be the result of a referendum proposing that Australia should be a republic. It would be even more presumptuous to assert what sort of republic Australians would accept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is committed to participating in the debate over whether Australia should become a republic and, if the answer is yes, what sort of republic Australia should become. It is essential that the public be informed fully as to what are the alternative forms of republic. It is also essential that there be a detailed analysis in the course of the public debate of the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives&mdash;retention of the constitutional monarchy, variation of it or substitution of one of a number of possible forms of republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not escaped attention that the Government appears to have embarked on a subtle campaign to remove visible references to and symbols of the monarchy. That campaign has extended to matters concerned with this Parliament. As I understand it, the proclamation of the Governor-General calling Parliament together has, since 1901, been in a time-honoured form. The proclamation has traditionally concluded with the words, `God save the Queen'. The proclamation calling this Parliament together omitted those words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forms of oath and affirmation of office taken by Ministers have also been in a time-honoured form. The commitment under it has been well and truly to serve the Queen, her heirs and successors according to law in the relevant office. Just prior to this Parliament being opened, the form of oath and affirmation of office was changed. In consequence, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) took an oath of office different from that taken by other Ministers. Reference to the Queen was eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional form of Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech has for 90 years been substantially in the same form. The Address-in-Reply proposed last week by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the honourable member for Lowe (Ms Easson) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) is not in that traditional form. While reference to the sovereign has not been eliminated, it has been amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I have no difficulty with changing the language of forms with a view to simplifying or modernising the language. It is particularly appropriate where the traditional form is obscure and the replacement, without changing the effect, is simple and direct. It is another thing, however, for the traditional forms to be changed with the object of eliminating references to our present constitutional system, the monarchy, with the ultimate view, no doubt, of inculcating and promoting a republican ideal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia may in the future become a republic, but if it does Australia will not become a republic by stealth. The Australian people cannot be taken for granted. Australia has a constitution. Until Australians agree to its being changed, it should not be subverted; it should be observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Governor-General's speech, reference was made to gender awareness programs for members of the judiciary and other decision makers within the legal system. I refer to this because of its connection with the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, there have been aspects of our law which were structured in such a way that they did not take into account women's perspectives adequately or, in some cases, at all. Reform over decades has eliminated much of that imbalance, but it would be wrong to assume that none remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice is administered in courts by judges and by judges and juries. Australians have a judiciary which is the equal of any in the common law world, and the public has great faith in the jury system. One of the strengths of the judiciary is that the judges exercise their responsibilities free from the influences of government and free from sectional and community influences. The function of a judge is largely to declare and apply the law. However, some decisions may be affected by the judge's personal view on a social issue. This may be true of juries also, but their deliberations are in private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, a judge sitting in court evinces an attitude which the community finds unacceptable. There have been notable instances recently where judges in sexual assault trials have made comments which many in the community, and particularly women, have found demeaning of women. I expressly refrain from commenting on any particular case. It is certainly disappointing if a judge reveals an attitude which is out of date or unenlightened or is out of step with general community views. It is more than disappointing if that attitude affects the outcome of a case before the judge, such that the outcome is perceived as unjust. I accept that many women in the community are concerned that some male judges have outdated attitudes on some social issues that do not adequately reflect the community viewpoint, particularly that of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should be done? It must not be forgotten that many decisions of judges are subject to appeal and an appellate court may correct a decision which reflects an inappropriate attitude on the part of a trial judge. That is not a complete solution. It is not for the Government to take steps to indoctrinate or re-educate judges. That would give rise to different and very serious concerns. It is for the judiciary itself to do something. In relation to gender bias awareness, the fact is that the judiciary has recognised that there is a need for something to be done. In the absence of detail in the Governor-General's speech, one could be forgiven for thinking that the proposed funding of the gender awareness programs for the judiciary was an initiative of the Government. It is not. The Government is responding to an initiative of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute is a body independent of government, comprising a large number of judges, magistrates, lawyers&mdash;in private practice, in government practice and academics&mdash;and court administrators dedicated to the study and improvement of the system of administration of justice. In November 1992 the institute, having regard to the report of the task force of the National Committee on Violence Against Women, applied to the Government for funding for the development of a gender bias awareness program. The institute is an appropriate body to develop and to conduct such courses for the judiciary. On the basis that there is no government interference in the development conduct of any such courses, I expect the Opposition would in due course support the provision of funds by the Government to the institute for the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing also to note that the institute is conducting a program on Aboriginal cultural awareness for the judiciary and is investigating the introduction of both gender bias and Aboriginal cultural awareness programs into orientation courses for judicial officers.

Mr Speaker, may I extend my thanks to the people of Geelong and the electors of Corio for the great honour they have extended to me by sending me here to represent their interests in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a wonderful electorate. They are wonderful people; I guess it is not fashionable for politicians to make promises at this point in our history, but I will make only one and that is that I will faithfully serve their interests in this Parliament. I will bring all my skill and energy to bear to represent their interests and I hope at the end of the day, when I leave this House, people will be able to say that he did his best for Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I would like to pay tribute to the man who preceded me as member for Corio in this House, the Hon. Gordon Glen Denton Scholes. As honourable members would know, Gordon entered the Parliament in 1967 and, over a career that spanned some 26 years, he gave loyal service to his constituents and loyal service to this Parliament. He was a man of integrity and he was genuinely liked by people on both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I just take honourable members through some of the elements of his maiden speech, because it will give them some idea of the vision of this man whom I regard as one of the unsung heroes of the labour movement over the past 30 years. In his maiden speech, Gordon drew attention to the fact that Australia needed a national standard gauge network. He also drew attention to the fact that Australia needed a universal health system easily affordable, a quality system that would serve the working people of Australia. He also made reference, in his maiden speech, to the need for a government aircraft production facility in Australia, and I am pleased to say that it was Labor in government that delivered those things to him. The national standard gauge network, as part of the One Nation statement, will be routed through Geelong. The Government has instituted a Medicare system that is the envy of the world. This Government provided the finance for the restructuring of the Government Aircraft Corporation which has lead to the formation of ASTA, which offers great and exciting potential for employment growth in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great contribution that he made to this place. I think the measure of his status can be seen in what other great Australians thought of Gordon. I would like to recount to honourable members an incident that occurred in the course of the campaign. We invited the living Labor legend, Big Gough, down to Corio to assist us in the campaign. It was a hot night, and we were all sweating pretty badly. The big fellow was mopping the back of the head like so. The city of Geelong West provided a small reception in the anteroom. After that was completed I suggested to Gough and Gordon that, before we went to the main dinner, we might like to go outside and walk up the side of the Geelong West Town Hall. We did that, to catch a bit of fresh air before we went into the main dinner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we walked along, Gordon was railing against the effect of the GST on older Australians. It was something that he felt quite passionate about, particularly the effect of the GST on funerals. As we got near the entrance to the main hall the Big Fellow stopped. We both stopped and he looked at Gordon and me; it was a poignant historical moment for me; and he said, `Well, Gordon, you and I will not have to worry about that. There will be no GST on state funerals'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was a mark of how Gough perceived Gordon's contribution to the nation, as well as how Gough perceived his own historical importance to the nation. But Gordon's contribution was a magnificent one, and I am sure all members on both sides of the House will join me in wishing him well in his retirement. He will be retiring from this place, but not from active political life in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the great Corio electorate, which I now represent, stretches from the great industrial heartland of the north of the electorate&mdash;the suburbs of Corio: Norlane and North Shore&mdash;and sweeps down along the Princes Highway to the central business district which services the great west coast region and the Bellarine Peninsula and also the productive western district hinterland. It is an electorate rich in ethnic diversity. It also stretches from that central business district down along the Bellarine peninsula. In that central business district that I mentioned before is the city's great cultural assets. I refer here to the Geelong Art Gallery, the Geelong Performing Arts Centre and the National Wool Museum. All these initiatives have been funded by State and Federal Labor governments to serve the people of this great region of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corio is an electorate of great ethnic diversity. I pay tribute here to the people who came to Geelong in the postwar era to make their homes. They have made an enormous contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of this region. We have one of the great community festivals in Geelong, the Pako Festa, and it is unique because it involves the combined effort of local government, the business community and the ethnic community. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) had the pleasure of participating in that festival in the course of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also an electorate endowed with great physical infrastructure assets. As far as transport is concerned, the port of Geelong is one of the pre-eminent bulk handling ports in Australia. It has recently undergone a period of micro-economic reform, resulting in great increases in productivity without conflict. It is well serviced by rail, and I have already mentioned the standard gauge rail network supplementing that service. It is well serviced by road. Travelling from Melbourne to Geelong, one can see the One Nation moneys being spent on upgrading the roads. Down on the Bellarine Peninsula, the Portarlington Road is almost complete. It is also well serviced by air. Exciting developments are taking place at Avalon with ASTA becoming a major regional employer and offering great potential for expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The region also has a well-developed community services sector. I would like to pay particular tribute tonight to those much maligned people in the Australian community who provide an essential range of services to the people of Geelong to improve their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the business sector is concerned, we have a combination of large industry: Ford, which produces passenger motor vehicles; textiles, clothing and footwear, with Godfrey Hirst Carpets; Alcoa, which produces aluminium; and also Shell, which produces petroleum. The large business sector is particularly important to the Geelong region; but so is the small business sector, and I will speak further about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many words have been spoken in recent times about the problems that the city of Geelong has had in the past. The Pyramid collapse sapped community confidence. Industry restructuring has meant that there has been significant labour shedding in the passenger motor vehicles industry and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. There has also been a major impact upon the city with the general downturn in manufacturing. However, through all that, the great, resilient Geelong community has come through the pain and it now faces the future with a degree of optimism. It is a great place to live and a great place to be, and it is bristling with potential. Many people have asked what that potential is. I would suggest that, in the range of government programs that have been put in place, there are hints as to the areas in which the Geelong economy can grow over the next decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Food and fibre processing will become increasingly significant. I would like to pay particular tribute to the Federal Government for the encouragement that it gave to BWK, the German wool scourer, to locate in the region. It will mean an extra 150 private sector jobs. There is great potential for job creation in the Geelong region through tourism&mdash;general tourism, eco-tourism, rural tourism and cultural tourism&mdash;utilising all the assets I have mentioned. There is great potential in the area for the export of services. I refer to engineering, construction and educational services. There is also potential for further growth in the public sector. Corio is relatively underdone when compared to other electorates around Australia in that regard. All in all, it is an exciting place to be and one which offers great potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to turn to the sector of the Geelong economy which offers the key to its long-term economic future and growth in jobs. I refer to the development of Geelong's small and medium business sector and the commercialisation of the new, innovative technologies that exist in the region. Exports from the Magnificent 700, identified by the Australian Manufacturing Council, will grow to $15 billion by 1997. My aim over the next three years will be to make sure that innovative Geelong businesses get a big slice of the action. Sorry, guys!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the recent measures announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which are designed to strengthen and encourage small business. Competitive taxation arrangements, investment and export incentives will do much to stimulate that sector. The Government's recent initiatives to make the banking and finance sector more responsive to the needs of small and medium business, and to expand their lending to promising new ventures, is good news. However, there is more to be done. Conservative banks are still attempting to shore up losses incurred throughout the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the House to an innovative firm in Geelong called Gearing Dynamics. It has developed a revolutionary oil-emersed braking system which has quite staggering export potential. While the company has struggled to research and develop the product and to bring it to the commercialisation phase, it has encountered significant bureaucratic and financial institutional inertia that really leaves one wondering about the future of the clever country. While the bankers muse about the great potential of the product, it is their guidelines that restrict lending to commercialise the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much more to be done in the area of financing small, innovative businesses. Ways must be found to encourage the mobilisation of indigenous capital in regional areas. Joint venture risk capital companies need to be encouraged with principals who are not constrained by the largely conservative lending culture that still exists in the Australian banking system. It is only when these problems are really addressed that the clever country can ride on the back of the innovative energy of its entrepreneurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the area of regional development, an issue which has important ramifications for Geelong. I suggest that there is a role for the Commonwealth Government to play in stimulating the efficient use of national resources, as well as reducing the disparity in income levels and living standards between regions. National economic and welfare objectives cannot be fulfilled if key manufacturing regions such as Geelong are not performing to their potential. Market forces alone will not achieve the optimal spatial distribution of industry across the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several compelling reasons why we need to seriously examine the regional development issue now. Firstly, the rapid pace of structural adjustment has left many regions with a diminished capacity to absorb displaced labour. Secondly, our major cities are becoming less attractive places to live. They have become economically inefficient, socially remote and polluted environments. In many regions the process of economic decline has been exacerbated by the process of tariff reform, adverse climatic conditions and declining commodity prices, which have served to reduce production, employment and income flows in local communities. In addition, the process of micro-economic reform has led to significant losses of public employment in smaller provincial towns that have no economic capacity to employ displaced skills. This rapid and serious decline in the economic base of regions threatens current and future investment in community assets such as housing and roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the Government's recent regional policy initiatives: the expansion of DITAC to include regional development responsibilities and the imminent formation of a regional development task force. There is a need to develop a comprehensive policy framework for coordinating existing Commonwealth programs, for many initiatives in the food processing and tourism area, labour market and adjustment programs, assistance to exporters and rural economic programs impact significantly on regions. The policy framework that is being developed must allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate the different responses that are required to meet the unique problems and needs of differing regions. It must also coordinate in an effective way all the players in the game&mdash;local and State governments, regional development associations, the union movement, community organisations and private firms. I look forward to participating in this future debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let me turn to an issue which will occupy a central place in public debate in Australia in coming years. I refer to the issue of an Australian republic. This is the debate that the Australian people have to have. I appreciate that the issue is a sensitive one for many Australians, because I draw my family heritage from English, Irish and Scottish ancestry, but that should not prevent us from conducting this debate in a rational manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see great potential for this debate to unlock the creative energy of Australians and to define more clearly for us what it means to be Australian in this rapidly changing world. The factors that are propelling us towards this debate are compelling. Since World War II the influx of migrants from southern Europe, and more recently from Asia, has created a cultural and ethnic diversity unparalleled in our previous history. Also, an increasing regional identification has been encouraged by the growth of our trade with rapidly expanding Asian economies to our north. Just as the United Kingdom is seeking to carve out a deeper economic and political relationship with Europe, so must Australia seek to construct a more meaningful relationship with our northern neighbours. Just as the loyalty of the Queen of England will always be to her own subjects in the United Kingdom, so must we have in Australia a truly Australian head of state whose pre-eminent loyalty will be to the people of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that there is widespread community confusion and ignorance about the Australian Constitution, the federal system and the institutions at the core of our political system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the Prime Minister's invitation to honourable members opposite to participate fully in this great national debate, and commend the Prime Minister for his political courage in thrusting this issue to the centre of the political stage. In raising this issue the Prime Minister is articulating a deep and legitimate personal aspiration. But it is one which I believe he now shares with a majority of Australians. I am convinced that we can conduct this debate in a way that gives all Australians an opportunity to participate, that strengthens our democratic system, and that produces an outcome that reflects our current political, economic and social maturity&mdash;an Australian republic. </PARA>

My parents were committed Christians and lived by what they preached. They instilled in their four children an intense love of the land, care for one's fellow man, the need to contribute to one's community no matter what one's station in life, and perhaps most of all that the pursuit of material wealth for its own sake was the path of fools.

I think of Benno Murray, at 103 years of age the oldest known Aboriginal&mdash;a Gallipoli and World War II veteran, and a resident of Womi Kata at Port Augusta.

I will continue to inquire of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) and seek a clear explanation of the future of Port Augusta and the Eyre Peninsula line, to at least ensure a consultative process where people are not living in a constant state of insecurity.

Australia is not a one-party nation, as the last election conclusively showed: 1,279 Australians in eight marginal seats determined the outcome of the election. In 11 million people that is a much narrower victory than any one-point victory in an Australian rules football grand final, and surely even the most one-eyed Labor supporter must regard it as a very slim mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember when Prime Ministers would claim victory in the spirit of governing for all Australians, but I do not recall hearing that this time around. The great lesson of 1993 was the use of fear as a legitimate political weapon, and I note the main headline today about the Government's need to broaden the tax base.

I see or hear no sign of any improvement, and it gives me no joy to say that. We are fortunate to have Roxby Downs, Moomba, our opal fields, our iron ore, and our gypsum mines, but that is still not enough. The infrastructure and our natural resources which the people of Grey currently produce means we make up about 50 per cent of South Australia's exports. The full potential is thwarted by a heavy indirect taxation burden. We must encourage people to help themselves, but we can never reach our potential if we tax people excessively before they even strike a blow. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to conservation. Part of my electorate includes the Lake Eyre basin. It is currently perceived by some to be under threat from a World Heritage listing. Locking this land up for the long term is seen as a threat to the viability of pastoralism and as a huge cost to taxpayers. I await with interest the Minister's plan for this region. We also have Landcare. I was involved in the early days of Landcare and the Phillip Toyne/Rick Farley initiative, but there is still a great unfinished job to be done. It has achieved a lot, but I outline this simple equation: something like $150 per farm is given from the Government, from the Treasury, and we take something like $15,000 to $30,000&mdash;you name it&mdash;out of that same farm by way of indirect taxation. So I suggest that one of the biggest threats to conservation in this country is the economic pressure of government policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal now with industrial relations. Industrial relations has a long tradition of adversarial competition which has harmed Australia's potential, and I look forward to the day when this part of Australia's national life is bipartisan and not captive to the partisan interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to education. Austudy and many components of Austudy are unfair to many who live long distances from the main centres of learning. There is some irony in the fact that we need people to live in our regions to produce most of our export income, but when it comes to a fair go in services the Parliament does not hear. It is a serious issue. At a time when we need all the skills this country can offer, there are too many people missing out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next serious issue is centralisation versus the smaller more isolated communities.

I will offer one area where we have done a terrible disservice to these regions&mdash;and I probably will differ with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), whose speech I was reading in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> this morning. I believe fuel tax is the most discriminatory tax in recent Australian history. It attacks those who have no choice but to use fuel, and ignores those who have access to subsidised urban transport in stronger, more viable communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal now with local government. In the electorate of Grey there are 30 council areas and up to six State electorates. Last week in our non-compulsory local government elections we had an 80 per cent turnout. So I can say that democracy is well and truly alive in my community. I had six valuable and pleasurable years of experience with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool and wheat in Grey are our traditional industries. To a large degree this reflects the double standards of Australia. Here we have the free market on the world market compared to the protected wage which can rarely, if ever, reflect the climatic or marketing fluctuations upon which it relies. I am puzzled by the barricade argument on wages when I see variations of factors of three, to five, to 10 in negative to positive incomes in my occupation. These traditional export earners enabled Australia to help pay its way in the world rather than be financed by the international bankers which now finance most of us as well as, of course, the wool industry itself. The rural adjustment scheme is lucky if it helps five per cent of farmers, offers no support for business, and will never be a substitute for effective economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I come to my conclusion I want to talk a little bit about political sportsmanship, and a little story that I always enjoyed in recent years. When John Curtin was Prime Minister during the Second World War, a journalist made some snide comment in the presence of Opposition leader Menzies. Apparently Menzies turned on the journalist and defended Curtin with great spirit in view of what Menzies considered an unfair attack. It is stories like that that I think help me to acknowledge the great gift of being born Australian, and it is with a sense of great humility that I remember our pioneers and those parliamentarians that have gone before. I feel particularly fortunate to have witnessed the condolence motions last week for Sir Paul Hasluck and Professor Fred Hollows.

This is a great moment of triumph for me. I have at last returned the seat of Bass to the Labor Party after its 18 years in the wilderness. The challenge to do so was offered to me at preselection in 1989. The task was a formidable one. However, my predecessor, Warwick Smith, underestimated my tenacity and firm belief that this Smith could win, and today a winner I am. My determination was immovable, although the obstacles were immense. My willingness to strive, my faith and often my pigheadedness kept me from wavering far from the ultimate goal of retrieving the seat of Bass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My local idol in Bass is Lance Barnard, a former Deputy Prime Minister of this great country. It was he who encouraged and helped me to shape the highway ahead. I made a solemn vow that I would work for three campaigns to get his seat back for the Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is Bass. It was named after Dr George Bass, an early explorer who, in 1798, circumnavigated Tasmania&mdash;then known as Van Diemen's Land&mdash;in a small sloop, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Norfolk</EMPHASIS>. Bass Strait was named after him to honour this trip that put Tasmania firmly and well and truly on the map. George Bass was a keen student of nature. It was once said that he was the first man to bring a trained, scientific intelligence to bear upon the natural phenomena of this country. I ask that we heed those ideals today as we all work on both sides of this House to restore our environmental flora and fauna, somewhat similar perhaps to that which Dr Bass must have enjoyed 205 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bass electorate came into being in 1903, and its first member of this House was David Storrer. During his first speech in this Parliament on 2 March 1904 Mr Storrer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am one of those who favour the idea that the Federal authorities should take over the whole of the functions of government and thus do away with the necessity for incurring expense in maintaining State Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that this man was well ahead in his thinking. Yet, almost 90 years later, we are still considering the possibility of one tier of government instead of what we now have, possibly an overgoverning of our people. Way back then David Storrer showed major concerns with the amount of commodities we were importing from foreign countries. He said that Australia in the early 1900s was intent on building up overseas industries and giving employment to their workers instead of affording encouragement and employment to the men and women of our own nation. Mayhap we should reflect a while on this thought as being once again perhaps relevant to today's import-export imbalance. His solution to partially avoid this imbalance in 1904 was to levy higher duties&mdash;today's tariffs&mdash;upon foreign goods imported, although I may add he did not suggest putting them on goods from Great Britain. Is this another suggestion from the past for us to heed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until today, the Labor Party has held the seat of Bass on and off for 57 out of 90 years, with its most famous ALP members being Claude Barnard and his son Lance, my mentor. I look to serving the electorate of Bass beyond the turn of the century at the very least. Claude Barnard held the seat from 1934 to 1949. He was a locomotive engineman and, during his service in this place, chaired the Joint Committee on Social Security and was Minister for Repatriation. On leaving this place he was elected to the House of Assembly in Tasmania. His son Lance was elected in 1954 and served in many ministerial positions, including health, repatriation, primary industry, immigration, the interior, labour and national service, supply, Navy, Army and Defence, and went on to be Deputy Prime Minister from December 1972 until his retirement in June 1974. Lance was and is an extremely articulate gentleman and a wonderful person to model oneself upon. May I be half as good as he, and I will have achieved much. Today he continues to steadfastly work with our veterans with an immense knowledge and understanding of the problems they still face. I too will continue to make representation on their behalf. </PARA>

Quality assurance is another initiative aimed at promoting a more competitive industry. Rationalisation and amalgamation of our 300-plus trade unions into a more manageable structure of about 20 national unions will be a dramatic step but, in my estimate, an acknowledgment of a process of change towards unification and a stronger industrial base with which to expand and grow once again into a major world player. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also pleasing to note in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) reaffirmed the Government's intention to retain awards as a safety net, coupled with a new set of minimum standards under a collective bargaining system, rather than individual contracts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the growing public debate has shown, the notion that Australia should become a republic is attracting a growing number of interested people. I have noted that in the speeches this evening. Just recently I attended an RSL dinner in Launceston where a majority appeared committed to a purely Australian identity&mdash;much to my surprise. There seemed to be a little hesitation, however, about major changes to the flag. It is also interesting to note that in 1977, when a coalition government conducted a national poll to choose a purely Australian national song, a total of 5,113,296 people chose either <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Song of Australia </EMPHASIS>or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS>, as opposed to 1,182,689 for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS>.

Let us look objectively at our Prime Minister's vision of the unification of Federal and State industrial relations, of reconciliation with our Aboriginal people, of a better way of life for all Australians, no matter from which corner of the globe they came.

This initiative will allow governments and local communities to tackle key sources of pollution such as sewage plants and algal problems in the Murray-Darling basin in particular.

I would also like to thank my Federal and State parliamentary colleagues who assisted me with what was an exciting and a very tough campaign. The one person whom I must acknowledge and for whom I put my sincere appreciation on record is Mr Bruce Cowan, the former member for Lyne, who not only did a magnificent job as my campaign director, but also during his 13 years as the member for Lyne represented all his constituents in an exemplary manner. </PARA>

Mr Jim Eggins of the former Australian Country Party was the first member to represent Lyne from 1949 until his untimely death in 1952. Following this, in 1952 Mr Phillip E. Lucock of the National Country Party won the by-election and held the seat until his retirement in 1980, during which time he represented the Parliament at the United Nations and elsewhere, as well as serving in the high office of Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives for over 12 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Lyne is named after Sir William Lyne, a former premier of New South Wales and a founding member of this Parliament, who held the seat of Hume at its inception in 1901. In current debate on republicanism, I get a sense that history does repeat itself when it is discovered that Sir William Lyne played a central role in the debate leading up to Federation in 1901. In fact, I identify closely with the man when I see him described as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a home-loving man, he liked the races, and he was fond of a first class concert. He occasionally went to the theatre and when he read anything it was usually a magazine!</PARA>
<PARA>My electorate of Lyne is bounded by the electorates of Cowper and New England in the north, and Paterson in the west and south. Geographically the electorate of Lyne covers an area of 5,200 square kilometres from the Hastings River in the north to the twin towns of Forster-Tuncurry in the south, and inland to the western boundary of the Greater Taree City Council area, and includes the major centres of Port Macquarie, Taree, Forster-Tuncurry, Wingham, Wauchope, Laurieton, North Haven, Bonny Hills, Lake Cathie, Old Bar, Comboyne, Harrington, and Kendall.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are three major centres of population, and along with an impressive growth rate, Port Macquarie, Taree, and Forster-Tuncurry are burdened with higher than the national average rates of unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, during the recent campaign in the lead-up to the federal election in March we flagged at every opportunity the devastating impact that unemployment was having on our society and, in particular, the electorate of Lyne. I noted with interest the absence of any positive proposals in the Governor-General's address to tackle our chronic, long-term unemployment problem which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) has stated will rise to well over 400,000 in the next year. Nor was there any action plan to reduce our exploding foreign debt.The republican debate is not going to generate any jobs for my unemployed constituents. They are more interested in getting meaningful, long-term employment than in whether we have a governor-general or a president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the regional economy in Lyne has been centred around primary industries such as dairying, beef, fishing and oyster farming, as well as the harvesting of natural resources such as timber. Although these industries are still important to the regional economy, the development of the tourism industry and the dramatic increase in the retired population, as well as widespread rationalisation of these rural industries, has seen a shift in the economic base of the region. An interesting example of that rationalisation and its effect on local employment is in the dairying industry. In the last 10 years in New South Wales the dairy industry has seen the number of dairy farmers fall by 40 per cent with the number of producing cows falling by 15 per cent, yet the amount of milk produced increasing by approximately 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note here that my electorate of Lyne is changing dramatically. It was once considered a solely rural region, and although it still has a sound rural base it is now diversifying into a region with a strong industry and business component. My ambition for the electorate of Lyne is to see it become a strategic location for regional development. We already have a large cross-section of manufacturing industries of world standard which are earning export dollars for Australia within our region. They have recognised the potential of our stable labour market, the availability of ever improving infrastructure and our strategic location between the major cities of Sydney and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with a great deal of interest that I learnt of the regional development strategy developed by the Country Mayors Association of New South Wales which is being launched in Sydney on 21 May this year. Also of interest was the funding of that scheme which was partly funded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training under the OLMA program. Giving credit where credit is due, the Government should be commended for the introduction of the OLMA program. There is not only that program which the Country Mayors Association has put together, but in my electorate of Lyne another very successful enterprise has been developed through this program which is a cooperative of herb and flower growers who are developing an export market for fresh flowers and orchids in the USA. These are the niche markets we must encourage our people to explore and get into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the Government for creating the portfolio of regional development in the current Keating Ministry and I ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) when formulating strategies to consider not just the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales but also to give consideration to the Manning and Hastings valleys on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of our existing industries could employ more and would export more if a little understanding and consideration were shown by government. If we can spend millions of taxpayers' dollars on waterfront redundancies, why can we not give more consideration to government support for research and development programs, low interest start-up loans and short-term loans for expansion programs? We have a flourishing vineyard and winery at Port Macquarie leading the way with new technology, exporting 30 per cent of its production. Yet the famous Cassegrain family vineyards are pedalling their own canoe as far as research and development is concerned. Why should government not support export industries which are creating employment as they grow and develop larger niche markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I should like to mention a number of companies which have undertaken quality assurance programs in an attempt to improve the efficiency of their businesses and move towards world standard practices. Anvic Meat Exports Pty Ltd of Wingham, which exports the majority of its throughput to Japan, America and Korea, and Port Macquarie Slipways Pty Ltd, which is a major supplier to the Department of Defence, have expended thousands of dollars on these quality assurance programs but are yet to see the real benefits from these improvements. The question must be asked: when will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) undertake a complete review of AQIS and rationalise the meat inspection service in Australia? So far as Port Macquarie Slipways is concerned, why is quality assurance accreditation a pre-tender requirement for the Navy, yet the Australian Army will not recognise this accreditation? Surely the Government should be leading the way in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The town of Taree has special prominence in the Lyne electorate as a major manufacturing centre, with a variety of firms having decentralised to the area over the past 20 years. Whilst many companies such as Jockey Australia, Stebercraft, Britax Brylite and Lansdowne Engineering have successfully decentralised to my electorate, an active federal government program to encourage further regional development is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments for regional development and associated settlement expansion within my own electorate are compelling. Unemployment figures in my electorate are, on average, five per cent higher than the national average, signifying a very stable labour force. As well, transport and communications infrastructures are so advanced today that contact with all major centres can be maintained easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways to begin to address the imbalance and distortion in population and investment and to increase economic and employment opportunities throughout regional Australia. It needs to be recognised that the tasks need to be spread over the three tiers of government and through the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A plan for settlement and infrastructure needs to be developed. This plan needs to identify, prioritise and coordinate strategic State and Commonwealth infrastructure, particularly road, rail, air and education. The plan also needs to develop an achievable goal for decentralisation. For example, a starting point should be to try to achieve the diversion away from metropolitan centres of up to one million people over the next 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a regional industries incentive fund needs to take place. Such a fund could build up to $200 million per annum from Commonwealth, State and local government sources. These funds could be used to encourage relocation, expansion or start-ups of country industry with export potential or import substitution, particularly in areas of competitive advantage, for example, food, fibre and minerals processing. Previous mechanisms, such as payroll tax rebates and loan guarantees with sunset clauses and delivery through existing funds management network could also be used. Industry incentives in the country should partly replace housing subsidies in the city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of metropolitan industry that can benefit from a country location needs to take place. This would help to achieve grouping of industry in regional centres so that by encouraging one industry to decentralise a whole range of secondary industries will also decentralise. Within New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the Police Academy have decentralised and are two examples of successful relocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional expansion of education facilities must be encouraged.

The wider use of telecommunications products should be promoted as well as the active involvement of local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further federal funding for decentralisation assistance needs to occur. The Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales noted in a recent study on industry relocation that the distinct lack of interest shown by manufacturers in moving to non-metropolitan New South Wales is of significant concern to State and Commonwealth regional development objectives. Indeed, statistics show that only 1.3 per cent of firms were even considering moving to a non-metropolitan location in New South Wales under current economic policies. With government incentives regional development will benefit not only the industries concerned but also the regional economy and indeed the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention regional development today in my maiden speech as I feel it is an untapped resource within our great nation's economic regrowth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry that has thrived within my electorate without much government support is the tourism industry. It contributes in excess of $350 million to the region's economy and in particular the economy of Port Macquarie and Forster-Tuncurry. We must continue to focus on this important industry and provide the necessary reforms for it to continue growing and competing. It was pleasing to hear of the positive move on penalty rates in the tourism industry. These changes will allow more flexibility for employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Lyne has an abundance of tourist attractions including many famous beaches, seaside ports and historical and natural attractions. I am sure that most honourable members here this evening would have at some stage in their lives enjoyed holidays in the area that boasts Australia's best climate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After emphasising the importance of tourism to the region, I turn to the issue of roads, and in particular to the serious concern within my electorate over the state of the Pacific Highway. Our tourism industry is one which relies almost entirely on road transport into and out of the area. Likewise, our regional development program relies enormously on having an efficient and safe transport infrastructure based around road transport. Yet it concerns me greatly that I now have to follow the trend set by all previous members for Lyne when making their maiden speeches in this House by having to put on record my concerns about the poor quality of this major highway which is carrying an increasing volume of traffic all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this year the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority released a report on the north coast road structure which found that nearly 40 per cent of the north coast road network is in only a fair to poor condition; that is, 40 per cent of the region's roads are in an unsuitable condition for modern transport needs. The lives of ordinary Australians are being placed in jeopardy due to the lack of concern about the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the New England Highway has been designated as the national route between Sydney and Brisbane, the population expansion along the mid-north coast and the industrial decentralisation to this area is demanding that the coastal route along the Pacific Highway receive far more federal consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the current round of federal funding allocated to the Pacific Highway ceases during 1993. I should like to urge the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to consider seriously the Pacific Highway for further Commonwealth funding beyond 1993. This issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency and is one which I will continue to pursue until it is satisfactorily resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the honour of serving my local community as a member of the Greater Taree City Council for the past eight years, three of which I served as deputy mayor. During this period I became acutely aware of the desperate situation of our arterial roads and in particular the Pacific Highway. I have therefore developed a strong affinity with local government, and I believe it has a definite and important role to play in the structure of Australian politics. I believe that local government should be given constitutional recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of my membership of local government at the time the recent Federal election was called, I was put in a position of having to resign that position because of an ambiguity under section 44 of the Constitution; that is, the lack of a clear description as to who holds an office of profit under the Crown. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that being an alderman in local government would be better described as being an office of loss under the Crown, not one of profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this ambiguity, and so as not to jeopardise my candidature for the Federal election, I and seven other members of local government in New South Wales resigned our positions causing expensive by-elections which ratepayers everywhere cannot afford.

I know my fellow members share my concerns on this issue and I urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to clarify the ambiguous nature of section 44 of the Constitution, as I believe its current interpretation to be quite discriminatory. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Franklin has been predominantly a Liberal stronghold up until now. The Liberals have held Franklin for 70 of the 90 years since this seat was established. For the last seven elections, it has been in the grasp of the Liberal Party and represented by Bruce Goodluck. I would like to pay my tribute to Bruce who convinced the electors of Franklin that his personal brand of liberalism was far better than that promoted by the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Bruce Goodluck was the first member of the Opposition to abandon the `SS Fightback' and take to the lifeboat. Bruce's retirement, and the complete fiasco that was the Liberal preselection, was also very helpful to the Franklin campaign. The dedicated work of my campaign team, the wonderful trade union movement support, and a real commitment by all party members to the true believer spirit of the Labor Party&mdash;the members had been waiting for 18 years for a victory; almost as long as Melbourne supporters have been waiting for a premiership&mdash;has seen Franklin returned to its rightful place among the safe Labor seats in Australia. </PARA>

Thanks also must go to the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition, Michael Field, for his guidance and encouragement during the long campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me not to thank the state and federal office of the Labor Party for their wonderful support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I would like to place on record my special tribute to my past employer, Senator Michael Tate, who is here in the gallery tonight. For the past five years, Michael gave me the opportunity to put my Labor philosophy into practice working as his electorate officer. Michael Tate is a shining example to all politicians and aspiring politicians, and I thank him most sincerely for his wonderful support, guidance and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our decision to venture out to the areas of Bridgewater and Gagebrook and set up an electorate office to proclaim our Labor faith in the broadacre housing commission areas was the first time that this had been done in Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Empowering the people in this and many other areas like it in the Franklin electorate has seen the Labor Party re-establish its real bonds with the people who are the real source of Labor strength. To see them return to the Labor Party in such numbers amazed many of us on that wonderful night of 13 March 1993 and led to Franklin providing the first shining beacon for the rest of Australia to follow. Many honourable members saw me early on that night unable to come to terms with the massive swings back to the Labor Party in this electorate. Swings of 19 and 20 per cent in many of the booths resulted in the Labor Party, which needed a 2.1 per cent swing to achieve victory, ending up with a two-party preferred victory of 14.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of winning the seat of Franklin is now accomplished. There is now the opportunity for the first time in 10 years for the member for Franklin to be part of the Government decision-making process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long in Franklin we have had confrontation and discord, and this has resulted in the area suffering a real malaise, and consequent lack of direction and confidence and resultant high unemployment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the legacy of social experiments such as the ill-serviced broadacre housing commission areas have trapped many people in areas where certainly, in the past, there seemed little hope for the individual, family or other small social groups. Franklin deserves much better than this. Franklin has the potential to provide some of the stimulus for other areas of Australia to emulate. Its rapidly expanding export industries&mdash;apples and pears, small fruits, wines, cut flowers, value-added timber products, the seafood industry&mdash;and the expertise in training in many of these industries, are now providing much needed export dollars in the Asia-Pacific region as well as promoting the pristine clean Tasmanian environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessor, Bruce Goodluck, in his inaugural speech in 1976 highlighted the disastrous decline of the apple industry due to ever increasing costs of production, exorbitant freight rates and indifference and inaction from Canberra. A new level of cooperation between the Tasmanian apple industry and this Federal Labor Government, and a commitment to seeking out trade in the Asia-Pacific region, has recently secured an 800 per cent increase of apple exports into Taiwan. Here I would like to place on record my tribute to the work of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and Senator Peter Cook in achieving this great initiative. I am committed to ensuring the continuation of this rapid growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a vision for the seafood industry located in the waterways of my electorate. In addition to the successful growth in fish farming in that area, recent research indicates that only one per cent of the seafood resource in the Southern Ocean is being utilised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been one other member of the Quick family to grace this House, one more important than I can ever hope to emulate. I am very privileged to have a link with a more prominent member of the Quick family&mdash;Sir John Quick, lawyer, politician and author, who was also involved in the Commonwealth Constitution. John Quick was born near St Ives, Cornwall, in 1852 and arrived in Australia with his parents in 1854. John Quick, with a few others at the 1893 Corowa Conference, hammered out his famous resolution which set the guidelines for dealing with the Federation question. He was a delegate to the Australasian Federal Convention, which framed the Commonwealth Constitution, between 1897 and 1898. John Quick was knighted on 1 January 1901 for his outstanding contribution to Federation. He was elected unopposed as the first federal member for Bendigo, a seat he held until 1913. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John was certainly a man ahead of his time, and I am sure he would feel quite comfortable, were he alive today, in supporting the Prime Minister's views about the role of Australia as we near the end of the 20th century. It is interesting to note that in his first speech to the House on 29 May 1901, almost 92 years ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this Commonwealth will pose largely before the world by means of its representatives. I hope we shall not content ourselves with being represented by an ambassador in London, exercising ornamental as well as useful functions, but that we shall also have working agents for commercial purposes in every civilised country in the world&mdash;agents who will be on the watch for Australian interests, or the look-out for markets for our trade and commerce.</PARA>

In the growth of that civilisation and in the spread of commerce naturally and necessarily associated with it, I trust Australia will be well to the front.</PARA>
<PARA>The cultural diversity that is Australia is not as evident in my electorate, but honourable members can be sure that I am vitally interested in pursuing the benefits of a strong and vibrant multicultural society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several important issues that I will be concentrating on during the life of this Parliament. I was very pleased to note that the Governor-General, in his opening speech, made mention of several issues that are of concern to not only me but the electors of Franklin. While I am mentioning the Governor-General, I note that opposition members have criticised the length of the speech. This amazes me as our vision can be encapsulated in 25 pages. Imagine what might have happened if, God forbid, we had to listen to a precis of the 700-page Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue I wish to mention is that of Aboriginal reconciliation with the wider community. Tasmania has had, and still has, a very sorry story concerning Aboriginal relations. I do not need to remind honourable members of past history. However, under the Groom Liberal Government we see no attempt at meaningful dialogue with the Aboriginal community to redress past dispossession and current disadvantage. Rather, it is turning the clock back by closing the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and rejecting a parliamentary Bill on land rights. I look forward to participating in the Keating Government's moves on lasting reconciliation and the development of an effective partnership between the indigenous people and the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to touch on briefly is the issue of tourism. Tasmania has a huge tourism potential and it is vital to the growth of employment and infrastructure. It is pleasing to note that under previous Labor governments tourism has emerged as a major contributor to economic growth throughout the country and has been instrumental in the provision of a great number of jobs, particularly for young Australians. As a Tasmanian member, ever mindful of the sensitive environmental nature of much of my electorate, it is pleasing to note that the Keating Government plans to work with industry to minimise tourism impacts on the environment through such measures as the national eco-tourism strategy and programs for forests and sites of natural significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue that I mention, which is very important to me, is that associated with long-term unemployment. Franklin, unfortunately, has some of the nation's highest levels of unemployment, areas associated with broadacre public housing development. The young people there now have some hope as, following the issues raised at the youth employment and training summit in Canberra last year, this Government has announced a national employment and training plan for young Australians. It is essential that the measures in this plan do deliver to young people the vocational education and training and employment experience that they so desperately need. Along with these measures, the excellent jobskills program needs further expansion to provide that much needed confidence and experience for those people entering the workplace after a long absence. I would like to pay tribute to those involved in the skillshare programs in my electorate&mdash;Key Training Centre, Huon skillshare and the Bridgewater-Gagebrook skillshare. These centres have provided thousands of unemployed with the opportunity to acquire the skills and training needed either to enter further training programs or, in many instances, part- and full-time employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, at Question Time I asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the purchase of an outstanding piece of real estate on the Gold Coast by a leading figure of Japanese organised crime, namely, Masaru Takumi. The Prime Minister seemed a little startled and surprised by my question and said that he was unaware of the subject matter of my question. I was a little surprised and startled by that response because this matter was in fact the lead front-page story in the Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> last Saturday. There was also a full page feature article on it, and there have been further reports in the press today on the subject of Yakuza identities moving into Australia, particularly Queensland, either on holiday or for investment purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I asked the Prime Minister that question was that, essentially, three Ministers are involved in this matter. They are the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is the junior Minister to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). I asked how this man who is second in charge of the largest Yakuza organisation in Japan&mdash;an organisation which has more than 37,000 members and which has an income in excess of $8 billion a year&mdash;could apparently visit Australia at will. I further asked how he could purchase real estate of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to the report in last Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> by David Ross for most of the factual evidence&mdash;and it is straight, factual evidence. However, this is not the first time that the subject of the Yakuza's activities on the Gold Coast and the activities of leading members of the Yakuza, specifically the Yamaguchi-Gumi on the Gold Coast, has been raised publicly. Unfortunately, there seems to be an attitude that this is something that is either too hard for us or, `What does it matter? Let us hope it goes away'. I urge the Government and every member of this Parliament, regardless of political affiliation, to pay the closest possible urgent attention to what is happening with respect to movement into this country of organised crime, specifically Japanese organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps very instructive that, coincidentally, a book which purports to be a biography of J. Edgar Hoover is presently receiving much publicity. Only one week ago, a special documentary feature on the subject matter of the book was shown on Canberra television. I managed to see the second half of it after I had arrived in Canberra for the Parliament's sittings. Whether we accept the premise that J. Edgar Hoover was compromised by his sexual peccadillos into taking a public line on the Mafia, when advising the various Presidents of the United States and when responding to Senate and Congressional committees of inquiry, or whether we accept the premise that he was deliberating downplaying the activities of the Mafia in the United States because he was under pressure, maybe even blackmail, from the Mafia itself, the issue remains, indisputably, that as a result of the Federal Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States taking this line, the Mafia and organised crime got the most horrendous toehold in the United States of America at mind-boggling expense to that country in terms of damaged and destroyed lives and financial cost as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a small country and in a sense relatively vulnerable. In another sense we are in a relatively good position. We do not have the history of narcotic addiction in this country which has given organised crime and its drug pedlars the base that it has in the United States. We also, because we are small, are a relatively open society and one relatively easy to `police' in terms of security operations. But I have to reiterate that the activities of the Yakuza in Australia have been publicly documented in our newspapers for some time. Nevertheless, it appears that no action has been taken by authorities, either State or Federal, which would have led to at least a reduction of the most blatant activities that we could imagine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is, first and foremost, in the federal arena, but it overlaps into the State arena, particularly as it relates to matters pertaining to casinos. Without a doubt, organised crime is quite blatantly using Australian casinos to illegally launder huge sums of money. The casinos know, and they are not stopping it. For example, Jupiters Casino in Queensland, along with, I believe, all Australian casinos, is obliged under the law, to deny a person with a criminal background or history acess to the casino if it is aware that that person is gambling on the premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 8 March 1991, also by David Ross brought to public attention the allegation that Jupiters Casino was actually bringing individuals from Japan to Australia to gamble and that a number of these people were organised crime figures. Furthermore, the most recent newspaper reports state that Masaru Takumi, one of the most powerful leaders of organised crime in the world, has gambled in the High Rollers Room at Jupiters Casino. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the activities that take place on the floor of that casino, like those in other casinos in Australia, are observed by security people who are employed by the casinos commission to keep surveillance of the casino. They are not employees of the casino; they are people who have a responsibility to a commission which has a responsibility to government. All activities on the casino floor are on film. Yet, in the small, exclusive High Rollers Room in Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast, one of the world's leading crime figures can gamble with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises only one issue. There are a number of issues that I must cover. I come to a federal area. I refer to the question of how this man can get visas to visit this country  apparently at will. He has visited here many times, and there has never ever, to my knowledge or anyone else's knowledge, been any impediment to his visit nor any question raised as to how he entered this country. I wonder what is happening at our Tokyo post. One cannot really say that the staff probably do not know about this person. I refer again to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Takumi is the brains behind the organisation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the Yamaguchi-Gumi&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which has its headquarters in the port city of Kobe. Its headquarters is a palatial building next door to the Australian embassy's housing complex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Australian Government was offered $20 million for the property, but the deal was called off when it was discovered the Japanese woman seeking to buy it for a car importing company was a front for the Yamaguchi-Gumi.</PARA>
<PARA>The Yamaguchi-Gumi are next-door neighbours of Australian Embassy personnel and the Australian Embassy has had its nose rubbed in the fact. I really cannot believe that the staff did not know prior to that property transaction who their neighbours were, the world being what it is. Yet we read in an article published in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> that apparently members of this gang and of other Yakuza gangs, not just this particular individual, come here at will to have their holidays, they say. There is nothing illegal about coming here to have a holiday, even if the persons are involved in organised crime. But the fact is that they come here in groups, sometimes in large groups. I, for one, do not believe the only reason they are here is to take in the sun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions have to be asked: what is happening in our post in Tokyo which allows these people to get visas? Even if something is happening and they travel to another country prior to coming here, what is happening at our immigration desks in Australia which enables them to set foot in this country? What is wrong with our security information sources that we do not know, and have in our computers, basic information such as passport numbers and names?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, members of the Mafia have been refused visas to visit Australia because of their Mafia associations. Last year, Hells Angels members were not issued with visas to visit this country because they were members of that organisation. We have no information about Yakuza members ever being denied visas, but there is information that a number of them have been detected since entering the country. If they were found to have a criminal record&mdash;which means they lied in their applications for visas&mdash;they were deported. But there are others for whom no criminal record exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say here that, until recently, if people in Japan were convicted of criminal activities and served their term, the conviction was then expunged from the public record. Once they had `done their time' there was no further record of it. To talk about the criminal records of Japanese individuals can be misleading because there may be information beyond that which now appears on the public record. Persons who have come to this country without declaring their criminal records and who have subsequently been detected have been deported, but others cannot be deported on that basis. They could, however, be denied visas. I ask: what is happening in immigration that these people can come here in the way that they do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that I wish to raise is to ask what the Foreign Investment Review Board is up to. As I understand it, there are three bases on which a foreign national can purchase residential property in Australia, such as the property Mr Takumi&mdash;or Takumi, since I will not dignify him with the title of `Mr'&mdash;has purchased in my electorate. As the Prime Minister said earlier today in part answer to my question at Question Time, people can purchase units off the plan&mdash;in other words, new units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unit in question is one in a block of units on the Gold Coast which has been there for quite some years. My information is that this unit, a penthouse on the 28th floor, had been owned previously by one of our rather colourful and well-known Gold Coast entrepreneurs&mdash;as they tend to be referred to&mdash;one of the white shoe brigade, who is no longer of that brigade and who has been divested of certain property. This particular property has been bought by Takumi. There is no question of the property qualifying on the basis of being purchased off the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A residence may also be purchased by a company for the purpose of providing accommodation for a senior executive who is moving to Australia to take up a position with the company. I will come back to that provision later. The third ground on which approval can be sought is if the applicant has a resident's visa&mdash;that is, there is approval for migration to Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the matter of being a senior executive in a company, the facts show that the penthouse in question has been purchased by a $2 company called Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd. No-one is even being shy about the name of the person involved in the transaction. It is a $2 company, in which the shareholders are Takumi and his wife, and the board of directors is made up of three persons: Takumi, his daughter and a Queensland solicitor. I do not know the name of the solicitor at this stage but, for various reasons, I suspect that will become public knowledge in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that companies of this kind tell the Foreign Investment Review Board that they are going into the business of dealing in real estate. It is under that pretext that they buy real estate. In Takumi's case I am wondering what on earth the Foreign Investment Review Board is up to. Certainly members of the Federal Police are fully aware of Takumi, all his visits and his activities on the Gold Coast&mdash;at least, they claim they are. Why are the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Foreign Investment Review Board not informed by the AFP of its surveillance of Takumi's activities and of what is going on? I am also informed that the Federal Police know that the real estate purchase in question has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big question is: how can that happen? It is simply asked and one would hope that it will be investigated and properly answered. I would like to know, for example, what information the FIRB has about the shareholders of Takumi's company. What information does it have about the activities, the background and the financial backing of the company? I hate the thought, but is it a fact that Takumi Enterprises is going into business in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me inform the House of the sort of business that this crowd is into in Japan. On the latest count, organised crime in Japan owns 4,276 money lenders, 571 real estate companies, 1,331 coffee shops, 2,291 restaurants, 2,156 construction companies, 4,616 snack bars, and 2,159 strip joints, steam baths and nude studios. Since the introduction of anti-gang laws in Japan, organised crime has been corporatising, trying to dress up its activities in corporate gear. Since those laws were introduced&mdash;laws which were meant to wipe out organised crime in Japan&mdash;the syndicate to which I have referred went on to establish 75 corporations in Japan, ranging from real estate firms to an aerobics school and a children's clothing shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know&mdash;and the Prime Minister should provide the answers, as he said he would in Question Time today&mdash;whether this is the sort of activity that Takumi's enterprise is engaged in. Also, what sort of notice is the Foreign Investment Review Board taking of all this? I am reliably informed that this is not a unique activity, and that members of other organised crime gangs, such as the Triad and other Korean groups, do exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our foreign investment guidelines are an absolute joke. As far as I know, they are not properly investigated. It is alleged that there is a very large sum of money&mdash;an amount in excess of $1 million&mdash;below which the Foreign Investment Review Board takes only the most cursory glance at when it comes to this type of activity. If the amount involved can be kept under a million&mdash;or whatever the figure is; it is not precisely $1 million&mdash;then organised crime will know that we are here for the taking. And why not? The number of Japanese tourists coming to Australia, specifically to the Gold Coast, and the very large number of Japanese and Koreans settling as permanent residents on the Gold Coast and in Sydney, become the prime targets. Of course, the syndicates I have mentioned will go to those places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also informed that when organised crime members come to Australia to launder their huge sums of money at the casinos, they are not necessarily carrying large suitcases with a million dollars in them. I am told that the system these days is more likely to employ the use of money transfers&mdash;the telegraphic transfer of money. I want to know what sort of surveillance the Treasury and the AFP have of telegraphic transfers to casinos. Surely this must come under the purview of financial transactions reporting&mdash;I do not know; I do not have expert advice on that. But one would think that amounts of $10,000 or more would have to be reported. What monitoring or surveillance process does the Treasury have in connection with the AFP to discover the source of such money and what is happening with it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to know what the Queensland Government is doing about its own casino legislation. These allegations were made quite some time ago. By the way, the allegations that I refer to were in a confidential report to the then police Minister, Terry Mackenroth. As far as I know, that report has never hit the deck. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last Labor member for Lyons was sworn in on 6 November 1947 when this electorate was called Wilmot. That new member was the Reverend Gil Duthie who held the seat for 29 years. Gil Duthie served the Parliament and the Labor Party as Opposition Whip and Government Whip from 1972. Gil is now 82 years old, keeps very reasonable health and is still very active in his church. To many members here who may remember him, I can say that his great sense of humour is still with him. I would like to thank him for his support, his advice and his great inspiration. I am very happy to follow Gil Duthie in the Labor seat of Lyons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Lyons has changed over the years but is basically still made up of small isolated communities. The people of Lyons elected me as their representative because they saw a local, somebody who would always give consideration to ordinary people, who is always prepared to go in to bat for anybody on the bottom rung and for people who were often passed over by those in large cities, whether it be by politicians, bureaucrats or business folk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe they saw in me someone who would give them consideration and have some understanding of their problems and needs. I will endeavour to live up to their consideration. Small towns are now facing many changes, and I will be seeking to build on their importance as centres for their communities, both socially and economically. The electorate of Lyons is not an easy electorate of which to be the member. It is big, ranging from the north to the south of the State and from the west coast to the east coast. Lyons makes up 61 per cent of the land mass of Tasmania. It touches all the other electorates&mdash;Braddon, Bass, Franklin and Denison&mdash;three of which, together with Lyons, now contain Federal Labor representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industries in Lyons include forestry, mining, farming, fishing and tourism. They all make a great wealth generator for Tasmania and its people. In its early days of development, Tasmania was the food basket for Australia. It was one of the first to develop the wheat and sheep industries, and it supported much of the mainland for many of the convict years. It has always played a prominent role in the rural economy, and today the seat of Lyons proudly carries on that tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Tasmania's contribution to foreign trade for the 12 months ending June 1992 was valued at $1.5 billion in round terms. That is a considerable amount of money. The main categories in which the major proportion of this falls includes food and live animals to the value of $298 million; materials such as pulp and paper waste, crude fertilisers, processed ore and metal scrap and textile fibres to the value of $303.3 million; manufactured goods including leather, paper, paper board, pulp, textile yarn, iron and steel metals, $30 million; chemicals and related industries including organic and inorganic chemicals, dyeing and tanning, medicinal and essential oils and fertilisers, $476 million; specialist manufactured items such as furniture, travel goods, footwear, scientific instruments, et cetera, $98 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very high proportion of these products is either produced in Lyons or manufactured from materials produced in Lyons. So, although it is sparse in population and facilities, Lyons produces much of the raw material going into our exports and is vitally important to the State and the national economy, as it has been for the past 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much concern over the forest and mining industries in our State for some time, and some with good reason. Many of those concerns in the broader community of Tasmania are being overcome with improved forest practices and better mining practices and the national forest strategy, which I hope the Tasmanian Government will soon sign. In the long term, I would like to see another pulp mill that will assist the growth of export dollars for our trade figures. The action of some forestry companies, and the way they wish to restructure their operations, adds to the distrust of some Tasmanians towards some forest based industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are progressive companies, and I would like to name Australian Newsprint Mills. It has gone about a restructuring process that would equal any industry that has been restructured in Australia. Although it has reduced its work force considerably, the honesty of the capital and of the labour working in that mill has proved capable of working through the difficulties of restructuring so that the mill will continue to operate in a profitable way within Tasmania. I had the pleasure of taking the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) there during the election campaign to show him the operation first-hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of important issues facing the future of the electorate. The wool industry has fallen into a hole, and there are many reasons for that. The superfine that was grown in my electorate&mdash;I guess there is a lot less being grown now&mdash;used to set record world prices. I certainly hope that will be the case again. But there is no simple solution to the wool crisis. We have been locked into the world milling market for too long, and we have not developed the products of the woollen industry. We have just concentrated on a commodity at the farm gate&mdash;a raw product. We have to be thinking about the product that the consumer wants. For too long the cocktail circuits of New York, Paris and Tokyo may have been the major incentives for those trying to sell Australian wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having travelled to Scotland some years ago and looking over the Isle of Harris at some of the roughest sheep in the world and some of the strongest wool, I marvelled at why Australia does not have a Cressy tweed or Campbell Town worsted, as the world knows Harris tweed. Several of the caps that I wear are Donegal tweed from Ireland. Why have we not been able to match those world marketing names with our superfine wool? Why has the Australian woolmark not achieved the same success as Tasmanian salmon and King Island cheese? It leaves me a little bewildered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of fine foods in the electorate of Lyons provides a great opportunity for Tasmania&mdash;and I am a product of that fine food. We have a great environment in which to grow those fine foods. People are starting to recognise that Tasmania produces excellent foods. We are now learning how to better market them, package them and transport them. If we can continue to do that, we will gain a higher reputation than we presently have. That will add to our acceptability as a tourist destination and we should be able to increase our tourists to the island. The tourist industry does provide an opportunity for growth in Tasmania, and as some of our major industries wind down some growth can be found in the development of fine foods and foods in general to bring us those jobs and wealth dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of my interests is housing. I have been a member of Shelter, a community group whose major role is to assist community participation and input into housing policy in Australia. I am very impressed with the development process of the national housing strategy. I congratulate the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe) for at last putting housing on the national agenda as a major issue. It has never before been addressed in such a comprehensive way, and I look forward to seeing the many recommendations made being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lyons, like so many other areas, suffers from a lack of accessible, secure and affordable housing. I know that many people can benefit under the community housing program, particularly in the more rural parts of the electorate. I will be doing my best to help promote this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to touch on the great benefits I received through the learning process of the adult and community education that exists in our country. It gave me encouragement and assistance in a structure which allowed me to learn. Without that level of education in Australia, I would not be here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of that level of education is of great importance to many thousands of Australians. Like me, they may only get a chance later in life to improve their basic education, and I hope that some of the recommendations in the skills formation document through the community based adult education report, instigated by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) when he was the Minister for Education and Training, can be implemented by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to the present Treasurer for realising in the early days of award restructuring, when he was the Minister for Education and Training, that to restructure industry and retrain workers those workers needed to have literacy skills. In a modern Australian community, communication skills are needed to be world competitive. He was able to respond and make the policy decisions to meet the needs that emerged. These were addressed by the workplace better English basic education programs that exist throughout Australia today. There are also courses that exist through adult education, TAFE colleges and workskill, et cetera. They were all of great benefit to many thousands of Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I merely mention this part of my life not to hold myself up as some great achiever through the education processes but to give heart to others and to show that no stigma should be attached to people who do not gain an education through the formal years. We need to make sure that we always maintain an opportunity for people to return to education, to improve to a level which they would like to reach. I hope my speaking here in this chamber today will show that it is possible to achieve things in our great Australia, and reach this high pinnacle of the House of Representatives. The right of all Australians to understand how to vote, to participate and to represent an electorate makes us a great democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These education programs had great significance for me personally. When I left school I was nearly illiterate and needed to improve my basic education. Working in the meat industry and the shearing industry, I did not very often need to write.

<PARA>In the early 1970s, I was elected a full-time trade union official with the Meatworkers Union, and it was then that I realised I had to endeavour to do something to improve my written word and my ability to communicate my ideas, my arguments, and my feelings. In those days there was very little help for illiterate people or those trying to improve their basic education as an adult. I was very fortunate to find an opportunity, after several years of looking, and I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Roy Pugh&mdash;somebody who at that time was just beginning to understand the needs of people without literacy skills, like me. She has since gone on to play a significant role in developing policies to assist people with basic educational needs as adults. </PARA>

So my concerns about being able to put my argument and promote the issues of trade unionism, in which I believe strongly, were able to be overcome through learning.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will recall that in the last grievance debate of 1992, on Thursday 17 December, I challenged the suitability of Mr Barry Hogan to head the outposted fraud prevention unit of DEET in Victoria. On that occasion I pointed out that over recent years Mr Hogan's career has been dotted with the most disturbing incidents, and detailed these at some length. The Government to its discredit refused leave for me to table documents supporting the arguments I put to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the obstruction of the Government, the subsequent furore, including a report in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, brought about an internal investigation into the matters I had brought out into the open. I am able to report to the House that Mr Hogan no longer heads the fraud prevention unit and now works elsewhere in DEET. As I am given to understand, he is also likely to be included in a future redundancy arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate action upon these specific allegations is commendable, but ongoing concerns must and do remain about the administration of DEET. These concerns have been reflected in the considerable number of questions on notice I have asked over a long period about DEET activities, many of which were answered only just prior to the last Federal election. In particular, I wish to pursue the issue of the awarding of consultancies by DEET to former departmental officers. Before going to the finer points of this issue, I would draw to the attention of the House the guidelines on acceptance of business appointments on retirement or resignation issued by what was then the Commonwealth Public Service Board on 16 April 1987. Subsequently these guidelines were distributed on 25 May 1987 within the former Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, now DEET, to all deputy secretaries, division heads, State and Territory directors and other senior officers. The guidelines were later slightly amended and reissued in DEET, as a reminder to staff in June 1988 and again on 18 September 1992, as an official conduct statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 3 of the later guidelines casts the following clear cut warning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures seek to take account of possible sensitivities or improprieties such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the use of confidential information gained by virtue of a former public servant's official position;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the use of departmental contact or personal influence by a former staff member to secure preferential treatment for a new employer; or</PARA>

<PARA>Paragraph 10 of the guidelines further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed employment of staff in the following businesses or bodies requires careful consideration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">those in, or anticipating, contractual arrangements with the government.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, paragraph 16 says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the proposed post-separation employment should not be detrimental to the interests of the Commonwealth, or give the proposed new employer an unfair competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>That concludes the quotes from the official conduct statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose in mentioning certain of the guidelines at some length is that they have special relevance to the consultancy and training work undertaken for DEET by Moreland Group Training Technologies Pty Ltd and Groundwork Development Pty Ltd, which are located in Melbourne. It is significant that the manager of the Moreland group is Mr Tom Gibson, who is also associated with Groundwork Development. Immediately prior to working with Moreland, Mr Gibson was head of the programs division of DEET from 1 April 1987 until 6 July 1990, as indicated in the answer of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to my question on notice No. 1571 in the last Parliament. This same answer tells us that Mr Gibson also acted as State director of DEET in Victoria from 19 December 1988 to 24 February 1989, 26 June 1989 to 7 July 1989 and 30 November 1989 to 18 May 1990. Moreover, the answer confirms that, as head of the programs division, Mr Gibson was responsible for Aboriginal programs, Aboriginal training, industry training and Training Services Australia, TSA, in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of further interest in the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571 is the information that Mr Gibson played a key role in the promotion or transfer of key DEET officers in the training area. Mr Gibson was a member of the selection advisory committee which recommended the promotion of Mr Deny Martin to the position of assistant director, industry training, senior officer grade B. He chaired the committee which recommended the transfer of Mr Andrew Jackomos to the position of assistant director, Aboriginal programs branch, senior officer grade B; and, in consultation with the then State director, Victoria, he recommended the transfer of Mr Ray Levingston to the position of assistant director, training services Australia, senior officer grade B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Andrew Jackomos later transferred from DEET to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, on 1 July 1992 as part of the transfer of the community element of the training of Aboriginals program, TAP, to ATSIC. This fact comes from the response of the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to my question on notice No. 2003. This same response points out that Mr Jackomos was promoted to the position of State manager for ATSIC in Victoria on 7 December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full implications of Mr Gibson's influence in the bureaucratic advancement of these officers will become apparent as I now proceed to deal with the work awarded by DEET and ATSIC to the companies with which he is involved. Before embarking on this analysis, it is worth noting that working with Moreland in much of this work has been Mr Iain Polley, another former officer of DEET. According to the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571, the Moreland group and Groundwork Development were paid a total of $280,679.37, from March 1990 to when the Minister provided his answer to me on 23 December 1992, for some 20 training and consultancy packages. Payments for 15 of these packages are detailed in the DEET annual reports of 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 totalling $166,760. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably the discrepancy in total amounts arises from the fact that some payments were outside the periods covered by the three annual reports referred to, or there is some discrepancy between what was put in the annual reports and what the Minister was told by his department. The principal concern, however, is in the ballooning of payments from the time Mr Gibson joined the Moreland group after leaving DEET on 6 July 1990. In the 1989-90 annual report only $15,200 was reported as being paid to the Moreland group, yet this tripled to $45,840 in the 1990-91 report and had gone up sevenfold to $105,715 by the 1991-92 report. It is difficult to believe that the Moreland group had become so dramatically improved after Mr Gibson joined it from DEET, that DEET officers felt compelled to push such substantial extra work its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question becomes more intriguing when we look at that part of the Minister's answer to my question No. 1571, which states that none of the officers over whose promotion or transfer Mr Gibson had influence, exercised any delegation in respect of the payments made to the Moreland group. Such an answer does not fit with the departmental documentation over this period in relation to approvals for payment to the Moreland group for a number of the packages it provided through DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ray Levingston, who Mr Gibson recommended be transferred to the position of assistant director, Training Services Australia, and who later became director, TSA, approved payments to Moreland as follows: on 3 July 1990, payment of $2,998.65 being two-thirds of the proceeds of a workshop run from 12 to 14 June jointly by Moreland and TSA; on 27 August 1990, payment of $1,800 for a share of proceeds from a metropolitan fire brigade program held in mid-year; on 23 October 1990, $1,600 for trainer training programs run just prior to payment; on 8 November 1990, $4,125 for a training techniques program held from 29 October to 2 November; on 18 October 1991, $1,600 for a two-day course run on 12 to 13 September; on 8 November 1991, a further $4,500 for a training needs analysis; and, finally, on 6 April 1992, $1,650 for trainer training conducted during 5 to 14 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from approving payment to Moreland in these instances, Mr Levingston was, of course, instrumental in actively arranging for Moreland to provide certain of these and other packages for or through DEET. Furthermore, the dates of these payments clearly shown on departmental records make a nonsense of the Minister's claim in his answer to my question No. 1571 that it was not possible to provide dates of payment. Someone is taking someone for a ride somewhere!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract that really takes the cake, though, is the engagement of the Moreland group on 23 November 1989 through DEET on behalf of the Victorian Aboriginal Employment Development Policy Coordinating Committee, to undertake a study of the training needs of the Aboriginal field staff of the AEDP agencies. A minute signed by Lesley Hale, Deputy State Director of DEET on 26 May 1992, further says of this contract:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contract was approved by the Director of Programs, Mr Tom Gibson. The cost of the contract to the department was $2,500.</PARA>
<PARA>This is just over seven months prior to Mr Gibson quitting DEET for private training. Strangely, the amount of $2,500 for Moreland is shown in the DEET annual report for 1989-90, but for a different purpose. Moreover, who on 15 April 1992 is paid an amount of $4,350 and a further amount of $3,800 for consultancy work with the Aboriginal community arising out of the contract just referred to? Thanks to a departmental fax sent by Mr Andrew Jackomos on 10 June 1992 we know it was Mr Tom Gibson through his company, Groundwork Development. It really has to be said that Mr Gibson's record before and after leaving DEET has given a whole new meaning to the phrase `providing for your own future'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of special interest also must be the consultancy awarded to Moreland through DEET for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. There was no public tender for this major consultancy as the work involved was likely to be below the tender threshold of $30,000. However, the eventual payment to Moreland was $41,746.30, as indicated in the Minister's response to my question No. 1571, which is well over the tender threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The selection of Moreland was recommended in a minute signed by Mr Bill Bowron, Assistant Secretary, Aboriginal Community Development Branch, on 21 October 1991. Mr Bowron, it should be noted, was also the author of the June 1988 official conduct statement. Moreland was chosen from three so-called firms of consultants, the other two being Mr John Stewart, a Sydney management consultant, and Jada Business Services of Cleveland in Queensland. I understand that Mr Stewart is a former director of Training Services Australia in the New South Wales State office of DEET. Good old DEET again!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little is known about Jada Business Services. None of the mainstream training agencies were approached that could have provided stiff competition for Moreland. Mr Bowron found all three contenders acceptable on the basis of competence, experience and fees quoted. Nevertheless, he recommended Moreland for the task as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All three firms have the ability to pursue required outcomes, but first ranking would have to be given to the Moreland Group because of their previous involvement in drafting the department's submission to the royal commission in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>This frankly strikes me as a very loose basis upon which to recommend a major consultancy which turns out to be $12,000 over the public tender threshold. The Moreland group and Groundwork Development have as well done well out of work for ATSIC, with Mr Polley and Mr Gibson heavily involved in much of the work undertaken. As shown in the answer of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to my question on notice No. 2003, contracts for Moreland go back to October 1989. Most of the work given by ATSIC to both Moreland and Groundwork in terms of value and volume has, however, been in 1991 and 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the House that Mr Gibson left DEET for his private sector activities on 6 July 1990. Furthermore, I would remind members that Mr Gibson chaired the selection advisory committee that recommended the transfer of Mr Andrew Jackomos to the position of Assistant Director, Aboriginal Programs Branch in DEET. When the responsibilities of that branch went from DEET to ATSIC on 1 July 1992 it will be recalled from the answer to question No. 2003 that Mr Jackomos went to ATSIC too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this may well be a wonderful coincidence of events in the Aboriginal training area out of which Moreland and Groundwork have derived a significant benefit, or maybe they provide a service of especially high competence. On the matter of competence I would have to say&mdash;and I am able to speak as a former professional trainer in both the public and private sectors&mdash;that certain compelling questions arise out of at least one major project undertaken by Moreland. I refer to the Moreland group report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cultural diversity training in DEET</EMPHASIS> commenced as a consultancy for DEET on 1 November 1991, with a final report presented in February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the vagueness of many of the report's assertions and the absence of such a basic element as a bibliography, it makes among its 10 recommendations a distinctly peculiar one. Recommendation No. 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement training and assist in work with clients, we recommend the development of `a phrase book'&mdash;including Aboriginal languages&mdash;for use in initial communication with clients in a variety of languages.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not quarrel with the notion that DEET officers should be trained to be more sensitive to all groups in the community, but how many languages are they expected to have a working command of phrases in? The proposed phrase book also presupposes very poor knowledge of what constitutes survival linguistic skills. More to the point, why are DEET officers expected to know Aboriginal phrases when only 40,000 of Australia's 200,000 Aborigines speak traditional or indigenous Aboriginal languages? We are, after all, talking about the operational practicalities of the day to day running of a Federal department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The awarding of contracts of any form by Federal departments must at all times be and be seen to be totally above reproach, but even more so in respect of consultancies awarded by a department to its own former officers. Accordingly, I call upon the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to immediately investigate whether the relationship between the Commonwealth and the Moreland group and Groundwork is in any way in breach of the official conduct guidelines for the acceptance of business appointments on retirement or resignation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an inquiry, I would suggest, should closely examine four points: first, whether those officers who authorised payment on approved consultancies had the proper authority and delegation; second, whether they, their relatives or friends profited or gained a benefit by the grant of consultancies; third whether they, their relatives or friends worked with the Moreland group or Groundwork Development at any time; and, four, whether Mr Tom Gibson was made an offer of partnership or employment with the Moreland group and Groundwork Development because he could deliver consultancies, having promoted or transferred the appropriate people within DEET. In demanding an inquiry I point out that as a DEET officer, Mr Tom Gibson was handed the official conduct guidelines on 25 May 1987 and subsequently sighted and signed them. Finally, I seek leave to table the various documents I have referred to throughout my speech on these appropriations. </PARA>

That is not in any way to denigrate the speeches made by many of my colleagues here today. They were all excellent and they deserve to be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These appropriation and supply Bills comprise Additional Estimates for 1992-93.

We are talking about child care fee relief, defence housing, the employer component of superannuation and our extremely successful labour market programs. We are also talking about the continuation of good government. We feel good on this side of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate, local party members worked with great passion and skill to ensure that we retained government. On this first occasion that I have had to speak in a debate such as this, I want to take this opportunity to thank all my campaign team, particularly all the branch members in my electorate of Bowman, who worked so hard to make sure that I was returned as the member, and also to make sure that we were returned as a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be correct of me not to mention the fantastic contributions made by people such as Joan Budd, my campaign manager; her husband, John Budd, who is my FDE president, and the local member for Redlands; and my very good friend and colleague Jim Elder, Minister for Business, Industry and Regional Development in Queensland, along with the Deputy Premier, Tom Burns, and Darryl Briskey, the member for Cleveland, who are all excellent members. I am very proud to say that every State member in my electorate is from the Labor Party&mdash;part of the good guys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, to my mind there was an even more pleasing aspect of the election result and that was the re-election of the Labor Government, because it also celebrates the good judgment of the Australian people. The Australian people rejected the throwback that was Fightback. They rejected the Opposition's regressive, iniquitous, divisive, foreign inspired and econometric model driven grab bag of new right cure-alls. They rejected them in favour of Labor's fairer, more compassionate, more understanding and, most of all, more Australian policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Liberal and National parties have since dropped the centrepiece of their inequitable policies, the goods and services tax. At least in the case of the GST, the Opposition got the message that the Australian people sent it on 13 March. It has, however, hung onto a policy that was equally rejected by the electorate, and that is its entirely unpalatable industrial relations policy. It is the area of industrial relations that exemplifies how un-Australian the Opposition's policies are. Basically, it is an imported product from New Zealand, I guess with a bit of American seasoning. Australians did not want individual employment contracts imposed on them. Handing over total workplace power to the employer, thankfully, is still a largely alien concept in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As others here realise, in some parts of the Commonwealth ordinary working Australians are currently having their jobs played around with by unscrupulous employers and, unfortunately, in some cases even compliant State governments. In Victoria, the Kennett Government pushes on with its industrial chaos legislation. While the Australians in my own electorate are lucky enough to enjoy the industrial harmony that is encouraged by the Federal and State Labor governments, they are currently being threatened by an attempt to introduce, by stealth, individual work contracts for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perpetrator of this so-called scheme is a Mr Graeme Haycroft and his Troubleshooters Available organisation. Honourable members, especially those from Victoria and Queensland, will undoubtedly have heard of him. Controversy seems to have followed him across the country&mdash;from the building sites of Melbourne, via the shearing sheds of western Queensland, and onto his latest venture. Graeme Haycroft has of late been promoting what he calls the youth contract workers scheme. I will, however, call it as I see it, namely, a cheap labour scheme. It cannot be seen as anything less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Mr Haycroft's stated intention that the scheme is designed to bypass and undercut the award system&mdash;the award system that has particularly protected the vulnerable in the workplace. Fundamentally, this contract labour scheme offers young people no protection from unscrupulous employers. It now appears to be Mr Haycroft's intention to import this scheme into my local Redland shire. He has conned the local Chamber of Commerce into supporting him. I find this most disappointing, to say the least, and I ask it to reconsider that support. One thing for sure is that it will get no support from me on this matter. I am here to tell Mr Haycroft that he is just not wanted in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Australian electorate rejected the offer of lower wages and conditions, particularly the $3 per hour youth wage, the young people of my electorate will turn down this dubious offer of assistance by a dubious scheme. This youth contract workers scheme has been running on Queensland's Sunshine Coast for a few months. The young unemployed people of that area are, very intelligently, avoiding the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every member of this House is aware of the gravity of our youth unemployment problem. I am not down on the enthusiastic young people who want to work. The significant difference between myself and Haycroft is that I support, and I believe the general Australian community supports, the programs that the Government already has in place to assist the young unemployed. That is why a significant part of these Bills before the House is pumping more well-targeted money into these extremely effective programs. Before he gets too keen on proposing the setting up of his scheme in the Redlands, Mr Haycroft should have a look around at what training is already available for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government has substantial schemes that take a productive approach to helping young people find meaningful employment. There are subsidised apprenticeships, traineeships, and currently teenagers who have been unemployed for six months have access to accredited vocational training. These teenagers also get their jobstart card which alerts their potential employers that there is a wage subsidy available to help them with the cost of employing the teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of assistance very evidently available for the unemployed in my electorate. They, like other unemployed people in my area, are very professionally and compassionately assisted in the quest for work by the staff of the local Cleveland and Wynnum Commonwealth Employment Service offices, which do an excellent job in placing people. These CES offices place hundreds of young people in employment. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and honourable members present to compare that record with that of Mr Haycroft's contract scheme. From my information, only a small number have got work on the Sunshine Coast&mdash;that is, work at $4.15 per hour with no safety net or conditions and training of dubious quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government already supports the local skillshare organisations. Training venues such as this are the way our local young people improve their ability to enter the work force and stay in an interesting job for the long term. Rest assured, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not rest until Graeme Haycroft realises that people are not interested in his fly-by-night contract labour schemes. They are nothing but a cruel hoax and offer young people only false hope and slave wages&mdash;and of course give them also a false hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's caring outlook is not directed only at young Australians. There is a lot of talk about this country's ageing population, and it is Labor's policies that help these older Australians to live in comfort and with some dignity. In my role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, I take great pride in the assistance we in Australia afford our age pensioners. The extension of fringe benefits, funded through these Bills, is only one good example. I mention at this stage that some concern is being whipped up in the pensioner community mainly by financial planners who obviously see one area of their business affected, namely, the treatment of shares for income purposes as and from September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I notice that at the end of last year although the Opposition in the Senate voted for this measure, which is now law&mdash;and it does not matter how much the Opposition says it did not; it did&mdash;obviously for the purposes of trying to gain some political points, the Opposition in the Senate is now combining with the Australian Democrats to bring in a private member's Bill. The Opposition is also saying that the Government's treatment of shares is wrong and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the social security system is basically a needs based system which is there to help those people who need it. The savings, which could be as high as $80 million for an initial setting up cost of some $350,000, have allowed the Government as and from 1 April 1993 to extend the fringe benefits to everyone who has a part or full pension. I know from talking to the many thousands of age pensioners and pensioners generally throughout the country that they place a very high value on those fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some three per cent of pensioners have money to invest in shares, in many cases simply to circumvent the income tax test. If it means that they have to be brought back to the same situation as other managed investments in order to find the appropriate funds in these tough economic times to extend fringe benefits to everybody, that is not a high price to pay. I look forward to the debate coming to this House so that we can talk about this matter at greater length. I can assure the Opposition that this is something which the Government supports very strongly. The Opposition supported it. I cannot see why those opposite should suddenly change their minds, but that is something we will examine later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dignity is terribly important for older Australians. Older Australians do not want to have to rely on others all the time&mdash;they want to do some things for themselves and at their own pace. In this situation, what can seem a very trivial matter may make the everyday experiences painful and frustrating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very community minded resident in my electorate, Mr Dennis Neville, who also happens to be a senior journalist at the local newspapers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Redland Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bayside Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, brought to my attention recently the frustration that many older people experience just trying to open everyday household products. People, whose hands may not be as strong and dexterous as they used to be, find it very difficult opening certain items that they buy from the supermarket. Difficulty with packaging is a widespread problem. Some of the items that are commonly complained about include bottles of food products, cereal packets, most items packed in plastic, and cleaning items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household chemicals pose a particular problem. Many of these items have childproof lids which can require a great deal of dexterity and strength. This issue becomes particularly alarming when one hears that some very frustrated older people enlist the aid of sharp knives making the opening of simple, everyday products a dangerous exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be raising this issue with the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Mrs McHugh) to see whether we can alert manufacturers to the problems being experienced. I am certain that once manufacturers become aware of the extent of the problem they would consider an investigation into their respective packaging policies. If we here, and those in industry, can do something to alleviate the problems that older Australians experience, we as a nation are only living up to the standard that has already been set by this Government&mdash;a standard of caring and compassion for senior citizens of this country. </PARA>

The new House is impressive&mdash;cleverly designed and incorporating many unique features. The 22 kilometres of corridors, however, are enough to render the gymnasium redundant. Sadly, the colours throughout the building, particularly in the two chambers, seem faded. Their pale, insipid and washed-out appearance is a parody of the rich and vivid green and red tonings of the former House of Representatives and Senate chambers. One can only hope that when refurbishment is required this mistake will be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow the building lacks much symbolism and what little there is is obscure and must be elaborately explained to be fully understood.

I have held positions at the State executive level in both the Liberal Party and the National Party and thus have a close understanding of both parties. The most notable characteristic deserving comment is the overwhelming similarity between the rank and file membership. Both comprise dedicated supporters of free enterprise. Branch meetings are almost identical, attended by usually small groups of highly motivated people, and they discuss the same areas of mutual concern.

My colleague the National candidate also flagged merger prospects following the election result in Fisher. I must say that I agree with him. Like others in the community, I was disappointed that at this stage the National Party has refused to even discuss amalgamation. A successful merger could well be the only way to federal government and, after five successive losses, it must be considered. Like Australia, as Liberals and Nationals we cannot go on the way we are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I pursue my point of order. This Bill, on which we are now embarking on the second reading debate, has previously had only one speaker. That was the Minister for Finance, who introduced the Bill. As I understand it, the advice that was given to you previously and the ruling you gave was that because the member&mdash;in this case the honourable member for Higgins, who actually moved that the debate be adjourned after the second reading speech of the Minister&mdash;was not here the Opposition forfeited its right of first call for the first speaker after the second reading speech of the Minister. That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is an unprecedented ruling. It is the practice of this Parliament that whichever shadow Minister of the Opposition is on duty here at the table when the second reading is finished will move the motion for the debate to be adjourned. It is just a form; it is just a procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen many occasions on guillotines where opposition members have sought the call in the way that the honourable member for Fisher has. Of course, they always get the call because that opposition member seeking the call is the first one to speak on that Bill. Under a convention, we have had a cognate debate on a number of Bills, but in fact we have been debating only one Bill. You will see that the amendment that we have debated cognately appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in relation only to Appropriation Bill (No. 5); that is, order of the day No. 2. We are for the first time embarking on a continuation of the second reading of this debate. An opposition member has the call because he is following the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Mabo decision does nothing to improve relations between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. The judgment of the High Court of Australia has discouraged investment in a whole range of areas&mdash;in the pastoral industry and in mining and tourism&mdash;and concern is continuing to mount. The impact on our economy will be devastating. While some say that the Mabo decision was a narrow one, based on its particular facts, and that the only land caught in the net will be certain isolated parts of the nation, this has not been proven. Even if that view is currently correct, uncertainty remains for the court may, at any time, expand the extent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander title. Indeed, much of Australia could ultimately be trapped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most agree that the full ramifications of Mabo are unclear. The Government itself has promised to fund, at our expense, a number of cases to test its limits. Negotiation has been suggested, but this will not resolve the legal mire. The last thing Australia needs is the year in, year out debilitating effect of protracted litigation. We would never really know the final extent of Mabo because the next case would be just around the corner. Racial harmony, jobs, including Aboriginal jobs, investment and economic recovery would all be casualties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been calls for legislation to bring certainty back into the land law. Industry groups, prospective overseas investors, both sides of politics, the Queensland Labor Premier and Aboriginal people themselves have all canvassed this possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most clear, decisive and desirable action would be complementary State and Federal legislation to reverse Mabo. Alternatively, the Federal Parliament could amend its own laws, where they have contributed to the ability of the court to find in favour of Mabo. This would not be an approach inconsistent with the concept of land rights, as the States could then deal with this issue in accordance with their own laws and values. While the Parliament would have then seized the initiative to break the deadlock, boosting stability, investment and jobs, we, as members of Parliament, are at least accountable at every election to the community for our actions. Unfortunately, the unelected politicians of the High Court are accountable to no-one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minutes remaining to me&mdash;not very many minutes&mdash;I will refer briefly to one or two other matters. I think it is wrong that we have compulsory voting in this nation. I think if we believe in democracy we should give people the right to vote or not to vote. I also would like to place on record my very strong support for our Australian flag. I think our Australian flag is a symbol of our nation of which we are all justly proud.
