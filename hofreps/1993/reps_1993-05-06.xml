<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud to sit in this House as a representative of the Australian Labor Party. I have had a long and enjoyable participation in politics in three States&mdash;Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales&mdash;over a period of 19 years, through the Labor Party, Young Labor, and the trade union movement. I worked for a former Deputy Prime Minister, Frank Crean, whose son, Simon, is a member of the Cabinet of the current Government. I also worked for a current member of this House, the Hon. Ben Humphreys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along my journey to this House, I worked with fine examples of major Australian corporations. I was with ACI&mdash;Australian Consolidated Industries&mdash;for four years, and Ansett Transport Industries for five years. Naturally, I have a keen interest in the manufacturing and tourism industries in this country. Australia's tourist potential is something that I believe is paramount to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from a family who originally came from the land, and as a child I spent considerable time in the farming communities of north-eastern Victoria. So I also have an interest in the plight of farmers and rural communities. My family members are mostly all involved in small business, and for the last three years I have conducted my own business. I have also been involved in a number of community groups which have influenced me. I am the national secretary of UNICEF Australia, I am on the advisory board of the Volunteer Centre of New South Wales, and I am a member of the Communication Commission for the Sydney Olympic bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My political and personal travels reached a new stage with marriage, home ownership and parenthood, which found me in the Sydney suburbs of Drummoyne, Ashfield, and latterly Strathfield&mdash;all in the electorate of Lowe. At that time, Lowe was ably represented by an excellent local member, Mr Michael Maher MP, a true gentleman, a great Australian and a very dear friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people go into politics because they believe they have something to contribute to the life of the community. We believe that we have values that are worth fighting for, and those values and objectives reflect our background and our experience of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to be cynical about politics and cynicism is often understandable, but these things come in cycles. Despite the claims about the endemic cynicism among the young about public life, my experience is quite different. Just after my election, I was invited to address a gathering at the Sydney University Labor Club. There was, to my surprise, a very large and enthusiastic crowd of well over 200 people&mdash;idealistic and full of eagerness on issues such as the coming of the Australian republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change of mood is also associated with a generational change of leadership: a new group of people with a new set of ideas, experiences and aspirations. One of the great achievements of Labor, both in government and as a party, is the way it has been able to make this generational change without having it forced upon us after electoral defeat and consignment to the political wilderness. My political views have been shaped by my family, my faith and my participation in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in the thoughts of the prophet Micah that one should act justly, love tenderly and walk humbly with one's God. I joined the Labor Party in the seat of Henty in Victoria in 1974 and had the pleasure to work on the campaign of Mrs Joan Child, who was also a Speaker of this House. She was certainly an excellent role model as a female member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also Senator Robert Ray was in my local branch and he taught me a lot about the political culture of the Labor Party and also how to count. I was elected president of Victorian Young Labor at the age of 20 in 1976&mdash;a time of great turmoil&mdash;and it was the best training ground that I could ever have had. My colleagues there were amongst the brightest and the best and I hope that many of them make their way into this House during their lifetime. I recommend to all young people, irrespective of their political persuasion, that they get involved in the political youth groups: that is the best training ground for future politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major reasons I believe that the Government was re-elected was that the electorate believes that the Labor Party is more responsive to people's needs, not just economic ones. But the process of economic reform is critical to the future of all Australians. There are many small businesses in Lowe and it is these hardworking entrepreneurs who are providing the basis of our economic growth. Nearly all growth in employment is in the small business sector and this will continue. We have come a long way since the archaic practices that were seen in that marvellous Australian film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Spotswood</EMPHASIS>, but Australia must take management and workplace reform further. Small businesses, with innovative and hardworking principals and employees, are taking on and beating the giants of the last decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my abiding concerns will be to see that this process of stability in government policy towards business continues. Friends in business tell me that Ministers for industry have maintained a constant policy approach and this has enabled business to plan ahead and to rely upon government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where government can and will continue to play an important role is in supporting research and training. We have already seen over recent years that those companies, big and small, who address internal operations and skill levels, and who achieve standards which are world best practice, prosper greatly. It is up to this Government to help provide training facilities so that business can increase skills and adapt, to make sure that we are the match of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a more comfortable orientation towards our Asian neighbours and the opportunities afforded us by the rapid economic growth of our region, we will be able to build a better Australia. To build this better Australia, we must free business from unnecessary intervention and regulation. Small business is what makes our economy thrive. We must create a uniform national standard of fair and appropriate regulation across the country to help facilitate an export orientated focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a very successful program of micro-economic reform under this Government. It is a program which must continue. The current emphasis on enterprise and productivity based workplace agreements is correct. We must empower workers to negotiate for fair working conditions, grant industry and business the flexibility to operate in the most productive way possible, guarantee existing jobs and create more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to a trend in business towards small and innovative flexible business units which have the capacity to take on the market giants by identifying and exploring a niche. The industry above all others which fits this description is the tourism industry. The Australian tourism industry is our biggest export earner. In 1991-92 Australia earned $8.2 billion, 11 per cent of total export earnings, from tourism. We need to take tourism seriously as an industry and foster its great potential for further growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been involved in the tourism industry through my work with Ansett Airlines and I believe that every member of this House has a tourism aspect to his or her electorate. Tourism is very much a bipartisan issue in this Parliament. This is an excellent development and one that I would always encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must also be applauded for its success in bringing down inflation. The temptation to escape from economic difficulty by taking the easy path of inflation has been rejected. With confidence in government policy, and steadiness in economic outlook, business is confident to invest. Business investment is the most important factor in our economic growth and leads to the creation of jobs to relieve the burden of unemployment. We must see a return to national savings and to capital investment in Australia by Australian business. Banks and superannuation funds can do more to encourage productive investment to create more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 20 years there have been important changes in the role of women in society. Women in this generation have more opportunities and choices than ever before. However, for many the stresses of combining work and family responsibilities are enormous. For me, one of the highlights of this year's election campaign was the Prime Minister's launch of the national agenda for women, appropriately entitled `Women&mdash;sharing and shaping the future'. I doubt that any political leader in our history has so ably focused on the social and economic needs of women in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the campaign the Prime Minister announced, as part of his economic policy, a major improvement in government assistance on child care. Not only will the policy greatly assist many Australian families but the psychological importance of including child care as a feature of a major economic policy statement cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our society often judges people by how much they earn and so many women who are at home rearing children in the unpaid part of the work force feel that society does not hold them in high esteem. It is very hard and very valuable work that they do and it should not be in any way underestimated. Therefore the home child-care allowance which is being forecast by our Government is a very important symbolic acknowledgment of the value of the work that is done by carers at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also important is the need for more occasional child care facilities to assist mothers who are at home and who occasionally need to go to the dentist, go shopping or have whatever relaxation period that certainly is due to them. Also important is after school care. I have three places in my electorate which have been waiting for three years for any funding because the New South Wales Government refused to co-fund after school care. I am pleased to say that the Federal Government has released funds and I am hoping to be applying for funds to assist those people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this campaign has seen the emergence of women and our perspective and values on issues, including economic issues, as a permanent feature of Australian political life. Certainly I got the feeling in my electorate of Lowe that many people, male and female, were positive about the prospect of being represented by a women. Nonetheless, most people would recognise that we have a long way to go in adjusting our economic and social institutions to accommodate the changed role of women. I might say that many men are assuming far greater parental responsibilities than they did before. Our workplaces in particular need to be more flexible, especially with regard to working hours and more aware of the needs of workers with family responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is here that I would like to address the need for child care in Parliament. It seems to me that there has been much talk and speculation in the press about the need to have more women in this House, but we all know the hours that are worked here and we all know the difficulties that are involved in leaving the premises. Lack of child-care facilities on this site for women of child bearing age is a real disincentive to enter this House. </PARA>

I am not suggesting something elitist in this, because it should be open to all employees&mdash;they also work strange hours in this House&mdash;and it should be on a user-pays basis. Certainly for children from zero to five years of age it seems to be important, and particularly if a mother is to breastfeed her child there are problems in having it at another site, although I know that this has been done here in the past. I applaud those members for making some endeavours in that regard, but I believe that a child-care facility needs to be on site in this House if one is to properly attend to those duties as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare has now been operating for 10 years under a Labor government, and most people would accept that in a community they would like access to high quality, affordable care. Medicare is crucially important to families, to the elderly and to those living on fixed incomes. Women are at the coalface when it comes to the delivery of our health care and they are usually the ones who take the children to the doctor. Certainly in the electorate of Lowe they made a very clear statement that they did not want to see the abolition of bulk-billing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would be aware, I ran against the shadow Minister for health and I believe that Medicare was the issue in the electorate of Lowe that affected the women voters even more than their opposition to the GST. Certainly the argument that I used for people was that when I needed to take my daughter Louise to the hospital at 2 o'clock in the morning with an asthma attack I wanted to know that the hospital was worried about her and her condition and not about what sort of insurance I had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My election slogan for the campaign in the seat of Lowe was `care and commitment'. This neatly summarises my approach to politics. Government has a responsibility to people. It is not good enough to leave everything to the market and to say to individuals, `You are on your own', and believe that things will work out for the best in the long run, because very often they do not. The campaign for the seat of Lowe was successful because of the contributions made by many people who did a lot of work because they believe in Australia, they want to play a role in the democratic process and to make a contribution to improving our national life. They were party members and the campaign workers of Lowe and I thank them sincerely. </PARA>

One of the things that I learnt from these four marvellous people was the contribution that has been made to Australia by migrants since 1945. The electorate of Lowe is a microcosm of multicultural Australia, because 50 per cent of the people who live there, or their parents, have come from other lands. In my campaign I was invaluably assisted by the help and enthusiasm of the Italian, Greek, Lebanese, Chinese and Vietnamese communities. All of these people put their faith and trust in me and I would like to thank them, because I suspect I would not be here today without their support. </PARA>

On election night, I thanked them very much for their support and this was written up in one of the local papers, which then found that people were coming in and asking for multiple copies. When one of the journalists asked why they wanted the copies, the reply was, `Because this is the first time an Australian politician has publicly thanked us for our work as an ethnic group.

I want to thank my husband, Michael, to whom after eight years of marriage I can say I am still madly in love with him.

Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth&mdash;`that man would never have attained the possible unless, time and again, he had reached out for the impossible'. But to do that, a man must be a leader a hero as well, in a very sober sense of the meaning of that word. And even those who are neither leaders nor heroes must arm themselves with that steadfastness of heart which can brave even the crumbling of all hopes. This is necessary right now, or else men will not be able to attain even that which is possible today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Office workers are the forgotten people of the Australian community. Too often, when policy is developed with respect to matters like industrial relations or training, focus is based unduly on the interests of particular groups of workers in particular industries, and many groups of workers, large in number but often weaker in voice or weaker in industrial strength, such as office workers, are neglected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to think of the typical Australian worker as a male with a hairy chest, a blue singlet and a hard hat, but the typical Australian worker today is just as much a female with high heels and a handbag. What I am committed to in debates and issues that are relevant to this dichotomy in this House is to make sure that we keep a true balance, because in this era of enterprise bargaining it is all too easy to lose the interests of many in the work force. What is appropriate and worthwhile for large numbers of metal workers in an individual factory may not necessarily be an appropriate approach for three typists working in a small real estate agent's office, and I am committed to making sure that government policy in these sorts of areas has balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the people of my electorate, the electorate of Melbourne, for bestowing their confidence in me, and also to thank those who have worked for me to get here. It is indeed a privilege to represent the electorate, which is rich in diversity, steeped in labour history and overflowing with ideas, energy and talent. It is also the site of many problems, many issues and many injustices, and I am conscious of the fact that I will be judged in my role as the member for Melbourne in this House according to how I represent the interests of the local community. My predecessor, Mr Gerry Hand, to whom I pay tribute, has set an extremely high standard in this regard and I am very conscious of the fact that I will have to maintain that standard, and I am committed very strongly to doing so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a socialist. I am committed to the values of humanity, tolerance and democracy. In an era when the repressive regimes of eastern Europe have thankfully crumbled, and when socialist certainties are under challenge, I regard it as very much a daunting task to reinvigorate the socialist ideal in this country and across the world. However, there is a great deal within our country that can inspire us. There is a great deal that is worth while about our country, in spite of our many problems&mdash;economic and other. I refer to things such as our entrenched democratic tradition; our still defiantly egalitarian spirit; our multicultural society and our extraordinary ability to absorb people of many different races and nationalities without serious violence; our commitment to individual freedom and our entrenched resistance and dislike of authoritarianism, pomp&mdash;although recent events might tend to suggest that I am not all that accurate in that comment&mdash;and fanaticism. We would do well to recall these very worthwhile achievements of our society when we are next wringing our hands about the latest set of economic statistics, because these are the true, great features of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to focus on several themes, which I intend to make prominent in my contribution in this place and which, hopefully, will occur over a substantial period of time. These themes are, firstly, the need for greater employment and initiatives in industry policy to ensure that we have a more competitive and more vibrant manufacturing sector to deliver that employment; secondly, the need to develop environmentally sensitive economic decision-making processes, both within companies and also at a government decision-making level; and, thirdly, the need to reform our structure of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is the search for solutions to our unemployment problem, which, I believe, is going to lead us into many new areas&mdash;in particular, structural unemployment. For example, there is a need to redefine the concept of work&mdash;but that is a matter for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to focus, here and now, on our industry policy. Although we are taking down our tariff wall, in my view, we are still relatively unsophisticated in how we deal with industry assistance in this country. Our assistance to industry is still too indiscriminate. It is not targeted and it is insufficiently proactive. We have learnt that picking winners can be fairly dangerous, but we still give a bit of money to losers and sometimes we give it to people who are not even in the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that there is plenty of experience, here and overseas, to put us on the right track. We have only to look at our assistance to rural industries over many decades&mdash;through bodies such as the CSIRO, through agricultural extension services and the like&mdash;to see how effectively interventionist industry policy can work to the benefit of the community. That assistance has been cost-effective. It has been a relatively low burden on the taxpayer. It has helped to make our rural industries amongst the most efficient in the world. It has been proactive and financially sound and, when an individual farm goes down the drain, a lot of government money does not go down the drain with it. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some industry assistance that has occurred in the past in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis of countries that have been recently successful in export manufacturing reveals not only the importance of government assistance but also the importance of the nature of the government assistance. In my view, what is critical is that strategic government assistance occurs directly in areas such as research and development, market development forecasting and planning and the development of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of examples illustrate this point. The Japanese Government pays half the cost of about 185 testing and research centres across the country. Small companies go to these centres, use the equipment and get specialist consultation with specialised staff in a national network of technology extension services. The thriving Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, which is a manufacturing centre of quite extraordinary vibrancy, has similar centres which are partly government funded. They engage in forecasting, research and development, and provide access to new technology for smaller firms that otherwise would be unable to obtain it. Even in the United States, with bodies such as the Michigan Modernisation Service and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies, the same type of thing is occurring. This sort of approach in general is supported by people such as Professor Michael Porter in his tremendous book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Competitive Advantage of Nations</EMPHASIS>, and in the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Global challenge: Australian manufacturing in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, the Australian Manufacturing Council report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that this type of approach to industry policy has many advantages. It is more cost effective than indiscriminate assistance such as tax breaks. It guarantees that jobs are created in key areas such as science and technology. It ensures that large sums are not lost when an individual business fails. It allows the government to influence, but not to direct, business policy and approach. It provides enormous potential for regional development through clustering of businesses in strategic locations. It is not indefinite: some of the overseas centres that I have referred to have in fact already left the government funded area and are self-funding. It offers a method for better articulation between our research institutions and business. It offers small and medium sized businesses access to economies of scale. It is a little more subtle than tariff walls&mdash;an issue that I think we need to keep in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of size and scale is critical because, since 1970 in Western economies, the long-term trend for the relative size of economic activity to increase has turned around, and more and more activity is occurring within smaller and smaller business units. Flexible production technologies are reducing the tyrannies of economies of scale. Specialised functions are being contracted out to specialised firms. In the words of Robert Howard, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harvard Business Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased demand for more specialised products, nonstop technological innovation and cheaper and more flexible computer-based technologies are inaugurating a decentralisation of production.</PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely this type of company that has led the re-invigoration of Australian manufacturing that is occurring already in the export area. We need to do a great deal more than simply provide level playing fields, tax breaks or tariff walls for these companies. Some examples of the sort of approach occurring now are the cooperative research centres and the National Industry Extension Service, but I would like to see a fair bit more being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just make a quick comment in this context about economic policy generally, because this approach sits very effectively with recent developments in economic theories that are called either `endogenous growth theories' or `new growth theories'. Economists such as Paul Romer have demonstrated the serious inadequacies of the neo-classical model. These new models show that the market solution is not necessarily the optimal solution; that government intervention can increase the real rate of growth; and that investment in innovation and human capital is critical for generating growth. Although these theories are still being tested empirically and still being developed as models, they do confirm our commonsense, instinctive view that the neo-classical model is based on false assumptions, ignores fundamental variables, and is not well supported by empirical evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the second theme that I intend to pursue in a long-term sense in this place&mdash;on the proviso that the people of the electorate of Melbourne give me that long term, which I sincerely hope they do. These theories also relate to the inadequacies of the neo-classical model, and to the greening of economic decision making. In spite of great progress, we still have entrenched conflict between human economic activity and the need to protect our natural environment. The key reason is that we operate by antiquated models of economic decision making, at both the national and the corporate level. The measure of environmental damage is not incorporated into these structures. The adverse effects of economic activity upon our environment are deemed to be externalities: they do not count. `It is not privately owned; it is not tradeable; therefore it is not relevant'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am thankful to say that business is at last getting serious about these issues, even in parts of the mining industry. The old adversarial approach of saying, `How do we beat the greenies?', is giving way in many areas to the much more constructive approach of saying, `How do we solve the problems?'. However, the approach which business is taking is still relatively narrow and it is still weighed down by the idea that growth is the answer to everything. That devalues the nature of the problem. It suggests that solving the problem is only a luxury that we can undertake if and when we get the money to do so. It also ignores the fact that if we have growth without solving those problems we will, in fact, exacerbate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I still must acknowledge that business is getting its act together, and I applaud that. Many feasibility studies for projects are now incorporating things such as environmental impact statements at an early stage, so they do not become something to be fought over at the end. My objective is to move this process of change to a higher level so that we can link economic decision-making processes to our broad environmental objectives. I define those objectives as closed-cycle production, to the maximum extent that we can get it; a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; a steady increase in the efficiency of our use of materials and energy; a switch to organic agriculture and renewable energy use; and a cessation of the invasion of natural environments by human economic activity, and preservation of species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to do&mdash;and it is difficult&mdash;is to link those goals with our economic indicators. National economic statistics measure our wealth creation, but they do not measure the damage we cause by creating it and by using it. Corporate decision-making indicators&mdash;company accounts and the like&mdash;do not even properly address the corporate impact of environmental damage, much less the community impact of that damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any instant solutions to this problem, and that is why I am suggesting that this is a long-term thing that needs to be addressed. I hope honourable members in this House will be interested in taking me up on this. We have to get the issue away from the high-profile battles, away from people lying in front of bulldozers, and into the boardrooms, into government. We have to make sure that the decisions have been made properly and in an environmentally sensitive way from the outset so that we do not get to the protest stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we internalised the environmental externalities. We have to integrate environmental indices into our economic decision-making structures. The company balance sheet must ultimately be linked in some way to a natural capital account of the nation so that national goals and indicators for environmental protection can be linked with the decisions that we actually make about economic activity, either in this place, in State parliaments or in companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mention of State parliaments brings me to my third and final theme: my desire to see the abolition of State governments. Like many in this chamber, I am committed to the achievement of a republic in this country by the year 2001. I have no doubt that we will traverse many other constitutional issues in our journey towards that goal. Although we may not achieve a two-tier system of government by the year 2001, it is critical that we examine these issues while attention is focused on our structure of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States are as much an anachronistic relic of colonial times as are our links with the British Crown. In 1901 the States reflected genuine focuses of economic and social activity in this country; they have long since ceased to do so. They are now an impediment to good government, a fount of economic inefficiency and a mis-allocation of scarce public funds. In this era of micro-economic reform, with interstate economic activity ever increasing, what we are getting from the States is eight different legal and regulatory systems in areas such as criminal law, environmental law, consumer law, trade and occupational qualifications, food standards, workers compensation&mdash;and so the list goes on. Business is confronted with a multiplicity of conflicting regulatory demands and overlapping planning regimes which generate inordinate delays, conflicting demands and fragmentation of the planning process. The States compete with each other for investment, including foreign investment, at the expense of their own citizens by trading off cheaper electricity, cheaper workers compensation premiums and the like. The boundaries of the States have about as much relevance and logic as the boundaries imposed on Africa by the colonial invaders in the 19th century. It is not necessary to be a genius to work out that the Murray River was adopted as a boundary in the days when no-one had heard of pollution and it was thought that natural resources were unlimited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexities of the distribution of powers between the States and the Commonwealth cause many anomalies and many problems that lead to an inadequate approach by government at large to issues in the community. If we want to see the ultimate absurdity of our system of government, we only have to look at recent chaos surrounding issues such as daylight saving and Australia Day. Those issues highlight the stupidity of the system. How many other countries in the world celebrate their national day on different days in different parts of the country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, there are a few people on the conservative side of politics who adopt a constructive approach to this debate and who do not respond with attempts to frighten small children late at night with boogiemen. Ian McPhee is an honourable example. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was even quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> about 18 months ago implicitly suggesting that it would be a good idea if the State structure were done away with. I suspect the honourable member might have changed his mind in recent times, but time will tell. In its publication `Government in Australia in the 1990s: a business perspective', the Business Council of Australia described the existing structure of government in this country as `archaic, inefficient and in urgent need of reform', and called for a two-tier system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I ask the economic rationalists on the other side of the House&mdash;if there are any left since 13 March&mdash;to give very serious consideration to this issue. There is one at least&mdash;that is good to see. If we are to be a truly independent nation, economically vibrant and innovative, and to provide efficient and responsive government to the people of Australia into the 21st century, we must not exempt our antiquated system of government from the flood of change which is sweeping through this country. I expect to be standing here in the year 2001 representing a truly independent Australian republic, and I intend to do everything within my power to ensure that that republic is genuinely democratic, efficient and accountable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great things about living in Australia is that it is a free country and that is how it should stay. Indeed, when I look at the make-up of my electorate I see a diverse ethnic mix with many immigrants coming to our great nation to escape homelands plagued by both religious and political persecution. They have come to a land of freedom, a country without oppression or serious friction, a country where they should be able to fulfil their dreams. They have found their safe harbour in Australia. That is how I want this country to stay. I am sure these new members to our country are proud they made their move and just as proud to now call themselves Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times many of our newer Australians have had to bear the tragedy of watching the destruction and disintegration of their former homes and the persecution and suffering of their relatives and friends. The fact that in the main they have not brought old conflicts and divisions to scar their new home, despite in some cases overwhelming temptation, does them and our nation great credit. In my campaign for Stirling, to have had the active support of people who formerly called home the nations of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the CIS, Asia, South America, Canada, and the United States gave me great pleasure and great confidence in our country's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the Federal election we saw in my State of Western Australia a State election that rang out with the disgust of the people at the despicable way government had been managed in my State for the last 10 years. The voice of the people rang out loudly, over and over, with one clear statement&mdash;never again. Their trust in politicians has been eroded to the point where we rate lower in the credibility stakes than do dishonest hawkers and charlatans. It is a sobering reminder to all of us about our responsibilities as the representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal election, too, very clearly showed the sentiments of the people of Western Australia. It has been published in the press that Western Australia is the most conservative State. One thing this Government must remember is that the people of Western Australia voted for change. They voted for the coalition and our vision for the future. They voted for the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and his team. Because of this I would suggest to the House that, rather than being the most conservative State, Western Australia is the most progressive State in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite its success in the recent elections I still say to the Government that it should look dispassionately at what it has done and more particularly at what it did not do. We, the elected representatives of the people, must now become healers and builders. We must heal the pain that Australians from all walks of life have suffered over the last 10 years. We must heal the divisions that have been created in our society and bring back a sense of love for our country. We had it once, we can do it again. To do it we need to rebuild this nation. We need to rebuild and revitalise an economy battered by unscrupulous economic vandals. We have to assist a work force brought up on a philosophy of near enough is good enough. We have to assist a society made complacent by hand-outs and do-gooders. There is a whole generation of young people without dreams. That is the greatest tragedy of all. That is what we need to facilitate&mdash;dreams for the young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to encourage those who would dream of a better future, a safer future for our kids. We need to encourage those who would dream of a compassionate and secure retirement for our seniors where law and order is not a dream but actually prevails. We need to have a country where there are real opportunities to live a productive and happy life. Let us show our young people by our example in this place that we who represent them dare to dream a vision of such breadth that their dreams for full and happy and useful lives are filled with certainty. Australia has the intellectual property&mdash;we have had it all along&mdash;and it is only by harnessing, nurturing and encouraging this invaluable asset that we can build a secure stairway to the bright future that all this country richly deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot hide my disappointment at the Government's inaction since 13 March. While I welcome a debate on the republic, it should not be the be-all and end-all of Government policy. It should not be a distraction. I am disappointed the Government has still failed to make the necessary changes to economic policy to alleviate the suffering of our unemployed and disenfranchised. They have taken our industrial relations policies because they were bereft of ideas. I urge them now to consider some of our economic policies which we knew had the right formula to pull us out of the recession and make Australia a leading and competitive nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has been wrongly stereotyped as a development at all costs party. This could not be further from the truth. I mentioned at the beginning of this speech that I had the wonderful support of my three children. They were part of the reason that I ran for this Parliament. I wanted to ensure the standard of living they inherited from us was better than our generation enjoyed. Economically, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has ensured that this will not occur. Environmentally&mdash;I cannot deny it&mdash;the Labor Party deserves some brownie points, although it has sabotaged many development projects simply to buy the support of the so-called green political parties in an attempt to win their preferences at elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that I or any of my colleagues would have any desire to harm our precious environment. I want my children, grandchildren and all future generations of Camerons to inherit an environment which is not harmed in any way. For that reason, I could not support policies which are environmentally destructive. Nevertheless, I cannot support policies which inhibit economic development when it is absolutely clear that the environment will not be harmed. We must put a stop to political opportunism so we can approach this issue in future in a bipartisan way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue brought to my attention during the recent Federal election campaign&mdash;which regrettably was made into a political football&mdash;was the topic of health. There can be no denying that our health system is in crisis; there is no denying that many Australians are waiting months for important surgery; and there is no denying that the Government has no idea of how to address this crisis. The coalition had a responsible policy which went a great distance towards solving one of the great problems with our health system: attracting individuals who could afford private health insurance out of the public system and into the private system. This would free up many hospital beds in public hospitals and allow lower income earners to access these. Essentially, this was the original purpose of Medicare. It was a policy that was distorted by our opponents but yet deserved bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the Government, in spite of these misrepresentations, to adopt the thrust of our policy which was to provide incentives to attract individuals into taking out private health insurance. Thankfully, with a new Minister at the helm, I would hope that policy is not to be dictated by some outdated ideology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also urge the Prime Minister, as well as any other honourable members opposite who do not have it, to take out private health insurance. I put it to honourable members that, if there is one hospital bed remaining and the choice is between an age pensioner who cannot afford private health insurance and, for example, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) who can, who would get that bed? It would take a lot of convincing to make me believe that the pensioner would get the bed first. But if we encouraged the Assistant Treasurer, and others who can afford it, into private health insurance, such a dilemma would not occur and many more pensioners and low income earners would have quicker access to public hospital beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another policy issue the Government has continued to ignore and which deserves immediate attention is proper recognition of self-funded retirees. Given that the Government is forcing people to take out superannuation so they need not rely on the pension in retirement, one would expect that once they do retire, self-funded retirees would be treated with fairness and dignity. Instead, they are taxed higher than pensioners, they are given fewer benefits, and this is in spite of many self-funded retirees being on a similar income level to pensioners. If we want to encourage more Australians to take a responsible attitude to their future, particularly young Australians to take out superannuation, either voluntarily or compulsorily, then we must ensure that, in retirement, they are treated fairly. Presently they are not, and I would urge the Government to recognise this group of people and give them the recognition and justice they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to congratulate my predecessors, the Hon. Ian Viner, whose advice and encouragement I have valued greatly, and Mr Ron Edwards, on his term as a member of parliament. I do realise I have some big shoes to fill, but I can assure my electorate, and those of you in this House, that I have enormous feet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday, 13 March 1993, against predictions of most media and political analysts, the Labor Government was returned for an historic fifth term with a 15-seat majority in the House of Representatives. I am proud to be a member of the 37th Parliament and the Keating Labor Government as the new member for Capricornia and the first woman to hold the seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me a great deal of pride to have the honour to represent the people of Capricornia, which has a long Labor tradition. The seat was one of the original electorates following Federation. In its 92-year history Capricornia has returned Labor Party representatives for 71 years. One of its famous members was Frank Forde, who held the seat for 24 years from 1922 to 1946. Mr Forde was Defence Minister in the Curtin Government and caretaker Prime Minister for four days until Ben Chifley was installed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was gratifying to have the support of Mrs Bray Gray, the widow of George Gray, the man who represented Capricornia from 1961 to 1967. Bray was the first Labor woman to be elected to the Rockhampton City Council and has an unequalled record of service of 18 years. More recently Capricornia has been held by Dr Doug Everingham, who was a Minister in the Whitlam Labor Government. It was a great pleasure and privilege to meet Gough and Margaret Whitlam and Fred Daly at the opening of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capricornia is a big electorate in every sense. It extends over 114,000 square kilometres, from Great Keppel Island and the beautiful Capricorn coast to the town of Jericho west of the Drummond Range in central western Queensland. Rockhampton is the major city in the electorate, with a population of over 60,000 people. The city's original wealth derives from the goldmining at Mount Morgan, half an hour's drive away. However, the great Fitzroy River and associated rail and port facilities helped it develop as an important regional centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the railway workshops and meatworks have been large employers. Rockhampton is promoted as the beef capital of Australia with its saleyards at Gracemere and meat processing works at Lakes Creek. These facilities service the cattle industry of Central Queensland, which is responsible for an export market which comprises up to 20 per cent of the total primary commodity production in this region. This is followed by grain and seed production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, coal production in the Bowen Basin is the dominant wealth producer for the region, accounting for approximately two-thirds of central Queensland's commodity production value. Central Queensland coal production contributes 80 per cent of Queensland's $4.5 billion coal export industry&mdash;a major contribution to the Australian economy. A significant proportion of this wealth is produced in the seven coalmining communities in the electorate of Capricornia; Blackwater, Capella, Clermont, Moranbah, Dysart and the two towns where I have lived and worked for ten years, Tieri and Middlemount. I will refer more particularly to these communities later in my address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear, however, is that the region is overly dependent on export industries which are notoriously vulnerable to world commodity prices. This has been pointed out in the results of a major study of the Central Queensland region by the University of Central Queensland, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Directions</EMPHASIS>. The report makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The message is clear for central Queensland as it is for Australia: value-adding, wherever it is economically feasible, must be encouraged and systematically developed.</PARA>
<PARA>A key recommendation of the study is the development of an integrated agri-food industry to service the fast growing economies of North-East and South-East Asia. It was therefore pleasing to hear the new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) refer to this opportunity during Question Time in the House yesterday. Apart from the positive contribution such value-adding industries would make to alleviating our external debt, they would provide much needed employment in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential I have just referred to makes it even more imperative that the Federal Government, together with the Queensland Government, assists primary producers affected by the worst drought in many years in the central Queensland region so that breeding stock is saved, and efficient and normally viable producers are not forced off the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During consultations that I and my colleague the State member for Fitzroy, Jim Pearce, had with cattle producers and grain growers, I detected a sense of frustration and desperation as they watched cattle die or crops turn to dust. From their perspective they feel that the Labor Government does not care about their predicament. I know this is not the case and welcome the initiatives announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). However, I request that the Minister as a matter of urgency review options which I have submitted to him for providing further assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current drought has also highlighted the necessity for strategic planning for water storage and management in the region. Many of the smaller towns in Capricornia are in dire straits for what most of us consider a basic necessity: clean running water for domestic and industrial purposes. The problem is now affecting the operation, with potentially serious economic consequences, of some of the coalmines in the electorate. These difficulties are already being felt by local government authorities. I applaud the Government's commitment to water conservation strategies and hope the central Queensland area will not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opening remarks, I referred to the beauty of the Capricorn coast and that brings me to two important concerns of my electorate: environmental protection and tourism. During the recent election campaign, the protection of Shoalwater Bay and its future use was a key issue. A major concern of those who have campaigned long and hard to protect this unique coastal environment was whether the Government would keep its promise after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), to the then Minister for Tourism, and to Senator Margaret Reynolds and the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the  Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Visits to the region and consultations with all the representative groups did much to regain the community's trust in the commitment of the Labor Government to environmental protection. I believe that the terms of reference of the inquiry will address all of their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity to fly over Shoalwater Bay was a profound emotional experience which reaffirmed my personal commitment to protect the area. It is essential that all those involved in decisions about the future management of the area come and see it first-hand. I have the utmost respect for those people who have given so much of their personal lives to protect this priceless asset. I urge the Minister to ensure that all groups making representations to the inquiry have adequate resources to put their case. The economic opportunities of carefully managed eco-tourism in the region will be one of the numerous benefits which will result from protecting this pristine coastal dune area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism in the Capricornia region is contributing to the health of the economy in my electorate and is providing important employment opportunities. Apart from the Capricorn Coast and Great Keppel Island we have the Dreamtime Cultural Centre, other local attractions in Rockhampton, and the proposed cattle industry park at Gracemere. The old goldmining town of Mount Morgan has the potential for tourism development and will shortly benefit from other employment generating initiatives being developed with assistance from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. All levels of government need to ensure that those communities that have provided so much wealth to this country are not forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, together with other new members whose first speeches in this House it has been my privilege to hear, I commend the priority given in the Governor-General's address to the need to tackle the unemployment issue. I am pleased to report that many innovative training programs are currently being developed in Capricornia to assist people to re-enter the job market. The most effective programs involve cooperative ventures between the Department of Employment, Education and Training, private industry and technical and further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example worthy of special mention is a program developed by the construction team during the building of the new Stanwell power station, a project of the Queensland Electricity Commission. In order to employ local people during the construction phase, a total training program was developed in consultation with unions, contractors and training institutions. An incorporated body, the Stanwell skills development program, was set up and has provided training and multiskilling to 700 workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result has been high employee retention rates, comparatively improved productivity and an excellent safety record. This innovative program has received deserved recognition elsewhere in Australia and overseas. Although not under my direct responsibility as the first woman appointed to the Capricornia Electricity Board, this is a further example of innovation in statutory authority human resource management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it is fair to say that, with the wealth previously mentioned, the Capricornia region has not experienced the recession as severely as other parts of Australia. The Queensland Department of Business, Industry and Regional Development reports that approximately $300 million worth of major developmental projects was completed in the region during 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant new industry is the Queensland magnesia project consisting of an open-cut mine 60 kilometres north of Rockhampton and a state-of-the-art processing plant in Rockhampton. I was pleased to be able to take the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on a tour of inspection during the campaign. Here is an industry contributing directly to Australia's exports, with further developments planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important employer in the region is the University of Central Queensland, which owes its present success to that process referred to by the vice-chancellor as `Dawkinisation'. Not only is the university providing on-campus and distance education to many in the region&mdash;including, I might add, my husband&mdash;but its faculties are also committed to working with industries throughout the region. The university is developing ties with overseas groups to develop joint educational services to our Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to represent the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) at a function in the neighbouring electorate of Dawson last week to launch the Asia-Pacific Studies Centre of the Thailand Australia Foundation. This function was attended by the Thai Ambassador, members of the Thai Parliament and the Chaiyong Limthongkul Foundation. The foundation's chairman, Mr Sondhi Limthongkul, praised the promotion by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the debate on constitutional reform and the recognition of Australia's future as an integral part of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the reference to constitutional reform brings me to an important issue in the Governor-General's speech, that is, the fundamental importance of the reconciliation process with our indigenous fellow Australians. The time for platitudes and talk is past; it is a time for action. The Mabo decision does provide all Australians with a unique opportunity to redress past wrongs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the campaign I was privileged to meet many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Rockhampton, Mount Morgan and Woorabinda who are working hard to improve the situation in their communities. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mainly urban</EMPHASIS> needs wide dissemination to assist European Australians to confront the myths that exist and prejudice that all too easily prevails, especially during times of recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a forgotten group that is relevant here, that is, the community of South Sea Islander peoples, who survived a less than glorious episode in Australian history but have not gained the necessary recognition or assistance to which they are entitled. I am proud to say that some of them live in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I am proud to be a member of a government that believes that economic success should serve social ends and, indeed, that economic success is substantially dependent on creating a fair and just society. Essential to that process is its treatment of women. The Federal Labor Government has achieved a great deal in the past 10 years in its legislative program and support of community initiatives. The commitments to child care, to Medicare, to heath initiatives for women and to the national strategy on violence against women outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New national agenda for women</EMPHASIS> and launched by the Prime Minister on 10 February contributed to the electoral support that women gave to our Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women in Australia</EMPHASIS> launched by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) this week and the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS> indicate that much more needs to be done to achieve true equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now return to my reflection on living and working in the mining communities of Capricornia. These are in many ways fortunate communities with relatively low unemployment rates, high incomes and the work-related benefits that are the outcome of a long history of industrial struggle to achieve safe working environments and recompense for the dangers involved in the mining industry. The great challenge now is for management and unions to work cooperatively to improve our international competitiveness. Thankfully, the election result has allowed the positive industrial relations approach of the Government and the trade union movement to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress from my theme, which is to indicate that my experience of living and working with men and women in mining communities was a key factor in my accepting the challenge of campaigning to win Capricornia. Firstly, because half the members of my electorate live and work in the hinterland, I deemed it important that their aspirations be represented. Secondly, the structural inequalities in communities that do not provide employment for women lead to particular problems, not the least of which is the lost opportunity to utilise the considerable talents of half the population. This has an impact on the aspirations of young women. These communities are not immune from the issues of family violence and family breakdown and often do not have the safety valve of extended family support. The development of the Twin Creeks Employee Assistance Program Inc. demonstrated the commitment by management and unions to the welfare of employees, and I was proud to be the first counsellor for that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, when asked to submit myself to the preselection process for Capricornia, I was driven by the realisation that, if women are to address the structural inequalities and attitudes that continue to impede their progress, we must continue the fight taken up by our sisters before us so that our daughters may benefit. This election has demonstrated that the Australian electorate is ready to support women candidates. The challenge is now for the main political parties to endorse women in safe seats such as Capricornia so that they may redress the gender imbalance in this House more effectively. I imply no disrespect to the members in this chamber by these remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the issues of domestic violence against women and children and of sexual abuse of women and children, which are essentially issues of the abuse of power in relationships, will not wait. These issues have been my focus as a family counsellor but their solutions are ultimately political. The new initiatives in educating the judiciary and police services are essential in a more effective response to combating family violence in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people contributed to my successful campaign for Capricornia. The following people are among the many to whom I owe a debt for giving me the opportunity to participate in the nation's affairs as we move towards the year 2000 and to represent the people of Capricornia in this House: the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), National President of the Australian Labor Party; members of the national executive; Lindesay Jones, Assistant Secretary of the Queensland Branch; Federal members and senators, especially Senator Margaret Reynolds; local, State and national coal mining unions; the Federated Clerks Union and all other unions at local, State and national level who supported our efforts in Capricornia; all members of my local campaign committee and ALP branches who worked so hard, and all those supporters who contributed to the campaign. </PARA>

It was a totally inadequate response. But while we were appalled, of course we would not necessarily be surprised, because honourable members would only have to go back to the election campaign to recognise that this Government went to that campaign with no plan, no sense of priorities, no sense of direction for Australia. That was something that was completely apparent in the Address-in-Reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if we look at the way this reply was structured, it becomes very clear how his speech was put together. They went back through some of the things that were said in the course of the election campaign, they cut them down to a manageable size, they cobbled them together in alphabetical order, and what we got was the Address-in-Reply, A through to W, with no sense of direction. As I say, there were no priorities, and no understanding of some of the basic circumstances that exist in Australia today. There is no recognition of the magnitude of the economic and social problems that bedevil this nation at the present time. To take one specific example, one specific omission, there is no reference to one of the major crises that are hitting regional Australia today in terms of the drought and its impact, in particular, on the wool industry. By the time they got to W they had run out of Ws; they could not go on to wool and they could not focus on what is a very real issue to a substantial percentage of average Australians. This speech was nothing short of a disgrace, given the magnitude of our economic and social problems at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also led to believe, of course, in the context of the election campaign, that the Government would bring with it a generational change. I did not know what they had in mind at that particular time but I now see, since it has put the Ministry together, what in fact it did have in mind: bringing back the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) and Senator Richardson. I mean, that is a clear sense of generational change. Not only do those opposite not have the policies or the responses or the sense of direction or an understanding of the priorities, they do not have the people to carry them out either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sat here yesterday and watched one of the Government's new rising stars perform on the issue of pay TV. What an appalling episode that was. He was absolutely out of control. He did not have an answer to any question and could not explain what had been done. It was a most amazing concept of the process of government where the job was completely beyond that Minister and, of course, his counterpart, his senior Minister in the other House, has got no sense of ministerial responsibility. I guess the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has got no understanding of ministerial responsibility. Apparently a Minister can sign anything these days and not be held accountable for it. Apparently a Minister can read the front page of something and not read the contents and say, `Well, I signed off on the cover but I never read the contents'. That is the standard of government we are about to see in this term on the basis of this speech, which gives us no idea of where they are going to take this country in the course of the next three years. The tragedy is that Australia is in a period of long-term decline. I do not want to be seen as a doomsayer, or a pessimist, I want to be seen as a realist in recognising the magnitude of this decline in Australia at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister or Parliamentary Secretary or whatever he is at the box here, the honourable member for Calwell, keeps challenging me to put some meat on that, so I will. Let us go back to the early 1970s, the period from 1972&mdash;which people on the other side of the House seem to think was the start of history in Australia with the arrival of their mate Gough Whitlam&mdash;and go through every economic cycle since 1972 to the present time and describe what we see in each of those. What we see as the country comes out of each economic cycle is a higher level of underlying unemployment. It is now sitting at around 10 to 11 per cent, and the Prime Minister, although he did not say it in the election campaign, has recently conceded that there is going to be no significant improvement in unemployment in the course of the next three years. In fact, he knows that on his own numbers it will probably still be well above 10 per cent three years from today under the sorts of policies that are likely to be put in place by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come out of every cycle with a higher level of unemployment, a higher level of debt and a higher level of real interest rates, which means not only a significant increase in the magnitude of our economic problems but a significant increase in the pain and hardship that is associated with those problems in the lives of average Australians. That is what I mean by long-term decline in Australia: long-term growth in the underlying rate of unemployment, long-term increases in the real cost of capital, and real interest rates which are making it almost impossible for anyone to go out there and start a business and expand a business in today's circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at interest rates in Australia today and compare them with the United States. Real interest rates for a small business in Australia are roughly three times what they are in the United States. People are paying somewhere between 12 and 14 per cent real interest rates to go into a small business, borrowing on overdraft. How many small businesses are going to give a return of 12 to 14 per cent? The answer is virtually none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has created a set of circumstances and, with the way it has been going, there is no hope of turning those circumstances around. There has been long-term growth in unemployment, real interest rates and foreign debt. Nothing I have heard in the last few years in the statements of Government Ministers has indicated that they have any understanding of debt, let alone how they are going to turn that circumstance around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking down the gun barrel of further declines in our credit standing internationally. I know that honourable members opposite do not think this is very important, but over time it is going to be particularly important when it costs us more and more to borrow, to pay the interest on last year's borrowings, to pay the interest on the borrowings of the year before and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, in fact, also moved into a period of long-term decline in investment in Australia. Business firms which are being given the choice of either operating in Australia or elsewhere are now almost consistently going elsewhere. That is showing up as an all-time record low in terms of business investment in Australia relative to GDP. That is a very significant feature of long-term decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of social dimensions to our long-term decline that are worth focusing on. A simple example is the number of people who are now on welfare. Honourable members opposite should look at the increase in welfare dependency in Australia since their mate Whitlam arrived on the scene at the beginning of history in 1972. There has been a staggering increase, a significant jump, in the proportion of Australians who have no hope, no possibility of getting back into the work force or becoming part of the system again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people on welfare is increasing. It is a significant element of long-term decline in Australia. One thing that is going to be a powerful feature of that is the number of long-term unemployed people, in their forties and fifties and sixties in many cases, who are never going to get another job. It has a very real impact on the average family. People in their forties have kids in the later years of high school, and those people are still carrying a mortgage. When they are thrown out of work, they have no chance of getting a job in the industry they were in and, in most cases under the sort of system the Government is running, they have very little chance of ever getting a job again, with the prospect of 15 or 20 years of welfare dependency. That is the sort of system the Government is building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example is the proportion of the population that is now dependent on government for a job: the number of people employed by government compared to the number of people employed in the private sector. These are long-term structural trends that the Government has done nothing about. It is an unsustainable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk these days about a republic; and I will come back to the specific elements of the speech on a republic in a moment. I think it is instructive to go back to what the Prime Minister described as a `banana republic' in 1986. It is very important to examine that particular interview, which was done in 1986 with one of the Government's mates, of course&mdash;again, John Laws. The then Treasurer described a set of circumstances that characterised a banana republic. He said that it was a situation where, if growth picks up and the economy starts to pick up, imports blow away, the balance of payments blows out, the debt blows out and it is an unsustainable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating went on to say that the only way to deal with that was to close the economy down, which was what he did after 1986 and what he has done, in particular, in the early part of this decade. The situation he described in detail in that interview is precisely what we have today. He is a bit behind in the sense that he has given us the banana and he is working on the republic, but it is a fair description of where we are today in terms of our economic and social circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pause here, because this is a chance for the Speaker to make a mark and set a standard early in the piece. I appreciate the fact that you have pulled the honourable member into line. We need some of these on the record so that we can refer back to them as important precedents, Mr Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that we are in the situation we are in today is that the honourable members on the other side of the House do not see this parliamentary process as anything more than a game. It is a game that they play. It is a game that they participate in. It is something that they do to look after themselves and look after their mates, but not to try and improve the lot of average Australians. How else could we have gone through an election campaign like the one we just went through in which we saw a government go to the people with no plan and no sense of direction?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable members opposite relied on fear and scare tactics to get themselves re-elected. They did not particularly care what they said; they did not particularly care about the direction in which this country was going. All they were determined to do was to get back into government at any cost, so they would say or do anything to get themselves re-elected and when they got there they would just deal with circumstances as they arose while they wallowed in the trappings of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was any mandate at all out of the election campaign it was that the present Government should never increase tax. If one wanted to identify any issue on which it could be said that the Government took a position it was that tax should not increase. So we are going to challenge the Prime Minister to give us a guarantee that he will not increase tax. In particular, we challenge him to guarantee to stand by the tax cuts that he promised to personal and corporate and other taxes, and that he will not then set out to claw them back by increasing taxes in a whole host of other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will want guarantees that there will be no increases in sales taxes or broadening of the sales tax base; we will want guarantees that there will be no reintroduction of death duties or increases in capital gains taxes; we will want guarantees there will be no increases in fuel taxes, or new energy taxes or whatever, that have been floated in recent days. We want an absolute guarantee that no taxes will be increased as a result of what is going to happen in the course of the next few years, because that is the only mandate the Government got out of the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be scrutinising the Government's attitude to payments to the States. There is no way the Government is going to push the tax increases off to the States. Every time it cuts a dollar in terms of payments to the States we are going to be looking for the charge that has gone up and we are going to tag that as a Keating tax increase. If it is an increase in registration fees, bank account debits taxes, payroll taxes or whatever, one will have no doubt it is a Keating tax increase, and it will be tagged as a Keating tax increase. We will hound you for three years on those tax increases, because the only mandate the Prime Minister got out of this election campaign was not to increase tax and we are going to hold him totally accountable for that at every opportunity. We are going to start by seeking absolute guarantees from the Prime Minister that taxes will not be increased directly or indirectly for the next three years. That is what we are after in the course of the next few days in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned before that the Prime Minister raised the republican issue in the Governor-General's speech. In fact, the speech committed the Government to an Australian republic by the year 2000. It was a significant speech in one sense: it was significant for what it did not say. It was significant for neglecting that tax commitment; it was significant in that it did not draw attention to all the promises that the Government is in fact about to break; and it was significant in the sense that it never actually spelt out what is meant by a republic or what agenda the Government and the Prime Minister in particular have in mind. It really begged the very real question about what kind of republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all suspect of course that the Prime Minister has his own republican agenda, but at this stage he says he embraces something called a minimalist position, and on that position he still cannot tell us the detail. In fact, he picked that leading light Malcolm Turnbull to go out and put together a group of so-called eminent people in order to try to specify the detail of what would be a minimalist position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Turnbull had the distinction of running twice for preselection in Wentworth and losing both times, but I would not want to point that out. What the Governor-General's speech did not say was that the Government has absolutely no idea exactly what it means by a republic. We have no doubt on this side that the Prime Minister has an agenda. The Prime Minister has a personal agenda in the republic area. He is certainly not saying that, but you can bet your life we are going to tag him with that too, because we know what his agenda is. His agenda is not the so-called name change for the head of state; his agenda is actually to go into some fairly substantial changes to the processes of government and the way of life in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is on record, for example, as referring to the Senate as `unrepresentative swill'. We know part of his agenda is to abolish the Senate. We also know that the attitude to the States of a number of honourable members opposite and the Prime Minister is that the States ought to be abolished. One of his frontbenchers, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths), was out the other day saying that he would like to see the States abolished&mdash;this is all part of the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that the Prime Minister wants to change the flag and pull us out of the Commonwealth. There is a host of other elements associated with the so-called `republican push'. Of course, most honourable members over there are so bitter and twisted about 1975. What they are really on about is changing some of those reserve powers so that they cannot be thrown out of government again when they are grossly incompetent. We know what their secret agenda is and they can bet we are going to oppose that type of republican thrust absolutely for the rest of the time that we can draw breath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have little doubt that the Prime Minister last year raised the republican issue in a desperate attempt to pull some of those honourable members opposite back on side and to try and put some pressure on us. It was raised for partisan political reasons. He had no understanding, at that time, beyond a desperate attempt to capture some cheap nationalistic sentiment and pull those opposite back on side in the hope that he could keep the leadership and go on and retain the prime ministership. Now he is under pressure to detail what he has got in mind with the so-called minimalist position. I think there are a number of points that I should make in response to what has been said by the Prime Minister and others on this issue at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are happy to participate in a debate. We are always happy to participate in debates about Australia's constitutional form of government. We are very proud of the form of constitutional government we have had. It has worked very well. That is not to say that we will not look at changes, but we have to be convinced that those changes are worth making. So we will participate in the debate in a constructive way. Of course we will. But we are not going to be steamrolled or stampeded into an outcome that is consistent with the longer term so-called republican agenda of the Prime Minister and others on the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only logical that we would participate in this sense because there is a lot of change in Australia. There are changes in attitudes, without the alternatives being fully identified. But there are certainly changes in the ethnic mix in Australia. All of these sorts of factors are consistent with our being part of the debate and participating on the basis of those trends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have denied ourselves the privilege of being part of the Prime Minister's republic advisory committee for a number of reasons: firstly, it was just a blatantly political exercise and it was not a bipartisan exercise in any sense; secondly, we do not have a position in support of the republic&mdash;at this stage we are participating in the debate. We are not going to be part of a process that is designed to specify a particular so-called minimalist approach. Thirdly, we kind of favour this Constitution Centenary Foundation under Sir Ninian Stephen, which is a genuinely bipartisan approach of some 60 people that has got a longer-term agenda to raise a lot of issues in constitutional reform for public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that I make is that there is no way we are going to let the Prime Minister, as I said before, succeed in his republican agenda, which we know about and which we will identify and delineate in the course of this debate. I would say that any minimalist change will always be a significant change, given the nature of the Constitution's situation in which we have operated in recent days. Questions about whether the President be elected, whether the powers of the President be changed, what to do with the reserve powers, how to involve the States and so on are massive changes, not minor changes. `Minimalist' is a furphy in a description of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we are not going to let Labor use the constitutional reform issue as a means of re-writing history. We will not let it chant the Manning Clark mantra of Australian history as though it were established fact. We will not let the Prime Minister interpret history in his own narrow, divisive and short term way&mdash;I refer to comments on the Burma Railway, the Kokoda Trail and so on. The Prime Minister's interpretation of Australian history has got nothing to do with objective fact and everything to do with a whole host of hang-ups of his own about Jack Lang, about the Irish-English issue, the 1975 constitutional crisis and so on. We will also not let him fool the people of Australia that history in this country actually began in 1972. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Perth is the area I grew up in, where I went to school, where my family have lived for the last 25 years and where we still live today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first election campaign I actively participated in was the 1975 election campaign for the federal seat of Perth.

The average tenure has been about 10 years but honourable members opposite will understand that no effort will be spared by me to increase that average. The longest sitting member for Perth was the first member, James Fowler, who sat from 1901 to 1922. Mr Fowler was obviously an early and successful exponent of the notion that one of the tricks in politics, like economic management, is to pick the turns. He achieved his record by turning from the Australian Labor Party to Liberal in 1910 and then to National Party from 1917 to 1922.

I pay tribute to Dr Ric Charlesworth, not least because in his capacity as my campaign director he presided over a one per cent swing towards me at the election. It is no criticism of him to say that he worked harder for me than he did for himself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ric Charlesworth made a fine contribution to the deliberations of this House and the Government. I have known Ric for many years, initially through hockey circles and subsequently with him as candidate and then member for Perth. He has recently been appointed coach of the Australian women's hockey team, so continuing his substantial contribution to our sporting life. I might add that, while Ric's hockey career culminated in the Olympics, mine peaked and plateaus today with the fourth team at the Bayswater-Morley hockey club in the heart of my electorate. And worse, when I was his campaign director in 1987, I managed to achieve no swing to him at all. </PARA>

It contains the Narrows Bridge, the WACA, the Perth and Midland town halls, Bassendean Oval, the Guildford post office, the standard gauge railway line and the Swan River. I have all the icons in my electorate. </PARA>

As well, the protection of the Swan River, enhancing its water catchment quality, protecting the Maylands clay pits as a local environmental preserve, improving the catchment quality of the Bayswater main drain and foreshore preservation work in Ashfield and Bassendean are important local issues. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members may be surprised to learn that, since Federation, there have been just over 870 members to this House, with only 70-odd from my own State, Western Australia. Although relatively few in number, we all come here to add our vastly different life experiences and our different little emphases to the sifting of ideas which goes on in the search for the correct policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own case, my initial life experience was to train and then practise as a lawyer. Practising as a lawyer put me in a special position. I became a member of Australia's second most powerful trade union, a law society&mdash;second, of course, to the AMA. That experience causes me to now focus on a serious national issue: the growing lack of access to justice. Judge Andrew Rogers said recently on his retirement that, while it was often said that everyone should be allowed to have his or her day in court, `does that necessarily mean that some other citizens should be exposed needlessly and unfairly to the costs which attend legal proceedings?'. </PARA>

This runs the risk of the pejorative description `machine or backroom boy', a label perhaps even more disdainful than parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I believe these are honourable professions. These roles are not only very useful life experiences and sometimes apprenticeships for this place, but play an important and much underrated part in our democratic and political process. We have the great advantage in this country that our disputes are settled every three years in primary school classrooms and town halls. The greater the quality of our political parties, the more integrity there is to that process. The greater the quality of advisers, the greater the quality of debate and the clash of ideas in the search for the correct policy outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now make a few asides related to these life experiences. I pay tribute to the retiring national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Bob Hogg. It was a pleasure to work closely with him. I met him first in the 1979 Victorian State election. He has not changed&mdash;ever the pessimist. He has made a much undervalued contribution to public affairs, political process and policy debate in this country, bringing a disarming frankness and great integrity with that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I refer to the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), and Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In between gainful employment with the honourable member for Blaxland, I had the pleasure of working with the Minister in his previous portfolio, science. However, I do note that some members of the Fairfax press alleged there was no actual break in employment. That started a keen interest in the need to develop our great Australian scientific ideas here. I enjoyed my time with him enormously and he has been a great encouragement to me in seeking a place in this chamber. </PARA>

At my first Caucus meeting, a colleague said to me, `Stephen, you now know the difference between real power and apparent power. You had real power but you gave it up. You now have apparent power'. Apart from the fact that that might be too close to the truth, it raises far too simplistically the question of Parliament versus the Executive or member versus Minister and minder.

I can vividly recall as a young schoolboy extolling to my mother and father&mdash;whom I see in the gallery&mdash;the great virtue of voting for John Tonkin at a Western Australian State election. I was met with the rejoinder that I should not worry; that we were Labor; that my father and mother had voted for Labor since Chifley was leader. The great Australian Labor supporting traditions were instilled, without resistance, at an early age. But it was not until 1975 that I became politically active as a rank and file member of the Australian Labor Party. That was as a direct result of the actions of the coalition, the then Governor-General and the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia conspiring to remove a democratically elected government. </PARA>

It has also been my great fortune to work closely with the Prime Minister and Joe Berinson, the last two of the Whitlam Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much analysis as to the reasons for our victory at the election. Like most complicated analysis, there is generally a simple answer. My own view is that the Keating Government was returned with an increased majority because Australia made a lifestyle choice about its future and its people's future. The elements are well known: the choice of a fair tax system over a new, unfair tax; the choice of a cooperative, productive, fair wage system over the imposition of unfair individual employment contracts without safety nets; the choice of a universal health care system over an American style system, based on profit and ability to pay; the choice of a view that governments have a responsibility to be involved in society over the withdrawal of government through massive expenditure cuts in social policy areas; and the choice of a commitment to creating jobs through continued development of Australia as a modern industrial trading nation over the illusion of a glib promise of one million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, the most difficult thing in life is choice but, given those elements, the Australian lifestyle choice was clear. The Opposition's attempt to take Australia down an unfair road, based on the worst excesses of Thatcher and Reagan, has been resoundingly rejected. But now we must look to the choices for the future. My own view is that, at the next election, the Australian public will judge the Government and this side of the House squarely on their merits. The obligation on this side is to live up to the Prime Minister's commitment&mdash;we will not let you down. That will require living up to the commitments given in the Governor-General's speech on Tuesday. </PARA>

These difficulties have occurred from time to time at the State level; they have not occurred at the Commonwealth level. I believe the reason for that is the diversity and quality of scrutiny which we have here on the policy choices and the policy issues. In my own State, if I was asked for the one single reason why the events on which the Western Australian community recently made judgment occurred, I would say lack of quality and diversity and scrutiny at all levels, from the Parliament to the political process to the media.

It was based upon the idea of the man on his own land, owning his own property, working for himself. That was the basis of the Lincoln Homestead Act and that was the basis of the occupation of the continental land mass of the United States. That principle turned the United States into the great juggernaut of agriculture throughout the world&mdash;so much so that it threatens almost every other country with an excess of production. </PARA>

It was a term he used endlessly, over and over again, and fought courageously and tirelessly to implement, whether it was against big companies or whether it was against the bureaucracy and the pushers of socialism, he fought tirelessly and courageously against those moves, and to me he is a hero.

He saw the Nogoa Dam and the magnificent cotton fields of Emerald; he saw the Greenvale development which created for people in Queensland 1,500 jobs  that are still there today, in part.

I challenged my opponent, in public debate on the ABC, to name one single kilometre that was sealed. Yet in the 15 years before that in my own State electorate alone, 1,000 kilometres of seal was laid.

Some of you may have strong feelings about tobacco. Forget about that for one moment. The major damage that has been done is by a declaration of the Government that now runs Australia that it is going to remove all of the protection for that industry. We cannot compete against Zimbabwe, which pays a dollar a day for wages. Do honourable members want a dollar a day wages to be imported into Australia or do they want to just wipe out the entire economy of a town of 10,000 people, because that clearly is the choice, and that is what is happening now; it is the stated intention.

Every country in the world, and most certainly in the Pacific, has a huge prawn and barramundi farming industry, and the only country in the world where effluent cannot be let out into the ocean is Australia.

A very great Australian, the person I most admire in Australian politics, Edward Theodore, in this House said, `Let us pay people to work rather than not to work'. One of the things he said was, `Let us build the Bradfield scheme'. We have people having their crops destroyed. We have people out here whose land is ravaged by drought. Let us build it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit I came to this debate unprepared but what I want to do is talk about what I see as Australia's greatest challenge. I actually wrote a paper on this some time ago. Australia has faced many challenges in the past. I guess the first great challenge this nation faced was the First World War when arguably the First and Second AIF constituted the greatest soldiers this nation has ever seen. Many were slaughtered and that denied to Australia a lot of the leadership that should have been here for the development of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect when people try to divide history and divide a culture that the First and Second AIF contained in their ranks many soldiers who were actually born in the United Kingdom. In fact, at Gallipoli, where Australia performed enormously well, one-third of our soldiers were born in the United Kingdom. It is also not widely known or recognised in Australia that the losses suffered by Britain in that battle were twice as high as ours. That was a great loss to Australia because it took away the leadership that should have been here after the war. I believe it was one of the greatest losses we have ever suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next great challenge we faced was the Depression where we had massive unemployment. A third of the work force was unemployed in this country. I think the third challenge was undoubtedly the Second World War. The fourth challenge, while not being as visible, will probably be more important to the future character of this nation than any of the other three. I refer to the coming battle between the nationalists and the internationalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sad things is that those who often pose as nationalists are in fact internationalists who are seeking to tie us to treaties with other nations. They seek to lock us into international obligations which are primarily not in the interests of Australia or, I might add, the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are men of honour on both sides. There are people on the internationalist's side who truly feel that Australia has no other option other than to lock itself into being a part of something else. This is a continuation of the cultural cringe. This harks back to our first great conflict, the First World War, when we lost that strata of leadership. Prior to the First World War this view did not exist in Australia. This was a proud nation, this was a nation where the Australian tail used to wag the British dog. Foreign policy in this part of the world was made by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of that, of course, is Mabo. It was not Britain that annexed the Murray Islands. Britain wanted nothing to do with them. They were annexed by the State of Queensland in 1859. It was done against the wishes of the British. They simply went along with it because Australia demanded it. Quite clearly the Murray Islanders are of a different culture to Australian Aborigines. They are a Melanesian culture and in the Melanesian culture there is a history of land tenure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue with a lot of the evidence given in the Mabo case. I think it was probably fairly suspect. The concept of terra nullius did not mean there were no people in Australia. That is a nonsense, of course there were people here. But everywhere the British went, be it New Zealand, Malaysia, India, North America or Fiji, they signed treaties with the natives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They signed treaties because that was their modus operandi. That has its own problems, and we have seen those in North America and New Zealand, but that was the way they operated. The instruction to governors-general in Australia was always to sign treaties. The reason they did not was that there was no structure under which to sign them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that, in large parts of this nation, there was simply no Aboriginal habitation. I was involved in the opening of the Nullarbor, the last great pastoral development Australia will ever see; there will never be another one. When I went to that area in 1960, there were no kangaroos on the Nullarbor, for the same reason that there had been no Aboriginal habitation&mdash;because there was no water. Within four years of putting the bores down on the Nullarbor, a man could shoot 100 kangaroos a night. In the late 1970s, to survive, I did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if we are to have a truly independent Australia, we must have full employment in this country. We cannot have full employment without industry policy. Anyone who tells people that we can have jobs for our kids without manufacturing in this country is simply lying or, of course, stupid. They are not mutually exclusive; they could be both. I believe that we have to look very carefully to this manufacturing industry, and it has to be recreated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have in Australia today is simply this: as the economy improves&mdash;and it is always going to be cyclical in nature&mdash;immediately there is wealth in the community it is used to suck in imports because there is no manufacturing capacity in Australia. We can ask ourselves why. Both political parties must take blame for the reason. In the days of Malcolm Fraser the exchange rate was kept artificially high, which simply drove manufacturing industry to the wall. We had years of irrational high-tariff policies. I am not a high-tariff protectionist, but I do believe in the support of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays, we have the level playing field, for which my party must take some responsibility. This too has decimated Australian industry, for there is no level playing field; and we have seen other nations who do not pay lip service to this nonsense thrive at our expense. I think we have to get much smarter in the assistance to industry. In terms of exports of manufacturing goods, our achievements have been considerable. I think the 18 per cent compound growth over the last 10 years is creditable, but it came from a very small base. A large part of it is motor vehicle offsets. There are some good endeavours. Shipbuilding is an excellent example. I was depressed to see in the Governor-General's speech that we are going to reduce the shipbuilding bounty, for I have a view that one should give assistance to the industries which are effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to get to manufacturing industry in this country, we have to change some of the ethos. The problem is not wages. I can tell the people of Australia this: if the wages of this country were halved, we would not create massive employment in this country; we would not create a mass of jobs at all. One of the problems is the availability of capital. People talk about the high savings rate in Japan and how this was the engine that drove the Japanese economy, and I will concede that there probably is a greater ethos to save in Japan. This is substantially because the Japanese have an appalling social security system whereby people have to supply their own because there is no government provided safety net. So people have to save. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there was another issue. The Japanese kept very tight control of currency. They did not allow money to leave the country. Had they done so in the early 1950s, Japanese money would have fled Japan to other countries where returns were greater. The money was forced to stay in Japan. I believe that this country would be well advised to look at currency controls to control the outflow of currency from this country, to force the people to keep their money in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to take their money out of the country they should have to have a very good reason for it. If they can convince people that there is a good reason, then it would be okay and they would be permitted to do so, but generally we should have currency controls to keep the money in the country, to make it available to industry here. One of the great costs of an industry is capital equipment. Without that, there is going to be no competition. The average age of machinery in Australian factories is getting into the eight- to 10-year range. In Korea it is two years. That is where the productivity lies. It does not lie in cutting wages; that is simply not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to build a united country in Australia it is important that we look at some of the problems that are working against this. I have heard just about every speaker in this House applaud multiculturalism, but what do we mean by multiculturalism? What I mean when I talk about multiculturalism is officially sanctioned and funded multiculturalism. I abhor that sort of multiculturalism; I think it is dividing this nation. I believe that if it were put to a vote of the people of Australia it would be overwhelmingly rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come here as the member of an electorate which has a very large migrant constituency, one of the largest in Australia, and I have overwhelming support from migrants. The reason most migrants come to Australia is for the benefit of their children, and these migrants want to be Australians. Many of them reject being closeted and told, `No, you can't be a real Australian, you've got to be an ethnic'. I find that situation intolerable. I believe that anyone who comes to Australia should come here with a commitment to this nation, to being Australians and to making this their home. If they lack that commitment, I think we are entitled to say to them, `Why are you here? We have no need for you'. Truly I believe that Australia has no need for people who have no commitment to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the immigration program generally, I believe that for environmental reasons, for social cohesion and pure economics, it is time to reduce immigration to this country. We have seen the Triads imported to Australia through the business migration scheme. The cost of this to the nation and to each of us individually is enormous, if it were calculable&mdash;we do not really know what the cost is, but it is clearly enormous. It has done nothing for the benefit of this country. We are told we need these people to enhance our trade with Asia. Ironically, of course, our trade with Hong Kong has dropped dramatically since we have had this large influx. It seems to me that there is never any scrutiny of the arguments that are used to sustain high levels of immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the effect of the importation of skills? The effect is to promote migrants over Australians and to deny Australians training in those skills. If we are going to build a nation it is far better to train our people to make sure that they have the necessary skills. But this is part of the cultural cringe I have talked about: the cringe that has developed that it must be better overseas; the cringe that used to be directed towards Britain and the United States is now directed towards Asia. It is a nonsense. I have a friend who is the chief pilot for a large organisation which provides technical services. This company is a world leader that has expanded across the world and it has opened branches in America. My friend said to me, `When I knew we were going to America I thought, "I will really have to be on my metal now because this is the absolute peak of aviation", but when I got there I found the standards were abysmal, that if I could get Australian pilots in there&mdash;which I can't because of work permits&mdash;I could increase my company's productivity by 200 or 300 per cent'. Yet how many people would look to Australia as the peak of aviation and to Australian pilots as being the most competent in this technical field?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another very good friend in Kalgoorlie who is a mining engineer, probably one of Australia's best mining engineers, particularly in the area of difficult mining and deep shaft construction. He is British but he has mined all over Europe, Africa and Australia. He said to me that he will get a job done in Australia quicker, safer and cheaper than anywhere else in the world. He said it is not because Australians work harder&mdash;in fact, he gives that to the Irish&mdash;but he says they work safer and smarter and they show the initiative required. He said he can do a job with two men less on the platform, which is important in shaft sinking because of the constraints of room. I think this international view is a credit to us. Yet how often do we hear that we must import these skills because somehow we are inferior? I abhor this cringe which Australia has developed. It is unnecessary and it has done a lot of damage, and it is being used today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now being told that we must move into part of the Asian sphere. Now, I believe in trade with Asia. I go to China a lot and the Chinese do not think they are Asian; they look upon themselves as Chinese or Han people. They have a healthy disrespect for a lot of other Asians. They like us precisely because we are not Asian; they see us as a non-threatening Western technology nation. If Australia is going to trade successfully we must trade with the world. The world is our oyster. We must supply the world in those things which we are particularly good at producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are going to be trade barriers raised against us but they will not be raised in some of the areas vital to Australia's trade. We will sell our minerals because we are the world's best miners. We provide competitive price and quality product. In other areas it will not be so easy. We must seek other alternatives. But I say now that manufacturing export industry is simply not enough for Australia. What we need is import replacement. If we had that import replacement industry, our improving economy would not be sucking in the overseas exports that we are doing now and compounding our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in the process of writing another paper, an interminable and an unrewarding job in this place, because for backbenchers it is hard work, lacking the resources, and, with media that do not pay much attention to other than the frontbenchers of either side, it is a disillusioning business. But I put it to honourable members now that we ought to think along these lines. In Queensland we have proven resources of oil 25 times the size of Bass Strait, enormous resources of proven oil, in shale. Those shale oil resources, because of Australian technology, are now buyable at about $24 a barrel. I saw the price of North Sea oil at $20.80 a barrel the other day&mdash;not that far off the marked price. That is about the equivalent to our Bass Strait high quality oil, the same high quality oil which you can get from shale oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to forgo excise on the sale of oil, we could deliver petrol to petrol bowsers at the same price as, or probably marginally cheaper than, we can now. Forgoing that excise would be of very good use, unlike the Liberal Party's intention to simply throw it away and waste it and obviously get the money from somewhere else. This would be very constructive because we would turn energy from a narrow, highly capital intensive industry into one which employed a lot of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to decide as a nation that we were going to develop our oil resources from this area, it would have an important impact on manufacturing industry. Heavy industry would blossom to provide the plant and equipment to do this. It would take time and improvements would be incremental. As the availability of shale oil improved on the market the Government would reap its benefit from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers rather than from excise on the oil. The Government would not be out of pocket in the long run, we would have unemployment on the way down and we would have something that was developing cohesion in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also make available, of course, our Bass Strait oil for export. The Fraser Government introduced world parity pricing. The real reason for it was to get more revenue, but it was applauded by the oil companies because they got more money, and what is going to happen now, under this scenario, is that they can export to the world. We will always sell our oil on the world market because it is good quality oil and the world would like to deal with us. There would be no trouble selling it. We would have to accept the world price, but I would estimate, and it is a ballpark figure, that we are spending something in excess of $25 billion a year on oil. If that were made available for export income, we then clearly would have the growth in the current account deficit beaten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other areas in which we should take these initiatives. We will not take these initiatives unless we have a united Australia confident in itself and confident in its future. If we are prepared to face the world clear-eyed and unafraid, we will survive. We will not survive as a nation by grovelling to others, by seeking to tie ourselves to the skirt strings of other nations or other groups. We must survive on our own ability as a nation. We must look to the world for those challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no embargo, for instance, on horticultural products into the Common Market. There is absolutely no reason why we could not be exporting horticultural products into Europe. We have developed the technologies so that these things can be sent fresh by boat, reducing the cost. Just think of this: the world's greatest market for table grapes is the United Kingdom; it imports $1 billion worth a year. It would like to import them from Australia. Why the hell are we not selling them, because they are paying twice the price that prevails in this country? There is there, I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, some food for thought, and I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his speech on the occasion of the opening of the 37th Parliament, His Excellency the Governor-General stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential for the economy as a whole that we make the most efficient use of our transport infrastructure and that a national focus be given to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding for roads of national importance will lead to the lowering of transport costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, may I therefore take the opportunity to criticise in the strongest terms actions taken by the previous Labor Party Government, led by the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and the then Minister for roads, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), regarding their punitive attitude to the Liberal State of Victoria and their favoured treatment of the Labor States of Queensland and South Australia, as well as the Prime Minister's own State of New South Wales, on the topic of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria's significance to the national economy is enormous, as is reflected in the following statistics obtained from Vic Roads on 28 April 1993. The State's gross domestic product&mdash;GDP&mdash;is 27 per cent of Australia's GDP. Victoria's population of 4.3 million makes up 26 per cent of the national population. The State's share of national employment is approximately 26 per cent. Victoria generates about one-third of the export of products which are most important for long-term economic growth. Manufacturing is the main employment sector in Melbourne, while Melbourne is the largest employment centre in Australia for the manufacturing sector. The port of Melbourne handles 44 per cent of containers moving through capital city ports. Finally, Victoria attracts one-third of visitors to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Resultant upon these statistics, road transport in Victoria is a significant factor in the cost of providing the services and products that contribute to Australia's international trade, accounting for up to 15 per cent of the total delivered price of commodities. Reduction of transport costs represents one of the few real opportunities to directly lower costs for our export goods and import replacements, thereby improving Australia's international competitiveness and improving our balance of trade. To do this, Victoria requires targeted investment in its road transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have expected the Commonwealth Government, being doubtless aware of the strategic importance of Victoria to the well-being of the nation's economy, to deal impeccably and without fear or favour regarding its projected road funding program. Indeed, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1993 land transport strategy</EMPHASIS>, a document produced by the Federal Department of Transport and Communications under the previous Minister, the honourable member for Charlton, states just that. On page 34, in the section relating to the redefinition of road responsibilities, it claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changed responsibilities will encourage greater accountability and strengthen the direct link between revenue raising and spending.</PARA>
<PARA>No such direct link between revenue raising and spending exists under the proposed distribution of untied funds in accordance with financial assistance grants formulae. Despite the fact that 27 per cent of total travel on Australian roads occurs in Victoria, including 35 per cent of the national interstate road freight, which is expected to double in the next decade; and despite the fact that Victorian motorists contribute 27 per cent of the federal fuel excise revenues used for road funding, in 1992-93 Victoria received only just under 20 per cent of total Commonwealth road funds, being 12.3 per cent of the national highway funds and 27.6 per cent of other allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allocation was despite there being additional funds provided through the Government's One Nation initiative, the accident black spots program and urban transport and provincial cities and rural highways programs. This is bad enough, but there is worse to come. Indicative budget advice to Vic Roads, received from the Federal Minister in January, suggests that Victoria will receive only 19 per cent of the total Commonwealth road funds in 1993-94&mdash;10.2 per cent of national highway funds and 34.8 per cent of other allocations. That will decrease to as low as 13 per cent in 1997-98&mdash;11.8 per cent of national highway funds and 20.4 per cent of other allocations&mdash;when the revised federal road funding arrangements are fully implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will explain what is probably known to some people in this place, but may not be known to the community at large. The former road classification system, which ended in December of this year, consisted of, firstly, national highways. These are the main highways of Australia&mdash;for example, the Hume Highway, the Western Highway and the Sturt Highway. The Commonwealth Government has total responsibility, including financial responsibility, for these&mdash;including the corridors surrounding the highways, involving construction, overpasses, land surrounding the highways and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next category is that of national arterial roads. An example of this is Melbourne's Eastern Freeway, which presently runs almost to my own electorate of Deakin. In this category, the Commonwealth Government had only limited responsibility but still provided funding for these projects. Proposed change in funding arrangements will severely curtail such projects. The national arterial roads funding arrangements will be replaced by untied Federal grants for road building, known as the financial assistance grants system&mdash;FAGS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the old system, in assessing priorities between States and intrastate, economic necessity was the criterion. For example, such considerations as connections to industry, value to local communities, usage of roads, et cetera, were taken into account. Under the new FAGS, economic criteria is no longer of any importance. There was an allusion to this in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement, but it had been discussed at the special Premiers Conference in July 1991, at which time it was mooted that the sum of $350 million should be committed to the States in untied grants. This was to be discussed at a Premiers conference in November, which was never actually held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter was sent by the Prime Minister to the Premiers, dated 5 June 1992, in which the decision concerning new funding arrangements was conveyed. The official bureaucratic justification at the federal level of the new funding arrangement, FAGS, is that funds are limited and it does not have the resources to fully evaluate national arterial road projects using economic criteria. In fact, this is a wonderful cop-out to allow funds to be averted away from economic necessity to political expediency; away from the Liberal State of Victoria, my own State, to the Labor States of Queensland and South Australia&mdash;not forgetting New South Wales, which may be Liberal, State-wise, but also is the federal domain of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detrimental effect of the new road funding arrangements on Victoria is obvious from statistics already mentioned. Perhaps the most blatant example of discrimination is the fact that, although Victoria pays 27 per cent of the national fuel tax bill, ultimately, it will only be reimbursed for 13 per cent of Commonwealth total road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are more detailed statistics contained in graphs prepared by Vic Roads, which I will later seek permission to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Those entitled `Victoria's contribution and share of total Commonwealth funding' and `Commonwealth road grants&mdash;Victoria' are of particular significance. The charts showing the proposed new funding arrangements on the road systems surrounding the cities of Melbourne and Geelong show the devastating effects of funding cuts. As a result of these cuts, the Sturt Highway upgrading cannot commence for five years; the Goulburn Valley Highway upgrading cannot commence for four years; the Western Highway upgrading cannot commence, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around Melbourne, the arterial road systems have suffered even more substantially. The Springvale bypass cannot proceed; the Scoresby Freeway cannot commence within the next five years; the Western Ring Road is delayed for at least two years; and the extension of the Eastern Freeway, which will run through my own electorate of Deakin, is substantially slowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Melbourne<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Age</EMPHASIS> of 5 May of this year, the Victorian Government Treasurer, the honourable Alan Stockdale, raised doubts over the future of the city freeway links despite a new 3c per litre petrol levy by the Kennett Government to start on 1 July. This will raise more than $150 million a year for roadworks in Victoria. The dramatic cuts in federal road building grants already mentioned are expected to leave the State well short of funding requirements for up to 10 planned major road projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the expected Federal cuts eventuate, Victoria will have only $17 million extra for road building in the 1993-94 financial year and this is despite the controversial 3c per litre  levy  on  petrol and  diesel  fuel  raising</PARA>
<PARA>$157 million. Mr Stockdale has rightly expressed confidence that the Federal Government would deliver a better financial deal for Victoria than predicted. I might add that it is certainly to be hoped that the new federal Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, the senator for the Northern Territory, will review the situation as soon as possible and adopt more just criteria in the apportioning of road grants, based on economic need, than was done by his predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator should do this because there is a clear argument that, based on Victoria's contribution to the national road freight task, 35 per cent of national road funds should be directed to the State. Based on Victoria's contribution to national road based revenues, at least 27 per cent of Federal road funding should be directed to this State. Victoria's forward programs included in this report have been developed on this latter basis. Any allocation less than this figure would be undermining Australia's national economic performance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 March the Australian people, certainly in my view, turned their backs on the policies of division and instead chose the policies of inclusion. Let there be no mistake, the Opposition's Fightback package was nothing less than a full-frontal attack on the values which have made Australia great, and the ideal of a fair go for all. The policies which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) took into the last election can only be described as extremist, including, as they did, the introduction of a GST on almost every good and service, the abolition of the award system and its replacement with individual contracts and the abolition of Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, since March 13, the Opposition has had the arrogance to infer that the Australian people got it wrong by falling for what they characterise as a Government scare campaign. Of course, it is the Opposition and not the Australian people who has got it very wrong. Honourable members opposite should have realised that the Australian people would never support policies that would divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots. It should also have realised that Australians would not allow the dismantling of Medicare, one of the finest health systems in the world, to have it replaced by an American style system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, the Opposition should have realised that the people would never buy its miserable 15 per cent tax on almost everything, which would have changed the whole way Australians live their lives. It is interesting how quickly Opposition members are now keen to say that they never really supported the GST at all. However, I fail to recall many occasions during the life of the previous Parliament when Opposition members had the courage to stand in this House and condemn the Opposition Leader's policies of division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">March 13 was not only a great day for the Australian Labor Party nationally, it was certainly a great day for the Australian Labor Party in my electorate. The people of the Oxley electorate turned their backs on the coalition's reactionary policies and there was a swing of the order of two per cent to the Australian Labor Party. It is certainly a great honour to continue to represent the people of the Oxley electorate in this place, and I would like to place on record my many thanks to them for their support, not only on election day but also over the five years that I have been the member for Oxley. My top priority during this next term will be to continue to ensure that the Ipswich region, which I proudly represent, receives the full benefits of the programs of the Keating Government, which have been clearly outlined in the Governor-General's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly thank the many party supporters and friends who ensured that the Australian Labor Party received such an excellent result in the Oxley electorate. My special thanks go particularly to my federal division executive, my campaign director, Joel Mafi, and his campaign committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General's address at the opening of the 37th Parliament on Tuesday, 4 May, outlined the Labor Government's policy priorities over the next three years. As was made clear in the speech, this Government's primary goal over its next term will be to achieve sustained reductions in the level of unemployment, and I am sure that is something that we all agree with. We as a government recognise that long-term unemployment has a particularly damaging impact not only on the individuals concerned but also on the wider society. Contrary to the Opposition's claims during the last Federal election, the Australian economy is now in recovery and beginning to grow again. The greatest challenge we will face over the next three years will be to ensure that the long-term unemployed receive assistance to get back into the work force as the economy picks up pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 years the Government has introduced a whole range of programs designed to assist the unemployed in re-entering the labour market. Indeed, it was the Labor Government which established the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Last year the Government made a number of important announcements in the area of vocational education and training. Following the youth employment and training summit convened by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last year, the Government announced a national employment and training plan for young Australians. It is estimated that some 96,000 young people will be assisted by this $700 million package in 1993. Among the measures announced by the Prime Minister was the career start traineeship, which provides young people with the opportunity to combine work and training to increase their skills and enhance their career prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landcare and environment action program, better known as LEAP, which provides 15- to 20-year-olds with work and vocational training on projects which help to preserve our environmental heritage, is one of those many programs. Under LEAP young people are provided with up to 26 weeks of vocationally relevant training and work, including field experience, in areas of land care, conservation, environmental protection and cultural heritage. Those are all very important areas in my own electorate, including the city of Ipswich. It is a very old city, certainly the oldest provincial city in Queensland, and heritage is one of those things that we protect very strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the measures contained in the national employment and training program for young Australians, a number of programs targeted at the older unemployed were announced in last year's Budget. Several local organisations in the electorate of Oxley, including some skillshare programs&mdash;MATES, mainly for the mature age training employment service; Goodna HUGS, the help unemployment Goodna skillshare; workventure; and the Ipswich YUPI skillshare program&mdash;have taken advantages of programs offered by the Government to provide quality training programs to the unemployed. These organisations have been quite successful in helping unemployed people from the Ipswich region back into the work force, and I put on record here my thanks and congratulations to them all for the work that they are doing in assisting these people to get back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While as a whole the Government's labour market programs have been quite successful, it is important that the effectiveness of these measures is constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are not wasted. I am sure that all honourable members will therefore welcome the Prime Minister's announcement on Monday that the Government will review all labour market programs to ensure that funds go to areas that will create the most jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that all sections of the community, the business community, the trade union movement, existing trainers and other concerned community groups, are consulted during this process of review, so that the Government can develop a solution to the issue of unemployment, and I know&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we get into the start of the 37th Parliament and as I see the new faces around the corridors of this great House, my grievance today is for the continuing disregard for the institution of parliament shown by this Keating Labor Government. The House of Representatives will meet for only nine days for this autumn session. In fact, the peoples' House will meet for a total of nine days in a period of eight months. I believe this is scandalous and, at a time when the public's reaction to the parliamentary process can be said to be lukewarm at best, the Government yet again displays its arrogance in regard to the institution of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the speech made in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this week, one should not be surprised at his arrogance if one examines the track record of the Hawke-Keating Government. However, it is not in terms of the number of sitting days that the Government's attitude is displayed. In other ways successive Labor governments have sought to undermine the authority of parliament. The refusal to make major policy announcements in the House and the abuse of Question Time which has caused the new Speaker to make statements about desirable and necessary changes are but two examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to drawn the House's attention to this Government's complete and utter disregard of the role of parliament in terms of the number of sitting days. The fact that this House will meet for only nine days in a period of eight months is indeed scandalous, for which the Government deserves to be soundly condemned. Although charged with the duty of responsible and representative government by this country, the Keating Labor Government persists in undermining the very institution of parliament. A mere nine days this autumn session is clear testament to this. There is no excuse for such a paucity of parliamentary sittings and the nine days is simply not enough if one is to examine the proposed legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the guillotine in this House has been brought to an art form by the Labor Government. Proper parliamentary scrutiny of proposed legislation is going to suffer. Presumably we will, yet again, be faced with the ridiculous situation of all night sittings. Why? Because of the Government's inability to sort out its own legislative timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public deserves better than this. They deserve the right to know that their elected representatives will be granted sufficient time to enable a thorough examination of legislation, particularly as it relates to their individual electorates. Honourable members must have the right to be afforded the opportunity to have their own input in regard to proposed legislation. They deserve the right to expect that legislation passed by this House would be free of errors, omissions or oversights, which unfortunately occur through haste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly this Government has denied not only these fundamental rights but the expectations of the ordinary community as well. What opportunity does an individual have in expressing his or her views in regard to proposed legislation when a Bill is presented and passed in the same night, as has been the case when the guillotine is in operation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of sitting days is a clear reason why the House is placed in this predicament. This House's ability to have the time to scrutinise legislation, debate issues of national importance and raise issues of concern to constituents is a critical aspect of the democratic process. Reductions in the amount of time that this House sits must mean that the democratic process suffers, and that forms the basis of my grievance today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect that the Government will cite the federal election as the reason for the ridiculously low number of sitting days this year. To use the 1990 sitting pattern as a guide, which, of course, was another election year, then it is highly likely that the House will sit for fewer than 40 days this year, and this would be one of the lowest number of sitting days since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lowest number of sitting days for any year was in 1937. Strangely, that was also an election year when the House sat for a mere 29 days. In 1990 the House sat for only 38 days, which does not set a good precedent for 1993. Given that we had an election in March, as was the case in 1990, then I would reasonably expect that the sitting pattern for this year would resemble that of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should this be so, then it is not unreasonable to expect that this House will meet for the lowest number of days since pre-war times. There is simply no excuse for this. In the past when there had been a federal election, governments managed to arrange a suitable number of sitting days. One has only to go back two elections to 1987. In that year, in spite of the federal election being held, the total number of sitting days was 74. This number was in fact one of the highest since the mid-1970s, when the three years of the Whitlam Labor Government saw a high average of 71 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make further comparisons, one has only to go to the 1983 parliamentary year when, despite a March election, Parliament was able to sit for 49 days. I would suggest this means an extra fortnight's sitting compared with the total for the 1990 year. The simple fact of the matter is that, despite the Government's protestations about the federal election necessarily reducing the total number of sitting days, this is simply not true, and past sitting patterns attest to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded at this time of a remark from the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, with regard to the low number of sitting days. At the end of the 1990 Budget session of parliament, Mr Hawke proceeded to tell the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that this Government has not at any time attempted to reduce for political ends the number of sitting days available to this House.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) interjected at the time, `What rubbish!', and I am inclined to agree with that comment. There is no doubt that successive Labor governments have manipulated the parliamentary program in a manner which has undermined the parliamentary process and the esteem in which this House is held in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is utterly stupid that this autumn session of parliament should conclude on 27 May. Why we are not extending our meetings at least until the middle of June I do not know, and there has been no explanation&mdash;unless, of course, we are meeting an undeclared timetable of the Prime Minister and his senior Ministers for trips overseas. Whatever it is, one cannot get over the inescapable fact that the Parliament is being downgraded. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his speech on Tuesday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the number of sitting days should be increased so that we have time to consider legislation properly and so that we will all work more sensible hours when the Parliament is sitting. That is also fundamental to good government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also draw the House's attention to the Labor Government's reluctance to announce major policy items in the House; rather it announces them on the hustings. It is a habit that has been developed by the Labor Party of not making announcements in this House. This means that there is no opportunity, therefore, for proper parliamentary discussion on the issue, whatever it may be. Prime Minister Hawke became a past master at this, and the present Prime Minister is proving an apt pupil and is following in the same way. Not only have we had to go through the debacle of pay television decisions and announcements, but we have also seen the nonsense of the position of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on the Labor pledge to remove aged pensioners from the tax system by 1995. All these decisions were made outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, despite the fine speech made by Mr Speaker on his accession to that role, which we on this side of the Parliament give every encouragement to him to carry out, we have some fairly vital decisions to make. Firstly, this House should sit for more days and at more sensible hours. Secondly, the Government must make all policy decisions within the Parliament itself, thus allowing a proper debate on the issues. This has been one of the real traditions of the Australian Federal Parliament. Lastly, we must see that the House is conducted with decorum, with a vast improvement in the playing of the issues and not of the man. Until these three suggestions are met, it is my sad prediction that the role of the Federal Parliament will continue to diminish, and that the attitude of the Australian community to members of this Parliament will continue to worsen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People in Australia who live in urban communities such as major metropolitan cities have come to understand that life in an urban environment does involve a number of problems and a number of issues, and the issue that I wish to talk about this afternoon is the question of noise. I represent a seat in urban Brisbane, in the southern suburbs, and my constituents suffer from a number of noise problems, which they have come to understand are part and parcel of living in a major city. We are, unfortunately, besieged on a regular basis by traffic noise from road vehicles, and by railway noise because of movement of freight and passenger trains. Last, but by no means least, a considerable amount of noise is generated by the movement of aircraft, both in landings and in take-offs, and it is this particular element that I wish to address in my remarks today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is in the unenviable position of having an airport within its boundaries, Archerfield airport, a secondary airport in Brisbane which is mainly used for commuter traffic. It is also in the flight path of most of the planes arriving and departing from Brisbane airport. Because of that, the constituents in most of the suburbs of my electorate experience unsatisfactory levels of aircraft noise from time to time. Most of them probably moved in after the establishment of Archerfield airport, so one might say they have no-one to blame but themselves if they are prepared to move into suburbs which come close to Archerfield airport, since it was there first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when they moved into the environs of Archerfield airport, there was a curfew on Archerfield and planes were prevented from departing after 11 p.m. and did not start again until 6 a.m. the next day. That curfew has now been removed and there is heavy traffic in the very early hours of the morning, at about 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. in particular, which is commuter traffic bringing materials and business papers from provincial cities of Queensland through Brisbane to Sydney. The residents of Oxley have suffered, I believe, unnecessary and undue hardship because of the level of aircraft noise that is generated by the fact that Archerfield airport is now an open airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the needs of the business community to have maximum use of that airport and the greater efficiencies that that entails for aviation and for transportation, but it is a problem for the living standards and the quality of life for the residents of my electorate in the suburbs that border Archerfield airport. I think it is an issue that we need to be considering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issue that I wish to talk about this afternoon, however, is air traffic movements from Brisbane airport and a proposal that has been included in the original development plans for Brisbane airport which the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation appear to be still committed to. The new Brisbane airport was opened in 1988. Since that time it has been a major cause of concern to the residents on the south side of Brisbane because, once Brisbane Airport opened, air traffic changed its direction and movements over Brisbane. Prior to the opening in 1988, most of the air traffic moved over Moreton Bay to land at Eagle Farm. Now most of the air traffic movements are over the southern suburbs of Brisbane, so that the residents of my electorate of Moreton and that of my neighbouring colleague, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), have suffered an enormous increase in aircraft noise due to the new airport. When it was first being planned we were told that Brisbane airport would involve most aircraft flying over the bay, but that has not come to pass, mainly because of the orientation of the major runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1991 I made a speech in this House concerning the need for the development of a cross-runway. There is already a cross-runway in the Brisbane airport but it is only a short runway of 1,400 metres and not large enough for large aircraft. Therefore, all of the large aircraft, the major passenger aircraft and particularly the 747s, have to land on the main runway, the 01/19 runway, which entails flying over the southern suburbs of Brisbane. In that speech in September 1991 I made a strong plea for the extension of the existing cross-runway. I repeat that plea today. I believe it is very important that that cross-runway be developed, not just for the alleviation of noise but also to reduce the safety concerns that we have with regard to the existing 01/19 runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with Brisbane airport is that the cross-winds that flow across it create some enormous safety risks from time to time on the 01/19 runway, and we have evidence that such risks have occurred in the past on a number of occasions. The major prevailing wind across Brisbane airport is from the south-east and the aircraft would be better served if they were able to land on the cross-runway rather than on the main runway, because that would be in line with the prevailing wind and would not create enormous cross-wind pressure for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we have seen evidence that CAA and FAC are intent on building a parallel runway to the 01/19 runway. That would increase the noise and safety problems that we suffer with Brisbane airport. I have campaigned strongly, and I will continue to do so, against the construction of a parallel runway, not only because of the impact it will have on my constituents but also because of the risks that it will create for the whole of Brisbane. It is my very firm view that we should be moving as fast as we can to take most of the passenger aircraft movements away from the built-up city area and over Moreton Bay so that there is a reduction in aircraft movements that impact on the built-up area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal by the CAA to construct a parallel runway is something that we need to oppose strenuously. There is already an existing cross-runway that can be extended from 1,400 metres to 2,600 metres at a much lower cost to FAC and CAA than the building of a new parallel runway of 3,200 metres. I have been told by the CAA that a 2,600-metre cross-runway would not be sufficient, and yet I find that the third runway being built at Sydney airport is in fact a runway of 2,600 metres. If a length of 2,600 metres is sufficient to deal with Sydney airport's needs, I can see no reason why a similar runway would not be sufficient for Brisbane's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the demise of the third major carrier, a number of funding opportunities now present themselves to allow the immediate upgrading of the cross-runway in Brisbane. A number of projects scheduled by the CAA for redevelopment of other airports were contingent upon there being a third major domestic carrier. Now that that is not proceeding and the development of a third major carrier in the near future seems unlikely, I believe that there are funds available to enable the cross-runway development to occur at Brisbane airport immediately. That development has importance for reducing noise impacts over the city of Brisbane and for eliminating some safety risks that I think we now have with the major use of the main runway. It would also enable Brisbane airport to cope with the increased usage that it is going to be facing over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current proposal is not to build a new runway for at least another 15 years. I believe that the increase in air traffic movements over Brisbane is going to warrant some expansion in its facilities long before that. We have an ideal opportunity to utilise the savings that have been made available to us because there is not the need now to proceed with the developments proposed to take account of Compass. We can transfer those funds to the development of a new cross-runway and ensure that the people of Brisbane no longer have to suffer the major noise impacts that they do from Brisbane airport. I shall be taking these matters up with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who has been a very understanding and sympathetic Minister who has tried to do what he can to help the people of Brisbane. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some 172,000 expatriate British retirees in Australia who have become permanent residents. The majority of them have made the decision so that they can spend their remaining days in contact with their families. Most were typically in their late 60s when they decided to leave Britain and had directly, or through a breadwinner spouse, paid taxes in the UK and contributed to its national insurance scheme for the duration of their working lives. On average, these tax and insurance contributions have been made over nearly 50 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the 172,000 ex-Brits of whom I speak left Britain at the very ages at which they might reasonably be expected to draw more frequently on the UK health and ancillary services, thereby adding to the usage and the strain on the services. For those people, the costs and strain have become a cost for all Australian taxpayers to bear. The burden is simultaneously lifted from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, as is the duty of care from Westminster, and transported to Australia. Transportation thus takes on a whole new meaning. The people are probably a whole lot more worthy now than in the 18th century, but the costs to us, arguably, are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this situation is unlikely to change while Australia continues to admit Britons under our family reunion program, surely it behoves the British Government to concede benefits that Australia extends to our former citizens now residing in the United Kingdom. It may not be widely known that British pensions are now frozen at the levels payable when the British citizens left the UK. Those pensions are not adjusted for the effects of inflation as are those of people similarly placed who have not emigrated. Australian pensions payable to our former citizens now living in Britain are adjusted on a regular basis for inflation as measured by the consumer price index. It is a double standard about which I grieve today. It is a one-sided arrangement that our Government seems conspicuously unable to remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can assume that the arguments have been conveyed to the bureaucrats and the British Government. Such arguments would no doubt have drawn the attention of the British to the cost benefits of health care and ancillary benefits which will not have to be met because 172,000 people at ages where the demand is higher than for those not yet retired become the responsibility of Australian taxpayers. That will probably never change, but insult is added to injury when Australia is bound to top up British pensions payable in Australia to adjust for inflation. That is what presently happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to Westminster of keeping expatriate pensions in line with inflation would surely be small compared to the costs of providing housing, health and other services required by the aged should those retirees have chosen to remain in Britain. In Australia, those who have full residency status or who are applying for a change to such status receive full Medicare benefits. As well, we have acted not just to top up British pensions to adjust for domestic inflation, we have gone even further and we protect the recipients of British pensions from the effects of fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are thousands of Australian age pensioners living in the United Kingdom to whom we pay full entitlements, including inflation adjustments. While I stand to be corrected on the figure, I understand that there are some 234,000 people living in the UK who are entitled to receive Australian benefits, including age, supporting parents, invalid and other pensions. None are penalised in the manner of British pensioners resident in Australia. On the contrary, all of our expatriates living in Britain are paid the same benefits as their equivalents who have remained in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">British expatriate retirees residing in Australia do not receive the same consideration from the British Government. Age pensions, as I have already pointed out, are frozen at levels applicable to the day they leave England's shores. We Australian taxpayers are left to pick up the tab for the effects of inflation. We continue to protect British retirees against fluctuations in the exchange rates. Our fairness, however, is not reciprocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, of course, continue to meet the expense of health care for British residents of an age where they will need to call increasingly on such care, without reciprocity. We will continue to make it easier for these people whose benefits are paid under the British national insurance scheme and ensure that they are able to calculate tax deductions, again without reciprocity. If UK pensioners are unable to obtain the total amount of contributions paid in the UK, as an alternative the Australian Taxation Office will accept a figure of eight per cent of their pension income as the undeducted purchase price after it has been converted into Australian dollars. It is also possible for those who have not already claimed a deduction to have this backdated for three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that background, it is bordering on reprehensible that our Government has been unable to secure redress of the inequities being visited upon Australian taxpayers, and for far too long. Perhaps even this administration can now be moved into action. As luck would have it, the opportunity presents itself to tackle the issue with some vigour. The British member for Davyhulme, Mr Winston Churchill, has introduced into the House of Commons what is known at Westminster as Early Day Motion No. 915. If passed by that Parliament, the remedies I seek can be achieved. It has the support, I understand, of other British MPs but not necessarily of a majority. It is therefore both timely and imperative that the Government actively and energetically support the measure through its agencies in London. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it cannot be too hard to convince the Brits of their debt of reasonableness towards those of their former taxpayers who were for many years valuable contributing members of their communities in that country. They are presently penalised because they merely wish to spend their remaining years in Australia near to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Government to get off its backside and take advantage of what is a unique opportunity and above all take the appropriate action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I were members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, chaired by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), in the last Parliament. That committee brought to light a lack of information to people and the threat of a widening gap between the information rich and the information poor as we go into the next century, if we do not take action now to ensure that people have proper access to information. It is also clear that people do not have proper access to services. George Bernard Shaw wrote in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Doctor's Dilemma</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main object of the professions is to keep the laity uninformed.</PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes I wonder whether the main object of government is to keep taxes at a minimum. A lot of people would laugh and dispute that assertion but, when we see some of the problems that people bring into an electorate office, we wonder whether the object of government is rather to keep taxes at a minimum than to provide taxes to help people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first matter, the professions keeping the laity uninformed, on which I quoted George Bernard Shaw, it was interesting when I first started in my old profession of pharmacy in 1951-52 how doctors would very rarely tell patients what was wrong with them. I can recall one patient dying of arsenic poisoning. She was not told why she was taking arsenic in a particular tonic over many years. The pharmacist did not tell her or give any warning on the label, and when she died her husband said, `No-one told me she should not be taking this tonic all of those years. It did not have on the label that there was arsenic in the tonic and she just kept on getting repeats'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that pharmacists are regarded in any public survey as the most popular of professions. Suddenly I am a different person&mdash;I come into politics and we are right down with used car salesmen and people like that. I think I am the same person, but apparently I am a very different person. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HJ4">Mr SNOW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wrong party; right. But I argued right through my professional life about the need to give people the proper information. Even today one can get a prescription from a doctor, go into a pharmacy and not get the proper warnings about side effects and incompatibilities. However the pharmacists have improved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the pharmacy which we had before I came into Parliament in 1983 and which we sold in 1985 we certainly handed out warnings and statements, but  I still cannot persuade all my former colleagues to make sure that people see all that they need to see. One will get a small item, for instance eye drops, where the pharmacist's label that states how they are used covers warnings such as `Keep below 4 degrees' or `Do not take this prescription with certain foods'. Some cannot be taken, for instance, with cheese and that sort of thing. So important information is covered up. I received a prescription only the other day on which important information was covered up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is progress, because the pharmacist asked  whether I had been given information from the doctor about the item, and I was able to say yes. But I believe it is important that pharmacists come to a system, maybe using a tag rather than a label, which assists people by ensuring that information that is directly on the container is not covered up. It should automatically state in detail what it is for and how it is best taken. With the computerised system one can now get programs which give full details of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of access to services often results from a lack of information that is given. People come into our offices who have had problems getting access to legal aid. How often that happens. The lack of access is not only due to the lack of information about where and how to get it but the access itself is often a problem. There are requirements for legal aid which, I believe, are far too strict. For instance, there is a very low financial threshold. If an inquirer has assets which are not very great or a certain amount of income which is not very great, legal aid is not accessible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal aid will often not take cases which are not regarded as winnable. I have spoken already in this Parliament about Mr Fred Saw of Merimbula, who wanted to go to the High Court because he disputed the decision of a judge. The legal aid people said that his case was not winnable, so he has gone on for years trying to get justice on that particular matter. I am not passing judgment on the decision of a judge but I do say that there ought to be better access so that he can get some lengthy legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criterion is that there are strict guidelines that have to be adhered to. I recall a lady coming to see me just two or three weeks ago. After slipping on a floor in a club she decided she wanted to take action against that club for the accident. She met the income and the probability of winning requirements but she was told that she did not meet the strict guidelines that apply. If she had put her foot out and tripped someone else up and an action had been taken against her, she would probably meet the guidelines and be able to obtain legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also many cases where lawyers do not explain to people what they are doing. Legal aid is given but it is received the day before the court hearing; people are thrust into the court and come away saying that their lawyers did not really mention everything that had been told to them. They ask why such and such was not said. Often the lawyers have their reasons but, again, the profession does not always explain to people the reasons for doing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unexplainable to me why, for instance, our colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) did not have things properly explained to him when he stood. He was a schoolteacher, but he was not in active employment at the time. The High Court&mdash;which has shown itself to be very flexible in a lot of cases in recent years&mdash;showed a lack of flexibility. That is my personal opinion; I may be treading close to abusing my privilege, so I will restrict my comments on that matter. The electorate of Wills was deprived of a member for far too long. When the honourable member for Wills stood again, he was re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happened similarly, I believe, with an elector in Queanbeyan&mdash;Alderman John Wright&mdash;who stood for the Queanbeyan City Council. It was not explained to him what would happen and he did not tell his department. No-one ever told him what would happen when he became a member of council. Suddenly, one day he was told that he had taken employment without informing the department. No amount of argument could diminish the tedium of the responses we had on that issue. Apparently, within the meaning of some Act, voluntary service as a member of a local council is officially regarded as employment, and no-one can find out why. In other words, the law is not just an ass; it is an ass covered with a blanket. The council just insists on calling voluntary work, as a member of local government, employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The blanket of secrecy must be lifted. Patients should be told as much as possible about their ailment and about treatment. Citizens' respect for the law must be raised through more frankness and flexibility. I believe that vigilance by legislators and administrators must reduce the use of the technical requirements, which are often used in the professions to avoid frankness, responsibility and comprehension of the real problems of people who come and deal with them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VH4">Mr McARTHUR</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Corangamite)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.07 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pioneering spirit is alive and well in western Victoria and, in particular, in Corangamite. I refer to the innovative and exciting new proposals to privatise the Melbourne-Geelong-Warrnambool railway line. I congratulate the Kennett Government and, in particular, Minister Alan Brown on taking this initiative and awarding the contract to West Coast Rail to conduct this railway line for the next seven years. This is a major policy change. A State government has handed the railway system, or a part thereof, over to private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grieve on behalf of all the people of Victoria who today, I understand, are subject to $70 billion worth of debt, if the audit committee's report is correct. In that context, the Kennett Government had no alternative but to look at arrangements with the Warrnambool rail line. The option that was facing it was to close that particular line. It was losing $5 million a year, under its current arrangements. The Government decided to put out for contract the conveyance of the people from Geelong to Warrnambool, either by road or rail or a combination of both. Having put that out to contract, the Minister, in his wisdom, and the Government last Friday decided to give the contract to the West Coast Rail consortium so that this rail line will be operated privately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an exciting and innovative approach. The privatisation of sections of Victorian railways, within the railway network, will now provide real competition and a quality of service to railway users. This could be a landmark policy decision for all Australian railway users, because we have this concept of government owning the railway line and subcontracting the railway line to the private sector operators. The Government, in this particular instance, has undertaken to maintain the track for its own freight operations and, of course, will be charging the private operators a maintenance fee to keep the track in good working order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to the other well-known private rail operation, which is in the Pilbara region. In 1965, 111 kilometres of rail were set down from Port Hedland to Goldsworthy, and it was able to transport the iron ore from that inland mining town to the coast, where great tonnages of ore were transported under a private sector operation. As I understand it, it is profitable, effective and very efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Warrnambool line tender&mdash;which the Government was out to save $5 million on&mdash;now means that this service will be kept going. There was a lot of local political activity in Colac, Warrnambool, Camperdown and Geelong to maintain this particular rail service. Not only will the service be maintained, it will be maintained in the long term, and it will also make a profit for the group. As I said, that will mean that the railway line will be maintained to retain the freight traffic in this area. How will all of this work, in an environment where EPAC has estimated that the Victorian public transport system is losing $884 million per year with urban commuters, country rail travel trains and trams? EPAC has estimated that the Victorian public transport system is the biggest money loser of all State corporations throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very exciting change taking place. We have a fundamental change of attitude and in the methods of operation and the numbers of people employed. West Coast Rail will now have a new approach towards customers: it will be seeking customers and looking after the passengers. It will be thinking about new services. It will be innovative in the way in which it introduces catering arrangements on those trains, in the hope that passengers will enjoy a better standard of catering and so will be attracted to travel by train. The 265-kilometre trip from Warrnambool to Melbourne will be serviced three times a day, five days a week, both ways. It is a very good service and provides excellent service to all of those people who wish to travel at various times of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concession card holders will receive benefits similar to those they now enjoy, and the Government will reimburse the private sector operators for those particular persons. The West Coast Rail operation will incorporate modern management in its accounting systems, ticket sales operations, cost control and capital reinvestment programs. What is more important, it will integrate with the current V/line systems. Plans are now in place to make sure that that takes place, and  that passengers will be able to buy tickets that will integrate with the rest of the Victorian system. It will, of course, provide a much more flexible system than is currently available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, V/line, on this particular operation, has 69 persons involved in running the system. The West Coast Rail operation is indicating that it will run the system with 15 people. That is a dramatic change in the numbers of people involved. It will have a private sector ethic in providing the service, in getting on with the job and working hard to make sure that its particular enterprise keeps going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">West Coast Rail will purchase the rolling stock at competitive prices from V/line. In a rail system that is contracting out there is a fair amount of rolling stock, both in terms of locomotives and rail carriages available, and that will be purchased at very competitive prices. Of course they will continue to ensure that this rolling stock is maintained under V/line guidelines, so the safety factor will be maintained. The 265-kilometre journey encompasses the population centres of Warrnambool, Camperdown, Colac, Geelong and Melbourne. It is very appropriate that those areas be serviced by train, and it does lead to making this particular operation very successful, as compared with more sparsely populated country areas. If we compare the figures for rail travel with those for car travel, an economy rail ticket from Warrnambool to Melbourne costs in the vicinity of $88 and that compares with RACV figures of $260 for travel by one motor car. That is not to mention the stress and strain of travelling down the Princes Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be associated with those people in the West Coast consortium. They bring a depth of experience because of their running of the Geelong Steam Preservation Society: they run that tourist railway efficiently and very effectively, keeping on schedule and providing a very good service to the tourist and the public. The group consists of Mr Don Gibson, a lawyer who has been associated with a number of public transport operations; Mr Garry McDonald, a banker who will bring a sharp eye to the financial matters and who is a great railway enthusiast; and the third member of the consortium, Mr Michael Menzies, whose full-time occupation is a senior job on V/line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key feature about the people in the consortium is that they can actually drive the trains themselves. They have hands-on experience with railway operations and they will bring that expertise to the arrangements. They understand train maintenance, passenger aspirations, rail tracks, locomotives and all the things that passengers are interested in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a first in Australia. We will have newer trains in the region, improved customer services, better trained staff and world best practices. I am sure honourable members of this House wish the consortium well in this new, exciting venture. It will lead the way to a new era of train travel in Victoria. This operation will give an opportunity for other State governments throughout the Commonwealth to follow this lead in privatising some of their rail tracks to provide a better, more profitable and long lasting service for Australian rail travellers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my re-election, I would like to thank a number of people. Firstly, I thank Peter Baxter, an old mate, who was my campaign director and ran a very good campaign, together with the executive of my FEC. I also thank Tom Kenny and Steve Farry, together with all the branch campaign directors, and Alderman Michael Sommerton, Jim Metcher, Peter Van Der Ryden, Bruce Rowling, Peter Clapham, Alderman Wayne Forno, Steve Hutchins, Brian King, Siri de Silva, Malcolm Douglas and Danny Mackin. It is true to say that we have never worked harder or more effectively in a campaign. </PARA>

I also thank those who generously donated to my campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly of all, I thank the good voters of the electorate of Chifley who supported me in increasing numbers on this occasion, notwithstanding that there were more candidates in the field and that, of course, the Liberal Party of Australia ran its favourite stooge, independent candidate Alderman Joe Bryant. I report to the House that the primary vote went up by about 8.8 per cent, and the two-party preferred vote went up by about 2.6 per cent. I pledge to the people of the electorate of Chifley that I will be doing my favourite thing, and that is working tirelessly on their behalf, hoping never to betray the trust, confidence, encouragement and support that they have so generously given me in my time as the member for Chifley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want, in particular, to report on a major event in my electorate this week. I was very pleased to open the Luxford Food Court. It was a $10 million project that took six months to complete. I congratulate the two partners in this development. Peter Campbell, from Clarendon Homes, was born in North St Marys in my electorate. He is a very successful builder who operates and is based in Penrith. The other partner is Frank Galea, who was also born in my electorate, in Rooty Hill, which is not too far from where I live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that following the crash in property values developers now have a tarnished reputation. I pay tribute to the vision of Frank and Peter. They had the ability to conceptualise just what this Luxford Food Court plaza would do for retailing in Mount Druitt. It took quite a bit of determination given that all the major banks had knocked them back. It was only Challenge Bank in Western Australia that could see the potential and share the vision that they had, and I commend Challenge Bank for that. I suppose that the major banks have been so bruised that they are not able any more to see the potential of projects like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Luxford Food Court is going to cause Mount Druitt to provide the best shopping for people in the western suburbs of Sydney. I would certainly encourage as many as possible to try it. We have three main retailers. There is my old friend John Velcich with his largest chicken place at Luxford Court. Duffy Brothers, who are well known fruit and vegetable people in the western suburbs of Sydney, have their largest shop there. And Jewel food court has established a unique shop, the largest of their shops&mdash;the first of the Super-J stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Super-J stores are going to usher in a revolution in retailing because whilst we think of Jewel food stores as providing the keenest food prices, and they are certainly doing that, they have also gone into retailing a variety of things that they have not done before. That includes electrical goods, clothing, you name it. Whatever you want can be found at a Jewel Super-J store.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see how it goes. I believe it will be very successful and I certainly wish Jim Fleming, the Managing Director of Jewel, every success with this venture. I predict that we will see quite a number of Super-J Jewel stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are going to be a lot of shoppers owing quite a lot to a dedicated small band of retailers. As I said, try Luxford Court. One thing I can guarantee shoppers in the western suburbs of Sydney is that Mount Druitt is now the hottest shopping spot at the moment and will be for some time because of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a successful $10 million project constructed in six months from go to whoa takes the cooperation of a lot of people. I would like to acknowledge the role of the local council led by Alderman Jim Anderson who goes out of his way to welcome these sorts of developments and ensures that they do not meet any council problems. There is also the builder, Beach Constructions, and all the workers who worked on the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one of the nicest things I saw at the opening was the presence of Paul Galea, Frank's dad. If Mr Jennings was a proud old builder then I have to say that Paul Galea was a proud old dad. Of course, Frank's wife was there, Sylvia, and also Zoe. We have named one of the streets Zoe Place and I urge the council to keep it as pristinely clean throughout its life as it was during its opening. I am sure Zoe is going to take a great deal of interest in that. To all who were associated with it, I wish them every success. They certainly deserve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that is left to me I would like to raise another matter that occurred during the election. I think a totally irresponsible approach was taken by the New South Wales environment Minister, Chris Hartcher. In a deliberately political and partisan way he set about scoring election points by suggesting that people living around the ADI site would be at risk due to radiation. As a Federal member for eight years, one of my keenest desires has been to see that radioactive waste removed and I regret that as Parliamentary Secretary I was not able to because of matters outside my control. Those matters were more to do with the then Minister for Science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising these reports, which were reproduced on Channel 7 and in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the local papers, he unnecessarily worried residents whose houses surround the ADI site. We are going to redevelop the 1,500 hectares into a combination of passive recreation, housing and industrial areas. He suggested that people who proposed to move into the redeveloped ADI site would somehow be placing themselves at risk. He ordered his EPA officials to investigate it. Of course, anyone could have told us that the investigation was going to get a nil result and say that there was no problem. Indeed, that has been the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think what I object to most, apart from his having raised the matter in such a cavalier way, is that the Minister failed to release the report publicly. He certainly sent a copy to the Department of Defence. But, having made such a splash and so many headlines, I think it is really outrageous that he did not make an equal effort to ensure that people were fully informed that there was no danger. There is no danger. I find his actions completely reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental issues are important. I think that Ministers for the environment have a duty to pursue their concerns and interests responsibly, not irresponsibly. Mr Hartcher has done himself and the New South Wales Government a great disservice by entering this debate in such a partisan, political and biased way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I want to mention first in this grievance debate is the need for increased television and radio coverage for the north coast of New South Wales and in particular for the mid-north coast. I speak particularly of the provision of SBS television services, the ultimate extension of Triple J youth radio to the north coast, 2EA services, ethnic radio, and ultimately commercial FM. While I am putting in a wish list, I will say that we should have regional ABC on FM as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted in the election campaign that the Richmond electorate was promised SBS services by the end of 1994. Regrettably, the public perception up and down the whole of the north coast of New South Wales is that the Government is now engaging in a form of very specific pork-barrelling. That is not doing the Government any good at all because most people are very concerned about this. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose one could call it that. There have been claims that the mid-north coast is a substantial area. Of 5,000 petition signatures presented to this Parliament last year, 1,500 came from the electorate of Cowper alone, and I will be presenting nearly another 800 next Thursday. I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has a lot on his mind at the moment with pay TV, but people in my electorate are concerned with the basic provision of SBS. I am told that the Minister has nearly 1,500 letters sitting on his desk, waiting for an answer. I think it is fair enough to ask the Minister when he will answer and why he is insulting the people of the north coast of New South Wales by not deigning to answer their letters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in the area that a transmitter from Mount Moombil, near Coffs Harbour, would cover, there would be at least 150,000 people. The number is more likely 200,000, but we will be conservative and say 150,000. The capital cost is $1 1/2 million. I know that that is a lot of money, but we can compare it with what we are spending elsewhere&mdash;and this is the provision of a service that is vital for people of ethnic diversity. That $1 1/2 million to get that service established is only $15 per head. The recurrent cost is $250,000, or only about $2.50 per person per year. I believe that the Government has been totally insensitive and has left itself wide open to attack when it appears to be going to extend SBS only to Government-held seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to tell the House that, of the 150,000 people we are talking about, 10 per cent come from 14 major ethnic groups. In Coffs Harbour alone 5,000 people from a non-English speaking background, from 53 separate countries, have been identified in the last two years. So, if the Government is fair dinkum, is concerned about a multicultural Australia and is concerned that people outside the capital cities get the services they need, it should take immediate action to start introducing SBS to the north coast of New South Wales&mdash;and not just to the Labor-held seats; let us be a little fair about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about a matter relating to tax file numbers. I was told recently about a teenager who secured a job&mdash;one of the lucky ones of the one million unemployed&mdash;working on a banana plantation and, to do the right thing, he had to submit his tax file number. The law allows him 28 days in which to submit that number and if it is not submitted within that time there are pretty heavy penalties. I make the point here that the law should apply both ways, not only to the taxpayer but also to the Taxation Office. The young man did not get his tax file number for six weeks, and that put him under a fair bit of strain because he was fair dinkum and did not want to attract any fines for not providing the employer with a tax file number. I suppose it is not a major issue, it is not earth shattering, but I believe it is very important indeed. There should be one law for all in Australia, for all individuals and for all organisations, and that includes the tax man as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I raise concerns the community of veterans of Australia. I have had a great many letters in recent weeks from veterans who are really fearful about the implications of the Auditor-General's recent report on the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I say quite clearly to this House that I have no hesitation in saying that men and women who have served this country in time of war and who have risked their lives should not be worried by recurrent sniping at their rights. Every now and again such sniping sticks its head up, and every now and again we have to knock it back into the ground because it is not appropriate that men and women who have risked their lives for this country and who have suffered injury and ill health should continually be worried by the threat of having their rights taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) that he should reassure the community of veterans that the rights of veterans will not be taken away as a result of the Auditor-General's report on the department. It is not right that they should be worried by this and the Minister should make that very clear. I state very specifically at this point that the coalition would never take action to reduce the rights of veterans who are receiving pensions. Those pensions are payments&mdash;in many cases they are compensation&mdash;and they are sacrosanct as far as we are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also sacrosanct is the matter of retrospectivity. I believe the Minister should immediately reassure veterans that there will be no retrospectivity in any changes that the Government might come up with. The price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and honourable members on this side of the House will continue to be vigilant to protect the rights of veterans who have served this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter I raise relates to Sporobolus africanus, that is, giant Parramatta grass. I see some honourable members in the chamber who come from country and rural areas who will know what I am talking about; there are others from Melbourne and Sydney who may not have a clue. But I need to tell the House, in particular those honourable members who have never seen giant Parramatta grass in their lives&mdash;if this is the first time they have heard of it, it will not be the last&mdash;that it is a weed which is invading the pasture and farmlands of Australia. Quite frankly, it poses an incredible threat. Unless we take efficient and prompt action to provide the adequate research necessary, it will have a devastating impact equal to any occurrence of foot and mouth disease in our livestock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sounds fairly dramatic, I know, but I believe this is the case. It is already spreading all over the north coast of New South Wales, and it is not stopping at any borders. It is going further all the time. It is out of control. I must say that some money is being spent on control. In 1991-92 New South Wales local government authorities spent $244,000, and a further $50,000 was granted by the noxious plants advisory committee for a special giant Parramatta grass awareness campaign. I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we do not have to make the farmers on the north coast aware of it. They are aware of it. What we have got to do is to have adequate research to work out some biological way of beating it. I commend the New South Wales Government, which has provided additional funding for a coordinator. That will supplement the work being done at the University of New England and the Queensland University which is being funded by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the Australian Meat Research Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this particular weed, which is invading pasture and other farmlands, will be the AIDS of Australian agriculture. I say to the Government, and I say to the Minister, that we need to get funding immediately for a massive research program to beat giant Parramatta grass before it destroys Australian agriculture. Heaven knows, Australian farmers are in enough trouble already, with the drought and reduced prices and world commodity situations. This weed must not be allowed to continue right over Australia. It probably will not get into Western Australia because the desert will stop it, but it is carried by vehicles, by wallabies and by other animals. It must be stopped. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise in the grievance debate today is a very serious one. It concerns the actions of the Kennett Government in Victoria with respect to programs which are of relevance and importance to the Commonwealth Parliament. I raised this matter a couple of weeks ago in a letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I want to refer, as a Victorian MP and as the member for Calwell, to one of the areas which were most viciously hit in the previous round of cuts by the Kennett Government. I am extremely concerned that these next cuts are going to impact in a very unfair way&mdash;in the way in which the previous round did. In fact, when cuts are made in the way in which these were made, the situation is so grave that it threatens to undermine the social justice strategy of the national Government for the nation, particularly for the State of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising this matter I do not wish to take away from a government the right to cut expenditure. That is not the issue. The issue, however, is this: the cutting of expenditure which directly relates to programs for which the Commonwealth has part responsibility must be a matter which is worked out in consultation with the Commonwealth. This has not happened in the case of the Victorian cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, the Liberal Government in Victoria has been faced with a difficult financial situation, but it is possible to deal with that financial situation in a fair way. The Kennett Government is not dealing with it in a fair way. It is not sharing the cuts across the board. In fact, it is attacking the key areas of education, health and welfare. Especially in the area of health there has been a massive cut, which is of great concern to me and to the Ministers responsible for this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if a government is going to try to get the support of the community for a cutting exercise of the kind which Mr Kennett has been involved in, it is important to try to share the burden. That has not happened. There has been great iniquity in the way in which Mr Kennett has proceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been great iniquity in the way in which the cuts have been made and no sense of social justice whatever has been shown by Mr Kennett. I cannot imagine anyone with less sense of social justice and social concern than Mr Kennett, from the way in which he has proceeded in this matter. Let me give an example: $381 million cut from health. The biggest cut is from health. As I said in my letter to the Prime Minister, when I expressed my concern about this, that means that the staffing levels in health are expected to be reduced by 24 per cent or 4,000 jobs. That is the equivalent of closing both the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital. That is how big it is. If they are not closed, many other hospitals and community centres will most likely be closed&mdash;as a consequence of the activities of the Kennett Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is such a thing as consultation and negotiation, especially where programs are being funded jointly by the State and the Federal governments. That has not happened in this case. The situation is even worse: the people of Victoria have not even been told the specifics of this program. The Ministers of the Kennett Government could not even be bothered doing the hard work of working out what programs they were going to cut before they made the announcements. They have simply announced in the area of health, for example, $381 million; in the area of education, more than $100 million; and so forth, without announcing where the cuts are going to impact. That is completely the reverse of the process of fiscal responsibility used by the Commonwealth Government, where we always announce the specific programs. We do not announce a big cut in a certain area and say nothing of the programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened as a consequence is that no-one working in the State sector in Victoria, especially in these areas of health, education and welfare, knows whether he is still going to be employed. It is several weeks since the Government of Victoria made its announcement yet we still have not had the specifics. Is this the way to run a State? It certainly is not. It shows an inhuman disregard for the Public Service in the State of Victoria when all the public servants are worried about what is going to happen in terms of their future. That Government has not even bothered to say to people, `These are the areas in which we think we are going to make the specific cuts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is Mr Kennett's response to these sorts of criticisms? His response is that he is trying to get the State of Victoria and the economy moving again. His idea of getting Victoria moving again is to sack 32,000 people in six months. That is his idea&mdash;32,000 people, with no regard for where savings may be made in other areas. He comes in just in the human areas, in the areas of concentration of labour, where people are needed for human services, and he cuts massively in those areas&mdash;32,000 people. Then he has the impertinence to suggest that somehow the private economy is going to grow so quickly in Victoria as to take up 32,000 jobs. A calculation of the sort of thing that would be required to create 32,000 jobs shows that, in terms of the normal size of private enterprises nowadays, we would need to create more than 2,000 enterprises to take up all those people in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the man who says that he wants an economic recovery in Victoria. The first thing he does is to say, `We have got an economic problem. Let's not try and work out the way to handle this in a sophisticated fashion. Let's come out and slash and burn and cut 32,000 jobs'. That is 32,000 people, with families, that have lost their jobs in Victoria as a result of Mr Kennett's actions. We have a diminished number of Federal Government members from Victoria; one of the reasons is that in the recent election a lot of people in Victoria voted against Mr Kennett's actions. I can assure you that if he continues in this way there will not be too many Victorian Liberal members left. The reality is that this sort of exercise, this sort of government behaviour, in terms of cutting and slashing, is unacceptable. </PARA>

This program is known as Operation Flinders and the program is designed simply to allow young offenders an opportunity for some form of rehabilitation other than the rehabilitation that we normally associate with prisons and the penal system. Under this program, the South Australian Police, community groups in my area, led by Miss Kay Harrison, and Aboriginal groups have been getting together to form Operation Flinders and allow young people an opportunity to spend some time camping in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, largely supervised by volunteers. The reason I bring this to the attention of the Federal Parliament is that what has been unique about the program has been the involvement of the Australian Army. It has been the Australian Army's preparedness to make tents and facilities available that has made this program such a success.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refute some comments made in my electorate yesterday, in the city of Orange, by the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Bruce Baird. In making a number of comments about the future of the western rail line in New South Wales, he somehow made a linkage between the future of the western rail line and actions by the Commonwealth Government. It should not be forgotten that the western line in New South Wales is owned and operated by the Government of New South Wales through the State Rail Authority of New South Wales. I remain committed as a Federal member to the importance of this line because, if in fact this is to be part of the National Rail Corporation into the future, clearly any freight that transits between Sydney and Perth and return has a 400-kilometre shorter journey than through Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, once the standard gauge link is completed. Naturally, as a committed advocate of rail in this country, like a number of members in this House, I am very keen to see the standard gauge link between Melbourne and Adelaide, but I do not necessarily see a nexus between the completion of that line and the insecurity of the western rail line. My view is that the New South Wales Government continues to make excuses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question; he obviously has a keen interest in the fortunes of this important industry. As honourable members may be aware, yesterday I tabled the yearly report of the Automotive Industry Authority. That is sobering reading but reading that we all should be very proud of, at least on this side of the House where we have indicated our support for the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most important part of that report relates to that finding by this independent agency that Australian automobile quality is now equal to or better than many imported Japanese cars. I am almost tempted to repeat it but time does not permit me. But that is a very sobering message and one which we all ought to be very proud of, and certainly the industry ought to be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in the report were acknowledgments of very significant increases in productivity, a significant drop in industrial disputation and a growth in exports now to $1.247 billion, that being a rise of well in excess of 200 per cent since 1984. Contrary to urban myth, our cars are now priced similarly to those on sale in the United States and are cheaper than those obtained in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the investment outlook, the industry confidently projects investment in the order of $2 billion during the next three years, a rise again of 19 per cent. The key parts of these investment proposals are those by Toyota and Mitsubishi. I have been acquainted with both companies over the past few weeks and both have indicated in quite compelling terms that the underlying rationale for this very massive level of proposed investment is the change in workplace and managerial culture that has led to the achievement of world's best practice across a whole range of this industry's endeavours.</PARA>

Is it also a fact that, as our growth rate approaches just 2 1/2 per cent, our balance of payments deficit is already blowing out? Does the Government now accept that we are in the pincer predicted by the Prime Minister in his banana republic comments in 1986, that Australia cannot reduce unemployment without causing a balance of payments crisis and cannot solve a balance of payments crisis without increasing unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess the most notorious point in the honourable member's question is that finally the Opposition has acknowledged that the Australian economy is growing. We have spent the last several years with the Opposition continually telling us that we are in recession and, when it was clear we were emerging from recession, month after month the Leader of the Opposition and his former shadow Treasurer said that they were expecting a double dip recession. They continued to say throughout the entire campaign that Australia was in recession, still in recession and unlikely to come out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have the great conversion of the Opposition, as evidenced by the honourable member for Mayo, who now acknowledges that Australia is growing at 2 1/2 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one looks at the three-month average of the monthly current account deficit, one finds that it is $1.2 billion which is, of course, well on track for the $15 billion current account deficit estimated at the time of the Budget and, I suspect, somewhat below the revised forecast which was included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> just prior to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the point here is that the Opposition should be careful about latching on to one month's statistics. Even Mr Spicer said that you should be cautious about embracing one month's figures as indicative of a trend. At least on that, if on practically nothing else, Mr Spicer has it right. I think the Opposition would be well advised to consider these matters in terms of the last three months and bear in mind that the Government did have a Budget forecast for $15 billion which was revised upwards before the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole question does raise issues about how Australia is going to manage the recovery. This is going to be a very different kind of recovery for Australia because it is going to be one in which we can look forward to a period of low inflation. What we are now faced with is the challenge of a long run of sustainable, low inflationary growth; and that raises new challenges for Australia, particularly in terms of maintaining our competitiveness. The points that the Prime Minister has made in relation to wages policy are an important part of that, and the points that I have made about improving Australia's saving performance are also a crucial part of managing that future growth for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, of course, the Opposition is in a state of total shambles: it has no policy about anything. If you take something as crucial as tariff policy, you find the Leader of the Opposition still waving Captain Zero's flag of zero tariffs by the turn of the century. Yet you have the Leader of the National Party and the shadow Treasurer now saying that that is all rubbish and that that ought to be abandoned; in other words, you have the shadow Treasurer turning on its head one of the crucial elements of how Australia should proceed through the 1990s and beyond. What he wants to do is reverse the trend towards Australia becoming more competitive, and simply turn his back on the world and start the process of lifting tariffs again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me welcome to Question Time the honourable member for Lowe in her maiden question in this House. It follows a very good maiden speech delivered by her earlier today. She is well and truly off and running as a parliamentarian and that is a good thing for this country and for us all, particularly as, clearly, she has decided to identify herself with some of the most significant issues confronting this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has, on a number of occasions in public and in this House, mentioned a decision by the Government to make a specific study of those who are unemployed and concentrate upon those who are long-term unemployed. On the last set of figures, for March 1993, there were some 370,000 long-term unemployed amongst the total number of unemployed. They are rising as a percentage of the total number of unemployed and my Department's estimates would be that the figure will rise over the next year or so well above the 400,000 mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to find a situation in this country which is now being experienced commonly throughout the Western world. After a period of recession there is an almost intractable problem of a large group of individuals in society who are finding it virtually impossible to get back into the work force. Even though we would expect over this period of time a reduction in the total levels of unemployment, that reduction would not of itself cause those figures on long-term unemployment to fall. This is a problem that is not unique to this country. It is a problem that is being experienced throughout the Western world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have in place a series of labour market programs which are making some difference to this. Some 490,000 job seekers were assisted by those labour market programs last year. In defence of those programs, of those long-term unemployed who actually found work in the work force over the last 12 months, some 80 per cent had been through those labour market programs to which I referred. They are absolutely vital in providing opportunities for long-term unemployed people to get back into the work force. Clearly, they are very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite one of those programs as an example. The jobstart program which saw 57 per cent of its participants remain in unsubsidised employment after their jobstart subsidy had ended. Of the long-term unemployed group&mdash;the program does not apply just to the long-term unemployed&mdash;some 50 per cent had maintained themselves in employment beyond the subsidy period. On top of that, another 3 per cent or so went into unsubsidised education and training. So that of itself has been a very successful program. I could cite other programs of equal success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are viewing this situation firstly in the context of the short-term requirements to devise appropriate strategies for the current Budget, and there is an interministerial office group looking at that at the moment. We are also examining the problem on a medium-term basis. We have recently appointed Dr Chapman, of the ANU, to undertake a study and we will provide opportunities for community input to that study in the Government's consideration of its outcome. His job will be to define the nature of the problem of high levels of long-term unemployed; to identify and analyse relevant issues; and to develop a set of options for reducing the level of long-term unemployed for government consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these studies, there will be obviously a great deal of speculation from time to time. Some of that will be engaged in by Ministers. It is not a process that simply will be confined to my Department. It is a process that will involve a whole series of departments of government and it is an opportunity for a great deal of community thought to go into this and for the community to express views on it. This is not a problem that is going to be readily solved. It will be a problem still with us well beyond employment issues being salient in political debate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is reasonable to assume that, as unemployment numbers clearly start to fall, so will public interest in unemployment. It is the nature of the thing. Where that has happened elsewhere this group of people have remained intractable, with all the consequent effects of poverty and poverty for their children in the community and it is that problem which we are morally and practically committed to deal with.</PARA>

We have seen the need to deliver constructive assistance to the rural sector on the basis of those areas affected by circumstances over which they have no control. They are the areas affected by drought&mdash;in some cases, drought that has now lasted for three years&mdash;and by the fall in the wool price. The fall in the wool price was due to a world recession that was not predicted on either side of this House, coupled with the Russians being out of the market and the pressure that has been put on the stockpile&mdash;a stockpile that was created because the farm leadership believed it could rig a price that the rest of the world was not prepared to pay, thereby guaranteeing security for their membership.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I know the keen interest he has taken in the wool-growing industry, particularly as he represents some of the best wool-growing country in this nation. Yesterday I outlined the package of assistance that this Government developed for the wool industry, but I made the point that, if we were to get maximum assistance to the farm sector, it required the States to match their obligations as agreed to last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I reported the fact that I was concerned that the Victorian Government was not prepared to match that assistance. I am pleased to say that, late yesterday, it appeared to have come to the party. There is still some difficulty with what it says is needed. The Victorian Government says that it is only $4 million; we say that it is $6.6 million. But the Victorian primary industries Minister has told me that his Government will meet fully its obligations. I will pursue that to the extent that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Gwydir, who asked me the previous question, was also keen to encourage the States to come to the party in their matching obligations, and in a media release on 28 April, after having welcomed the wool package, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge the state governments to allocate their matching finance and implement these interest subsidies immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, those on the other side representing the National Party do not seem to have too much influence with their colleagues in New South Wales, because yesterday Ian Armstrong, the Minister for Agriculture, said that the extent of their assistance would only be to provide for interest subsidies up to 80 per cent, not the 100 per cent that we have said that we are prepared to support.</PARA>

This Government has delivered constructively in terms of wool and drought, but those opposite and their colleagues have consistently failed to do it. Yesterday I had cause to mention the fact that the Kennett Government in Victoria, in its approach to the rural sector which is going through one of the worst crises in living memory, has actually cut expenditure to the rural sector by 10 per cent. Today we report the fact that it is the New South Wales Government that is short-changing farmers.

I am advised by the department that that process could not have been undertaken unless&mdash;no, sorry&mdash;let me correct that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General.

What are the Government's intentions in this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen criticisms of the Government's proposal from the Leader of the Opposition, other opposition spokesmen, and I think also from some sections of the Law Council of Australia. I do not believe that the criticisms being levelled by the Leader of the Opposition have any basis at all. They seem to be on the premise that we are somehow moving away from a merit based system in terms of the appointment of the judiciary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that any proposal which the Government is considering has, as its fundamental, the basis that all appointments to the judiciary must be on the best person for the job, on the basis of excellence. That is the basis of any proposal we will be looking at. It is also, of course, a matter of fact that, if we look at the make-up of benches throughout Australia, there are very few women serving and very few Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe anyone in this House would suggest that there are not outstanding excellence and talent on behalf of Australian women or those Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds. The proposal that we are looking at is whether there should be a broadening of the pool from which appointments are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the process generally involves drawing judges from senior ranks of the bar in each of the States. It is also true to say that there is excellence in the ranks of solicitors, in the ranks of academia, and indeed in the ranks of government solicitors. I think it is also appropriate that the very process of appointing of judges also should be looked at. At the moment it is a fairly informal process where consultations may be undertaken with members of the judiciary and sections of the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe a system that could be looked at would be more open than that, maybe formalising the process of consultation. I think a very important comment in terms of this debate was made in the editorial in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> this morning. This editorial dealt broadly with the position of women in paid work, but made, I think, some important comments. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one crucial area of public life, the law, the representation of women is abysmally low . . . it is unfortunate that a move by the Federal Government to broaden the gender and ethnic base of the judiciary has immediately been attacked by the Opposition as somehow diluting the merit principle in judicial appointments. Of course judges should be appointed on merit, but unless it can be argued that women are less talented and capable than men in this area, there has to be discrimination at work, given that there are so few women on the bench.</PARA>
<PARA>Discrimination in that sense is not that there is not some overt barrier there saying that we will not select women or people from other backgrounds but merely that the same sort of barriers which see so few women indeed in this Parliament and in senior decision making positions throughout Australia are also at work in terms of the judiciary. These are matters that we should be concerning ourselves with, and it is disappointing that the Opposition, in my opinion, makes very inane comments in response to what is a serious and worthwhile proposal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House about recent trends in official statistics measuring the level of industrial disputes in Australia? What action is the Government taking to ensure a continuation of a low level of industrial disputation? Is the Minister aware of alternative proposals affecting industrial disputes?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="299" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform him and the House that I am delighted with the most recent ABS statistics regarding the level of industrial disputes for the month of January 1993. They show that the number of disputes, that is, 35, and the number of employees involved, that is, 4,400, were the lowest recorded at any time since December 1961&mdash;31 and a bit years ago. For the year to January 1993, the number of working days lost per thousand employees at 158&mdash;I repeat, 158&mdash;was at its lowest level since 1962.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These outstanding figures do, however, mask some worrying trends because, whilst the Australia-wide figures are at a record low level, the number of working days lost per thousand employees was higher in both Victoria and Tasmania: Victoria at 370 and Tasmania at 285. In Victoria the position has significantly deteriorated since the election of the Kennett Government last October. Honourable members opposite do not like the statistics, but they tell a story. For instance, in November 1992, 83 per cent, or 502,400 of the working days lost in Australia were lost in Victoria. Similarly, 60 per cent of the working days lost in December were also lost in Victoria. Given the renewed bout of industrial trouble in Victoria&mdash;and I might say there was a stoppage yesterday and the Opposition was conspicuously silent in this place&mdash;it seems that that State will continue to inflate the national figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high level of disputation in Victoria has been caused by the removal of the safety net of awards caused by the abolition of the industrial commission there and the move towards individual contracts. That is an approach that is mirrored in the Opposition's jobsback policy. For our part, in promoting cooperative workplace reform, we have rejected that approach, the Victorian approach, the jobsback approach. We have undertaken to keep a safety net of awards; we have undertaken to legislate for national minimum standards, to maintain the industrial umpire and to promote collective bargaining, not individual contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are confident of our approach, and we know that on 13 March the Victorian approach was categorically rejected. Indeed, if one includes Tasmania, seven of the seats won by the Government were in the two States that really went out of their way to embrace the policies of conflict. Already the Federal Government's approach has seen more than 800 federal enterprise agreements covering 680,000 workers put in place. Meanwhile, in Victoria, for all the disputation, for all the horror, we have seen only 50 employment contracts launched in that State to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Victorian, and hence the jobsback, policy approach has failed, and failed dismally. It seems to me that the only one who does not accept that is the honourable member for Bennelong, whom I saw on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday </EMPHASIS>program only the Sunday before last. He said that keeping the award system as a safety net had no appeal whatsoever for him and the only aspect of his policy that he would change was the $3 an hour youth wage&mdash;of course, he does not attribute that policy to himself, but to the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that, unless the coalition changes course and adopts the Government's cooperative approach, we will see Jobsback go the same way as Fightback and the same way as the Victorian industrial relations system&mdash;that is, right down the gurgler.</PARA>

Subsequently, but in an unrelated incident, the St Kilda footballer Nicky Winmar was the target for racial abuse during a game at the Collingwood football ground. Given the Prime Minister's avowed commitment to Aboriginal reconciliation, why has the Federal Government decided against providing funding for Northland Secondary College?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think one can make the logical link that because one is committed to reconciliation with the Aboriginal community therefore the Commonwealth must fund every school in the country which in any way services Aboriginal children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. Yes, I am aware of the problem which was reported in Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> and also followed representations from the honourable member for Groom. With Austudy, as with many other initiatives, the Government is constantly looking at ways to make a good system work better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the broad level we recently introduced the Austudy supplement which allows young Australians to increase their income at their time of greatest need; that is, when they are studying, with repayments commencing five years after they graduate and then only when their income exceeds $27,700 a year. I note that a recent study in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Economic Review</EMPHASIS> showed that up to 88 per cent of female students and 68 per cent of male students would be better off by taking up the supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case mentioned by the honourable member, we are again conscious to ensure that the scheme applies fairly. It appears that some students studying at Toowoomba TAFE had lost Austudy eligibility for 10 weeks because the TAFE put back the commencement date of the course at very late notice. The Austudy rules were correctly applied. It is not normally appropriate to pay Austudy to students for periods of several months in the year in advance of starting their course. In this case, however, there was a clear anomaly. The postponement of the course commencement date was entirely beyond the control of the student.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances, therefore, I have instructed that an amendment be made to the Austudy regulations to provide for the backdating of assistance to students who, because of circumstances beyond their control, start their course later than the allowable starting period.</PARA>

Those two agencies have the experience, the independence and the infrastructure to maximise the effectiveness of the aid that we are providing. Like most of our previous assistance, it will be made up not just of food but also of clothing and medical supplies, with provision also for the counselling of rape victims. It will help meet the most pressing needs of people who have fled the fighting, particularly refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, and tragically, no amount of money will ever fully stem the suffering in the former Yugoslavia; that trauma will linger for years, even if the fighting stops soon. But help from Australia can make a difference; it can help prevent malnutrition, disease and death, and it can help people in small ways to start their lives again. Unfortunately, that task will not be properly fulfilled unless the peace efforts which are now, I hope, bearing some fruit are fully fulfilled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well known in this Parliament and around the country that the present Government is intent on overturning many of the traditional attitudes, practices, customs and conventions of this country. Some of them may have stated, some of them may have inferred, but I never believed that we would have demonstrated in the first two days of Parliament the absolute commitment of this Government to the complete overturning of any semblance of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministerial responsibility has probably been defined more frequently, and on occasions has been attended by more humbug, than just about any other doctrine in our parliamentary system. But, reducing a definition of it to the essence of language that I believe most Australians would identify with&mdash;in other words, if I could give it a nationalistic definition; and I am sure that would appeal to those who sit opposite&mdash;most Australians would understand ministerial responsibility as meaning simply this: if we take the car and the money, we have also got to take the responsibility. That is what, through the whole of this episode, Senator Collins and the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) have conspicuously failed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this unfolding saga of farce and drama where the bungling incompetence not of the departments but of the Ministers has been revealed. It reached its absolute apotheosis today when the Minister for Communications not only found himself guilty of having misled the Parliament on two occasions&mdash;he misled the Parliament yesterday and he misled the Parliament today&mdash;but he also found himself in absolute and direct conflict with Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of this whole matter is that the Government has realised that Senator Collins should have imposed a requirement of the payment of a non-refundable deposit when he made those decisions and before they were announced with such fanfare a couple of weeks ago. If that had been done, all of the nonsense about the financial stability, the viability, the capacity to raise equity and all of those other attendant matters would have never arisen. But what he basically says now is, `Look, I could not do that because the law would not allow me to do so'. It transpires that Senator Collins was presented with a bit of paper that stated, `You can ask them to put down $500'. He was talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. He was talking about $389 million for the Budget of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, if a Minister of the Crown is presented with a bit of paper that he instinctively knows relates to a tender that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, is he really saying to the Australian public that a man or woman exercising ordinary commonsense without any advice at all would not find it passing strange that an amount of $500 is a bit on the light side? Does the Minister really need the advice of the crown law authorities to tell him that? Does he really need the advice of the department of communications to tell him that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that members of this Labor Government have terrible trouble when it comes to documents. Some of them have trouble when they sign documents, as with Senator Collins, and some of them had problems a few years ago, on two occasions, when they did not sign documents, namely taxation returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental charge that we make against this Government, against Senator Collins and against the Minister for Communications in this place is the very simple, uncluttered proposition that Senator Collins failed the ordinary commonsense test of a reasonable person applying his mind in a reasonable manner to a fairly simple proposition. That is what it is all about. We really have to ask ourselves whether a man who fails to realise that $500 is on the light side when we are dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars is really fit to discharge the responsibilities of ministerial office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the Minister do? Does the Minister have the common decency to stand up and say, `Look, I made a mistake. I did not read what I signed'&mdash;in other words, in the parlance of this Parliament&mdash;`I did a Jim Cairns; I did not read what I signed.'? The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Mackellar), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and others who were there at the time well remember the price that Jim Cairns paid when he did not read what he signed when given a document. He did not remember that he offered a commission to George Harris to pledge the worth of the Commonwealth around the world in order to raise loans. He did not realise it. He obviously did not read what he signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite honestly, that is what I believe happened on this occasion&mdash;Senator Collins did not read it. I cannot believe that he would be so stupid to accept that $500 was enough when we are talking about something worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What other explanation can there be? He was either grossly negligent in not reading what he signed or he was totally stupid in accepting the advice that he was given. He cannot lay the blame on anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think sticks in the craw of many people on this side of the House is that, when something goes wrong with that mob over there&mdash;do honourable members know what they do? They always lay the blame on somebody else. When the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, Environment and Territories signed the cover and did not read the inside, it was all her department's fault. When her department issued those motifs for the Commonwealth Games or the Olympic Games and there was not any representation of women athletes on it, she really lectured staff of her department; she really ticked them off. She brought the head of the department down, she really carpeted him and told him that he had to lift his game. There was no suggestion that she might have to lift her game; no suggestion on this occasion that the bumbling Senator Collins ought to lift his game. What does he do? He says, `I cannot understand how my department can be so incompetent'. He ordered an intra-departmental inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bendigo properly interjects, they are unable to defend themselves. And what else does he do? Today he announces in the Senate that he is going to have an inquiry into the department conducted by an outsider with legal and administrative experience. If he is going to do that, why will the Government not agree to a Senate inquiry? Why is the Government stonewalling on a Senate inquiry? Does the Government not like the idea of this thing being let loose in the hands of the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not want the questions to be asked because any dispassionate inquiry into this matter is ultimately going to say to Senator Collins, `If you want the car and the money, you've also got to take the responsibility'. That is what ministerial responsibility is all about. And there are a lot of people sitting over there who would like to be Ministers; there are a lot of people who try very hard to become Ministers in a government party. Senator Collins has got plenty of competition, and Senator Collins is sitting on a knife edge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really poor, unfortunate person of this little exercise is the good old Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall).

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Confusion, as the Leader of the Opposition says. What was his contribution yesterday? It was to try to tell this House that he had legal advice which said that, if one imposes some kind of financial hurdle, one would undermine the whole basis of a cash based bidding system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Beddall interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the Minister interjected. That is what he said yesterday. And he wanted the House to believe that non-refundable deposits equalled financial hurdles, and he wanted the House to believe yesterday&mdash;and he repeated it today&mdash;that the Attorney-General's Department had told the Government that one could not do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister compounded his error today in answer to the second last question put to him, by not reading from the advice of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). He did not read from the Attorney-General's advice; he read from the advice given to him for Question Time by his own department. And that is why he did not want to table that document. Yet he was trying to mislead the House into believing that he was reading from the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Minister not have the honesty to get up and say whether he is telling the truth on that subject? That is why he did not want to table the document when the Leader of the Opposition asked him to: because he had read from the advice of his department which was some kind of paraphrasing&mdash;and a shonky one at that&mdash;of the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. The truth is that there is nothing, according to our reading, in the advice of the Attorney-General's Department to back up what the Minister said yesterday. There is nothing at all in the advice that talks about financial hurdles or undermining the cash price basis of the tendering system. And the Minister repeated today that which he misled the House on yesterday. He has compounded his deception by trying to mislead us into believing that today in his first answer he quoted from the Attorney-General's advice when he knew damn well that he had quoted from his department's advice. That is why the Minister wanted to keep it under wraps. The Minister has failed the basic test of ministerial responsibility: he is not being truthful to his peers in the Parliament. The fundamental obligation that people have in this place is to tell the truth when they come before the dispatch box in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister has another problem. Not even Senator Collins agrees with him on the proposition about hurdles. If the Minister had seen Senator Collins last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I would have thought at the moment that viewing such an interview was de rigueur for Keating Government Ministers given the problem that they have with the subject&mdash;he would have seen that a very simple proposition was put to him. Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if any of those conditions had been put on prior to price being used to determine the allocation, it would have been unlawful to have done it.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien interjected and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that includes the issue of a non-refundable deposit?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, of course it doesn't. As I say, look at the advice.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, last night Senator Collins was saying that the advice did not say that the Government could not impose a non-refundable deposit. Not only was the Minister wrong in trying to infer that to the House&mdash;he did it yesterday and again today&mdash;but also he was out of step with what Senator Collins had said, and he was also misleading the House in trying to have us believe that non-financial hurdles equalled and included the imposition of a non-refundable deposit as a condition of accepting a tender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is wrong about that. He has contradicted Senator Collins. He has misled the Parliament twice in trying to foist upon us a false view of the advice of the Attorney-General's Department. And he made it even worse today by trying to have us believe that the advice he was reading from was the advice of the Attorney-General's Department and not the advice of his own department. I think the Minister has failed the basic test of ministerial responsibility. I think that he has made an almighty mess of the situation and, quite honestly, if ever anybody fitted the exaltation, `If you want the car and the money, you have to take the responsibility as well', the Minister for Communications certainly does. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with great interest to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is really very interesting. We have from the honourable member for Bennelong a large amount of frustration: first, at not being on this side of the House, and, secondly, at not being supported in the ballot when he put himself forward to the members of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I had listened very carefully. I must correct one point. The honourable member for Bennelong stretches a long bow. He said that I had tried to mislead the House by saying I was quoting from advice from the Attorney-General's Department. I said I had been advised. If the honourable member checks that, I am sure he will find that to be the case. I did not try to pretend that it was advice from the Attorney-General's Department; it was a confidential document to me. There were other pieces of advice in that document that were not related to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think ministerial responsibility is a very important issue. In my view, it is the ultimate responsibility of Ministers to deliver good policy to the benefit of Australia. That is the real responsibility of Ministers, and is exactly what the whole issue is about today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of the Government is very clear and, I believe, correct in this particular case; that is, for a national pay TV system to be delivered by satellite using compressed digital technology for the benefit of all Australians. The ultimate policy angle is to deliver that technology at the same time as we receive the best price for what is a public asset. That is the ultimate policy here; that is what this is all about. The Opposition continues on fishing expeditions because it has nothing of substance to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I will outline what this process is because I think it is very important. The process to allocate licences A and B following close of tenders involves basically three steps. Firstly, the bids are assessed on price. This is an impartial means of selecting who goes on to the next stage. Secondly, it involves the ABA and the TPC checking the validity of the bids. The third and final stage is the discipline of the marketplace, the Opposition's favourite marketplace, requiring that the bid price be paid in full in 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This worked in detail as follows. A decision was made by the communications selection team, with Attorney-General's advice, as referred to by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), on the conformity of the bids. The highest priced tenders were then identified for each of licences A and B and the company was then advised accordingly. Details of the successful tenders were then referred to the Australian Broadcasting Authority by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications so that the process could be undertaken for the issue of the licence. The ABA then needed to form a view about the suitability of the applicants under section 98 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The ABA referred the ownership details of each tender to the Trade Practices Commission for an opinion under section 93 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 regarding the compliance with part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission has a maximum of 45 days to provide that opinion to the ABA, but it can obviously take less time, depending on the complexity of the issues involved. When these processes are complete, the ABA will notify the applicants. The licence can be issued on payment of the bid price within 30 days of that notification. The company needs to persuade the marketplace that the amount of its bid and its plans for running the company are commercially viable. If it cannot persuade the market to provide the necessary capital, the bid will fail. This is the policy that Senator Collins put in place, and is, I think, a good policy for the people of Australia. If the tenderers cannot pay the bid amount, the licence will be offered to the next highest bidder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process is a very open one. It involves scrutiny by the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Trade Practices Commission. It also involves scrutiny by the marketplace. If the price offered is too high, the bid will fail. The Government has acknowledged that there is a deficiency in the process and has acted swiftly to correct the problem. But the problem is only one of process, as the Opposition would understand if it really looked at this issue. I hope that there will be support today when we introduce the Bill to fix up the problem of process. It is not a problem of policy, which is the responsibility of Ministers and not departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome will be that licence holders who have met the standards required by the ABA and the TPC will then be charged with providing digital satellite technology to the people of Australia for pay television with the payment to the public purse of an amount which reflects the market value of the public asset, which exposes the claims by the Opposition of deals with media mates for what they are&mdash;tired lines from an intellectually bankrupt Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members on the other side of the House are being too opportunistic and two-faced. They dress this issue up as ministerial responsibility, but they do not know what it means. The Opposition is using this issue to cover up the fact that it agrees with what we have done and what we are about to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Alston. The comments were made in the context of Senator Alston's claims on the weekend that we should have adopted a merit based process to test the financial viability of bidders. This is completely contrary to the policy principles Senator Alston outlined on behalf of his party in the chamber during the tabling of the Senate committee report. Arguing against an exclusivity period for the initial licensees, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would certainly argue that viability is a relevant factor but it ought to be a matter for the players and the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same debate Senator Alston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to ensure diversity will largely be a matter for consumers and I think it will evolve over time without any direct intervention. . . Certainly viability ought to be a matter for commercial judgement rather than for Government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is claiming that, in some fashion, Senator Collins did not act with propriety or responsibility. This is not borne out by the actual charge made in the Senate. It was not a charge concerning policy. The whole process in the charges is one concerning process. That is the differential here. Ministers are charged, I firmly believe, with the administration of policy. It was a charge dealing with process, as I said before. It was claimed that he was negligent in not reading the details of the tender document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of detail is a matter for administration. The Minister who makes the policy and objectives clear is acting responsibly. That is what both Senator Collins and I have continued to do. It is up to the department to get the administration right. The first occasion that Senator Collins and I were aware of a deficiency with the satellite licence tender process was after Friday, 30 April 1993 when the announcement was made. We were made aware over that weekend. As Ministers, responsibly we took action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins initiated the investigation into the department's process and we initiated legislative amendments to overcome the deficiency. It is not only the Government that is saying this. Let me quote from last Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The priority considerations in awarding the pay TV licences are to get the best value for taxpayers and the best value for future pay TV viewers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.                 .                   .                   .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What they have won is the right to be vetted by the Trade Practices Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Authority as potential licensees.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics should also consider what alternative procedures were available for awarding the licences. Of course, the Government could have stepped in, examined all the bids, and decided that only some consortia had the wherewithal to tender for a licence. But on what basis would it have made that decision? Just as importantly, on what basis would the Government have been perceived to have based its decision? Favouring its media mates? Picking winners? A price-only tender not only had the virtue of simplicity but of an absolutely objective criterion for ranking the bids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism of the tender process is that it has thrown up two companies with no proven experience when it comes to getting a pay TV service up and running. That may be perfectly true. But it doesn't follow that only established media companies should therefore be considered for pay TV licences. That is an argument for maintaining an exclusive industry club.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me also quote from Fred Brenchley's article in last Tuesday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a member of this chamber for 8 1/2 years. In those 8 1/2 years I have not seen a more pathetic defence by a Minister under attack in this Parliament than that seen today and yesterday. Neither this afternoon nor yesterday did the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) answer the allegations levelled at him by honourable members on this side of the House. The allegations go to the very heart of his responsibility as a Minister of the Crown. They surround the fact that he misled the House today and yesterday&mdash;a total of twice in two days. They are allegations of incompetence, both on his part and on the part of his senior Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from this display today the result of having a ministerial appointment system designed not on merit but on the basis of which State members come from, which gender they belong to, whom they voted for in the last leadership ballot or which faction they come from. That is the method of appointment of Ministers under this Government. The natural consequence of appointing people under that methodology is that fools and incompetents rise to the office of Minister. If we ever wanted to see an example of the truth of that, we have just witnessed it today, and we witnessed it yesterday when we sat here and listened to this Minister's defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in this issue, as we have seen over the last few years, a complete lack of ministerial responsibility and an inability to administer a portfolio in a competent and professional fashion. I am reminded of 1988, I think it was, when the former honourable member for Parramatta, Mr John Brown, was under attack over an Expo contract. Do those who were here then remember that? That Minister ultimately had to resign because he misled the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest today to this Minister that he ought to go back to his office and start to think about his future, because he has not addressed the claims and the allegations that were made this afternoon in this House by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in his address on the matter of public importance. We have seen today and over a period of years that when Ministers get into trouble they try to wriggle out of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Minister for Transport and Communications said over the last few days? He has said, `Oh, this giant embarrassment, this complete stuff-up, is not my fault but the department's fault. It is the one to blame. Don't blame me. I am only the Minister for Transport and Communications'. Where does the buck stop when it comes to responsibility in the administration of government in Australia? Under the system that has operated in this country since Federation, the buck rests with the Minister responsible; yet these people who are prepared to accept all the kudos, all the wages and all the lurks and perks of office are not prepared to accept that the buck stops with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has been a champion at this practice, whether it is the Minister for Communications in this House or the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, in the other House. We have had plenty of examples of this situation with other Ministers. I am reminded of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), who has been in a lot of trouble over the years. That is why he has been called Biggles. Do honourable members remember the problems that he got into over the appointment of Brian Burke as our Ambassador to Ireland? It was not his fault; it was the responsibility of a departmental officer. Do honourable members remember the Marshall Islands affair? It was not his fault; it was the fault of the responsible officer&mdash;in fact, I think it might have been his senior adviser, Miles Cooper&mdash;not the Minister's fault. Exactly the same trick is trying to be pulled today. The Government will not get away with it because we on this side of the House know what ministerial responsibility is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that members on the government side of the House also know what ministerial responsibility is all about, because I happened to take the opportunity today to go back over some of the things that these people said when they were in opposition. I go back to a speech made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who is now the President of the Federal Labor Party. In a speech in September 1981 when he was in opposition, he referred to ministerial responsibility and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the minister were unaware of it, that minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign.</PARA>
<PARA>The following year, the Hon. Lionel Bowen became Deputy Prime Minister and Attorney-General, and in a speech in September 1982 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial responsibility, I remind honourable members, does not concern the question of what one knew; it concerns the question of what one ought to have known.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who still sits in this House today, is sitting on the back bench now&mdash;not because of any personal responsibility, but because of a failure to get his department to administer what he should have done. He paid the penalty. A speech made by Lionel Bowen a few weeks later indicated that these people really knew what ministerial responsibility was. They are trying to wriggle out of it. Lionel Bowen said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each Minister is responsible to parliament for the conduct of his Department. The act of every civil servant is by convention regarded as an act of his Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>If this inquiry set up by the Minister to try to ease the pressure on him proves that the mistake was made by a civil servant in his own department, then under the guidelines referred to by these people in opposition that Minister, Senator Collins, ought to resign. I suggest that these people really know that that is the truth of what ministerial responsibility is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just sad that as we stand here today&mdash;two days after the opening of this Parliament for a new session, to try to give people of this country some fresh hope&mdash;we see members of this Government trying to wriggle out of their responsibilities. It shows to us that these people are immense hypocrites. They have not been able to live up to the oaths of office that they took as Ministers of the Crown. They have not lived up to the standards that they set for others to live up to when they were in opposition 10 or 12 years ago, and they have not been able to convince anybody here in this House today or yesterday that the charges of incompetence are not well made. The Minister for Communications has not been able to convince us that the charge that he misled the House on two occasions, which was levelled at him by the honourable member for Bennelong, is not correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to the members of this House this afternoon, as we lead this debate, that it would be interesting to find out what this Minister will do when he goes back to his office. If he is a person of honour and dignity, as I hope he is, and if he is the sort of person who stands up to the principles that Ministers of the Crown before him have ultimately had to stand up to, that he, along with his colleague, Senator Collins, will offer his resignation to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that in the interests of good administration, in the interests of maintaining the Westminster system of democracy, the Prime Minister will accept those resignations, because if he does not accept them, then I suggest that this Government has no principles and no standards.

If they try to wriggle out of this by blaming it on everybody else, nobody will believe it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting to note the way that this debate has developed. It started off to be a matter of public importance based on the topic of ministerial responsibility, and progressed further to claims made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) that the Minister has misled the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very serious claim to make in this place that someone has misled the House, and in this particular case, it is very wrong. Not a single word that the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) has said at this dispatch box, since he got his first question in the portfolio yesterday, has had one element out of place and incorrect. I have listened very carefully to every word he has said, and I have had some interest in this matter for some time. So to come here and make the claim that a Minister has misled the House, knowing very well that not a word he has said was wrong, is in fact serious and mischievous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the heart of the matter. The key question being asked really is whether anything that the Minister for Communications said in his answers in this House yesterday or today is wrong. Those opposite claim to have the document that the Minister also used as his source&mdash;the Attorney-General's advice. They know very well&mdash;having heard his answer yesterday, and having had all yesterday afternoon, all last night and all of this morning to pore over it&mdash;that had one single word that the Minister uttered been out of place in relation to that document they could have put it on the table today. Where was the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp)&mdash;the Opposition's new star, its communications person&mdash;who is supposed to be putting the Minister under pressure? He did not even speak in the MPI today. The big star led us off yesterday with all his questions, but they went absolutely nowhere. The one reason why the questions went absolutely nowhere is that nothing the Minister said either yesterday or today was in any way wrong or misleading of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go next to a couple of other questions those opposite might ask. Has the Minister for Communications, or the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) for that matter, said anything in this debate that reflects either an error or a mistake? In this tender for the pay TV licences the Government made a decision to go with a price based process. For those people who do not understand the difference between a price based allocation and what the Minister for Communications correctly referred to yesterday as a beauty contest or a hurdles system, it might be interesting to note that the Government had a choice. This Government has had substantial experience now with a range of tenders, not just in transport and communications issues but in very major government projects over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way to tackle the problem is to say to potential bidders, `Yes, we are looking for the price that you are offering, but here are hurdles that you will also have to meet in order to get the nod'. In this case, in the very difficult area of government broadcasting licences, the sorts of hurdles that have to be examined at some point under the legislation are whether the ownership requirements in the bid meet the Government's requirements for Australian ownership, foreign equity and the other issues that come into the ownership of licences; whether the bidder has the capability to carry out the function&mdash;I will come to this very important point in this case in a second&mdash;and whether the Australian content requirements have been met. Unlike those on the other side of the House, we actually do require that Australian industry and Australian film and production get a draw in these decisions. Whether the industry development requirements meet the policy and whether the bidder understands all the other conditions that are being set for the granting of the licence also have to be examined. Those hurdles can be set in place in the process and considered at the time of judgment of the bid. However, the minute that is done there is a move away from price only into the making of subjective judgments about whether one particular bid is better than another for a whole lot of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members in this chamber are not aware of the sensitivities involved in selecting pay TV licences&mdash;there is a very broad perception out there that, no matter which way the Government goes, whatever decision is taken, there will be inferences made that it was done to give benefit to some particular interest group&mdash;the Government made a very deliberate decision that in the first stage of the tendering process it would be price based only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite claim to have a document. I have a document which I do not intend to table; it is confidential advice to the Government. If those opposite reckon they have it, they should table it. The document I have seen contains specific legal advice on this point. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not consider that hurdles can be incorporated into the pre-qualification stage whereby some potential bidders are eliminated before their bids are assessed on a price basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Simply placing obstacles in the way and still claiming that it is a price based system is not on. Let us then turn to the question the honourable member for Bennelong raised about the deposit. It does not matter what level of deposit is set; at some point people who are interested in the process will claim that they have been denied their due process under a `price based system'. In fact, the document the honourable member claims to have says exactly that&mdash;and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong also asked: why has the Minister decided that this will be an administrative investigation and not a Senate inquiry? That is a very good question for him to ask because we can go back to Minister Collins's comments last year when those opposite decided to set a Senate inquiry going. His most prophetic words were, `Pay TV is now going to disappear into the great black hole of the Senate'. From the day the Senate got hold of it, the whole process has been stalled and messed about. Not only has it caused everybody to have to revisit the whole issue time and time again, but also it has also caused us to have serious questions about the ability of those in the other place to consider this matter without a direct political impression and direction as to how to tackle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this issue of resolving the administrative question as to the deposit in the system. The Minister has the legislation to introduce, for future reference. Those opposite can say that Minister Collins, in looking through hundreds of pages of documents, did not notice that the five per cent requirement was not there. No problem, he has admitted that everywhere&mdash;including on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program last night, as the honourable member said. But to come in here and say that any of this represents an attempt to mislead this House is not only wrong and known to be wrong, but also gravely serious. Those opposite do not do themselves any justice in saying so. </PARA>

The committee heard matters relating to these references in February of this year but was unable to report prior to the dissolution of the Parliament and, for that purpose, they are being reintroduced now. Since this is a standing committee, even though no membership has been appointed at this stage, it seems quite appropriate for the committee to pursue its references once again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On the point raised by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), that really does put it beyond doubt in my mind. If the references were there and the Public Works Committee continued, there would be no need to give it those references again. If in fact this is going to be a defective procedure, why proceed with it? If it is beyond doubt, obviously it might be appropriate. But where it is clear that there is doubt and what we are trying to do is ensure that the committee gets a valid reference, when it had previously been with the committee, we ought to put it off until the membership is appointed and we know the matter is clear and unambiguous. For more abundant precaution, I would suggest that the matters be adjourned until the appointments have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 introduces changes to part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to modify some aspects of the procedures for allocating satellite subscription television broadcasting licences A and B. Let me make clear at the outset that this amendment does not apply to those tenderers who were announced as the highest bidders on 30 April 1993. Those companies' applications are now at the second stage of the established process which will continue to finality. This legislation does not reflect a judgment that either of the current highest bidders is unable to meet its bid, but is to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place should such a contingency arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process to allocate these licences, which was determined under section 93 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, has three stages. The first stage that has just been completed involves an impartial assessment of complying tenders to identify which delivered the highest bid price. The second stage involves assessment of the tenderers so identified by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, which will need to form a view about the suitability of the applicants under section 98 of the Act. The ABA will also seek the opinion of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to part IV of the Trade Practices Act as required under section 93 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third stage involves actual issuance of the licence but only after the ABA and TPC processes have been satisfied and the full bid price paid. Under the legislation, Trade Practices Commission consideration could take up to 45 days. Following that, licensees have 30 days within which to pay the bid price. The interest of the public is that the issuance of pay television licences and the effective commencement of broadcasting services should occur as soon as possible. This has always been the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until licences A and B are issued, it is not possible for the standard for a digital transmission system to be declared, nor for a third licence to be issued to the ABC. The legislation before the House therefore provides that, in the event that either of the present highest tenderers were not successful, any alternative tenderer who thereby had the opportunity to be assessed as a potential licensee would be required to provide a deposit of five per cent of the amount of its bid within three days of being given that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That deposit would not be refundable if the licence was not subsequently allocated, unless non-allocation was due to an unfavourable report by the Trade Practices Commission. This amendment will put an additional step in the process after the initial identification of highest bidders. Its purpose is to provide an additional indication that those tenderers have the financial capacity to pay the price bid hence justifying continuation of the process through its detailed assessment stages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I recommence, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me put on record my congratulations to you on your election as Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to serve with Mr Speaker and yourself as one of your deputies. I am sure that with all of us working together we will make this chamber the place it is supposed to be. I look forward to working with you during the term of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge, as you did yesterday, Mr Deputy Speaker, the work of your predecessor, the former honourable member for Stirling, Mr Ron Edwards, as the Deputy Speaker in this place. Ron was and remains a very good friend of both yours and mine. I miss him, of course, as I am sure we all will in this place. I just wanted to put that on the record too. I am sure we will see Ron from time to time if he does not come back the next time around. But that is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier, before this debate was adjourned, I was speaking on the reference in the Governor-General's speech to employment, education and training. The Government will review the employment, education and training programs with a view to ensuring that those benefits are actually delivered to young people&mdash;indeed, all people who are unfortunately unemployed. It is important that that review goes ahead as soon as possible to ensure that those benefits do pass on to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will certainly work with my local community, the business community, trade unions, trainers and other community groups in the Ipswich region in particular to ensure that they make a contribution to those discussions. I am sure, knowing the people involved, they will be very keen to make a contribution to those discussions. I will be giving them every encouragement to play an active part in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) spoke about the personnel at the Amberley Air Force base. Shortly a big housing development will be commenced in Ipswich. That development was referred by the Minister earlier to the Standing Committee on Public Works. I turn to the defence area and speak a little bit about that because the Amberley Air Force base is in my electorate, which is the home of the F111s, and the defence industry is very important to my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the important role of the F111s in Australia's defence was actually in danger under the policies that the coalition took to the last election. The then coalition defence spokesman, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), made it clear that the purchase of an additional 18 F111s to be used as spares, which was announced by the Government last year, would actually be in jeopardy under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it soon became apparent that there were divisions between the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his defence spokesman on the issue of the purchase of these F111s. In an unannounced photo opportunity, I suppose one could call it, during the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition dropped into Amberley for his aircraft to be refuelled and was actually photographed in the cockpit of an F111. When the defence people had him in the cockpit of the F111 they suggested that it would be a good time for him to review the coalition's policy on the F111s. Of course he said that he would review the situation at the right time, but he did not give any commitment that he would change it. Anyway, the people of Australia have been saved from that because they made up their minds as to what they thought of the coalition's defence policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people really made this debate between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Mayo academic by re-electing the Keating Government on 13 March. The Australian people have made sure that the purchase of those additional F111s will actually go ahead and ensure the future of the Amberley Air Force base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scrapping of the purchase of the additional F111s was just part of $200 million in cuts to the defence budget proposed by the Opposition prior to the last election. Other cuts included large cuts to civilian and officer numbers, with approximately 300 officers to go, $150 million in cuts to travel costs, office equipment, stationery, fuel and computer services, around $30 million in cuts to non-combat forces, almost total abolition of the commercial vehicle fleet and substantial cuts to personnel support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cuts of such a magnitude would clearly have had a devastating impact on defence bases such as Amberley and on defence personnel. RAAF base Amberley is a vital part of the economy of the Ipswich region and plays an important part in the life of the general community of that region. The Keating Government, of course, remains committed to consolidating Australia's defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence white paper, which will be released during the Government's term in office, will continue the Government's defence priorities and the structure of the Australian Defence Force for the remainder of the 1990s. One of the defence success stories in recent years has been the developments in defence science. About $20 billion will be invested in defence equipment and facilities over this next decade. While this investment in equipment is absolutely necessary, it is essential that the Government does not overlook the needs of defence personnel. Over the next three years, the Government will continue working to improve the living conditions of defence personnel by upgrading facilities at military bases as well as improving defence housing. I am sure that, with this support from the Government, RAAF base Amberley will continue to play an important role in the life of the Ipswich region for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to Amberley, the Oxley electorate also includes a significant number of rural producers, particularly in the Lockyer Valley and the rural centre of Laidley. These rural areas were included in the Oxley electorate as a result of the redistribution which occurred prior to the recent federal election. Therefore, the primary industries and energy policy is of considerable interest to many people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last Parliament I served as a member of the committee set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on value adding in primary production during which time I gained a greater understanding of the potential export income to be gained through the development of processes that add value to our rural primary products. The Ipswich region, which has both a strong primary producing sector and a strong industrial base, is well placed to pick up on the opportunities now opening up in the area of value adding. Over the next term I will be working to encourage governments at all levels to provide greater support for the development of value adding for these primary products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Value adding provides tremendous opportunities to increase the value of our primary products and to increase employment opportunities, as well as providing opportunities to increase Australia's export income and reduce our current account deficit. If Australia is to seize the opportunities for increased export income now opening up for us in the Asia-Pacific region, reform in our industrial relations system must occur. The only way such reform can take place is by the Government, business, workers and the unions working together constructively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the Government and the Opposition towards industrial relations was a clear dividing line between the major parties during the recent federal election campaign and I do not think much has changed. The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) declared war on Australian workers and, as it turns out, they lost&mdash;which is a good thing for Australian workers. They sought to blame the trade union movement for all of Australia's economic ills. The Government, on the other hand, realises that if Australia is to become more competitive the old policies of confrontation must be replaced by a spirit of cooperation. We are committed to cultivating the partnership between business and trade unions which is essential if we are to achieve lasting reform of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to increasing the flexibility of our industrial relations system by expanding the system of enterprise agreements. However, we will ensure that greater flexibility does not come at the expense of workers' basic rights and conditions of employment, which are essential parts of the system. This will be achieved by maintaining the safety net provided by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the award system which was referred to today by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in Question Time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating Labor Government is committed to the policies of inclusion to ensure that all Australians are able to participate fully at all levels of society. We as a government recognise that we have an obligation to make Australia a more just place to live for all its citizens. However, we recognise that we have a unique responsibility to Australia's original inhabitants, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in this, the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, we have a special obligation to address the human rights issues raised by the current position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australian society. Achieving justice for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders remains high on this Government's agenda, as honourable members would have noticed in the Governor-General's speech. I might add that it is an issue high on my own personal agenda, after having served as chair of the Government's committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in the last parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to be able to hold its head high during international discussions on human rights, reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians must be achieved, and as soon as possible. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation which was established by the Government in 1991 will continue to be a key participant in the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year's decision by the High Court on native title&mdash;more commonly known as the Mabo case&mdash;was a major landmark in Australian legal history. It overturned the racist concept of terra nullius which previously existed in the common law and recognised a form of native title for the first time. Mabo, which essentially recognises the dispossession of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, provides the foundation for reconciliation. I am pleased that the Government has begun discussion on this decision as part of the process of preparing a national response to the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the hallmarks of the Keating Government has been its efforts to establish a more distinctive Australian national identity. In December the Prime Minister announced changes to the oath of allegiance for people taking out Australian citizenship. Under the new oath people who take out citizenship will swear allegiance to Australia and its people. That is an important change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members have attended citizenship ceremonies from time to time and seen the people who have come here from many different countries. It is often quite confusing to those people when they have to swear allegiance to the Queen rather than actually to their new homeland. This is an important change that must be proceeded with as soon as possible. The revision of the oath of allegiance is just part of the commitment to a broader debate about Australia's national identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government&mdash;and the labour movement generally&mdash;remains committed to continuing to promote the idea of having an Australian head of state chosen by Australians. Recently the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a committee of eminent Australians to formulate a range of options for constitutional reforms. This is a committee that I fully support and an initiative by the Prime Minister which I wholeheartedly support. It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen not to nominate a representative to serve on this committee, because if we are to advance this debate a bipartisan approach is essential. Changing our constitutional arrangements to reflect Australia's changing national identity should be an issue which unites us all as Australians. I would hope that we can maintain a mature and balanced debate as we decide this important question in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a great country, as we in this place all understand. But through all sections of society working together it can be an even greater country. It is essential that we all work together to make Australia the great country that it could be. We are now situated in the fastest growing economic region in the world and if we can tap into that growth we will have a prosperous future. But we can only do this by all working together. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my time in the Victorian Parliament I took a great interest in the Parliament. I was very concerned, as I hope all honourable members are, about the way in which parliaments in Australia have become a place where the law has not been upheld as it should be, in the sense that there has been denigration of the institution, for many reasons. The community has lost respect in many ways for the institution of parliament and for the law-makers, and I think it really is incumbent on all of us to do a lot better. One of the contributions I would like to make as the honourable member for Indi is to help all of us improve this Parliament. I will refer in a little while to some of the areas where I think there are some vivid examples of what we need to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the first time that I have spoken in the chamber that is the House of Representatives. Ironically, as many honourable members would know, when Federation was agreed upon the Victorian Parliament was agreed to be the Commonwealth Parliament by arrangement. So Victoria lent the building&mdash;that beautiful building at the top end of Spring Street&mdash;to the Commonwealth and the Legislative Assembly chamber became the House of Representatives. I have just come from the Legislative Assembly wishing you all well and saying that the rent still has not been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to express my sincere appreciation to my predecessor, good friend and mentor, Ewen Cameron. Ewen Cameron was the 13th Cameron in this place, and I am very glad that the honourable member for Stirling, Mr Eoin Cameron, who made a marvellous first speech today, is the 14th Cameron. I can report back to my good friend Ewen that the place must be in good hands if there is another Cameron here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ewen was a man whom I admired very much.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to note that I am the second member for Indi who was also the State member for Benambra. The first member was, of course, Sir Isaac Isaacs. He grew up in a little town called Yackandandah. His father was a tailor; he became a lawyer. He was elected to the State Parliament. He was one of the fathers of Federation. He came here as the first member for Indi. He left a very daunting task for all of us who succeeded him. As a student of the Constitution and one who worries very much about the future of the federal system, I think that we should read again some of the words of Isaac Isaacs, Alfred Deakin and people such as that, because I think they were pretty wise. The safeguards they put in the Constitution remarkably have protected this nation very well, although they have caused some frustration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pleasure for me to rejoin a colleague from the State Parliament who was elected into the State Parliament when I was first elected, and that is the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). The honourable member for Bendigo is an accomplished parliamentarian who has managed to convince the electors of Bendigo that their judgment is indeed correct. However, he does specialise in narrow escapes. I think that the honourable member's skill as a local member of parliament should be the subject of a treatise for all aspiring members of parliament. </PARA>

In Indi we are in the process of helping Australia recover from the recession. We are producing marvellous value added food, which is one of the things that we have to do better than anyone else. I have some empty samples here of Uncle Toby's muesli bars, which are now being sold in Asia. I will give honourable members some figures in a minute, which will make them feel very proud. Not so much attractive to honourable members but to their pets, I have labels for Pal dog food and Whiskas cat food. Uncle Ben's in Wodonga is one of Australia's great companies; it is one of Australia's great employers of country people. It is selling successfully into Asia and can really teach Australians what best practice is.

It would be dreadful if I brought my constituents here and they could not enjoy the wines from north-east Victoria. Brown Brothers is a family business, now employing 200 and exporting into Asia, America and Britain. It is showing Australians what we can do. It is still owned by the family.

One of the reasons that I stood for the Federal Parliament was that I really believed that Fightback would help us gain export markets&mdash;and I still do. I feel so sorry that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been slow in adopting our policies. I think we ought to send him another copy of Fightback to read. Under our policies we would have reduced the cost of exports by five per cent in the first year. That is a remarkable one-off figure, and it would have meant jobs. The other reason that I am here&mdash;and I am sure people on this side of politics feel very strongly about this&mdash;is that it is unacceptable that there be a million people unemployed in Australia, that there be 700,000 kids in Australia whose mothers and fathers are both unemployed and who are on some form of government welfare assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members look at the current account figures this week&mdash;they will have a nightmare afterwards, as most of us would have&mdash;they will see that it is fundamental to Australia that we introduce reforms. Unfortunately, the Australian electorate did not quite make it this time&mdash;about 1,400 votes in the marginal seats. So my friends on the other side should not crow too much about the mandate. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said today, the only mandate the Government has is not to increase taxes. We are looking forward to seeing the Prime Minister deliver his mandate.

His examples and hard work as a small businessman in Australia have always been an inspiration to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other people: my master when I was articled, Stan Jackling, who wrote the constitution for the Australian Association of Apex and was a great influence on me; Harry Flood, one of the partners who recently passed away and who was one of the commandos on Timor who used to observe the Japanese naval ships and report back. He was pursued across all those islands by the Japs but they never caught him. He was a great lawyer and an influence on me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I would like to mention Mr Justice Nagle of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Mr Justice Crockett of the Supreme Court of Victoria who also, as barristers, were very interested in my career and helped me along. Obviously, I would not be here today if it were not for my family&mdash;my wife, Marj, and my three children. As someone said the other day, `Lou, why are you doing this? Wouldn't you have had enough, having been in the State Parliament?', but above all they said to my wife, `Why are you letting him do it after all of the years in State Parliament?'. The fact is, we are a team. We believe in Australia very much and we also take the view that everyone has a responsibility to serve his nation. We enjoy doing that so that is part of the reason I am here. </PARA>

That is what is coming through to me. I know honourable members are all human beings. I know we are all subject to the frailties of man. But I must say that there is a great interest in the Parliament, and I think that if we could do more to promote that interest and, above all, improve the standards of Parliament it would be not only a good thing for us in our career, but also a great thing for the community. </PARA>

But I would like to mention briefly that I do not think Australians have put enough effort into the regional development of Australia. It is the most unrecognised issue, and it is one that I know a lot of governments talk about, but unfortunately there has not been a national policy on it. I would like to help this Parliament and I hope people from all sides will support me in the quest to have a better Australia, one in which all the population does not concentrate on the coastal regions and the major capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have shown honourable members some of the things which we are doing in regional Australia, in Indi. Our potential has not been reached. Given the right regional policies, there are many parts of Australia like Indi that could do an enormous thing for Australia and create jobs. I would like to say particularly that the electors of Indi&mdash;most of them, about 50 per cent I would say, were formerly electors of mine in the State seat of Benambra&mdash;have been absolutely supportive of me. They gave me a very good mandate in the State Parliament. I had the second highest vote, I think, in the State Parliament and this time round I got 63 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. </PARA>

Regional Australian policies, in my view, should be absolute priority for all governments.

When I was visiting the Royal Women's Hospital as Minister I remember being shown the neo-natal wards where the miracles of technology and medicine have saved so many lives, unfortunately at a great cost. I am told that the neo-natal programs are at risk because of the crisis in the health system. Surely to God, sir, the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) and the Keating Government should move urgently to address these issues because we have a crisis in health. I notice that Senator Richardson is looking at the possibility of providing incentives for people to take out private health insurance. Only 40 per cent of Australians have insurance, with more dropping out every day. We had 70 per cent about eight years ago. It is our policy that that should happen. Prime Minister, please do it.

The Murray-Darling Basin represents about one-seventh of Australia's continent and produces 40 per cent of Australia's total food, some of it by Uncle Tobys and others. It is value added, getting jobs, earning export dollars. To me the policies of the national Government on Murray-Darling have been neglected. There is not enough support from the Commonwealth to look after that great resource of Australia. I would like, while I am in this place, to see that the Parliament focuses more attention on supporting the Murray-Darling Commission, which is a partnership between the State governments of South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and the Commonwealth Government, so that that valuable resource is looked after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is with great pride and pleasure that I rise for the first time to speak in this House as the sixth elected representative of the electorate of Macarthur. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Macarthur has always been represented, since its creation in 1949, by a member of the Government party. Of the five previous members for Macarthur, four are still members of this Parliament. They are John Kerin; Stephen Martin; you, Mr Deputy Speaker; and Senator Michael Baume. The other previous member for Macarthur was the late Mr Jeff Bate.</PARA></TALK.START>

In addition, let me convey to the honourable member for Cunningham the appreciation and best wishes of his former constituents of Macarthur for his outstanding service as their representative in this House for the past eight years. Let me also convey similar appreciation from former constituents to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), part of whose former electorates now fall within the electorate of Macarthur. Each of these members has provided outstanding service to their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to the Hon. Stewart West, the former member for Cunningham in this House. Stewart West entered parliament in 1977. He became a Minister in the Hawke Government and served as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs from 1983 to 1984, Minister for Housing and Construction from 1984 to 1987, and Minister for Administrative Services from 1987 to 1990. Mr West's services to his electorate over 16 years exemplified what it means to be a Labor member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a particular honour and privilege for me to represent Macarthur as a member of the great Australian Labor Party and as a member of the Keating Labor Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined the ALP in 1979, and I did so because it was the party&mdash;the only party&mdash;which had a fundamental commitment to equity, fairness and social justice, and the achievement of progressive, social democratic reform. The efforts of the Whitlam Government in this regard were rudely interrupted by the unforgettable events of November 1975&mdash;events which, hopefully, will never be repeated but which themselves helped motivate me to become politically active; indeed, it could be said that I have maintained the rage. However, much has been done to bring about greater equity and social justice since the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate in my working life, and through my involvement in the trade union movement, local government and community organisations, to have had direct involvement with issues and policies which are great examples of the achievements of a Labor government. These include Medicare, our great universal health insurance system. I was employed in a team monitoring abuses of Medicare benefits by medical practitioners. However, our efforts were undermined by the medical establishment within the bureaucracy and were attacked by the more extreme elements of the AMA, forcing the Government to abolish our program during the doctors dispute in 1985. I might say that some of my colleagues at the time were less fortunate than I was in finding a new career. Indeed, at least two of them were so badly persecuted within the bureaucracy because of their vigilance and effectiveness in pursuing cases of medical fraud and overservicing that they were eventually forced into premature retirement due to stress related illness. However, the Medicare scheme itself, despite continuing opposition from elements of the medical profession, has survived and stands as a truly great Labor reform which will continue to improve even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive increase in Federal funding for child care is another example of Labor's commitment to social justice. Much credit for this is due to my colleague the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) in his role as the Minister responsible. My local government experience with Campbelltown City Council has given me a valuable insight into the importance of child care as a priority for the community. As most of my electorate has a high proportion of young families, I look forward to the implementation of the new child-care initiatives announced by the Prime Minister before the election, and to the continuing expansion of the children's services program. However, as with so many other Commonwealth-State programs, the Government must overcome the difficulties of dealing with uncooperative State governments, such as the current one in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are probably few better examples of a typical Labor achievement than the progress made in the past 10 years toward equal employment opportunity in Australia. This is an area in which I have worked for some years in the public sector. It is significant that every piece of legislation relating to equal employment opportunity in this country, both at Commonwealth and State level, has been passed by a Labor government. This has resulted in a much higher participation rate of women in the work force, as well as significant progress in breaking down gender stereotypes and eliminating discrimination against women in the workplace. However, there is still much more to be done in relation to EEO for migrants, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my six years in local government I have also been encouraged by the Federal Government's efforts in promoting better cooperation with local councils and providing increased direct funding. I note that it was Labor which attempted to provide constitutional recognition for local government by holding a referendum in September 1988. Unfortunately, however, the referendum was unsuccessful due to the negative campaign of the Opposition parties. Perhaps this matter could be once again dealt with as part of the review of Australia's system and structure of government, which will undoubtedly be completed well before the year 2001. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also commend the Government for the introduction in the 1992 Budget of the local government capital works program. Despite the gratuitous criticism of the Opposition and the attempted obstruction by conservative State governments, this program provided a much needed boost to many local councils. Not only is the program creating jobs and stimulating local economies, but also it has made possible the provision of desperately needed capital works and community facilities which councils have not been able to afford due to the recession and to continuing funding cuts by State governments. This is particularly important in newer areas with rapid growth, where councils have struggled to provide the infrastructure and facilities to keep pace with the community's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned just a few of the reasons why I am proud to be a member of the Australian Labor Party and to represent the party in this House. Certainly, the people of Macarthur will benefit greatly from the Government's re-election. As an electorate with many young families and first home buyers, issues such as child care, education and housing are of high priority, along with employment. In these areas Labor's policies were clearly superior to those of our opponents. Macarthur also has a predominance of small business people who would have been severely disadvantaged by the Opposition's proposed goods and services tax&mdash;a point which became clear to many of them during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Job creation is clearly a high priority for this Government, and in this respect I am encouraged by the emphasis on regional development foreshadowed by the Prime Minister. I will be paying particular attention to seeking early progress on the construction of the Badgerys Creek airport, and also to the issue of transport infrastructure within Macarthur, particularly in relation to the problems associated with the transportation of coal to Port Kembla. Coal mining is one of the largest industries in the Macarthur region and is also an important export industry. It is vital that the most efficient and cost-effective coal transport arrangements are put in place, with due regard for employment, environmental issues and the needs of local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to those who supported and assisted me in my election campaign. I thank my wife, Kerry, and my three children for the support they have given me and the sacrifices they have made as an inevitable part of my holding public office, both at the local government level and now as a Federal member. I thank my local party branch members, my federal electorate council, Young Labor members and my campaign committee, many of whom are well aware of the particular difficulties we experienced during the campaign. I thank the national and State offices of the Labor Party and all those who assisted during the campaign and on polling day; indeed, I thank all of the people in Macarthur who voted for me and the Labor Party. They have bestowed a great honour and a great responsibility upon me, and I will not let them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must pay a special tribute to the role played by the trade union movement in the re-election of the Labor Government. No doubt motivated by the threat of the draconian industrial relations climate foreshadowed by the Opposition, the trade union movement mobilised as never before to support the Labor campaign. I am pleased to say that Macarthur was no exception. I received significant support for my campaign from officials and from rank and file members of a number of unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express particular gratitude to the New South Wales branch of the miscellaneous workers division of the LHMU, and the New South Wales branch of the building workers division of the CFMEU. I am proud to have been associated with both of these organisations, as well as the other unions which contributed. The support I received from unions was all the more gratifying in view of my own background as an active trade unionist for many years in the public sector. It was my involvement in the union movement that originally gave expression and focus to my commitment to social justice, and led to my joining the ALP. It has also provided me with the background of experience which has played a large part in enabling me to achieve the honour of being elected to this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a public sector worker, my union activities also taught me a lot about public administration and the workings of government at the federal level. However, my early years as a delegate in the former ACOA&mdash;now the Public Sector Union&mdash;coincided with an era of confrontation and Public Service bashing under the Fraser Government. Since 1983 the close, cooperative relationship between the Labor Government and the ACTU, together with the promotion of industrial democracy principles as government policy, has resulted in major changes in the industrial relations culture, both in the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the 1980s brought with them other problems for Australian workers and unions, particularly in the public sector. The predominance of economic rationalists amongst the senior levels of the bureaucracy has been a source of continuing concern and frustration for many of us. Much has been said in recent times about the failure of these doctrinaire, market driven economic models, particularly with the spectacular failure of the Opposition's Fightback package to win electoral support. However, the economic rationalist bean counting mentality has dominated the bureaucracy for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been true in most government agencies&mdash;even, I am sorry to say, in the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, where I represented the Public Sector Union. I will not soon forget the despair and anger of many of my colleagues and myself during 1988 when more than 500 jobs were abolished, resulting in a bitter industrial dispute. It is a great tribute to the dedication, commitment and professionalism of program staff in that department that the Government's important social justice programs are still being delivered, despite the ongoing difficulties created by such restrictions as the efficiency dividend, endless rationalisation and restructuring and the obsession with the false premise that adopting private sector models automatically means greater efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that this Government has learnt from the mistakes of the 1980s, both in Australia and overseas. Thankfully, economic rationalism is no longer the flavour of the month. As one who has always believed that governments should play a significant role in social and economic planning so that the economy is tailored to meet our social needs and objectives, rather than the reverse, I look forward to an even greater emphasis on the achievement of real equity and social justice, building on the many great reforms already achieved by Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past five years the Federal Labor Government has been working together with unions, employers and employer associations in the building industry to achieve improvements in productivity and efficiency, as well as to ensure opportunities for workers in terms of access to training, career paths and job satisfaction. Already this process is bearing fruit, with many key projects being completed well within budget and ahead of time. This approach will undoubtedly attract further investment, both Australian and international, and will ensure increased development and job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building unions have been, and continue to be, key participants and initiators in this reform process. Union amalgamations have proceeded rapidly, particularly over the past two years. The amalgamations, together with the unions' approach to cross skilling and career paths will, amongst other things, ensure a reduction in demarcation disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated previously, I have had many recent dealings with the officials of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, the CFMEU, in New South Wales. The responsible and far-sighted leadership of the CFMEU has ensured that it is playing a key role in the reform process so that maximum benefits will flow to its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition policies on unions and micro-economic reform are diametrically opposed to this. It was the anti-union, anti-worker aspects of so many elements of Fightback which motivated many trade unionists, Labor Party members and supporters to put in extra effort to ensure a Labor victory in the election. This certainly happened in Macarthur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One organisation which is out of step with current progressive reforms, and which seeks a confrontationalist and negative approach to the union movement is the Housing Industry Association. During the recent election campaign the HIA, under the stewardship of one Ron Silberberg, embarked on a campaign which would rival the captain of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>, or perhaps the formulator of Fightback, in terms of judgment and skill. The HIA spent millions of dollars of its members' subscriptions on the most disgraceful misinformation campaign seen in this country for many years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HIA's campaign followed this Government's amendments to the Industrial Relations Act concerning protection for subcontractor workers. After consultation with unions, employer associations, the Australian Democrats and other interested parties, modified proposals were legislated and came into effect in July 1992. All those who opposed the initial proposals were satisfied with the final amendments&mdash;that is, all except the HIA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final legislation simply gives the Industrial Relations Commission the power, upon application on behalf of the contract worker, to set aside and vary a contract if it is found to be harsh, unfair or unconscionable. This was simply designed to prevent exploitation of workers not protected by award prescription. It applies whether they are contractors, subcontractors or employees and whether or not they are members of a union. The provisions are, in many respects, much more conservative than provisions which have existed in New South Wales for decades and which were retained in the Greiner Government's harsh new industrial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, the HIA embarked on its massive scare campaign. It carried out an expensive radio, television and press campaign which blatantly misrepresented the content and effects of the new provisions of the Act. It then spent a reported $2 million on direct mail alone, targeting 13 marginal seats, including Macarthur which includes many new housing estates. The material presented in this vicious campaign contained many blatant untruths. In particular, the HIA falsely asserted that the new legislation would result in compulsory unionism and a blow-out in housing costs. By contrast, it was absolutely silent on the likely effects of the Opposition's GST on housing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign by the HIA was political and ideologically based.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most laughable aspects of the HIA's propaganda was its claims in relation to compulsory unionism.

By contrast, I know dozens of people who have experienced victimisation, discrimination and harassment in the workplace because of their trade union activity. I know from my own experience in the public sector that active trade union delegates and members are often singled out for special attention by employers. This sometimes goes well beyond the normal robust political relationship one expects between unions and managements and can seriously disadvantage a worker's career. I have represented dozens of people who have suffered unfair discrimination of this nature. </PARA>

Its residential component includes such hills suburbs as Darlington, Kalamunda and Lesmurdie, together with the outer suburban housing in the foothills at Swan View, High Wycombe and Forrestfield. It borders the major industrial and service centre of Midland. Much of this suburban component proceeding along Great Eastern Highway blends into a rural lifestyle that the electors of Pearce are properly determined to preserve.

I have been given a strong mandate by the electors of Pearce and must act as part of a forceful Opposition. The people of Pearce demand that answers be provided to such continuing national problems as unemployment, health care, and the strengthening of rural and resource industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drawing on my community involvement in the Pearce electorate, I firmly believe that those of us elected to parliament must work effectively for the deeper involvement and understanding of our fellow Australians in the political process. If we are honest, we cannot deny that there is a growing cynicism in the electorate. The healthy scepticism of our anarcho-conservative cultural tradition has been overtaken by a sullen alienation, a continued feeling of `us' against `them'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many Australians consider that they are completely dissociated from government, that they have no means of influencing public policy, and that any major policy initiative is certain to contain a malign hidden agenda. Much of the responsibility must be borne, by not only publicly disgraced political leaders, but also all those in leadership roles who have sought to exploit and deepen this feeling for partisan gain. It is a fact that the cynicism that has been successfully mobilised to win an election may boomerang. When a re-elected government wishes to promote new solutions to deep-seated problems, it will find that it has created a monster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to do my utmost to assure the electors of Pearce that they matter, to give them a chance to have effective input into the political process and to take charge of their own destiny. Beyond representing my own views, it is therefore my role and my privilege to consider and represent those wishes of electors that are in the common interests of the people. Part of the process is to inform the public of the amount of constructive and bipartisan work achieved in this Parliament and its committees, an aspect of politics too little understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, we need to strive toward consistent bipartisan solutions. The reduction of tariffs over the last two decades has been achieved in such a climate, and the temptation to arouse protectionist emotions for cheap political gain has to be resisted. Nor can a Government that may not rely electorally on the vote of wealth producers afford to delay and compromise on the need for tax reform that will cut the cost of transport and other burdens on the export industries and business and farming sectors, on which all of us ultimately depend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have a duty to break down the barriers of cynicism and despair which cloud the political process and to act as popularisers rather than populists, I am always conscious of the fact that our national problems cannot be solved by political action alone. It is the great fallacy of the 20th century that mankind is somehow perfectible through politics. In furtherance of this Rousseauist lie, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao Tse-tung, those apostles of social engineering, have slaughtered millions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One common feature of those who believe that men and women exist to witness the validity of political theory rather than the liberal-democratic axiom that politics must serve people is their ultimate scorn of the individual. Hence the pre-war Japanese Ministry of Justice stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Individuals can only exist as links in an infinite and vast chain of life called the state; . . . Individuals participate in the highest and greatest value when they serve the state as part of it.</PARA>
<PARA>This blend of Western Hegelianism and bushido is the hallmark of any society where oligarchies take collective decisions in secret and thus avoid moral responsibility. Unfortunately, this exaltation of the state can also corrupt a democratic polity. It is to be found whenever some eager social engineer in our own society subscribes to the attitude, expressed by Labour intellectual Douglas Jay in 1937, that housewives could not be trusted to buy the right food for their families as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the gentleman in Whitehall really does know better what is good for people than the people know themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>This dangerous arrogance is at total variance with the philosophy of the Liberal Party that I am proud to represent. It is a core belief of liberalism that markets will better serve the needs of individuals than government controls, simply because they are less easily manipulated. The collectivist assumption that each additional state power will be used for the common good is a proven lie. However, it is equally our belief that markets depend on morals, on the property rights that are the only firm guarantee of personal freedom, on governments upholding firm laws expressing conventions of decent behaviour. Disregard of this truth has cost us dearly over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Respect for individual worth and individual choice is essential as Australia goes forward into the next century, particularly given the current debate as to the continued validity of constitutional structures. Whether Australia continues as a monarchy or opts for a republican head of state, we need to discuss these alternatives without rancour. We must recognise that the role of head of state in a parliamentary liberal democracy must serve as a focus for national unity, and look to best achieving this purpose. Fidelity to national institutions should generally be regarded as a sign of a nation's maturity, but neither should all change be rejected. I respect the viewpoint of those for whom a Queen of Australia is not the same as an Australian Queen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who, like the great majority of Australians, wish to preserve the basic form of government that we have today might consider the other possibilities. A head of state, elected perhaps by popular vote, by a two-thirds majority of the members of this Parliament, or an electoral college that also included State parliaments, may provide a stronger check on a malign and reckless executive than would a governor-general appointed by the Prime Minister. It is a time for members of parliament to be asking questions rather than decreeing solutions. We must avoid the shallow, closed progressivism that is based on vision rather than argument, and that instead attacks the bona fides of questioners. What is essential is an honest debate on the matter of an appropriate head of state for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at this early stage, however, it is becoming apparent that Australians may not be given this opportunity and choice. Rather, the debate will be hijacked by those eager to vandalise our Federal Constitution, proceeding on the totally unproven hypothesis that the Constitution is out of date. We will not build anything of value in Australia if it involves rejecting the past. That soon degenerates into the gravest form of dishonesty, the falsification of history. Whenever Sir Robert Menzies is mocked for the royalism he expressed in the 1950s and 1960s, the values of a whole generation, coalition and Labor voters alike, are taken out of context, trivialised and insulted. It is incumbent on the proponents of an Australian republic to ensure that, in the event of a successful referendum being carried, continued reverence for a monarch who has served us with dignity is not stigmatised as unpatriotic or subjected to any governmental pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can take the positive benefits of the past with us into our chosen future directions without rejecting and denying our heritage and the very foundation stones of this great nation. In fact, it is essential that more Australians are informed about the truth of our history, which is that of an essentially tolerant society shaped by the rule of law. The most salient feature of the history of convict settlement was the fact that assigned convicts enjoyed the protection of the law and were able to attain freedom. It is a fact that the Irish component of our nation in the previous century was blended successfully with its Anglo-Scottish strains. In 1836 Governor Bourke ensured equal treatment of Christian denominations, avoiding the divisiveness of an established church. In 1846 in Victoria the public commemoration of the Protestant triumphalism of the Battle of the Boyne was prohibited, preserving an emerging nation from displays of sectarian hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last half century, Australia has successfully absorbed tens of thousands of immigrants who have learned to live together because they were joining a tolerant society and a culture that may not have encouraged public displays of difference but that set an immense value on civility in personal relations. The assimilation policy of the day was not perfect, but neither was it repressive. It is one of the great fallacies of the present time that the due recognition of non-Anglo-Celtic cultures should involve denial of the legitimacy and achievements of the host culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, rational debate on an Australian republic will be rapidly derailed once it becomes confused with a predictable and squalid assault on federalism, advocating the downgrading of the Senate and the removal of powers from the States. We must always recall the truism that republicanism need not equate with democracy, or the sovereignty of the people as opposed to the Executive. On four recent occasions Western Australians have voted consistently against centralising referenda, all of which have deservedly failed on a national basis. Proponents of centralism in Australia have to explain why Australians stubbornly refuse to entrust the Federal Government with greater powers. Centralism should be recognised as a discredited form of government, whose failure is most graphically illustrated in the debacle of the former Soviet Union, where centralised control destroyed initiative and resulted in a corrupt polity and economic ruin. Equally, it is no accident that the rebirth of postwar Germany as a liberal democracy and economic giant occurred in the framework of a federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Federal governments have only two realistic choices in regard to our federal system. They can choose to centralise by stealth, to let the system deteriorate, or they can put aside perceived self-interest, extend the hand of cooperation to elected State governments, and try to make the system work. To me, as a representative of Western Australia, the State which provides 24 per cent of Australian export revenue, it comes down to a fundamental question of equity. Western Australians want real solutions that involve States being sufficiently resourced to fulfil their responsibilities, and less bureaucracy rather than more at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Pearce understand the need for responsible government, but these are people who have that rare capacity to go quietly about solving their own and their community's problems. They understand the dignity of work and appreciate that the privilege of individual rights also brings with it responsibility for others. In Pearce, evidence of this great spirit abounds. Whether it is tackling the problems of land care, attending to the broader issues of environment, or in the areas of social justice and care for the aged, the youth, the unemployed or the family, these people demonstrate what can be achieved when communities are allowed to get on with running their own lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) and welcome her to the Parliament. She spoke the truth when she said that many Australians do not have a lot of faith in the political system; in fact, many Australians do not feel sovereign. This is partly because there is a lack of faith in parliamentarians. I think the honourable member feels it more in Western Australia, as would Queenslanders, because of the record of both of those States over the past 10 years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also a problem with people not feeling sovereign. There is a lot of buck-passing between governments. I firmly believe Australia is over-governed, with too many levels of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I also welcome you and other honourable members back to the Parliament. I welcome the new Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. I welcome particularly the high calibre of new members on both sides of the House. I believe this will mean that we will have a better Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important commitments were made in the Governor-General's speech. He talked about some important innovations, such as the proposed seniors card, financial help to partners at home, and assisting older people who may not be eligible for a pension and people who may need medication. We will help those people to cope a little better. We will help those people who are just over the border of pension entitlement. Men who have just reached 60 and who cannot find a job can now join women, who are entitled to a pension at age 60, in receiving a benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to tackle some very important issues, many of which were mentioned in the Governor-General's speech. The one I want to pick out concerns a commitment to look at the whole employment situation. I believe honourable members on both sides of the House have neglected to face the real truth about unemployment. They have failed to recognise that we have a different situation in Australia today. In 1961, for instance, the participation rate was much lower. Women, Aborigines and a whole lot of other people did not think they were entitled to register for jobs. It is now entirely different. The participation rate is much higher. This means that the unemployment rate of two or three per cent in 1961 was much tougher than the unemployment rate of about seven per cent we now have throughout much of my electorate. Today the participation rate is much higher and more families have both partners working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in many cases both partners work because they need to. But it is also true that we have things today that we did not have before. For instance, in 1961 I did not have a television set, I certainly did not have a video and about five years prior to that I did not even own a car. The situation is very different today. Most families have two cars, a video, a refrigerator or two and sometimes two television sets. We have different requirements today and there is nothing wrong with two partners working to meet those requirements. Anyone who wants to turn back the clock is not facing the facts about participation. I believe that human beings have great flexibility and can adapt to any situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our own region, we have important employment issues to face. The south-east region of New South Wales combines with the ACT to form a vast area of employment and some of the areas close to the ACT depend on jobs which are forthcoming. I remember talking to the Minister for the environment some years ago about how the creation of jobs should proceed in this region. We both felt that we should not rush into a whole lot of heavy construction works all at once and that the work should be spread out. The work which is coming up on the foreign affairs office and the Australian Museum is an important manifestation of our resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to think about other areas not so far away. In Cooma, for instance, the Government has decided to sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. But we need to ensure that the corporation stays in Cooma. The Federal Government has made some important moves in seeking to sell to the staff and I believe that is one way we can guarantee that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation will stay in Cooma. It is important that we complete the negotiations and come to terms with our responsibilities&mdash;both in terms of liabilities and management of the business&mdash;as soon as possible so that the people of Cooma and the workers in the corporation will know where they stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to make sure that our rural industries are as strong as possible. We have a successful dairy industry in the area and we need to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes which have been made in the past of allowing a lot of heavy growth with the prospect of people who have just come into the industry being hurt. We do not want to make the mistake of holding prices at an artificially high level, as happened in some instances in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry is absolutely vital to this region. Unlike many other areas, sheep farmers do not have a lot of alternatives. They can invest in cattle, but cattle are not suited to many areas of the Monaro where sheep are much more viable. We need to keep people on their farms so that they can become viable farmers and provide more wool when it is needed. We also need to ensure that we have wool which will sell: the wool that other countries want. Wool constitutes a pretty low percentage of total fibre sales when one includes man-made fibres and other fibre options, so the marketing of wool will be extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of very good alternatives in this area. I have just been told that a south-eastern food cooperative is talking about the mulching of wool, for which I believe it may be prepared to pay up to 486c. It is looking at that proposition and I hope that it will be successful, because we need to look at all of the possibilities for wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industries in the south-eastern forests, northern New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria are also extremely important. We need to get the balance right. We have had environmental studies in those areas over many years&mdash;indeed, decades. The Greens and the industry people can now work together. I talked to both sides before the federal election and they agreed to work with me to ensure that any restructuring which is necessary will take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the south-eastern forests I believe restructuring should be based on a proposition that was put forward by the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner. It ought to be brought into line with negotiations that are going on with the Victorian Government so that we can have an integrated south-eastern Australian timber industry which will proceed along the lines of the proposal which the Federal Government put to the New South Wales Government last year. This proposal may have approximately 50,000 to 60,000 hectares, which have already been set aside, declared as national park. That should be the basis of our action in relation to the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourist industry is vital to our region. It is a growing industry and a very high income earner for Australia. Along with a whole range of other industries, it gives us a great balance of trade advantage with the countries of South-East Asia, China, Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I believe we have a surplus of trade with those countries of over $10 billion. There are a lot more opportunities available to increase that surplus, including through tourism. The number of tourists who have come from Singapore recently is approximately 150 per cent higher than a year ago. Tourists from those countries are now interested in Australia. They are interested in snow, and the Snowy Mountains in the electorate of Eden-Monaro will be a great attraction for them. These tourists are also interested in golf, and Australia has some beautiful golf courses. All who have played on our golf courses, such as the one at Narooma with beautiful, picturesque views over the sea, are attracted to them. They are a great attraction to tourists from Asia because of the relatively low cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of jobs in the Public Service. We have the Public Service towns of Bega, Batemans Bay, Cooma and Queanbeyan working with Canberra so that we have decentralised services with people on the job locally. It is interesting to note that when a social security office was opened in Bega 10 or 11 years ago it was found that not only were a lot of people able to get better justice, better service and fairer treatment because the people were known locally, but those who were trying to defraud the system were found out much more quickly because local people know other local people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next suggestion is that we do need to look at our federal system come the turn of the century. We should look at local government because local government ought to be an arm of government which supplies far more services. It is all very well for us to do what we have been doing with State and local governments and say, `Here is a few bob. Here is some money. Why don't you have a go? Why don't you take up this federal or State responsibility? We will give you some money'. But the money is frittered away and they are told, `We can no longer afford to give it to you. Try to do it yourself'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have a local government system which has a rate raising or taxing system, preferably of its own. At least there needs to be a permanent link into the taxation system so that it can have access to funds, and preferably for it to determine the use of the funds. We should not get rid of the Senate. If we are getting rid of State governments we should keep the Senate and have a national house of parliament which represents local government. That would make the decisions and the House of Representatives would make sure those decisions were equitable across all of Australia and then ratify those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a different system, a national system which gets rid of the huge costs of duplication. This has been talked about by people as disparate as Sir Ninian Stephen and Ian Macphee, as well as a number of people in the Labor Party. They are some suggestions that ought to be looked at seriously. We would save many billions of dollars by having a change in our federal system. It would not only involve savings in taxes by cutting out duplication of jobs but also assist industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just two or three days ago Santos said that it was not able to sell gas across State borders easily because of the different State regulations. Not being able to sell a commodity within Australia because of different State regulations is intolerable. A plumber who moved from one State to another said to me, `I have been here for a year and I still cannot get registered. Even though I am registered in Victoria they will not register me in New South Wales'. Then there are incompatible transport systems. Until recently the Victorian road rules were different. They are the same as the other States now but they could be made different again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, with gun laws, a State or Territory only needs to panic and say, `We have got to do something about it. We are entitled to do it. We will do it', and once again there will be enormous differences. People do not feel sovereign because they cannot be sure that a person, a member of parliament or a councillor will be the right person to see. How many times do federal members get queries from people about State housing? How many times do we get queries from people about hospitals? Do we turn them away and tell them to go to someone else or do we try to deal with them? Naturally people do not feel sovereign because they cannot be sure where they have to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of drugs is another example where Australia has different laws. I can recall dispensing amphetamines in the ACT when they were illegal in all other States and Territories. This meant that truckies could come to the ACT, get 100 or 200 tablets, and sell them in other States; that could happen again. Even now we have people in States and Territories saying, `Let's reform our own drug laws and not worry about the rest of the country or the World Health Organisation'. The World Health Organisation may be wrong, but as a country we need uniform laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal system is an inefficient one that does not recognise the natural geographical boundaries. I have moved a motion in this House before which proposes a different system, which recognises local government as an important seat of power but with a larger number of full-time people. Brisbane, the ACT and Tasmania are good examples of natural regional boundaries for the type of government that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of drugs, I believe there should be drug law reform. I welcome the fact that Michael Moore, an MLA in the ACT, convened an all-party meeting in Canberra just a few weeks ago. People came from houses of parliament all over Australia prepared to talk about the need for drug law reform and to face the reality of the increasing problems in Australia because of the involvement of crime, not just organised crime but disorganised crime&mdash;petty crime, all sorts of crime. Women and old men are being knocked over and robbed of $1,500 so that those on drugs can get their week's supply of a drug which, even with a reasonable profit, should cost only $50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They adopted a measure, which I have recommended in this Parliament, which would bring a lot of the hard drugs under strict prescription control, as they were in the 1950s in Australia, before we fell for the trap set by the World Health Organisation when it said that there should be a ban on these drugs. What happened after the ban? Instead of people being prescribed their drugs regularly by their doctors, with the pharmacists dispensing them and the addicts paying $50 in today's value and taking them home, knowing that they could come back again in a week, these addicts are now robbing pharmacies, robbing doctors, robbing doctors' bags and stealing so that they can find $1,500 to have their drugs for the week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a different situation. We ought to face reality and bring these drugs under control because we now have a computerised system with doctors, pharmacists and clinics being prepared to be involved so that addicts can get what they are after. We have faced the facts on the prohibition of alcohol, and it does not work. Let us face the facts with other drugs and look at cannabis and its sale. </PARA>

<PARA>In my maiden speech delivered eight years ago I referred to Dame Mary Gilmore's reputation. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electorate was named in honour of one of Australia's great citizens, Dame Mary Gilmore. Some would criticise me for calling Dame Mary Gilmore a great Australian. They would point out that the differences in political philosophies between her and me would make my declaration somewhat suspect. However, to evaluate a person's worth to the nation using political beliefs as a main criterion is, I believe, an injustice. Surely the best way to evaluate the worth of an Australian is to view the contribution that he or she has made to his or her country, and Dame Mary Gilmore made a great contribution to Australia. She was one of our most noted authors and poets. Indeed, it is my privilege and honour to represent the electorate which bears her name.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that in comparing the quotation from my speech with the claims made by the honourable member for Gilmore last night, I will clear up the matter of misrepresentation. I just hope that in future the honourable member for Gilmore will not base his speeches on misrepresentations as he did last night.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General's speech opening the 37th Parliament of Australia must rank as one of the most longwinded and certainly one of the most boring speeches of any kind heard in this Parliament for some considerable time. In that speech we heard the vision of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for the future of this country&mdash;a dull litany of bureaucratic programs and policies that promise more of the same from this Government over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a speech totally devoid of ideas or inspiration. Australians listening to that speech&mdash;and I suggest that they would not have stayed listening for very long&mdash;would have gained the impression that the Australian Government had been hijacked by Sir Humphrey Appleby and his cronies down at gratuithe club. Such an impression would not have been too far from the truth, as the pay TV debacle so amply demonstrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the Government did not really expect to be re-elected, and so we have a tired Government, devoid of ideas, once again taking the helm but with no real idea of where it wants to go or what it wants to achieve during its coming term in office. Much of what was discussed in that speech merely reaffirmed the Government's intention to continue with programs commenced during the previous parliament and which have been such a resounding failure. Perhaps we should be thankful that the Government does not know what it is doing, lest it do even more damage than it has knowingly done in the past with its programs and policies. And I refer in particular to the deliberate engineering of the recession we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were a conspiracy theorist, one might come to the conclusion that the Government tried to force us into changing the arrangements for opening this Parliament by making the current arrangements so crushingly dull that we get down on our hands and knees and beg to be spared from another speech like the one we heard on Tuesday. Maybe the intention is to remove the vice-regal representation from this country by making the office so dull that people plead for it to be taken away. This, I might say, is intended as criticism of the content of the Government's speech rather than as a criticism of the traditions by which the Governor-General opens this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on this occasion one cannot help taking note of the massive irony under which the whole opening ceremony was forced upon us and the nation. We had a new government that was being sworn into office with the very oaths and traditions that the Government is committed to dismantling over the rest of the decade if given the green light to do so by the Australian people. Indeed, that process has already commenced with the Government removing references to the Crown from some oaths of allegiance and in other areas, and it has signalled its intention to continue to do that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be more ironic than the spectacle of the Governor-General reading a speech in which he is obliged to reaffirm the Government's stated intention to examine the options for becoming a republic. The indignity of this spectacle was compounded by the fact that the real announcement of the Government's intentions in this regard was not made to the Parliament but in a speech given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before a left wing think tank in Sydney last month. That an announcement of this type should be made before such a partisan audience is, of course, entirely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was the Prime Minister's speech given before a partisan audience; it also contained several paragraphs of thoroughly gratuitous criticisms of the Opposition&mdash;criticisms that bode ill for a non-partisan and constructive debate on the question of a republic in the years ahead. The Prime Minister was very careful in that speech, and in the terms of reference he set for the Republic Advisory Committee, to limit the debate to the question of the head of state and to avoid taking on board some of the broader constitutional questions that the republic issue inevitably raises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference of the committee require that any options it might come up with for a republic be such as to maintain `the effect of current conventions and principles of government as they apply in this country'. I will leave aside the question of whether we can, in fact, change the head of state and at the same time maintain those principles and conventions in their present form since that would raise enormously complicated legal issues, and they will be best addressed on another occasion or occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, I ask the fundamental question: what is achieved by changing the head of state while not otherwise changing the substance of our system of government? The answer must be, `Very little', unless one is particularly impressed by the symbolism that is said to reside in a change to the existing arrangements pertaining to our head of state. Of course, different people are impressed by different things, but I think that most Australians are not exactly feeling deprived of national symbols at present and can probably live without whatever symbolism might be thought to reside in a change to a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Australian Government to be engaged in a major national debate on an issue which is of only symbolic importance would seem to be an expensive indulgence for a country that faces so many other important challenges in the years ahead. If nothing else, it suggests a lack of national maturity that we should be about to spend so much time debating who we are rather than actually getting on with the job of being Australian and achieving the things for which we have been notable in the past and can be notable for in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there is an inevitable conflict between the Government's desire to establish an Australian republic&mdash;via its so-called minimalist position&mdash;and some of the more important constitutional issues which are likely to come up for debate as we approach the centenary of Federation in the year 2001. The political imperative for Labor will be to minimise the extent of constitutional change in order to maximise the chances of a republic succeeding at a referendum of the Australian people. This could mean that a number of important issues in the area of constitutional reform are swept aside for the sake of a largely symbolic change in the arrangements pertaining to this country's head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we have already seen the Constitutional Centenary Foundation being pushed aside by the Prime Minister to make way for his Republic Advisory Committee, thereby sidelining serious consideration of constitutional reform by the foundation. There is scope for improvement in our Constitution, but the areas of the Constitution which are probably in least need of reform are those provisions dealing with the head of state. It would seem that the republican push will succeed only at the expense of genuine constitutional reform and the way in which this country is governed will be none the better for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional debate has now been well and truly hijacked by the Prime Minister and that can only mean that the debate will be used for his own political ends at the expense of genuine constitutional reform in matters of substance. The principal danger in this whole process is that we will open the way for the head of state to become politicised, which would seem to be the inevitable consequence of such a debate as it is shaping up at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government in this country is likely to take a turn for the worse under a republic if we allow our head of state to become politicised contrary to the way in which our present head of state is notably above politics. For whatever may be said of our current head of state, perhaps her greatest virtue is that she minds her own business. If only the same could be said for the rest of government in this country. The risk we run with an elected President&mdash;be it through direct popular election or indirect election through this Parliament&mdash;is that we will end up with a highly politicised figure as head of state who will do everything but mind his or her own business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians already have more politicians than we either need or want and there seems to be little to be gained by adding yet another public nuisance to the list of the ones that we already have. Australians fundamentally want to get on with their lives in their own way without being lorded over by public officials, and that includes republican heads of state. The people do not need yet another public busybody to tell them how they should live their lives, which is the likely result of having a politicised head of state with his or her own popular mandate to make a pest of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our present head of state has the good sense and respect for her subjects to leave them in peace or, where necessary, to take the advice of the government of the day on those rare occasions when she is required to act. In short, there are some distinct advantages to the existing arrangements for this country's head of state that we would lose by becoming a republic. I quote what one political scientist had to say on the subject:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we must have anything so distasteful as a `head of state', then it is just as well that she be half a globe away and not settled in our midst.</PARA>
<PARA>However, he went on to put the debate in its proper context when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is important what rules and practices are adopted or prevail within the structure of a constitutional government, it is much less important what political form constitutional Government takes. By whom we are governed matters equally little: self-government is no substitute for good government.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, good government is not the principal concern of this Government in promoting the republic debate. The Government is more concerned with dividing the Liberal Party and the coalition than it is with genuine constitutional reform for the purposes of good government in this country. It would be a tragedy indeed if we marked the centenary of Federation by adopting an inferior form of government to the one with which we began the century all for the sake of some inconsequential symbolism and the partisan political purposes of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government's talent for politicising what should not be politicised, or does not need to be politicised, is amply demonstrated by some of the things said in the Governor-General's address delivered at the opening of this 37th Parliament. The Government's intentions in relation to the arts and cultural policy are particularly disturbing. The elevation of the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) to Cabinet level signals Labor's intention to further politicise the arts community for its own ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which the arts community has already been politicised by this Government was made painfully apparent during the election campaign when an unrepresentative group of artists jumped onto the ALP's campaign bandwagon and said that the re-election of a Labor government would be good for the arts. Of course, what they were really saying was that the re-election of Labor would be good for them, the artists, regardless of what it meant for the rest of the arts community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now they are to be rewarded with the Government's proposal to develop a cultural policy to be released by the end of this year which will no doubt supply certain individuals with some nice work at public expense. The very idea of a Commonwealth cultural policy should ring alarm bells with anyone concerned for the future of arts in this country. The view that the Commonwealth government should have primary responsibility for developing this country's cultural life is a dangerous one. The nation's culture should be the spontaneous product of its people's many and varied efforts in a variety of fields and not something that should be orchestrated by a government at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national cultural policy means coaxing the arts community into a dependence on the Commonwealth government for guidance and funding to an even greater extent than prevails at the present time. This is a recipe for patronage and corruption in the arts that can only serve to stifle creativity. We could well end up with a cultural community so beholden to the cultural commissars in Canberra that the cultural life of this country suffers as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also mean that many worthy cultural activities will suffer for lack of political influence in Canberra. Surely, it is for the Australian people themselves to decide which of the arts and which artists they wish to patronise and not for the Government to go around picking winners in the arts in the way that it tries to do in so many other areas. Nothing could be more damaging to the cultural development of our country than an arts community beholden to the Commonwealth Government in the way foreshadowed in the Governor-General's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the more curious of the initiatives flagged by the Government was its intention to establish a `Foundation for Australian Cultural Development', the purpose of which will be to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">help all Australians locate themselves within their country's . . . cultural landscape.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that most Australians would be surprised to learn that they need locating in their cultural landscape, much less that they should be obliged to pay for the privilege. It is typical of the arrogance of the Government that it can take on itself the role of shepherding the Australian people towards an unspecified cultural identity and destiny. Most Australians are perfectly comfortable with where they stand in relation to their cultural heritage and the last thing they need is for the Government to be running around and telling them how they can find themselves in this context. The reference in the address to arts and culture is typical of how out of touch this Government really is with the needs and interests of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's stated intentions in this area&mdash;as in so many others&mdash;reflect the interests of the Commonwealth bureaucracy at the expense of those of the rest of the population. The Government's program for the next three years is built around special interest groups. If they have a special interest, chances are there is something in the Government's address for them, however insignificant that something might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, there is relatively little discussion of the general mainstream interest, or the national interest, probably because the Government simply has no conception of the national interest with which to govern this country. The Governor-General's speech on the opening of this, the 37th Parliament, does not bode well for this country's future over the next three years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to the Governor-General's address, which marked the opening of this, the 37th Parliament, it is relevant to observe that the Government's policies for the next three years, outlined by the Governor-General in what was significantly great detail, evince a new and vigorous nation making a conscious decision, through the primacy of the ballot box, to go forward, both at home and abroad, with decency, equity and innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This election has been hailed as yet another watershed election&mdash;a term which is only too commonly applied; in fact, it is somewhat passe. Undoubtedly, it was an election which more clearly than any other in over 20 years represented an opportunity for the electorate to choose between two starkly differing political parties with diametrically opposing beliefs right across the policy platforms. It was an election which, based on Australian political precedent and conventional political wisdom, the Opposition should have been able to win. There was record unemployment. At one stage leading into the election the Opposition was 15 per cent in front in the polls and we had an incumbent government seeking a fifth term following a bad recession. It is, of course, part of the living history of this place that those opposite are now doing much soul searching to find out what went wrong from their perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political scientist Malcolm Mackerras who is sometimes pilloried for his observations and predictions has&mdash;I believe most adeptly&mdash;identified the symptoms but not the cause of the electorate's decision. The Australian people, to paraphrase Mackerras, voted for the party of least change, as they saw it, and the party of greater certainty&mdash;a decision which should not surprise any of us in this place, given the traditional conservative nature of Australians. Of course, when I say conservative, I do not necessarily mean politically conservative; I mean conservative in their outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, however, does not explain the cause of the last election result. The answer is simple: for 10 hard, long years Labor governments have taken one difficult decision after another, only to be met at every turn with blatantly shallow attempts by those opposite to extract political mileage above all else. Those opposite&mdash;mostly by implication, but particularly in the fundamentals of Fightback&mdash;said that there was a better way; their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's problem was that in the full and robust debate that was unleashed by a national election in this country over a full five-week period the nation decided for itself&mdash;as families, as individuals, as employers, as employees&mdash;that in fact there was no better way than what was being undertaken by the Government. They decided that the only alternative on offer to meet the national aspirations, to heal our problems, was a radically repugnant change to the fundamentals of their lives and their country. The crux in short is that given an alternative, they endorsed the realism of this Government's course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Labor it was politically a reward for courage and for vision displayed over 10 years. Not for a moment did the electorate reject the concept of change itself; it rejected the type of change on offer. I think that Australians, whether they be in suburban Sydney, in the outback of Queensland or anywhere else in this country now know that the only constant for this country in the foreseeable future is change itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This goes to the heart of the matter of the Governor-General's address, which is the manifestation of this Labor Government's mandate. Australians gave us a mandate, clearly and unequivocally. They voted for what they saw quite rightly as rational people making policy based on principles, not people with prejudices claiming rationality. If two policy areas can be singled out above all else, education and health were perhaps the most obvious examples of this choice and of our mandate. But let it be said very quickly that the economy, industrial relations, sport, social security and so much more&mdash;particularly, I might say, Aboriginal affairs and immigration&mdash;were not far behind as obvious examples of this choice, this mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the basic message that has to be understood, by those opposite in particular, is that we on this side of the House, individually and collectively, have shown on five occasions that we understand that ordinary Australians essentially want two things for their kids above all else, although not to the exclusion of all else. Above all else, ordinary Australians want two things for their kids. First, they want their kids' health. They want to know that they are well; they want to know that if they get sick they can make them well without breaking the family financially. Second, they want those kids educated. They want them to have a chance at what Australia's popular radio commentator John Laws repeatedly calls `keeping the dream alive'. They want that hope, that aspiration for their kids. I think all parents like to think that their children will do just that little bit better than their mum or dad; at least, if they cannot do that, they want to give their children the opportunity to do better than their mum or their dad. It is the Australian way; it is our version of the national dream. It is the aspiration of ordinary people. It is not an aspiration that any political party can or should have the right to assign only to those people with inherited wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was one of the symptoms. In the end it was only those people with inherited wealth who could bring themselves to identify with the Liberals. From the Liberals they got a health policy which they knew would endanger the basic right to health of themselves and their kids. The Liberals, it must be said, spent an awfully long time trying to woo the young in the lead-up to the election&mdash;as did the health funds for their own particular purposes. Over the last 12 months in particular the Liberal message on health was one that perhaps some of those young people have heard in a well-known rock song by the Irish band U2. It goes along these lines: `the rich stay healthy and the sick stay poor'. That was what the Liberals' health policy meant to young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In education Australians saw the right of access for their kids to university and to TAFE colleges on the basis of scholastic merit being threatened for the first time since 1972. If the honourable member opposite has any doubt about that, she should have come and stood on a few railway stations with me in Sydney. What was being proposed for education by those opposite went absolutely to the core of ordinary Australians' aims and aspirations, not only for themselves but for their kids. Of all the alternative Liberal and National Party policies that were on offer at the last election, the education plank of those opposite was by far the most elitist and the most repugnant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Liberals and the Nationals, the Nationals tagging on behind like mules in a horse race, both managed to do was to create a new class divide, a new class consciousness not just based on wealth or income, as political scientists hitherto have so described it but more fundamentally on access and equity. Access and equity became issues. They came alive to the ordinary Australian. The Australian people rejected that divide as unethical and un-Australian. Our mandate, by contrast, is underpinned by a social consciousness that says that every Australian who needs help has a right to that help. </PARA>

The Australian electorate does not see these as radical any longer; rather, I submit, people see them as overdue.

Another question was, `Why can't we have Medicare any more?'. This was a group of 11-year-old Australian children who believed the absolutely unbelievable because they had been virtually brainwashed by the television election campaign of this Government.

The Prime Minister and some others tend to get carried away about their desire for a republic. I still think that is a red herring. I still believe that what is important for those of us who have been privileged enough to be elected or re-elected to this Parliament, and what is important for all of us, is the economy. This should be the focus of our total attention when one million people still are unemployed&mdash;and, if we add in the number of people underemployed, the figure would probably be closer to two million. Then there is the balance of payments figure of $2.1 billion. It is only one month's figure but, when added to all the others, it makes an enormous number indeed. </PARA>

So far this session this Parliament has improved in terms of Question Time behaviour by comparison with the last parliament. Mind you, it is early days yet. Who knows what will happen in the future? I, for one, very strongly believe that we all need to cooperate to have the Parliament work in a more harmonious and less rowdy way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Particularly when the honourable member interjecting is speaking, yes; I acknowledge what he said. For most of the day there is very little uproar. What people should realise is that in the parliamentary committee system there is an almost totally bipartisan approach, with members of the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Australian Democrats and the Independents working together very closely for the benefit of Australia. This is a side of the Parliament that people do not see and of which they are not aware. It is our responsibility to help people understand just what goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made those general remarks, I would like to deal with some specific matters. As I said when I came into the chamber, I was not expecting to speak until after the suspension of the sitting for dinner, so I am shuffling papers for the moment, trying to find, in the right order, some of the very many things about which I need to speak. First,  I congratulate the Banana Growers Federation of New South Wales, the body organising the banana industry in that State as the COD does in Queensland. I am very pleased to announce to this Parliament that there has been a breakthrough in export development. In the past, there have been trial shipments of bananas to New Zealand, but there has always been some difficulty competing with bananas from Ecuador. Trevor Miller, the chairman of directors of the Banana Growers Federation, from Macksville in my electorate, has announced a trial shipment of two cartons of bananas to Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that, although the Greek authorities tested our bananas for radiation and disease problems before considering New South Wales as a major source of supply, the fruit passed with flying colours. The next step is to send a 600-carton container load to Athens. If that goes as well as expected&mdash;I am sure this will be of interest to the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who also represents some wonderful banana growers in the northern part of the State&mdash;Greece is looking at importing three or four containers of our bananas each week. Each container will return to growers a net $6,000. So we are therefore looking at a new market worth a million dollars a year. That is excellent. I am very pleased about it. There is even talk of marketing the fruit in Greece as Aussie Kanga bananas. That is very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting point is that we can compete with Greece's usual supplier, Ecuador, because the Greek Government has a 20 per cent tariff on bananas from South America. Our bananas get in tariff free. Perhaps there is a little lesson there for all of us looking at the level playing field. For once, that alleged level playing field&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;is working in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the fact that, as a result of legislation coming up in the New South Wales Parliament later in the year, the University of New England's Coffs Harbour campus will combine with the Lismore campus of the University of New England to become the University of the North Coast. It will be a separate university college, probably under the parenthood of the University of New South Wales, or perhaps the University of Sydney, which actually parented the fledgling University of New England decades ago. I am very pleased that this is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) is in the chamber, and I say particularly to him that in the long-term or even in the medium-term there should be a campus for the University of the North Coast at Port Macquarie. That would certainly complement the campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour. It is appropriate that the funding should be maintained specifically for each of those campuses. I am not throwing spears at anybody, but it is a fact that, in the past, federal funding earmarked for the university campus in Coffs Harbour was somehow siphoned off to the campus in Armidale. The rationale for that was that there were people from the coast being educated at Armidale anyway. I have written to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and made it very clear that as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I believe this Parliament should endorse this&mdash;there should be some specific provision for earmarking funding for the Coffs Harbour campus of the University of the North Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I want to mention in this debate is my concern about small abattoirs. There are two in my electorate: one at Repton, operated by the Perry family, and the other at South West Rocks, operated by Kevin Ball. There is another one at Murwillumbah in the seat of Richmond which had a very tough trot because of the funding of beef inspection. The cost has gone up substantially, making the situation totally unfair. The figures are not exact, but the cost of meat inspection has increased from something like $60 to over $336 a week. This should be looked at. These small abattoirs are important employers in local areas. We must bear in mind that the north coast of New South Wales has incredibly high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to deal with my concerns for the armed services of this country. Most people are unaware of the  frightful situation regarding funding in our defence forces. We see a lot of publicity about the wonderful job&mdash;and it is a wonderful job&mdash;that we are doing in Somalia and Cambodia, but it is absolutely true that our defence forces are underfunded. Defence spending has declined both in terms of outlays and as a percentage of government spending. The Australian Defence Force is short in a number of capabilities. Since the Government decided to reduce the number of infantry battalions from six to four, there has been a shortage of available troops, and United Nations commitments are overstretching the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no money for bullets for training infantry, and there is no fuel for ships. Ships cannot be driven without fuel. Pilots and aircraft in the Royal Australian Air Force are not getting adequate flying hours because of the lack of funding. There is not enough money for the long advocated airborne early warning aircraft system. The lack of funding has meant that the option for an additional two submarines will not be taken up. Many other areas of ADF supply are very low and would present very severe problems if the Australian Defence Force were required to deploy a significant force at short notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very often there is no funding available for travel and subsistence for members of the armed services undertaking activities. They can get a field allowance, but it is far less than the normal travel and subsistence allowance, and even that has been cut out. I invite honourable members to check this for themselves if they doubt me. We have Leopard tanks which are incredibly old: they are not regarded as a main battle tank anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two years our armoured corps is going to be totally non-effective. We should have three sabre or front-line active squadrons. We had one with a reserve, with two regulars, but now one has gone to the Ready Reserve and we have only one regular squadron in the armoured corps. Anybody with any knowledge of the Australian Army&mdash;as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has&mdash;will agree that it is not a satisfactory situation. We still have many regulars in the Ready Reserve squadrons, but within two years they will be gone and we will be left with only one regular sabre squadron; and that is not enough to be operational in a battle situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ready Reserve trainees do 50 days a year. It is totally inadequate. One general reserve squadron is not enough; 6 RAR is under half strength; and our infantry battalions have platoons with a lieutenant as a platoon commander but with no soldiers to command. This is a dreadful indication of the future of our defence forces. In Sydney, 5/7 RAR would be lucky to fill two companies out of four; 3 RAR is understrength; and so it goes on. There are very strong rumours in the defence forces that promotion for junior officers will be frozen for the next 18 months. </PARA>

If we have junior officers of the Australian Defence Force believing that they will not get promotion for the next 18 months because all promotions will be frozen, it is extraordinarily bad for morale. I believe that the Australian defence forces are made up of excellent men and women&mdash;they have my total support&mdash;but I do not believe that this Government is doing the right thing by them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the strategic considerations for supporting more defence spending, we have to remember that the United States is reducing its military power in our region. President Clinton is further cutting United States defence spending. The Philippines bases have gone. There are a number of intractable trouble spots in our region&mdash;Bougainville and Papua New Guinea with general instability, Timor, Cambodia, the Spratly Islands area where China is very interested, and Fiji where Rabuka is really sitting on an ethnic and social powder keg. With this environment in our backyard, it is vitally important that we continue to properly fund our defence forces. It is totally irresponsible if we continue to cut into defence outlays. </PARA>

In the last Budget, defence expenditure went up by $500 million. In conventional terms, it was a real increase of four per cent. The total defence outlays at $10 billion is 2 1/2 times more than the Government allocates for all universities and all post-secondary education in Australia. The level of defence funding is 2.4 per cent of GDP. As a proportion of national income, it is at the same level now as it was at the beginning of the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your election and wish you great success as an eminent, intelligent and fair Speaker. We were elected to parliament at the same time, and I am sure that you are likely to achieve those goals. I want to use this opportunity to speak about employment particularly because, as the Governor-General said in his speech on Tuesday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing unemployment remains the ultimate focus of all the government's economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it must be. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to progress on this front will be the continued application of policy settings that achieve the maximum sustainable rate of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, growth holds the key to reducing unemployment to more acceptable levels.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly true. It is essential that we build up the rate of economic growth so as to maximise the rate of employment growth in normal ways. The question is, though, how do we do that? I think there is an issue about the macro-economic settings which have to be addressed. The Governor-General went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's aim is to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that that is making too much of a goal which really is an intermediate goal. If we want to reduce unemployment we have to maximise the level of economic activity through every means at the Government's disposal. Amongst those has to be its own expenditure and its own monetary policy. I think it is important to examine what we are talking about when we are talking about a Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is conventional in Australia to regard the Budget deficit as the difference between total outlays and total revenue. That is really a very simplistic way of looking at it, because at the very least there are two very different types of outlays. There are recurrent outlays, such as salaries, transfer payments to the social security recipients, and so on, and there are capital outlays which are used for building infrastructure or hospitals or schools or whatever. It is quite legitimate to say that revenue should be equal to or greater than recurrent outlays, but that borrowing should be, by and large, used for funding investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seem to have forgotten that important economic distinction. It is now being talked about a lot in the United States. President Clinton has been giving renewed emphasis to the building of infrastructure in the US. Robert Reich, one of his advisers, has published a very important book called, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Work of Nations </EMPHASIS>and it makes this distinction. Other eminent economists in the US are doing so as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the New Zealand Government, with whom I am sure colleagues on my side would have many points of dispute, has introduced a system of public accounting which does distinguish between recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure, not least for this reason that the economic effects of those two forms of expenditure are quite different. Even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, the conservative <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which is a very useful source of information but which has many very conservative views&mdash;in an editorial not long ago stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . borrowing for investment by governments is appropriate because `future generations who enjoy the benefits of that investment will pay for it through higher interest payments.' This `seems to give reflation a ring of prudence.'</PARA>
<PARA>If a conservative mainstream news magazine at that time&mdash;with a very intelligent approach to reporting the news, it must be said&mdash;can make that kind of comment, I think that we can seriously consider that sort of approach here as well. If we do that, then the kind of deficit fetishism which has characterised much debate about fiscal policy in Australia becomes far less important. We were even criticised for that by the Brooklands Institute team that came to Australia in the early 1980s. They talked about the Treasury `frightening of the bourgeoisie' with the Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a tendency amongst the people who are called economic rationalists and the official advisers in a number of departments, to give a lot of attention to reducing outlays, to overemphasise the Budget deficit rather than looking more analytically at the various parts of outlays and the various forms of revenue, and seeing what the economic consequences are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that we should give a bit less attention to the overall deficit, a bit more attention to recurrent outlays and matching revenue, and concentrate rather more on those policies which will lead to economic growth which depends principally on the level of investment and that is both public investment and private investment. It has to be predominantly private investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the elements of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS>, which was released during the election, and which gave me greatest pleasure, was the announcement that an investment allowance would be introduced which would apply for just a couple of years. It would be at the rate of 10 per cent, and a 10 per cent reduction on tax paid, as long as the investment occurred in that period. That has the obvious advantage of encouraging enterprises to bring forward investment that they might have deferred indefinitely. Knowing that other firms are going to do the same thing will have the cumulative effect of increasing investment in the next couple of years when we need it most to get out of this severe recession which we have been in and from which we are starting to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other pieces of information that was included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> was on the level of Government debt in Australia. Together with frightening people about the deficit, another way of arguing for reductions in outlays or restraint on outlays has been to point to the high level of overseas debt. It is true that we as a nation do have a high level of overseas debt, but it is predominantly private debt. It is not government debt. In fact, the level of government debt in Australia is very low indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister showed in a table that was included in his statement that gross public debt in Australia in 1991 was only 26 per cent of gross domestic product of national income. That was the second lowest in the OECD, amongst Western industrialised countries. For Western countries the average level of government debt was 60 per cent of national GDP. In Australia, it is 26 per cent. The only country which has a smaller debt is Finland which has a debt of 21 per cent of its GDP. Every other country: the United States, for example, 60 per cent; the Netherlands, 77 per cent; Canada, 78 per cent; and so on, right up to Belgium which has a public debt of 132 per cent of its national income. These are much higher than that in Australia. The significance of that is that it gives us the freedom to borrow in order to invest when we need to do so. Now, more than ever, is the time that we need to do so. That was the central thrust of the One Nation statement. That was the rationale for the increase in outlays on public infrastructure, and that is what we can continue in the next Budget and even in the Budget after that, if the economy has still not picked up at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to talk about a couple of other aspects of employment policy because it is quite clear, as the Governor-General said in his speech, that additional policies are required. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we also acknowledge that new policies and practices may have to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no doubt about that, and it is very good to know that work is going on within the Government to design new policies which will have the effect of building up employment. There are no panaceas, and no-one has all the answers. We should be looking for good ideas wherever they can be found. In fact, there were some very good ideas in the maiden speech made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) this morning, which I would strongly endorse and encourage the Government to look at very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) mentioned in her maiden speech this morning that most employment growth is likely to come from small business. I think she is right about that. The evidence is that that is what has been happening in recent years. What can the Government do to encourage employment growth in small business? The most important is to reduce interest rates, to keep interest rates as low as possible. The level at which interest rates have to be set is a question of judgment; it is a complex judgment. It depends on the impact on the exchange rate in particular, and on what is happening to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what is likely to be a one-off high current account deficit, which was announced this week, I do think that there is some scope for some further fall in interest rates. They have come down a great deal in the last couple of years. But I think that, because the economy is still relatively recessed, because it would do no harm at all if the exchange rate were a little lower, and because countries which have a strong influence on our interest rate are also reducing their interest rates, there may well be scope for a further small reduction here&mdash;maybe another half a per cent, and possibly another one per cent in due course. That has to be looked at very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the availability of capital. In the last two or three years there has been a problem: the banks, which were severely damaged by their excesses in the 1980s, have been too restrictive in their lending practices. Mr Speaker, you prepared a very interesting report for Parliament on the banking system. It made a number of recommendations which were very important. It is important for the Government to keep urging the banks to be as imaginative and as creative as they can be in their lending policies. It may be that additional institutional changes are required in order to ensure that capital is available for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I had a very useful discussion with a senior private banker. He said that, in his judgment, there is still a gap in the capital market for lending to smaller and medium businesses which do not have physical assets to offer as security on their borrowing. That is a major problem. Companies often depend principally on the intellectual capacities of their staff and, therefore, they do not own the buildings in which they work. For example, a computer software firm&mdash;one I am particularly familiar with in Canberra&mdash;does not own its building. It has a staff of 25 and has a good order book. One would think that the order book would be enough security to warrant additional lending, but it was not sufficient when the company went for an increase in its overdraft so as to expand its equipment base. That sort of restriction on the availability of working capital is a severe constraint on the expansion of some of the more dynamic smaller and medium businesses. We should be looking for every possible way to address that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday it was interesting to hear the Vice-President of the World Bank speak to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He said that most of the growth in Taiwan, which has had an enormously successful economic performance over the last three decades, has been through small business. In fact, the 60 largest companies in Taiwan are responsible for exporting only 5 per cent of its exports. Most of Taiwan's exports are from quite small companies, and that economy is very dispersed. In Korea, five companies are responsible for about 80 per cent of its exports. Korea has a totally different economic system. If we were to look for an example of a country which has successfully built up its exports, Taiwan is a good country to look to. Taiwan has larger reserves of foreign exchange than Japan. Part of the reason for its success has been the effectiveness of its small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other aspects of policy. For the next year we will have to debate many additional policies in this House&mdash;frequently, I hope&mdash;in order to stimulate growth in employment. No person, no school of thought and probably no party has all the answers on this issue. It is extraordinarily difficult to deal not only with a million unemployed but with 400,000 long-term unemployed people. It must be our highest priority. I commend the Government for giving it that emphasis, and I hope that this debate and others like it will provide a forum for ideas to be presented. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Tuesday we were subjected to what could only be described as a disgraceful, boring speech written by the Government for the Governor-General to deliver. I confess that I nodded off five times in the first half hour of the speech. It was 25 pages in length, went for about an hour, and has now become known as the alphabetical speech&mdash;going from A for Aborigines to W for women. As important as those two segments are, had they been taken out the speech could have been shortened to about 15 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having reached W for women, I would have liked to have seen the speech go further to W for wheat and especially to W for wool. Those two great industries were not even mentioned, although wool is Australia's No. 1 industry and is in diabolical trouble at the moment. The theme of what I have to say this evening can be embodied in the words of the prominent poet Dame Edith Sitwell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the public will believe anything&mdash;so long as it is not founded on truth.</PARA>
<PARA>In saying that, I am referring to Labor's election campaign. On 13 March, Labor scored a largely unexpected win. In the House of Representatives it scored the greatest proportion of votes and seats in both Territories: the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory; it polled most votes in three of the six States: New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria; and it also won most seats in three States: New South Wales, Tasmania and Queensland. It won by a narrow margin and, for the first time since 1984, polled more primary votes than the coalition right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor won 80 seats against the coalition's 65, made up of 49 Liberal and 16 National. There are two Independents who mostly vote with the Government, particularly on substantial matters. Although the Government has virtually doubled its majority in the House of Representatives, its uniform margin to lose has actually decreased markedly to between 0.5 and 0.6 per cent. I think that 1,550 votes across eight electorates would have changed the government. The margin the Government holds is considerably thinner than is generally realised, and I state that because the media has painted it as a 100 or a zero per cent situation. Had there been 1,500 votes the other way the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) would have been painted as a courageous visionary instead of being written off as a politically naive person for having told the Australian people the truth about what needed to be done before the election rather than after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, having said that, we live in a democracy. The Labor Party has won and I congratulate it for that. Winners are grinners, so the saying goes, and the rest can please themselves. I guess there is another pertinent saying: all's fair in love, war and politics. But, regrettably, in the last election campaign the Labor Party stretched even a robust interpretation of that saying to its limits and well beyond. In short, it lied its way into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking about the orthodox scare campaign those opposite ran against the GST. In a democracy that is legitimate. One may think it is sad, wrong and regrettable, but it is legitimate and all political parties of all colours always exaggerate their good points and gloss over their bad. They sometimes stretch credibility past its limits by waxing lyrical about the consequences of their policies and try to scare the pants off the voting public about the perceived dire effects of their opponent's platform. It might not be what we would want in a perfect world&mdash;and I suppose it is no wonder the public sometimes holds us in such low regard and views us with cynicism.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I freely confess that the coalition has indulged in all of these dubious but timehonoured tactics since the formation of our parties, as previous Labor members and governments have done. As Churchill said, democracy is the worst system in the world except for all the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this election was different. The Labor Party and its cohorts smashed the bedrock of acceptability and plumbed depths that most people never knew existed. The major distortion Labor members mouthed&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did it too&mdash;was that a 15 per cent GST would be slapped on everything. Leaving aside the fact that the tax certainly did not apply to everything, at best this was a half truth because it did not mention all the complicated taxes that were already applied and all of which would come off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can live with that sort of distortion; it is par for the course for the Labor Party and I have grown used to it. But I do take offence when a party goes beyond even that and resorts to a host of persistent and deliberate lies as part of its scare campaign. I, for one, have never seen anything like what the Labor Party resorted to at the last election. It is worth putting on record some of its shameful transgressions, from the simple to the more blatant. </PARA>

Once those taxes had come off, the price of toothpaste would have actually come down. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is also talking about ripping up Medicare, proposing that people will pay a $32 up-front fee after a visit to the doctor.</PARA>
<PARA>We never said that at all. In fact, we believed that consultations would come down after the removal of taxes that doctors had to pay on their computers, furniture and so on. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every worker would be forced to take out private health insurance, at an added cost of about $20 per week (for a family).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be no payments of accumulated sick leave or pro-rata long service leave.</PARA>
<PARA>And so he went on, preying on the fears of pensioners in Broken Hill and the 500 people who had just been so tragically sacked. I think that is not only despicable but also ironic. Pasminco lost $9 million last year on its Broken Hill operation and $6 million of that came out in payroll tax and another $3 million in the sales tax, fuel tax and freight tax that it paid. In other words, if a GST had come in, Pasminco would have lost nothing and would not have had to sack 500 workers. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) said that beer would go up by nine per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Net of all deductions, the price of beer at a bar in a hotel (will be) an extra nine per cent, after taking into account all of the alleged fightback tax reductions.</PARA>
<PARA>The calculations clearly show that the price of the average middy would go up about 5c, which again, ironically, is about the amount that the price of a middy went up during the election campaign due to other factors. We would have taken the automatic indexation away after that. I have a letter from the Australian Workers Union which it sent to every union member in my electorate. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson also wants to dismantle Medicare, forcing many people into paying for expensive private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say&mdash;and this is the daddy of them all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Dr Hewson will impose a 15% Consumption Tax (GST) on . . . petrol.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose, in a sense, that is right. We were going to put a 15 per cent GST on petrol which would have added 7c per litre to the price of petrol. But there is no mention of the 26c per litre which would have come off and would have meant cheaper petrol for the members of the Australian Workers Union. It would have helped those people driving from shearers shed to shearers shed because petrol would have come down by 19c per litre. Actually, because they were in business, the price of petrol would probably have come down by 26c per litre. John Della Bosca, in his pamphlet, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hewson would make private health insurance virtually compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA>He added that the losers in this would be the elderly. Medicare would have been left exactly as it was for the pensioners, bulk-billing would have stayed and, on top of that, we would have given $800 per couple towards taking out private health insurance plus a whole host of other benefits which I do not have time to mention. In a letter to its members in my electorate, the Metals and Engineering Workers Union said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberals would break up the Medicare System . . . a worker can be bankrupted if they are not insured . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare would have stayed exactly as it was, apart from bulk-billing, and when people got the doctor's bill they could have taken it to Medicare as they do now with most doctors, received their rebate and paid the doctor with that. It also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost every purchase you would make will be 15% dearer.</PARA>

I told him that it was a State matter&mdash;it had nothing to do with us&mdash;and that we were not abolishing it. He was horrified, but the damage was done&mdash;another lie was told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another letter here authorised by Derek Cafferty, Secretary of the CFMEU, which states that houses will be unaffordable if the coalition is elected because 15 per cent will go on to the price of clay, and then on to the price of bricks, and then will be added again to the price of the contractor who buys the bricks, and then the bricklayer who lays the bricks.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The goods and services tax will increase education costs by 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another lie. Education was going to be zero rated and, if anything, would have come down in cost. In an article put up in every office in my electorate where his union members work, Joe de Bruyn, the National Secretary of the Shop Distributive Association, said that the $3 an hour for young workers was a slave wage and that all 20-year-olds would suffer a wage cut of $205.90 a week. Leaving aside the fact that he supports a party which has delivered 35 per cent youth unemployment, he implies that all youth wages will be cut to between $3 and $3.50 an hour. This was the absolute minimum for those who were out of work and we believed that at least 100,000 of those people could have got new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he thought that $3 was a slave wage, how does he defend&mdash;because he is a supporter of the ACTU&mdash;that the gas industry minimum award wage for a 15-year-old is now $2.78 an hour, after tax, for a 38-hour week. The minimum under the metal trades award is now $2.90 an hour and under the vehicle industry award it is now $3 an hour. The under 18-year-old, staying at home on the dole, is on $1.68 an hour and even the 20-year-old at home on the dole gets $2.03 an hour. As part of our policy at that time we were not only going to pay that, but we were going to give them free off-the-job training for two days per week for two years and allow them to retain all their social security concessions as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Metal Worker</EMPHASIS>, which is published by the Automotive, Metals and Engineering Union, is interesting.

The intestines are labelled `penalty rates', `hours of work',` public services', `awards', `education', et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the trade union movement has been reduced to in its desperation to have the Labor Party returned. Just before I came into the chamber I heard that Bob Hogg had authorised a letter to go to pensioners in one marginal electorate saying that the eight per cent compensation for the two per cent that the GST was going to cost them was only going to apply for one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election is over and the Labor Party has won; I acknowledge that. But since then the lies seem to have gone on. We have had the industrial relations backflip. The Prime Minister read out an almost word perfect document of the coalition's policy on industrial relations before Bill Kelty rang him up and got him to slip in a bit saying that the trade unions would still have their power. The Government has jettisoned the promise to establish a department of regional development, which was in its February launch. That is the second of the 153 promises made by the Prime Minister that has been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one, of course, was the promise that he made that all age and service pensioners would be exempt from the tax system by 1995. When he was queried in the week after the election as to why he had broken that promise, he said, `Oh, that was something that was made quite some time ago; it wasn't brought up during the election campaign'. Well, it was in the papers that he handed out at his February launch. But he denied it. He said, `Nobody was using it. No Ministers were saying that'. I have here a brochure handed out by a very senior Minister in the Federal Government in the election campaign. It is headed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor pledges new benefits for senior citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Tax', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remove all age and service pensioners from Tax System by 1995</PARA>
<PARA>Further down it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Printed and authorised by Simon Crean 6 Atherton Road Oakleigh 3166. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is another Labor lie. This seems to be par for the course. I guess it is something we are going to have to get used to over the next three years. The Prime Minister seems to have set a new standard which I think will not only disappoint Australian people, but will divide Australia, particularly when the Prime Minister shows his prejudices on this monarchy-republican debate. When that is combined with the promises he has made in the past and the promises he is going to break in the future, I think we are going to have a pretty grim three years ahead. The Labor Party probably can take no joy at all from the way in which it has won the election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As this is the first occasion on which I have spoken in this Parliament, I would also like to take the opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees  He is a person who is well regarded in the chamber and I think that the comments that were made on his election to that position a day or two ago stand testimony to his record in this place. I would also like to make some comment on the record about what I think has been seen quite rightly as a very high standard of contribution over the last couple of days by those members making their first speeches. I think all members would agree that those new members of the Parliament on both sides have contributed very significantly to the debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also take this opportunity to record my sadness that some of our colleagues from the previous Parliament, the 36th Parliament, are not with us here today. I wish to mention just a couple of them, the first being the former member for Stirling, Ron Edwards, who was one of the true gentlemen and human beings of this place. It is a loss to this Parliament that we no longer have Ron Edwards amongst us. I must say that as a Queenslander, I am particularly sad that Brian Courtice, the former member for Hinkler, and Rob Hulls, the former member for Kennedy, are not here. I will miss those occasions late in the evening when there seemed to be a spontaneous eruption of Queensland members in this House, usually on industrial relations debates. Queensland members, of course, have had to deal with some of the most draconian industrial legislation this country has seen in some 60 or 70 years. Regrettably, that record is now being matched by conservative governments in other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of days the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and members of the Opposition have continued to demonstrate that they have learnt very little from the decisions which the Australian people took in the election earlier this year. The Leader of the Opposition's speech on the opening of the Parliament and his comments on the appointment of the office-bearers in this place again demonstrated that he was the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Leader of the Opposition seemed like a person about to embark on a campaign out in the electorate, rather than somebody reflecting on the decisions which the Australian people took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the decisions the Australian people took, what comes to mind first and foremost is the goods and services tax, although in many respects it was overrated. The goods and services tax was a regressive proposal designed with the inevitable outcome of injuring ordinary Australians, providing a benefit to those who are already better off, and it was seen by the Australian electorate in that way. Many people whom I spoke to during the campaign and in the year or so before were openly concerned about how they would make ends meet week to week if those things which they bought on a regular basis were subjected to an additional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people at the outset understood that there would be some tax on the things they bought at the supermarket. But as it became clearer to Australians that it was not just the goods that were purchased on a regular basis but also the services that they used on a regular basis that would be affected by a goods and services tax, more and more Australians decided they would be worse off if the Liberal Party won the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not without warning. There are enough people on the other side of the House who were told time and time again in this chamber and outside that the goods and services tax was both wrong and unpopular. It is interesting to see how many of yesterday's advocates are today's critics of the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the Liberal and National parties have gone about their internal navel contemplation since their defeat does them little credit. It does the National Party in particular little credit, because, of all the interest groups represented by those opposite, the National Party stood to lose the greatest yet it tagged along with the Liberal Party policy for a goods and services tax and it paid the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare was one of the issues which seldom rated front-page billing but which, in the minds of average Australians, weighed heavily. One of the points which seemed to have been lost on the Opposition prior to the election and, it would appear, after the election is that the Australian people place enormous weight on ensuring that their health and their children's health can be properly cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we have one of the best health systems available in the world&mdash;a health system which is being looked at by Canadian authorities, the new American Administration and the New Zealand conservative Government as a model from which they want to learn&mdash;yet the Opposition went to the people of Australia with a proposal to disband Medicare as we know it today and, as with its industrial relations policy, attempted to camouflage that by saying Medicare would be kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people, though, knew that Medicare was not just the name; it was the service they relied on&mdash;the opportunity to know that if their children were ill they could go to a doctor without concern for meeting the bill. One of the things that seemed to elude the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow health spokesperson, the former honourable member for Lowe, Dr Bob Woods, when they discussed these things was that, if a person has a family and someone gets sick and that person has to pay up front, the Opposition's policy assumed that person paid for a single service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With three young children myself and winter approaching, I know that when one of the kids gets the flu they all get it. We do not make one trip to the doctor; we make three. And that is three the first time around, hoping that the medication fixes the problem. Chances are a family probably ends up making somewhere between four and six visits to the doctor for three children with the common cold going through the house once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when the Opposition was talking about people paying up front and getting something back, albeit a reduced Medicare refund, the people out there in their homes, the people with children, the ordinary Australian families, knew that they would not have to make one up-front payment but half a dozen payments in the space of a fortnight. That is an impost the average Australian could ill afford to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things which a number of people said to me after the election that made the difference in their mind in that last week was neither the GST nor Medicare; it was industrial relations. Ordinary Australian working men and women were concerned that under a Hewson-Howard program they would be stripped of any rights in the workplace; denied the opportunity of award safety nets; denied the opportunity of union representation; and denied the opportunity of representation in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Each and every one of those things was in the Opposition's platform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition stands condemned for anything in that last election campaign, it stands condemned for its deceit for the way in which it portrayed its industrial relations policy. At first I was surprised and then just totally disenchanted with the way in which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) carried the argument in this place prior to the last election and then publicly, claiming that people would still have the option of being in a union and going to the industrial commission when he at least and most Opposition members understood that they were denying the right of Australian workers to be in a union and have a union represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's legislation would have ensured that only individuals were eligible to sign employment contracts. Unions would have been forbidden, as they are under the legislation of the Victorian Liberal Party. Moreover, there would have been no recourse to an industrial commission. Workers would have had the opportunity to go to an industrial commission to settle a dispute only if the employer agreed. We do not have to know a great deal about industrial relations to realise that in the heat of an industrial dispute the average employer is not about to say, `Sure, let's go down to the commission and I'll accept what he says'. That is not the way in which those disputes are settled now. It is not the way in which they would have been settled under the Opposition's policy, and the Opposition knows that only too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier an Opposition member spoke about scare campaigns and deceitful campaigning. If we are to be objective about it, we could all point to the odd bit of propaganda from every political party represented in this place, and a lot of the political parties that are not represented in this place, which would fail the test of the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But Opposition members should have a pretty careful look at themselves before deciding to throw too many stones in this debate, particularly on key issues like industrial relations, as occurred a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to its election to government, the Kennett Liberal Party put out a brochure on industrial relations. It was entitled, `Your Employment Rights'. It was authorised by the Liberal Party's head office in Melbourne. Under a heading, `The real truth about your job', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no person in employment will suffer <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">any</EMPHASIS> loss of award wages or conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same Jeff Kennett who, days after winning an election, produced legislation to do precisely the opposite&mdash;to ensure that all awards in fact were abolished in Victoria. Yet weeks before the Liberal Party was putting out propaganda saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no person in employment will suffer <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">any</EMPHASIS> loss of award wages or conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>When Kennett was producing and distributing that material he had in his possession the draft legislation to abolish every award in the Victorian jurisdiction. It is the height of hypocrisy for any honourable member on the opposition benches to hop up and talk about the truthfulness of campaign literature, particularly in relation to industrial relations. When the deceit which Kennett perpetrated on the people of Victoria last year is coupled with the deceit which those opposite peddled in their industrial relations policy at the last election, members of the Liberal and National parties in this place would be well advised to leave that issue alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I want to mention quickly some of those programs which the Labor Government will be continuing in this the 37th Parliament. On a number of occasions, and in the opening of Parliament in the Governor-General's address, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has made clear the Government's commitment to increasing employment as the focus of our activity. To that end for the last two years and into the next two years the Government has been committed to stimulating the economy through an injection of money in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in stark contrast to the sorts of policies that the Opposition took to the people of Australia and which were rejected. In the last Budget discussions the Opposition proposed a reduction in outlays of some $7,000 million. That goes not just to Medicare and some of the other items to which I have referred, but it goes to the very fabric of Australian society and the basis upon which social security benefits, pensions and education and health entitlements are all based. The proposal that the Leader of the Opposition took to the people a few months ago was for a $7,000 million cut this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to see the Opposition's revamped economic platform and I will be looking forward to the Budget session in a couple of months time when presumably the Opposition's new views as to how the Australian economy should be run will be unveiled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will continue its ongoing program of workplace reform; a program which has seen the most dramatic improvement in productivity in Australia's manufacturing sector that this country has ever witnessed. I might say that this increase in productivity in many industries now places us on a par with our European trading partners and in some cases our Asian trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This workplace reform process has seen our port handling facilities improve to the stage where the number of containers shifted per hour in ports such as Melbourne is better than the OECD average. The number of containers shifted per hour is now about twice what it was three or four years ago. In the merchant navy the number of sailors crewing ships with the same tonnage has been reduced by about half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of micro-economic and workplace reform changes have occurred with this Government working in partnership with the relevant unions, employers and the ACTU. They have occurred without a day's dispute. Today there are half the number of wharfies in this country that there were five years ago. Those wharfies are doing 100 per cent more work. That has occurred without the loss of a day's work. Yet the Opposition went to the people of Australia with a policy which said, `We want to reject this program of consultation and bipartisanship. We want to reintroduce the sort of confrontation and division which wreaked so much havoc on the Australian population and economy throughout the 1960s and 1970s'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Opposition learnt little from the events of earlier this year during the federal election, but also it would appear that it has learnt little from the events of the last three decades in respect of industrial relations and how one goes about getting cooperative reform for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other areas of policy that I quickly want to mention. I was pleased to note the comments in the Governor-General's address concerning arts policy and the Government's ongoing commitment to foster Australian arts. The arts are an important part of our national heritage and culture. In many respects they provide the outward public face of the different aspects of Australian society. The Government is to be commended for its commitment to the theatre and the arts and for ensuring that all Australians have a greater opportunity to participate in and enjoy the very skilled performances that Australian artists are able to provide. This Government will be judged very favourably over the years to come by its contribution to the arts community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make some comment about the announcement in the Governor-General's address of the Government's intention to look at appointments to the judiciary with a view to making those appointments more representative of Australian society. That is a long overdue reform and I was pleased to hear the comments made by my good friend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on those matters today in Question Time. Today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> carries a front-page article which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A County Court judge has joined the debate over the law's treatment of rape victims, saying that in his legal experience, when women say no to sex, `no often subsequently means yes'.</PARA>
<PARA>When important people in the judiciary go on the record in a considered way and say that when people say no as a matter of law they really mean yes, and that that can be justification for an offence such as rape, is mind-boggling to me. For any member to stand in this place and say that there is no need for the Government&mdash;which I accept has final responsibility for these matters&mdash;to look at the issues behind such decisions and statements would be folly. I welcome the Government's initiative in that area and commend the Attorney-General for his willingness to address it. In the end it will be something that the Australian people will be well served by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to thank that team of people in the Brisbane electorate who worked so hard for so long to ensure that Brisbane remained an important part of a Labor government. I was very fortunate to have a large and dedicated team. I want to place on record my thanks to them and to my campaign director, Liam McKay, in particular. Most importantly, I wish to thank my wife, Cathy, and family, without whose support I would not be here and who give up so much in order that I may contribute in this place. </PARA>

In what I consider to have been those dark days, my State colleague the Hon.

Now, with the addition of the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Cowan respectively, and with the new State Liberal members for Wanneroo and Whitford in the State Parliament, we can provide the type of representation that reflects the great pressures of modern life in the mortgage belt area of Perth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the real message from the northern suburbs in the recent federal election&mdash;and the State election, for that matter&mdash;was that Western Australia overwhelmingly rejects the disastrous State and Federal Labor governments. The message from the community in Western Australia was quite clear. In Western Australia we saw a two-party preferred vote of just under 54 per cent for the coalition&mdash;an overwhelming no vote for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for the Prime Minister's republican push and for the terrible damage wreaked on the economy by the Hawke and Keating administrations. In fact, around Western Australia today it is almost impossible to find anybody who will admit to having voted for the Labor Party. One just cannot find anybody. In fact, some people whom we suspect of having voted for the Labor Party look very sheepish and move away without really answering the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate a friend of mine, a businessman, put up a sign outside his business saying, `I voted Liberal; it must have been you!', because there are many people in Western Australia who just cannot understand how the Keating Government was re-elected.

It is pleasing to see that the average Australian family&mdash;raising children, with a mortgage and struggling under all the pressures that the recession has brought on&mdash;absolutely rejected Labor and preferred instead, and still prefers, the vision and the opportunities presented through the principles and philosophies on which our party's policies are based.</PARA></TALK.START>

I thank my campaign chairman, Mike Hill; the chairman of our finance committee, Frank Merry; our secretary, Bob Hales; and our treasurer and agent, Greg Ahern.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the campaign workers and supporters who came out to give us such a terrific result in Moore. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Mick Nanovich, who was a popular and conscientious State member for the area during his career in the State Parliament. Glad York and Pat Court, Pam Grant, John and Dorothy King, Albert and Margaret Presland, Pat Healy, and Geoff and Dorothy Lobban all helped organise successful functions at their homes or at local halls to support our campaign effort. This is the grassroots type of political activity which ensures close and responsive representation on the part of its member.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area I represent is one steeped in history. It is at the furthest reaches of the urban spread. In my maiden speech back in 1990 I talked of the tongues of bitumen licking into the bushland as development pressed ahead. But from that point to now I little envisaged the incredible changes that have occurred in the area during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the city of Wanneroo, the largest municipality in my electorate, we are seeing growth at the rate of 9,000 people a year. The new city of Joondalup is starting to become a more discernible metropolis. Shops, offices, workshops, public amenities and the new sports facilities are all taking shape as the city becomes the focal point for the region. But at the same time it is important to recognise the tremendous background of the other focal point of the region&mdash;the Wanneroo town site. I have been very interested in the traditions of hardship and struggle on the part of the families that pioneered the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently able to wish Santo Crisafulli a happy 80th birthday. He is one of the area's best known growers and part of a family that has contributed greatly to the fortunes of Wanneroo. With his brothers, Ned and John, Tony Martin, Bill Stevens and his family, the Conti family and many others, he has provided the colour and character of an area that is no longer a waterbag and cut lunch away from the Perth city area but is now part of the urban sprawl and a lot closer to the activities of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is an area that has been sadly neglected by the Federal Labor Government, particularly in the last Federal Budget. From the local capital works program it got absolutely zilch in the way of funding, which was in stark contrast to the next city, the city of Stirling, the largest proportion of which was of course in the area of the Federal seat of Stirling, one of the most marginal Labor seats. The then sitting Labor member, who was on a knife-edge margin, was able to relay the news that the city of Stirling received over $7 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It did not do him much good; I was going to come to that in a second. Both Stirling and Wanneroo have similar unemployment levels, and the bizarre method of distribution unfortunately smacked very heavily of pork-barrelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The city of Wanneroo is the fourth largest in population and has the second fastest growth rate in Australia. Our unemployment rate is a terrible 9.7 per cent, thanks to the havoc wreaked on the economy by the Keating Government. In fact, during the allocations of the local capital works program, we had the ludicrous situation where the town of Peppermint Grove, the wealthiest part of the Perth metropolitan area, received $75,000 to help its 75 unemployed people, yet Wanneroo with its huge unemployment rate received absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wanneroo's unemployment rate is considerably worse than that of the cities of Melville and Canning, which received $1.7 million and $1.6 million respectively. The basic inequity of these allocations in the case of the city of Wanneroo leads one to believe that the Government was nothing more than pork-barrelling on a grand scale. The pork-barrelling had, as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) correctly observed, little effect on the electors who rejected the Federal Labor member for Stirling and, in the other area occupied by Stirling, the Labor member for Cowan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The local people in my electorate realise that they have been short-changed in the Federal Budget by a government more intent on helping out its marginal seat candidates rather than properly planning its capital works expenditure to the areas where this is most in demand and most needed. A number of projects could have benefited from a fair application of the allocation. For example, the Quinns Rock senior citizens and community facilities are in dire need, in an area that is seeing the construction of one house being completed a day. It is an area of tremendous growth to the extent that we have to get bureaucrats from both the State and Federal governments to actually come up and have a look at it because they cannot believe the enormous growth that is happening in the northern suburbs of Perth, the second fastest growing area in the country after the Albert shire. </PARA>

As such, I would like to congratulate those elected at the recent city of Wanneroo and city of Stirling elections. In the city of Wanneroo councillors Rita Waters, Ewen-Chappell, Cooper, Maloney, MacLean, Wood, Rundle, Freame and Curtis are all to be congratulated for achieving election at the recent elections; and in the case of the city of Stirling councillors Carter, Rose, Scott, Maio, Willox, Spagnolo, Camilleri and Burkett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of local government councillors&mdash;often unsung, performed at considerable personal sacrifice in money and time&mdash;deserves our recognition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the development plans for the Joondalup city is the Joondalup sports complex. The West Perth Football Club will relocate to these premises in 1994. This will be a big plus with the residents of the city, who will have the opportunity to watch first class Western Australian football within their area. The move is an historic one and will require a huge investment on the part of the Western Australian Land Authority, Landcorp, and the West Perth Football Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the club's application in 1992 for a grant under the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program was unsuccessful. This was a blow to the aspirations of those responsible for this far-sighted project. The relocation of the West Perth Football Club from Leederville oval to Joondalup is a major step in the redevelopment of Australian rules football in Western Australia. The relocation will bring the club's headquarters to the geographic centre of the young and enthusiastic player and follower base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club has currently 66 junior teams within the district boundaries and will continue to progress the game through the junior development program. The complex will also become home to the Wanneroo Wolves ladies and men's basketball teams, which play in the State league, and the Wanneroo Basketball Association, which is very active in our region. I hope that, in the future, the sports Minister may look a little more kindly on the project, one which may well lead to the siting of the proposed second AFL team at Joondalup. To an area that is growing in such a fast way the full range of facilities found in older municipalities is something that we aspire to. With a large concentration of young families with children in my electorate this places additional demands on the very heavily used resources and I intend to pursue this matter until it is successfully concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this compendium speech about the Moore electorate I would like to discuss also the question of Telecom charges in the town sites of Yanchep and Two Rocks. The people in the northernmost pocket of the electorate are victims of a 10-year old zonal structure which sees them paying STD rates for calls to the central business district, although the growth in these suburbs has been absolutely prolific in the last ten years. It is absolutely ludicrous in this day and age that people who reside in what is effectively a suburb in the metropolitan area of Perth should be forced to pay STD charges for calls outside of their area. I will continue to lobby for the abolition of time charging in the area as development in the second fastest growing region in Australia continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to reflect briefly on the issue of Hepburn Heights. It is a local environmental matter. The State Labor governments of Dowding and Carmen Lawrence vandalised one of the last remaining stands of natural bushland in the northern suburban area, an area about which we, the Liberal Party, gave an absolute commitment to preserve. I am very pleased to say that the incoming Court Liberal coalition Government abided by that commitment. Although parts had already been developed in a rush by the outgoing Labor Government, it was able to stop the development at a reasonable level and still preserve important stands that I believe will be preserved in the interests of the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have in the area very active recycling and environmental community groups. We have, I am very happy to say, the Glengarry primary school video project on recycling that was undertaken in the first instance by Robin Bigwood, the environmental teacher at the school. It has now achieved some national prominence, thanks to the promotional efforts of Robin and other teachers at the school and, of course, the parents and the children who also go there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few remaining minutes, I want to refer to one particular event of today. I acknowledge the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), also has a strong interest in the particular issue I wish to refer to; that is, the terribly disappointing news this evening that the Bosnian Serb Parliament, in Pale, has rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina and has referred the matter to a referendum. At a time when we can see some of the worst fighting and most bitter bloodshed ever seen on the European mainland since the Second World War&mdash;bloodshed that I have personally witnessed in visits to Croatia and also to Sarajevo in September last year&mdash;the opportunity for creating a peaceful solution was seen to be something of optimism. Now, unfortunately we are faced with the prospect that the rest of the world will have to enforce peace through the use of force. That is something that none of us particularly aspire to or would particularly like to see but I think that under the circumstances of what has occurred today it is now almost inevitable. </PARA>

When I came back from my visit to Sarajevo, in December 1991, and issued a statement in Zagreb, Croatia, and in Australia warning of a bloodbath of this kind, a lot of people thought that was alarmist. The situation turned out to be even worse than I had envisaged in that statement.

Before doing so, I want to make some comments about the speech on the Address-in-Reply made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) earlier today. I was sitting at the table when the Leader of the Opposition made his comments. I must say that I was extremely disappointed. Here is a man who has just lost the federal election. The people of Australia have rejected him and his parties. He appears to have learnt nothing from that rejection, to have no humility about the fact that he was rejected. He ought to try to learn something from that exercise. Indeed, all he did for 20 minutes was make totally negative comments about the Government and, what is worse, about the country&mdash;we are in a doom and gloom situation; we are going to have a dreadful economic situation&mdash;the same stuff which we heard prior to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voters might have forgiven statements like that&mdash;statements running down the nation&mdash;prior to the election, regarding it as electioneering, but the election is over. There are three years of government to go. A responsible leader of the opposition ought to be saying positive things about the country, encouraging economic growth and investment, and encouraging people to put their faith in Australia. Anyone listening to that speech this morning would not have heard any of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is completely wrong to approach the matter in that way. The Leader of the Opposition's whole analysis of the situation is wrong. He had the impertinence to suggest that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has no program, the Government has no program, no philosophy. He said that the Opposition offered something to the Australian people while the Government did not. In fact, the opposite is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition offered the Australian people was an intellectually unsupportable hotchpotch of policies which was eventually exposed for what it was. It was even exposed by the media, but that was only after the election, not before it. Most of the media did not pick up the problems and contradictions before the election but did so after the election. The reality is that the program was not supportable. The Australian people recognised that it was not supportable and did not support it. Yet we had the Leader of the Opposition getting up in this chamber today, making the same negative attacks on the Government without even thinking about the possibility of saying something constructive and positive about the nation, its problems and the way to go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To refute what the Leader of the Opposition has said, I intend to say some things about the Government's philosophy and what it hopes to achieve in the next three years, as far as I understand it. I start by referring to what the Prime Minister said in his so-called True Believers speech, which was given one wonderful evening here in Canberra when so many people who supported the Labor Party came to celebrate. The Prime Minister said a number of things that evening, but I want to quote these particular words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think that, given the fact that we have been able to put these great building blocks of social and economic progress into place over the last 10 years, we truly have the option of being one of the great social democratic parties of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I don't think that is an idle claim or an idle objective. I think that is something we can actually do because I don't think any government has, over such a prolonged period of time, so carefully threaded and weaved a social policy as this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this party&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has changed Australia, but changed it co-operatively and together, put the two pieces together&mdash;economic policy and social policy&mdash;which gives us I think an option and the opportunity, the chance of truly becoming one of the great social democratic parties and for the great purpose of establishing a great Australian social democracy. Because it is that Australian social democracy I believe Australians voted for the other day; it is that Australian social democracy where Australians not only understand the values they should attach to themselves, but understand the identity that those values should have; the fact that this country will now be a country made in its own image where its identity is as clear as day and where the things we stand for will be universally accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>That does not sound like the words of a man who has no vision or no idea where things are going. On the contrary, the Prime Minister does have a philosophical approach, a clear conceptual approach, an approach which unites and gives force to the Government in relation to the whole gamut of policies. The social democratic philosophy of the Government is important because, as the Prime Minister said, the Australian Labor Party is one of the few social democratic parties in the world to have sustained itself in government for such a long time, with a coherent and evolving philosophy of which it can be proud, not only in Australia but also around the world where it serves as a model for other social democratic parties. There is no doubt that this has happened already. Inquiries have been made of the Australian Labor Party about the general thrust of its policy, the approach it has taken and the way in which it has been able to galvanise the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of elements to this general social democratic philosophy, some of which were outlined in the Governor-General's speech. I will elaborate on some of them. Economic growth was one of the main features and is extremely important. It is fundamental not only to the creation of jobs but also to the creation of wealth. Economic growth means that a whole range of services can be provided to the Australian people. What have we heard from the Opposition about economic growth? We have heard that it is not going to occur. When the statistics say that it is occurring, we hear, `It's not occurring'. Members of the Opposition were saying that even after the election. We can understand why they might say that before the election: they did not want to make a political point of the fact that there was economic growth. But the same thing is being said after the election, in the face of statistics that show that Australia is achieving economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that economic growth is not as great as we would like it to be. Who would not like more economic growth? We would all like more economic growth in order to get out of the recession more quickly. But the reality is that economic growth in modern circumstances, for a nation such as Australia, is not easy to achieve. I am talking about economic growth that makes sense. I am not talking about growth with inflation; I am talking about growth without inflation&mdash;genuine growth. And in that sense&mdash;in terms of growth without inflation&mdash;Australia is moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long way to go to get out of the recession, but we are doing well. Instead of running the nation down, we should be looking at policies which will help us achieve that economic growth. These policies include a range of complicated policies on industry development, the development of tourism, the development of the services industries, the development of a range of other industries, and the export of all those services and goods. To achieve that export orientation, we need to work at it; we need to develop incentives for export. Those complicated policies cannot be solved by being the kind of simple-minded, economic rationalist that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have been for the last few years. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian people have rejected that ideological agenda. Economic growth is not a goal in itself. A central feature of it is the fact that we need it to create jobs. Can there be anything more important than the emphasis the Government has placed on creating jobs, especially for the long-term unemployed? While there has been a significant restructuring of the Australian economy, it is very important that we help the people who have lost their jobs during the restructuring process and are having difficulty finding jobs&mdash;not just for a few days, weeks or months, but for a year or more. We have to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the next element of the strategy: the training and retraining of the work force. That is a very important aspect. In the area of training and retraining the record of the Government has been amazing with respect to the number of people that have been placed in training and retraining programs of various kinds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a very large number of programs in the TAFE colleges, in the universities and in a whole range of other institutions of learning. There is on-the-job training, cooperation between the union movement and the Government in order to achieve retraining, and restructuring of the roles of the workers in their places of employment. All this has been taking place. There has been a revolution in this training area. But that does not mean that we have finished. There is much more to do in this area, as there is in the whole general area of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not committed to cutting the resources in this area, as would have been the case had the coalition been elected to government. On the contrary, the Government will in fact sustain, and in some areas increase, the resources in this area. Had the coalition been elected, this area of education and training would have been one of the first areas to be drastically cut, because I remind the House that the Opposition was going to cut $10 billion from the federal Budget in the middle of a recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would that have done? That would have got rid of a large number of jobs immediately, as we have seen in Victoria where in six months 32,000 people have lost their jobs from the State public sector. Imagine what would have happened if the conservative forces had won the election. How many people would have lost their jobs at a federal level? We would have had not only that immediate loss of jobs but also the loss of the opportunities for those people, especially young people, to get the education and training that is required for them to really achieve a worthwhile job and a worthwhile future in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next element in the social democratic strategy and policy of the Prime Minister and the Government is the social justice strategy. I want to talk about this social justice strategy at greater length because it is an area of direct concern to my portfolio responsibilities. As the Prime Minister said in the True Believers speech, if there was one element that differentiated the conservative parties from the Labor Party in this election it was the perception of the community that there was a very big difference in values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was this difference? Essentially, it was that the Australian Labor Party, irrespective of economic difficulties, would look after people and continue to look after people; that it had a human face; that it was concerned to protect the poor, the disadvantaged, the people who were in a difficult situation, very often through no fault of their own; that the individual would not be thrown out to care for himself, alone, especially if that person was disadvantaged, poor or sick. In the whole gamut of policies, the Australian people perceived that the Australian Labor Party had a social justice strategy concerned with welfare and that the conservative parties did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the election, the Leader of the Opposition went out of his way to actually offend a number of the key welfare groups in this country, groups whose whole raison d'etre is to look after the poor and the needy. He went out of his way to offend them, and in so doing gave the impression to the Australian people that his would be a heartless government. Some might say that is an unfair description, but that is certainly the perception which the Australian community was given because of the policies that were adopted. That is not merely my own personal view; it has actually been said by a number of people, including some people closely associated with the Liberal and National parties. Belatedly, the Leader of the Opposition has recognised that this was a problem because he has now put into place a number of shadow Ministers to try to deal with some of these human areas which the Opposition totally ignored prior to the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party's social justice commitments go back some considerable time to the development of a social justice strategy which began from the very election of the Labor Government, and they have continued over that time. Let me read from the social justice strategy document that was put out from the office of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) before the election. The document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social justice is about quality of life. It is about choices and opportunities as different points in a person's life are reached. It is about entitlement to education, health care, and affordable housing; about the right of families to receive assistance and the aged to receive services; and about the right for people in crisis or facing difficult periods such as marriage breakup or unemployment or homelessness to receive special support.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Prime Minister has said, there can be no doubt that in the 10 years of the Labor Government it has managed to introduce a range of social justice policies while maintaining a focus on economic development and growth. There has not been a contradiction between economic development and social justice; there has been a marrying of those two approaches. Essentially, that is what social democracy is all about. The document talks about the way in which Australia is leading the world in many of these areas of social policy. I give a couple of examples. Between March 1983 and June 1992 payments targeted to low income families increased in real terms by 75 per cent for a family with children under 13 years of age, and by 147 per cent for a family with teenage children&mdash;that is, children of 13 to 15 years. Government subsidised child-care places increased from 46,000 in 1983 to 193,000 in 1992. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the last few minutes of the speech by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). He concentrated his remarks on what Australia would have been like had the coalition won the last federal election. I would like to right a couple of mistruths that I think I heard. The first thing I say to the honourable member for Calwell is that I do not think the Australian people rejected the coalition on the matter of social justice. I would point out to him that in my electorate of La Trobe the electors&mdash;including the elderly, the pensioners, the self-funded retirees and those who have lost their jobs and who now live by benefit of the State because they can no longer find work&mdash;returned me with an increased majority through a 70 per cent vote. It seems to me that that gives the lie to any sort of statement that we had heartless policies that would hurt the already disadvantaged. In my view, nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the electors of La Trobe. I did thank them at the declaration of the poll, but I would like to thank them in this place properly. It was with some degree of satisfaction that we increased our absolute majority and we increased our majority on preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are horribly disappointed that overall the coalition was not able to win enough seats so that we in fact could form government. I think the agenda that the Labor Party has tried to run for a number of years is not what the Government is doing but what the Opposition might do. I think that argument has got a bit old, a bit stale and a bit out of touch, I say to the honourable member for Calwell. The agenda now is on this Government and what is this Government going to do to get us out of this horrible mess that we are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here tonight to talk about the Governor-General's speech. I have the greatest respect for him, and I think that he is a fine Australian and has upheld the greatest traditions of that office in a most proper manner over the lifetime of his appointment. I have to say that it was a long and boring speech. I mean no disrespect to the Governor-General because he only parroted the words given to him by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Now we have on record this Prime Minister's agenda for this country. The honourable member for Calwell will sit to be judged for the next three years or two years or 18 months, however long it is until we go to the people for their judgment again. We, day by day, every day, will judge the Government on the record of what it says in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let those who are listening examine just exactly what it is that the Government intends to happen to Australians and for Australians over the life of this Parliament. The Prime Minister, through the Governor-General, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government sees as its primary task the encouragement of a strong and durable recovery from recession, assistance to those who have suffered as a consequence of the recession and a search for solutions to the increasing problem of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Somewhere along the line the Prime Minister forgot to apologise to the Australian people for the devastation that he has caused to Australia's economy. It is true that the rest of the world is now in recession and we are trapped in that recession. It appears that we are unlikely in the short term to exit it. It is not true to say that our recession was caused by the rest of the world. We did a bloody good job of bringing it on all by ourselves. The man who is now Prime Minister, who was Treasurer, was the arch architect of the policies that brought that devastation to our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable member for Calwell that today Australia is in debt to the rest of the world by some $170,000 million net of what the rest of the world owes us. That is growing now at what? Is it $2.1 billion a month? We have a real problem with our current account. The problem is that we are still buying more than we are selling. We are sucking in imports as we barely creep to come out of the recession, if in fact that is what we are doing. We are sucking in the imports and, at the same time, it costs us some $1.2 billion every month to service our existing debt, which is growing. So it snowballs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher our debt grows, the further the rest of the world devalues our currency. As they devalue our currency, so rises inflation. As inflation rises, so increases the cost to Australians buying overseas goods and services, so extends the current account deficit, and so our net debt to the rest of the world continues to increase day by day, week by week, month by month, and year by year. I see nothing in the longwinded, boring speech, in this document, which was delivered so well by the Governor-General, which points to a way out of this catch-22 situation that we are in. I note in the document that the Government intends to continue with its election promise to cut company taxes. That is an interesting scenario. We are going to cut taxes for corporations, and what is the effect?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first effect is that we will repatriate more dollars overseas in dividends for profit earned to the major companies in this country, which are the only ones making a profit. Small and medium sized businesses are not making much money. The real money is being made by major corporations, and the majority of those are owned by overseas companies, by multinationals and by conglomerates, and the profits will be expatriated. That is not going to do us much good, is it? It certainly is not going to help us increase investment in plant and equipment, the productive capacity which we so desperately need today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second effect is that we have gradually convinced the Australian public that participating in the share market, that mums and dads being owners of Australian business, is a good idea. What is going to happen? Imputation is going to fall, so the return on their investment will fall. The incentive for them to buy shares in the stock market will decrease and investment in productive capacity will fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the Government last year passed legislation which will come into effect this coming September. In effect, it taxes pensioners for unrealised capital gains. So they are now going to lose pension entitlements because of a so-called nominal increase in share value unrealised. The effect of that will be to tell the pensioners to get out of the share market. Where are they going to put their money? I do not know where they are going to put it, but one thing is for sure, it will not add to purchasing new plant and equipment, to buy new jobs, or new investment and to attack the unemployment problem in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do have a problem with unemployment, which is still over 11 per cent. Our youth still have this terrible problem of either finding places in universities or TAFE or finding a job when they exit year 12&mdash;and increasing numbers of them are staying on at school until year 12, and some now are going back for year 13, because what else are they going to do? Increasingly, we are finding graduates from universities unable to fulfil their destiny, unable to utilise their qualifications, with their hopes and aspirations dashed by an economy that is as flat as the proverbial pancake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a lot of schemes to help retrain people and to relieve the unemployment problem. There are more or less, plus or minus, 150 employment schemes today to try to help those who are unemployed. There are so many and it is so confusing that even the personnel in CES are confused about where to place an individual, or on what program, and I should think so. It is a terrible confusion, and no-one really knows which programs are working, which are not working, and whether our taxpayers' money is being used to proper effect. I have to say that it is not just taxpayers' money because we now are really borrowing money to run the Federal Treasury. What will the deficit be this year? Will it be $16 billion or $17 billion? It will not be as low as $15 billion, that is for sure. What is it going to be next year? We have got tax decreases coming and not tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this document, I really see very little hope for the financial future of our country. I see very little hope for the short or long term unemployed. I really do not know what the outcome will be. Another issue that is raised in this document which I think is going to increasingly take our time in this place&mdash;and I think it is a shame because the economic and social issues are more pressing&mdash;is talk about constitutional reform. By any other name, it is the issue of republicanism. The Governor-General, on behalf of the Prime Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to continue the process of promoting discussion and debate on the appropriateness of having an Australian Head of State, chosen by Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a brief look at that issue. Let us try to see what it is all about. Why are we today discussing changing a system that has made Australia the sixth longest serving parliamentary democratic system in the world? Of those six, four are monarchical forms of parliamentary democracy. They have been big failures, have they not? Australia is sixth&mdash;uninterrupted by military dictatorship or war. So we must have done something pretty well. In my view, it has worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nation has absorbed millions of people from countries all over the world. I am a product of that immigration. When I changed my citizenship I swore allegiance to the Queen of Australia, and I was proud to do so. I have to say that I think my uncle who some seven generations ago signed the Declaration of Independence might have rolled over in his grave; nevertheless, I was pleased to swear allegiance to the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I saw the Prime Minister swear allegiance to the Queen, yet he is running the agenda on republicanism. One has to ask oneself the question: why is it that we are brought to this debate? What is the agenda? Why are we today discussing changing the nature and the power structure of our system of parliamentary democracy? For what reason? Are we under attack? Is some other country about to take us over? Is some other country telling us what to do? Is some other country driving our agenda? Do we have the issue, as did the country of my birth, of taxation without representation? I say no, that no such issue exists. There is no such problem, even on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look behind the issue. There are probably three reasons why our Prime Minister is now supporting a republic. The first of those reasons undoubtedly is that he sees that it offers him a place in history&mdash;perhaps a permanent place in history; perhaps as president for life; perhaps not; perhaps emperor. Who knows? I think that the issue offers him an opportunity to see his name go down in history as the individual who led the debate that saw Australia change its system from a parliamentary democracy, based on a monarch as nominal head of state, to a so-called republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the agenda is all about power. This minimalist position severely understates the real case. The issue is about power; it is about further centralising the power of the executive in federal government. If one thinks carefully about that, one comes very quickly to the conclusion that the Executive in this Government already has excessive amounts of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive is constrained in only three ways, the first of which is by the Senate. But, if the Australian public at a general election returns a Senate which is of the same party as the party in dominance in the House of Representatives, the check is gone. The second check on executive power is the High Court, but that takes a very long time and is very unpredictable; it involves very detailed legalities. The third check on the power of executive government is the States. Frequently I read about members of the Labor Party supporting the abolition of the States and promoting regional governments around Australia. There was a time when I thought that that might not be a bad idea, that some of this overlap in the provision of services by the federal government and by State governments was a bit nonsensical, a waste of money and inefficient. But the States form a real check against abuse of executive power by the federal executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that in my lifetime I will never support the abolition of the States or the rescission of our federalist system. The federalist system has worked well. The checks and balances work reasonably well and, whilst the executive has too much power, I believe that there are things we can do in terms of the operation of this House of Representatives to help diffuse part of that power and to help make the House of Representatives, and parliament, more relevant today. I will pursue that agenda with vigour over the coming three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in my mind there is no question that the third reason for this debate has to do with sectarianism. We have seen evidence of that in the last few days from members of the Labor Party who just happen to be Irish Catholics, who just happen to say that the method of selection of the monarch who looks over us all is both sexist and sectarian. For heaven's sake; the history and the tradition of the monarchy goes back for centuries. I note that it has given us that well-known Australian republican, our current Governor-General, who has done a magnificent job. I would also say that it is the office and the history, heritage and tradition of that office that has made the man. He has been an excellent Governor-General for Australia. I note that Robert Manne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 4 May said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Irish Australians are instinctively both anti-British and anti-monarchy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no accident that the first Australian Prime Minister who raised the issue of republicanism seriously was a Keating, that the leader of the movement was a Keneally, the editor of the conservative newspaper which supported the cause a Kelly, and the first Liberal Party leader who broke ranks on the issue a Fahey. For the first time in our history the Australian elite is generously (and rightly) peopled by descendants of the Irish. In part at least, republicanism is their revenge.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's agenda on the one hand is economic, but it is an agenda which shows us no hope for the unemployed in this country. On the other hand the agenda&mdash;the republic&mdash;is a furphy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had time to reflect over the last three years on what it means to be a member of parliament. I made my maiden speech in this Parliament in 1980, and I had the privilege of serving the Parliament for 10 years. I have also had the experience of spending three years out of the Parliament, and I now have the honour of being re-elected. I can assure anybody who has been through the experience that no matter what one does in politics it is a great learning curve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was out of the Parliament I had the opportunity and privilege to serve the Australian administration as the Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. For that opportunity and privilege I have to thank the former Minister for Territories, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who is sitting here behind me. One thing which can assist a member of parliament is the experience of being an administrator, particularly if that administration is based upon a very old, colonial, Queen Victoria rule of law. I was interested to hear the last speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), talk about the republican issue, but I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my two-year term as the Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, one of my major responsibilities was to see through the final introduction of modern Australian law in that outpost of Australia 3,280 kilometres north-west of Perth&mdash;the farthest point west one can go and still be in Australia. When I arrived we were in the final stages of introducing modern law&mdash;a process which commenced in the 1970s during the Whitlam Government when the United Nations took a great interest in the colonies around the world, of which Cocos was one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the first real moves were made in this Parliament to introduce Australian law to that Territory. At that time, the laws of Cocos were based very much on the colonial English law of 1905 out of Singapore&mdash;and they were still that way when I arrived at the end of 1990. The administrator had total power by law&mdash;an anachronism which was in the process of being changed. It is interesting to listen to the debate about a republic and think that it is only very recently that an outpost of Australia actually reached the stage where, at the end of last June, this Parliament passed the laws which brought it up to date and into modern Australian law. This law is based upon Commonwealth law which mirrors West Australian State law. It is a unique situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that period my role was to see those laws introduced onto the islands and to assist the community in their introduction. Under the old law, the administrator was the commissioner of police and also the policeman. He was the director of education, the director of health, the harbour master and the director of the harbours department. Under the old British law, everything went through administrators. We now have on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands a modern law situation where the Federal Police report to the commissioner in Canberra; the chief of the education department and the full-time school principal reports to the education department of Western Australia; and the chief medical officer, who is also the medical officer for the local government, reports back to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday the local government held its first full council elections under Western Australian law. I suppose it is hard to believe that, in 1993, a local government was formed in Australia. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Calare was Minister for Local Government when this system of law was introduced and it has also been a very interesting time for me to be a part of these legal changes. We now have Commonwealth law mirrored on Western Australian law and the people now have their own local government. They elected that Government in the election held on 1 May and I would like to put on the record those who were successful in that election. Seven councillors were elected. Ibram bin Not, Haji Zaitol bin Wallie, Woren bin Dedian, Balmut bin Pirus, Ronald James Grant, Haji Wahin bin Bynie and Amatnoor bin Anthoney were the successful councillors elected to that council which is now part of Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are the descendants of those who first came to the islands as workers for the Clunies-Ross family who settled there in the last century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very interesting time for me. If people are interested in visiting an Australian outpost which nobody knows too much about and wants to have a magnificent holiday away from it all, they should look at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands because they are certainly well worth going to see. They will not find a prettier place in Australia or better people to mix with than those on the islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it even more attractive, I can report that the weather conditions there are the greatest anywhere in the world. Every day it is 28 degrees and every night it is 25 degrees. The hottest day on record is 30 degrees and the coldest is 21.9 degrees. As honourable members can see, with that climate all people need to take is a pair of shorts, some sandals and a couple of T-shirts and they can have a great holiday there without any difficulty at all. I have been very privileged, as a former member of this House, to have had the opportunity of working there. I will not forget it and it provided great experience in administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I arrived back in Australia in early December 1992 at the end of my contract. Whilst I had been following the newspapers fairly closely on Cocos when they arrived a week late, I was absolutely dismayed to see that we had elected in Victoria a government which was virtually dismantling much of what we had just introduced to the people of the Cocos Islands: Commonwealth laws on awards for workers which had introduced equality for the first time on Cocos where, under an award, people could get the same wage no matter where they worked in Australia. I was horrified to see what was occurring here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About three weeks before I arrived back in Australia one of the biggest demonstrations that had ever been seen in the Latrobe Valley took place. Ten thousand people tried to enter the Kernot Hall in Morwell, which holds a capacity of about 5,000 people, to protest at what was going on in Victoria. This really amazed me. Having been endorsed previously to run for the seat of McMillan, at that stage I felt there was a chance that perhaps the swing would be on in Victoria which eventually did come through on election day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the Labor Party which once before afforded me the opportunity to represent for 10 years the electorate of McMillan. People do not very often get the opportunity to serve in this House and it was a great honour for me to have 10 years here. Very few people can enter this place as Independents&mdash;we have two sitting in the chamber at the moment; but it happens very rarely. Most who are given the privilege to serve in this Parliament are reliant upon all of those people who go to branch meetings and work diligently for nothing at all by way of remuneration to make it possible for us to sit in this chamber and have the honour of serving an electorate. I take this opportunity to thank those in the Labor Party and the party itself, firstly, for the opportunity to serve for 10 years and, secondly, for the endorsement which enabled me to come back again. I will not forget that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few things about the electorate of McMillan. As I said in my maiden speech in the old House 13 years ago, the electorate is based upon the rural sector and has a traditional Labor base situated around the Latrobe Valley where we generate all the power for industry and homes in Victoria. In the future, we expect to send it interstate in a very competitive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate is unique. It has now developed to the point where it is virtually in three sections. The western end of the electorate&mdash;the Pakenham region&mdash;is now being built up at the very outskirts of Melbourne. It has the unique problems of a city which is growing extensively as part of the outer corridors of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy of the electorate's central region is based on the dairy industry. I had the honour of serving in this Parliament with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) as the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and working through the restructuring that took place in the dairy industry in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Whilst we are still talking about restructuring and the problems we are having with it in many industries, that is one industry which is benefiting today from the restructure that was put in place&mdash;at times in the face of strong opposition from some conservative forces. I remember attending a meeting in my electorate with the honourable member for Werriwa where a Commonwealth car was badly damaged when 1,500 angry farmers opposed what the Government was introducing. I can assure honourable members that in my electorate in this election the swing to the Labor Party in the rural sector was as strong as it was anywhere else because that section of my electorate is now very prosperous and the dairy industry is going from strength to strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eastern end of the electorate now is based upon the power industry and is very much dominated by the State Electricity Commission. Over the years there had been a steady restructuring of that operation, which is the basis of the economy in that area, by the former Labor Government. By a steady operation, I mean one based upon consultation with the unions, one based upon the realities of how restructuring can take place without totally disrupting the community. Today I am afraid we are facing a situation where consultation has gone out the window and things are moving at a pace which is really frightening. People are not being consulted, the unions are being ignored, and people are being asked to accept that decisions can be made without appropriate information being given to them. We are suffering in that area because people are very concerned and worried about what the future holds for them. It is very difficult for families who know that cuts are coming but do not know which families the chop is going to come down on. It is causing grave concern to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great concern at the moment is that the Victorian Government is going down a path of privatisation. I am not one who totally opposes restructuring. The word `privatisation' puts fear into some people but perhaps not others. It is restructuring that has to take place. In Victoria at present the Government is experimenting with people's lives. In New South Wales the Government has brought private enterprise into the power industry. The company is known as Pacific Power and it is an integrated operation in New South Wales. The Victorian Government is talking about selling three of the power stations to three different companies, with no integration and movement from one power station to another, and breaking the system up into transmission and distribution, again on the same basis. It has never been tried anywhere in the world. It has never worked anywhere around the world; it is an experiment which is fraught with danger. Whilst in New South Wales drastic changes were made with Pacific Power, it still has the integrated operated operation which gives it strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Victoria continues on the path it is going&mdash;and there are three different companies running three different power stations&mdash;one of them could be closed overnight by private enterprise. This is causing grave concern. It is really experimentation. Many of those who have been charged with the responsibility of delivering this system are expressing these concerns to the Victorian State Government. Tonight, in this Parliament, I would make a plea that it is time the Victorian Government started to listen and consult. The decisions it is taking and the way it is taking them are so drastic that when it finds perhaps that it has made a major mistake, it will be too late to reverse the situation, and that would be an absolute tragedy for our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate is a very diverse one, as I have pointed out tonight. The three distinct areas of the electorate are totally different and need to be treated in that way. At the Commonwealth level we need to take an active interest in what is happening in this restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to comment on the republic debate that is going on at the moment. At the end of my electorate are the large towns&mdash;the people in them call cities&mdash;of Moe, Morwell and Traralgon. Some 90,000 people live in those combined cities. There are three cities, three local government operations. It is my belief&mdash;and it is something that I am going to work very hard to achieve&mdash;that we will not prosper in that area until such time as we have a single regional city administration covering that city base where there is a community of interest. It should be established in such a way that we have a proper, modern administration&mdash;the sort of administration that is needed in a republican debate. This type of administration has been proposed before in regional areas and has been defeated for political reasons, because it is called the amalgamation of shires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those interests need to be considered, but we need to put them aside when they need to be put aside. We need to come to a real understanding that almost every sector of the Australian economy has been restructuring. Those sectors that got into it, got on with it and were led through it are prospering; those areas which are still resisting are struggling. One of the areas that is still resisting is local government. At the regional level in Victoria it is as bad as anywhere in Australia. I am not being critical of the people who are in local government at the moment in my region, but I am sure, because of the moves that have taken place in the last two months and meetings that are now being held in Victoria amongst local government people, that they are coming to realise that an area as big as the electorate of McMillan does not require 10 CEOs of local government, or 15 or 16 chief engineers, or assistant clerks to administer the population and that these things are holding back development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am raising this matter in the Parliament because I think the Commonwealth has to be involved. I think some of these regional cities have to prosper as cities. They have to develop a base where a region such as ours can have performing community arts centres big enough that one would say that it is a city; where we can have the major stores come in to the area because there is a catchment of 200,000 or 300,000 people within that region who need to be catered for. It will not happen while we have cities of 20,000 to 25,000 people with separate administrations trying to do what one administration can do in a city of 80,000 or 90,000 people because we are not efficiently using the public services that we have in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are discussing the republican issue, we also need to discuss that issue, because it is a States issue; it is a local government issue; it is an issue that we need to discuss going into this next century. Our regional areas in Australia cannot wait any longer for those in power at all levels to consider that the people there have problems which will not go away if the administration looking after those areas is still thinking in last century terms. We have to move with the times and move away those obstacles which are holding our areas back. That area, which is one third of the electorate of McMillan in size but with the greatest population area, needs to move into the next century and it needs to move into the debate that I am pleased the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has started. But I hope we do not have to wait until the year 2001 to see the changes come in our area; and that our local people will move with it and move quickly and deliver to our local region the services, the programs and the potential employment through new industry that is required. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As I sat and listened for an extended period during the Governor-General's speech, I could not help but wonder how different that speech would have been if about 1,500 Australians in the right places had voted differently on 13 March. Instead of long and often empty rhetoric, alphabetically and repetitively covering the topics of the agenda, we would have had the announcement of an exciting program of legislative change, a real opportunity for Australia to break free from the recession that it has endured for such a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program would have given Australians hope for the future&mdash;a program of slashing taxes, reducing the size of government and so much of the waste that occurs in government processes these days, a revitalised health system, justice for self-funded retirees, encouragement for Australian industry by removing some of the penalties that are so grievously holding back Australian producers and exporters at the present time, reward for effort, encouragement for those prepared to invest and to save, and support for Australian families in these difficult times. That kind of program would have given Australia an opportunity to fight back and to build a real and new beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will never go ahead as a nation whilst we impose penalties on Australians who put in that little extra effort, while we tax our exporters and put obstacles in the way of those who want to achieve.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, exhaustion. We have lived through a long period of exhaustion and it seems more of that is ahead of us. Thinking back over the election, for many people the result seems to have been a shock. In fact, when I walk around my electorate I have trouble finding anybody who is prepared to confess that they actually voted for the Labor Party. I wonder where those people are that returned Labor to office. Perhaps it is because I come from a country area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country parts of Australia certainly did not return Labor to office. Indeed, Labor lost a big swipe of the small number of rural electorates that it actually held. I am very proud to say that electorates such as Wide Bay showed a good degree more wisdom than that reflected in some of the capital cities and other parts of the country. I am very proud of the 4.2 per cent swing the coalition parties achieved in Wide Bay. I should like to express my gratitude to all of those people who assisted in our campaign to achieve that result. It was the best result the National Party has had in Wide Bay since 1985, and the second best ever, and I can assure honourable members that we will do a lot better in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this election will be a part of the political science textbooks for all time. It has always been a tenet of political science that governments lose elections, oppositions do not win them. The coalition did not want to just win this last election because the ALP was so bad. Everyone knew that Labor had been a failure in government. Labor had created shameful records in this country: record unemployment, record debt, record Budget deficits and record social despair. Labor created the recipe to guarantee that it would lose the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone said to us, `All you have to do is stand up and you will be elected'. But we did not want to go to the Australian people covering up the difficulties of the past and the magnitude of the problem. We wanted to be honest with the Australian people, to level with them, because they would have to be a part of our agenda. Because there would be some pain in getting Australia working profitably again, it was important that in proposing such a massive program of change we were honest and up-front with the Australian people by telling them the story in advance. We did not play dead and wait for the victor's robes to be draped over our shoulders. We went out there to win. We went out there to be honest with the Australian people and to put in place and to put before them the sort of program that was necessary to change Australia. So for two years we had set the political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Usually it is governments that supposedly put up all the ideas and propose the program of change and oppositions that do the criticising. That did not happen in Australia. The Liberal and National parties were composed of the people who put forward the proposals and who had the exciting agenda. All the Government could do was criticise. It never had any ideas of its own. All it could do was knock the ideas that we put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Prime Minister Hawke was not seen to be sufficiently effective in criticising, so he was knifed in the back for somebody else who had a louder mouth and who was a bigger critic&mdash;not somebody with more positive ideas but somebody who could criticise louder. The Government's campaign was negative and bereft of ideas. One of the lessons of this election was that it proved the power of negativity. It proved that it is so much easier to criticise than it is to be constructive. It proved how much easier it is to knock down than it is to create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This election also proved the great power of fear in elections. Labor built its campaign around fear: the fear that we might end Medicare, that we would add to living costs, cut wages and close services. They were all groundless fears but, nonetheless, the basis of the ALP campaign. This election also proved the power of the big lie. The Government's campaign was built on dishonesty. Its television advertisements told nothing of the truth but were built on fear: for example, the pregnant lady advertisement that lied about the impact of a coalition health care program on the cost of having children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate the Government conducted a mailing campaign. The Labor Party candidate actually distributed a brochure in which she claimed that petrol tax had fallen under Labor. That was the ultimate lie. There is no way that one could interpret history to lead one to the view that under Labor petrol taxes declined. The petrol tax has gone from 7c to 28c a litre and the excise collection has risen from $900 million to about $7 1/2 billion. The proportion of income derived from petrol tax has also increased. Yet in my electorate and in other electorates Labor distributed a pamphlet in which it claimed that under Labor petrol tax had declined. That is the kind of big lie that Labor built its campaign around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The involvement of the unions in the campaign was devastating. The Queensland Police Union, normally a more rational union, in the last edition of its journal before the election, published an article claiming that under a coalition government police superannuation benefits would be slashed fivefold. The truth was that we would increase police superannuation benefits something like sixfold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went to the trouble of writing to all the police officers in my electorate to point out the error&mdash;or the dishonesty, to be frank&mdash;in this particular union article. But I had just got that one out of the way when the nurses union wrote off to all the nurses telling them that under a coalition government they would all lose their jobs, they would have to apply for their jobs and there would be huge cuts in their salaries. Of course, under the Goss Government many of them are losing their jobs now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That one was just out of the way when the shop assistants were told that a coalition government would cut all shop assistants' wages to $3 an hour. Again, that was rank dishonesty. It ignored the fact that after this whole youth wages debate Labor is currently employing thousands of young Australians for precisely the same wages that we spoke about in our youth wages program. That was part of the dishonesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the $5 note which I think the Seamen's Union distributed in Western Australia. It was even the old design $5 that did not survive Labor's economic mismanagement. It was a note that the union turned into a $4.25 note. The Government claimed that GST would add 15 per cent to the cost of a whole lot of items. It got the list all wrong. It should have been a $5.50 note because of the extra benefit that we would have packed into everybody's pay packet under the Fightback program. But, sadly for Australians, sadly for our democracy, the campaign of lies succeeded. Evil triumphed over good. That is a really sad message for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are always told that people want honesty in politics but it seems they are not prepared to vote for it. It is a real threat to our democratic system if we cannot go into an election campaign with candidates and parties telling the truth&mdash;criticising each other's policies is quite legitimate, but that ought to be done on the basis of honesty and fact, pointing out the merits of one side as distinct from another&mdash;rather than relying on the big lie, fear and dishonesty, to win an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should any Opposition ever be honest again? Why should anyone ever tell the truth? Are there no rewards for honesty? Do Australians not want to know the truth? Do they want us to keep spending what we do not have? Do they want an unsustainable welfare system and overburdened bureaucracy to continue? That is, sadly, what we are left with. People did not vote for the Keating Government, they did not give the Prime Minister any kind of a mandate at all. Sadly, on the basis of fear and concern, they rejected an opportunity for new hope and a new start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that 10 years of Labor has significantly changed Australia. But can we ever recover from those changes? The odd Labor term may be sustained by a country or a state for a while, but what has gone wrong in Australia over recent years is that, for the first time in our history, States and now the Commonwealth have had successive terms of Labor governments. It has always been known that Labor cannot manage money. Labor governments are good spenders; they can think of lots of things to throw the money away on&mdash;and maybe a vigorous, productive and wealthy country like Australia can afford such spending policies once every lifetime. But we have had a succession of Labor governments and our country has reached the stage where the economy is on its knees. We have massive debt and there is no real possibility of that being turned around under the sort of program that was announced for us this week in the Governor-General's speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is no longer a country dominated by workers and producers&mdash;the contributors to our society. Now we are dominated by public servants and welfare recipients. Labor has in fact bought for itself a constituency. I was impressed by an article by Fia Cumming which appeared in a recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> entitled, `How your tax elected Labor'. I think it quoted some very telling statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the headline, `Half a nation on the public payroll', Fia Cumming cited some statistics. There are now 1.73 million Australian people employed by federal, state and local governments. There are nearly one million people on unemployment benefits, nearly half a million on invalid and wife and carer pensions, 68,000 on widows pensions, 290,000 on sole parent pensions, 16,000 rehabilitation allowance recipients, 607,000 on family allowance supplements, 1.5 million on age pensions and 53,000 on double orphans pensions. These figures amount to a total of almost four million Australians on welfare benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are another 450,000 students on Austudy and the families of 3.8 million children get family allowances. What it basically means is that the number of Australians receiving wages or benefits from the Government totalled 8,094,818 but there were only 7,808,000 full-time or part-time workers in Australia. For every part-time or full-time worker in Australia now, we have more than one on welfare. So in fact Labor has so encouraged dependence upon the welfare system that it has bought for itself a constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the end of it. Many millions of dollars in taxpayers' money is now devoted to lobby organisations. I am told that $57 million goes to the trade union movement. The Australian Council of Social Service gets 90 per cent of its income from the taxpayers, as do many conservation and other organisations, the arts and the Australia Council, many consultative groups and the like. All of these depend for their existence on taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any surprise then that they crank up their computers at election time and beef out pro-ALP material? Is it any shock that ACOSS or the consumer organisations back whatever ALP rubbish comes out in the election campaign? It does not matter what the Labor Party proposes on election night, it can count on all of these groups devoting their resources to support it. In addition, the resources provided to the union movement are then turned around to provide massive on-the-ground support to Labor Party candidates wherever they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this situation where the election campaign is now heavily loaded in favour of the Labor Party. It is able to use the trappings of office to resource a mass of groups across the countryside to ensure that its candidates have an advantage that no-one else can possibly hope to match. If we want a fair and balanced democratic system it is essential that checks and balances be put in place to ensure that the Government uses the resources at its disposal fairly, particularly in the lead-up to an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> this week how EARC in Queensland had commented on the fact that the Queensland Government was unable&mdash;or, in truth, unwilling&mdash;to disclose the extent of its own expenditure on public relations and publicity activities. But, from its own endeavours, it uncovered the fact that something like $37 million was spent by the Queensland Government on its own publicity and promotion during the previous year. I read reports a year or so ago that the Commonwealth Government spends $252 million a year on self-promotion and publicity. Of that money, something like $50 million is spent in the environment, recreation and the arts portfolio alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of expenditure can really be put down to expenditure on the ALP. Most of these publications have the Minister's picture on them. Some beautiful environmental material is put out by the environment department that I would love to distribute to schools in my electorate, but there is no way I am distributing brochures that have the picture of the Minister for the environment on them and contain all sorts of pro-ALP comments. That is a gross abuse of the public treasury and these sorts of things really ought to be brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Governor-General's concluding remarks, he said that the Labor Government is aiming to create a richer and more rewarding Australia; a fairer one. That is a worthy objective. What is fair about one million unemployed? What is fair about 100,000 on the hospital waiting queues? What is fair about 700,000 children in poverty? What is fair about drought-stricken farmers? What is fair about the program of this Labor Government? Sadly, in all of the pages that preceded those comments from the Governor-General, there was nothing to indicate that this Government has learnt from its experience and intends to do something more positive in its current term. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to the many other people who came out in support&mdash;some perhaps in fear of the Opposition's policies and many concerned that the sort of vision that the Labor Party had established over the years, the sense of fairness and purpose that had been part of our agenda, was retained. All of those things came together to create a very great victory for us on 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay particular tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his very strong leadership from the time he was elected Prime Minister right through to the election.

They did not want to throw away the things that they had grown up with, the important issues such as a comprehensive and universal health care system; they did not want to throw away the sense of decency that goes with having comprehensive child-care policies; they did not want to throw away the sense of equity that comes with giving all people a chance to have access to educational opportunity; and they did not want to throw away the broader sense of having a socially cohesive community in which policies are directed not for the benefit of the few at the expense of the majority but rather to include the majority in the various decisions that are made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the electorate showed that they were far too smart, as the Parliamentary Secretary rightly points out. Various members of the Opposition have said that they understood what the policies meant after the election, but the people of Australia had the good sense to realise what they would wreak on Australia well before the election. That is exactly the reason why, on 13 March, the Government was returned with an increased majority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in the few days after the election, members of the Opposition were blaming the GST. Now we find that they are blaming the people of Australia and the interest groups. They are blaming everybody else rather than their own incompetence and their own hopeless policies that they put to the people which were so soundly rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the ramifications of the election results of 13 March, we see that what really counts is that the people of Australia said they want fairness and equity. They do not want division and dislocation. The community wanted policies of inclusion, where cohesion and the benefits that flow from developing a socially cohesive society are retained, rather than policies of fragmentation and the slavish pursuit and blind faith in markets at all costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the result of this election it is clear that the people of Australia were concerned that there was a strength of vision and courage in what the Government delivered, but that had to be developed in a way in which all people would be part of that sense of vision and purpose. It did not matter whether they were concerned at the community level, the workplace level or in the business decisions that were being made. They wanted to ensure that the policies that were adopted by the national government adequately addressed the different challenges that the community faced. It was no good the Government creating a set of policies that benefited a few people. The Government needed to create a set of policies that over time would create economic growth that all would be the beneficiaries of. The Address-in-Reply and the Governor-General's speech focused on the need to pursue economic growth and ensure that growth occurs more quickly, but at the same time we cannot do that in a way that destroys the embracing nature of the social fabric policy framework that the Labor Government has been about creating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government went to the election making a number of fundamental points. The first was that the economy was not growing quickly enough. It certainly was growing, despite the protestations of the Opposition that we were in this double-dip recession. Nothing that has occurred since suggests that that is the case. It is clear that the economy needs to grow more quickly and that we are headed in the right direction. When we do comparisons with other countries, it is clear that our economy is growing more quickly than comparable countries at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also made it clear in the election that the level of unemployment was unacceptably high, that the Government's clear priority would be to tackle unemployment, and that it would be the agenda item that needed most focus in this term of government. The address from the Governor-General made it clear that that is the Government's continuing fundamental policy derivative over this term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point the Government made clear was that it deeply regretted the pain of the recession, that it understood its severity and impact and was determined to overcome it. In the process, while economic growth and development of policies to overcome the recession occurred, we were going to ensure that people were not left behind, and we were going to give people the social and income support they needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the more socially directed policies which we were concerned about. We were concerned that Medicare was not thrown out the window, which is what the Opposition tried to do in its policy pronouncements prior to the election. We were determined that Medicare would be a universal health care system from which all would benefit. In my electorate the vast majority of doctors bulk-bill. The Opposition was basically saying that the people who had the benefit of bulk-billing were going to lose it. What were they going to gain in its place? They were not going to gain anything in improved health care or more affordable health care; in fact, they were going to have more costly health care and probably a diminution of services as a result of the policies that the Opposition was pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the period since the election it is clear that, in trying to promote sustainable and more vigorous economic growth, our policies will start to come through. That has been the position of the Government. Let us look back over the period of announcements and economic statements that we have made since the Prime Minister was elected. We have had the development of initiatives in One Nation to build economic growth; we have had the Budget of 1992 with the fiscal stimulus that contained; and we have had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement, which also contained many important measures to promote private investment. They are, quite clearly, important provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we have competitive company tax regimes with our trading partners and competitors, that we have the lowest interest rates in over 20 years, that we encourage investment allowances which will ensure that we rebuild the private investment sector of the economy, and that we take steps to ensure our banks make finance available for new business projects. All these issues have been covered in initiatives undertaken by the Government over the last 12 months. The challenge now is to build on the initiatives</PARA>
<PARA>that have been taken, to ensure that the benefits of those decisions flow through the economy, and to move further than the initiatives that have been taken already. The Governor-General's speech makes it clear that the Government is precisely about ensuring those things happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise&mdash;this is something that is made clear in the Governor-General's speech&mdash;that the world economy continues to be very fragile; no-one can dispute that. The impact that has on Australia is there for all to see. We know that world commodity prices continue to be a difficult issue and that we need to get fair outcomes to the GATT round of trade talks if we are really going to build effectively on those issues. In the meantime, we will enhance the rate of domestic economic growth and take steps to enhance the rate of private investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, there is a role for government in this process: it must ensure that it does something about the long-term unemployed. It has been made clear in the Governor-General's speech, and in the policy speech of the Prime Minister, that we need to focus on issues relating to regional manifestations of economic growth. We need to take a structured regional approach and look at areas in which the Government can play a part: creating the environment for private sector growth and enhancing infrastructure to facilitate that growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blind, slavish faith in the markets and in the economic ideology of Reagan, Thatcher and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will not achieve that. It was not achieved for Reagan and Thatcher&mdash;they have been dispatched into the pages of political history. I think it is fairly likely that the Leader of the Opposition does not have too long before he is similarly dispatched into those pages of political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ensure that export growth and export opportunities are improved and that we recognise the strength and capacity of small and medium sized companies to play a part in that export growth. Strategic industry development is a key element of that. Promotion of efficient trade movement and reform in those areas is also a very relevant issue. Maintaining a fair and balanced industrial relations system is pivotal to that process. Surely we can achieve results only if there is a spirit of industrial cooperation, seeking out the collective wisdom of both management and labour and utilising their skills and talents cooperatively to produce and achieve more effective productivity. Ensuring that we maintain low levels of inflation through the developing and evolving accord process is clearly another fundamental part of that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures continue to bear the value that has been part of the accord, and part of the relationship that we have tried to structure with labour organisations throughout the period of the Labor Government. Industries like tourism, industries that were not recognised as industries prior to the Labor Government, offer more potential as time goes on. We can do more in those areas. The integration more closely with the Asia-Pacific region offers tremendous opportunities in tourism and services. Clearly, the Government recognises the importance of those and the Governor-General's speech makes clear that we are determined to enhance those opportunities over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at some of the measures we took in industry development in the last term of the Government, in the pharmaceutical industry, the telecommunications industry, in food processing and in educational and financial services&mdash;all areas where there are growth opportunities. Prior to the election, the Opposition basically said that those sorts of industry plans were irrelevant. They were meaningless. The results were there. Companies in my electorate, as in many other electorates, were talking about the benefits of those policies, and were concerned about the continuity of the sorts of measures that those industry arrangements provided. The Opposition's policies were designed at that time to tear them to bits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that the Opposition may have changed its tune on some of those issues since the election. I hope that is the case because, clearly, continuity in those industry development arrangements, in areas like the pharmaceutical industry, one of Australia's great exporters at this time, can be achieved only if the community is confident about policy continuity. The only way people can have policy continuity is to continue to re-elect Labor governments that will be committed to policy certainty in those areas. Those small and medium sized businesses also will now have the benefit of lower company tax rates, clearly an important opportunity for them. Many were advocating more access to investment allowance provisions. Those measures were contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment in the nation </EMPHASIS>statement and will flow through and be of direct benefit to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of these practical industry initiatives is shown in electorates like Parramatta. We have seen a major growth in the importance of tourism to our region. Further promotion of the regional strategic nature of tourism can only make that effort even greater. Improved marketing, and an orientation towards the service excellence that goes with it, will give us more opportunities both for the growth of the industry and more jobs in the industry. In the area of export enhancement, I am very pleased that, just prior to the last election, the Government made a commitment about developing an export access centre in Parramatta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very important initiative, not just a Government initiative. It is a joint initiative between Austrade and the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. It is a public-private sector project, designed to encourage companies in the region looking at export opportunities to have a one-stop shop they can go to, to have the expertise on tap to encourage them to move into those new export markets. I am very pleased to see the encouraging response that has been achieved from the business community in the region. It offers great opportunities for them to become major exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export facilitation and the opportunities that provides for growth is clearly very significant for Australia. When we turn to the further steps that we can take in educational services for instance, I am very pleased to note that the University of Western Sydney, which has a campus in my electorate, is very much focused on the capacity to export educational services and what that offers to the Australian community. Those sorts of opportunities, that sort of stimulus, and the get up and go that goes with it, from educators and the business sector will over time reap benefits for Australian export opportunities and in building our relationship with the region that we are part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General's speech also highlighted a number of other policy initiatives. The policy speech of the Prime Minister very definitely identified child-care as now firmly on the national political landscape. We had a clear commitment from the Government to expand the number of places, to make more flexible options about child-care and to recognise the role of child-care, both in the home and in the broader community, as an occupational issue. All of the measures that were taken in the national child-care policy announced by the Labor Government go to the very heart of giving more opportunities to women, but at the same time recognising the changing nature of our community. I believe it is important that those initiatives be pursued with vigour, and I look forward to many of the projects initiating more child-care places in areas like western Sydney where clearly the population growth demands those new services. It is one of the great regrets that over the last two years or so we have not been able to get the Government in New South Wales to cooperate in funding arrangements for these sorts of programs. Before and after school care is desperately needed; yet we are finding increasingly delays and procrastination by the State Government in meeting its responsibilities to be part of that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the area of aged care, we have clear initiatives taken by the Government which are very much directed at providing increased support to the aged in the community. The extension of fringe benefits to all part rate pensioners is a very timely initiative; the seniors card that has been developed by the Government is again a very important step in recognising the broader needs of older Australians in the area of health and aged care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our program is clearly focused on building on the strengths of regions like the Parramatta-western Sydney region. I was very pleased that in last year's Budget the local capital works program recognised the important contribution local government can make to building national economic recovery. In Parramatta's case, the program ensured work on major heritage buildings and, of course, our region is one of the most historic parts of Australia. Also, we had the building of new tourist centres and more sporting, cultural and recreational facilities. The big issue that we have had in our area, over the last 10 years or so, relates to urban flooding and the Government has made major contributions and further commitments to that as well. The better cities program again has ensured a major initiative in the Parramatta region with the transit west scheme. That scheme, designed to improve public transport, improve urban infrastructure, and ensure enhanced quality of life for the region is something that I warmly welcome and I will ensure that it is developed and delivered in this term of parliament. The support the Government has given to Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid is also an important initiative for my region. I think the other initiatives that we have taken to improve the urban quality of life are equally going to reap real benefits for the people of Parramatta over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to be part of the Government for this term of parliament. The Governor-General's speech sets a vigorous agenda for economic growth, new opportunities for young people and for women, a new era in our relations with the Aboriginal population, a new vision for Australia in this decade and beyond. It is pleasing to be able to be part of that very exciting agenda for the people of Australia. I am delighted that the people of Parramatta chose to return me to Federal Parliament and I look forward to being part of the Federal Labor Government in its building of Australia, creating a new national identity and ensuring strong economic growth for Australia over the next three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General's speech about the Government's program for the next parliamentary term was an A to Z of plagiarism. In the important areas of industrial relations and tariffs, the Keating Government adopted the Opposition's policy positions. Cleverly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has attempted to create the diversion of the republic, but this will prove to be ultimately his Waterloo. Before I look at these issues, I would like to look back a few years and see what this Government has done over the 10 years it has been in power.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1986, when the present Prime Minister made his famous remark about Australia being in danger of becoming a banana republic, the Australian economy was in much better shape than is the case today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seven years ago, seasonally adjusted unemployment was at only 7.8 per cent; today's figure is 11.1 per cent. If we talk in real numbers of people affected by the scourge of unemployment rather than just percentages, we find that in February 1986 there were 608,000 Australians unemployed. Today that figure is 956,000, after seasonal adjustment. What an indictment on the unemployment situation here in Australia. The impact of the Government's recession, `the recession we had to have', which is so well-known by all Australians, has been experienced by ordinary Australians in many other ways. In the four years between 1984-85 and 1987-88, Australia's gross domestic product rose by an average each year of about 4 per cent, after allowing for inflation. In the last four years, the average annual rise has been 0.8 per cent. In other words, we are doing about a quarter as well as we were doing five years ago. These figures give a clear indication of how people feel out there, how badly they are going, and how they fully understand the decline in their own living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The April current account deficit of $2.1 billion will put more pressure on the Government and is further evidence that the fiscal policy cannot be eased. We cannot afford to go on the sort of mindless, irresponsible spending binge that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) might advocate in this House from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is heading for a current account deficit of $16 billion this year, with the Government having a similar deficit in its own spending programs. This is the greatest challenge for the returned Labor Government. It can hardly be complacent about the recent suggestions of a supposedly lower than expected Budget deficit. The deficit forecast was constantly amended last year. In the 1992 Budget the figure was only $13.4 billion. The amended figure rose to $15.9 billion, and that might yet be exceeded when the final figures come in at the end of June. Only half of the planned $1.6 billion in revenue from privatisation has been collected, so little more cash will flow in from this area this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social security spending is up two per cent on the budgeted figures. Social security and welfare accounts for a third of the Budget spending. All honourable members of this House and all Australians should be aware of that very important feature of the current Budget. It will probably be a feature of future Budgets as they come to be framed. The need to take into account the welfare cost of the long-term unemployed has very serious implications for future Budgets. There are about 340,000 long-term unemployed, and all honourable members would be aware of the great cost involved in keeping them on unemployment benefits. Professor Judy Sloan of Flinders University has predicted that by the year 1996 there will be almost half a million long-term unemployed. That is an indictment of the present Government's policies and represents a huge human problem facing Australia, particularly those people who are unlucky enough not to find a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the Cabinet recently decided that there will be no net increase in any government spending on any new policy proposals for the next three or four years. That is a far cry from the $1.2 billion figure included in the One Nation statement, where there seemed to be funds emerging from everywhere to pump prime the economy. One also cannot overlook all the extravagant promises of the Prime Minister during the election campaign, which showed little regard for fiscal responsibility. The razor gang will no doubt come out of hiding because there are three years to go before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that Senator Richardson, the Minister for Health, will not offset the cost of election commitments because he believes that the political advantage of such a move would be dubious. Senator Richardson will stick to his high spending arrangements no matter what, because he is a politician through and through. However, I commend Senator Richardson for being more cautious in adopting our key health policy, suggesting that there should be tax incentives to encourage people to take out private health insurance. The coalition has been advocating that for a number of years, and it is encouraging to see Senator Richardson looking at it. So all those Australians who are presently waiting for hospital beds might have a chance of receiving hospital care. In the Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament, the Government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reducing unemployment remains the ultimate focus of all the Government's economic policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has not done too well with that key issue during its term of office, but it is pleasing to know that at least it is looking at it. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . above all else, growth holds the key to restoring unemployment to more acceptable levels.</PARA>
<PARA>That shows that the Prime Minister and the Government agree with the message that the Opposition was pushing during the campaign; that employment was the fundamental issue concerning Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to industrial relations, I note that the Labor Party is now mouthing the words `enterprise bargaining'&mdash;the rhetoric of the coalition. The coalition has been advocating equal treatment for all Australians in industrial relations, but the Labor Party has said that it will bring the non-unionised workers into the fold and that unions should represent workers in the enterprise bargaining arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very subtle change and people out there in the marketplace do not fully understand the impact of the difference in the policies. In philosophical terms, I am pleased that this trade union based Government is now coming around to the view that enterprise bargaining is the way for Australia to go in the future and that individual firms should be able to negotiate the terms and conditions of the workers who are employed in those firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, page 17 of the Governor-General's speech gives the game away. The ALP is involving unions and management in these arrangements but the individual workers will not get much say because the trade union movement will represent them in the bargaining arrangements. Why is the Labor Party suddenly saying it has done so well in industrial relations?  It has had six previous failed accords to bring about these changes and, because so many people in the Labor Party now fully understand that, inevitably, the union movement does not have a monopoly on the way in which wages are determined in Australia and the way in which people will go about work in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy per cent of Australians who work in the private sector choose not to belong to a trade union and will not take up a ticket. That figure is not understood by a lot of people out there in the electorate; there is a bit of a feeling that the trade unions dominate proceedings. One only has to go down to Melbourne and listen to John Halfpenny; people in that city would get the impression that he dominates the work force. The fact is that 70 per cent of the work force do not want to join a trade union and they are very happy to work within their current arrangements, to work with management, and keep their job, even in these very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most economists and most intelligent commentators would agree, it is the small to medium sized business in Australia that will hold the key to the restoration of economic growth. The employers and employees of those smaller businesses have not been consulted by the Prime Minister or Mr Kelty or Mr Ferguson about the way in which they might organise their industrial relations arrangements. At a time when these smaller businessmen are struggling to make a profit, struggling to make sales in these recessed times, they have never been consulted about compulsory employer funded superannuation. Employers were forced by legislation passed by the Parliament to pay more and more superannuation, whether or not they had the money. The 800,000 small businessmen are struggling to find the funds to make the payments for that compulsory superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the recent comments of Mr Steve Dowrick of the Australian National University who very much agrees with the problems I have set out before the House. He believes that, under the Keating Government, use of the term `enterprise bargaining' will just mean that bargaining strategies are drawn up by the traditional, partially centralised blocs of craft based trade unions and  industrially based employer associations. Mr Dowrick believes that these cosy, neither wholly centralised nor decentralised arrangements will lead to the deterioration of Australia's economic performance over the next 10 years. He has hit the nail on the head; he sees this unlikely arrangement where the Labor Party has agreed with the thesis we have put forward but is not able to put it into practice because of its commitment to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must abandon this approach of the ALP; it must properly deregulate the labour market and not keep the trade union movement as the favoured sons of the industrial relations arrangements. All the Government can say is that it will review the success of the national employment and training plan to ensure it is delivering to young people a number of these training programs. That is the Government's answer to the difficulties associated with industrial relations and the difficulty of creating jobs. </PARA>

We need policies that will encourage investment in Australia to create real jobs&mdash;and long-term jobs at that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's speech allots a mere two paragraphs to the discussion of the question of constitutional reform&mdash;the debate we have here in the Parliament and the debate that is out and about in the electorate. Whilst we have not seen the report of the advisory committee recently set up by the Prime Minister, it seems to me that there is a hidden agenda behind the Government's moves. The whole exercise started with the misleading claim by the Government that it is really about minimalist change. The Government is also hoping that there will be sufficient consensus on constitutional change to hold a referendum and presumably, according to the ALP, install a President, if that was passed, by the year 2001. There were just two paragraphs in the Governor-General's speech, despite the important debate that we have here today. They are just slipped in there and they indicate a very minimalist approach to the whole program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me raise the issues. What will be the future role of the Senate? Who will hold the reserve powers of which the Governor-General is now custodian on behalf of the people? Would a President be elected by the Parliament or in a general election, or would he be appointed by the Prime Minister? Would the methods of changing the Constitution be altered to delete the present requirement that a proposal has to be carried by a majority of electors in a majority of the States? Will it be possible for the States that disagreed with any push for a republic to retain a constitutional monarchy? Will the recently announced Republican Advisory Committee be permitted to come to the same conclusion as the constitutional commission did back in 1988 when it found that Australia should remain a constitutional monarchy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wording of the Prime Minister's terms of reference seem to prevent the eminent persons Republican Advisory Committee from reaching a similar conclusion. It would appear to me that the Prime Minister has hand-picked the committee. It is not a genuine committee. It has a preconceived position. From the way in which the Prime Minister has drafted the terms of reference, he is hoping to get a result that would suit him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If and when the committee recommends a change to a republic, will it be altering many of the other mechanisms of Australian government, such as the balance of power between a suddenly more powerful Commonwealth of Australia and the States?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important question is whether there is such a sudden need for change. Opinion polls showing a gradual shift in favour of a republic merely reflect the almost universal lack of understanding in our schools, through the media and in the public debates about the merits of the Westminster system of government, a constitutional monarchy and a Federal arrangement of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also congratulate the honourable member for Ballarat; he probably thought he had a bit of a hard run. I offer my congratulations to all honourable members on both sides. I am particularly disappointed by the loss of a couple of members on my side. I would like to mention the former member for Hinkler, with whom I worked very closely in a number of areas. I found him to be a very hard working member for parliament and for his own electorate. It is genuinely a great loss to this Parliament to lose people of his calibre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to a number of the speeches here today. I want to commend many honourable members for the way they have presented those speeches and the standard of those speeches. That standard reflects the sort of commitment that most people here have. However, I was quite astounded by the lack of direction that some speeches seemed to have. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) demonstrated a clear inability to comprehend any view that was in any way different to his long held views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he is incapable of understanding that the Liberal and National parties have been beaten in this election, that the electorate of Australia actually voted us in with a clear majority. He was beaten because of the policies that he, in missionary-like fashion, enforced on the members of the Opposition, and because the Government's policies were seen as better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was unable to bend at all from his philosophy. He had policies which were seen as divisive&mdash;in industrial relations, in health care and, because of the regressive nature of his proposals, in the tax system he was proposing. He did not consult with his own party or with the National Party. When he changed that policy and cut food from the GST, and when that was relayed to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) who was in England at the time, he did not know anything about it. There was no consultation; it was purely the initiative of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember listening to the comments of the Leader of the National Party when he was asked about it, and he was astounded, or surprised, that things had changed. I almost thought he would fall off the deck of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Britannia</EMPHASIS> at that time. His policy was produced because he did not consult. He looked to the past for initiative and, with no imagination of his own, he looked to other countries, even word for word for some of the wording for that policy. He cannot accept that he got it wrong. He now says that the electorate got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was sad to hear such pessimism and negativeness from a leader of a political party when he spoke today in this House. There was no view to the future, no view that he might be able to make a commitment that might be better for Australia. He had nothing whatsoever to offer us and he had absolutely no hope for Australia. If one listens to him, one would think it is true that we are all doomed. It was in a `we are all doomed' fashion that he presented himself. His lack of imagination and his lack of faith and confidence in the Australian people were really there for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the address by the Governor-General held out hope for the future, and we on this side of the Parliament do hold that hope. We recognise the problems and we will identify them. We identify the problem of unemployment in this country, particularly the problem faced by the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Solutions are achievable, and with the recognition that we can achieve those solutions, we can look forward with hope and optimism for Australia and all Australians. The thrust of that address by the Governor-General is directed to those problems. It establishes the Government's primary task of achieving a recovery from recession, assisting those who have suffered, and finding solutions, particularly for those long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, the number of long-term unemployed and unemployed generally is an ongoing problem. It is not something which has developed in the last few years as a result of this recession. In 1986, unemployment on the north coast of New South Wales was around 16 or 17 per cent. It is still around that figure and is still far too high. But the point is that that figure has not developed as a result of the recession and it will not disappear when the recession ends. The long-term unemployed are of greatest concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in many of those electorates&mdash;mine in particular and I dare say the electorate of the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne)&mdash;where the National Party had been in control for many years, unemployment was never produced as being an issue. It was only produced as an issue when national unemployment figures rose and members of the National Party could say that it was the Labor Party's fault. But the long-term unemployment problem in those country electorates, particularly on the north coast of New South Wales, has lasted many years and only this Government is starting to take steps to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we came out of the 1982 recession, national unemployment fell. But unemployment did not fall on the north coast of New South Wales. Employment rose and national unemployment fell, but on the north coast of New South Wales unemployment rose, if anything. The reason was that the people there were not able to take the jobs that became available. They did not take the jobs because they did not have the skills and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of programs that were denigrated by the previous speaker are the ones that will give the long-term unemployed a chance to get back into the work force. They are the sorts of programs that, as we come out of this recession and employment rises, will give the people on the north coast&mdash;the long-term unemployed who have taken advantage of the training schemes brought in by this Government&mdash;the opportunity of taking the jobs that become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not happen after the 1982 recession as we recovered in 1985-88. I see the programs that have been put in place, such as jobstart and jobskills, working on a personal basis all the time. There is a lot of opposition to them and many attitudes in the general community need to be changed. The attitude that seems to be so rife on the other side of the House is that these are mickey mouse programs. But I see them working in my electorate. I see people obtaining skills and training that will get them into jobs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week I was out with the Richmond Landcare group, which has a jobskills brokerage. About 20 people are working in Richmond learning a whole range of farm and building skills that will be of enormous value to their getting jobs. I have met them personally and seen the work that they are doing. They are not unemployable people by any means. They are unemployed because they do not have the skills and training that are necessary for the jobs that will become available in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old idea, particularly in rural areas, of rural work being unskilled, low paid and without worth is gone. Those jobs do not exist any more. If people want jobs, they need the training and skills and the sorts of programs that this Government has initiated. The Governor-General's address stated that the national employment and training plan, with funding of $770 million, will provide that sort of training and the programs needed for developing skills for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another side to the issue. There ain't no jobs if there ain't no industry. There has to be industry and business in areas such as mine if there are to be jobs. One has to look at the impediments to industry and regional development that exist if one is to encourage industry and business to come to rural areas. The problem is really caught up with infrastructure, because distance is the greatest impediment for people in setting up. The programs of road building and rail building will provide that infrastructure into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased about the spending on the National Rail Freight Corporation as a result of the program initiated by this Labor Government. If we look at Australia's history, we see that one of the greatest impediments to goods moving throughout this country has been the rail system with the changes in the gauges between States. This has existed for 100 years, and people have been talking for 100 years about fixing it, but no government has ever taken the initiative. Last term this Government took the initiative. The money was set aside and the work is happening now. A standard gauge rail system will be of enormous benefit. Although it was talked about, it was never acted upon. The problem was recognised but never addressed. But this Government has taken the step; it has put the money aside to do something about it. In my view, this has been one of the biggest steps in the transport and communications area in the last century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker also commented that government spending in this time of recession and low economic activity should not occur. It is completely appropriate that spending should take place at this time when private spending has dropped off to keep economic growth going. It is appropriate for the Government to step in to accelerate that economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind honourable members that in the 1980s this Government had consecutive surpluses over a number of Budgets. Historically, that had not been done before. That enabled us to have the sort of deficit we now have for the benefit of Australia. It is aimed to have that Budget deficit down to one per cent of GDP in 1995-96. I believe that is achievable, but these estimates do depend on what happens in the rest of the world. We are very dependent on world commodity prices and on trade in resources and primary products. We cannot act alone and we cannot achieve these estimates simply on Australia's performance when we depend so much on what is happening in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of this Government's greatest achievements has been to turn around Australia's trade performance from a state of almost total dependence on commodities and primary products to a greater dependence on manufactures, on value added goods. Our exports of manufactured goods have doubled in the last five years. Our exports of manufactured goods to the Asia-Pacific region where so much of our future lies have trebled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of my area of Australia depends on primary products. It has been tough for people in my area in the sugar, beef and dairy industries. The achievements of this Government in the dairy industry have been remarkable. If it is properly marketed, if we obtain the markets in that great growth area of Asia, I believe the dairy industry will be a very good primary industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has worked hard at, put a lot of work into, and not walked out of, the GATT talks&mdash;as one of the previous members for Richmond did&mdash;without any achievement. Achievement in those GATT talks will be by degrees. But even a small degree of achievement has potentially great benefit and increased profitability for our primary industries. The action of this Government on tariffs has also been remarkable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the Opposition did not do it, and it would not have done it, because it has the National Party with it. We did it. We do not claim, as the Opposition does, that we will go to zero tariffs, but we do claim that we have broken the tariff wall. It is no longer the same as when old Black Jack McEwen used to run around the place. All one did was go and see him and say, `My costs have gone up, I need a bit more tariff protection'. That happened through those years and those enormous walls of tariff protection were built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, congratulations, Mr Speaker. I did congratulate you before you came in. It is good to see your smiling face.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has no imagination when it comes to constitutional reform. The previous speaker said that the reserve powers of the Governor-General are held on behalf of the people of Australia. That is the sort of rubbish that this lot opposite is going to run around the place. Those powers are not held on behalf of the people of Australia; they are held on behalf of the Queen of England. Those opposite talk about scare campaigns. I can imagine the real scare campaign they will run on this issue, for no better reason than lack of imagination and lack of forward thinking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I formally congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your attainment of high office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by national governments at the United Nations in 1948. It was conceived when the Second World War and the human tragedies in Europe and Asia were fresh in people's minds. Framed as it was in the shadow of momentous events, the declaration of human rights is one of the great idealistic pronouncements on human affairs. The opening lines of the declaration are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>In June 1993 the governments of the world will meet in Vienna for the United Nations world conference on human rights to attempt to devise methods to bring these ideals into practical effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution to the Vienna conference has the potential to be an important one and I hope the Government will take full advantage of the opportunities. However, there is a huge difference between the rhetoric of human rights to which most governments ascribe and the grim reality. In recent years we have seen the Chinese military massacre students in Tiananmen Square and we have seen Indonesian forces kill a large number of East Timorese mourners at a funeral in Dili. There has also been a savage but thankfully brief repression in Bangkok. In Burma the popularly elected leader is beginning her fifth year under house arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Closer to home we have Papua New Guinea's Bougainville blockade which, with the assistance of the Australian Government, is denying basic medical supplies to the population. It would be unfair not to mention in this context the treatment of Australia's Aboriginal people, aspects of which have brought into question our commitment to ensuring the dignity and equality of all members of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the differences in this area between Australia and our neighbouring Asian societies are very significant. This was underlined last March at the United Nations regional conference on human rights held in Bangkok. That meeting was called to prepare an agreed position for the Vienna conference. Although Australia sought to participate and vote at the Bangkok meeting, several Asian nations were successful in excluding us and New Zealand. We were allowed to attend as observers only. Burma, although accused by the United Nations of widespread executions, torture, disappearances, unfair imprisonments and forced labour, was accorded full status at the Bangkok conference. Indonesia, smarting from world disapproval of the Dili massacre, seemed especially anxious to exclude Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems little doubt that some governments of South-East Asia will attempt to use the Vienna conference to undermine the concept of the ideal of universal human rights using the arguments of the primacy of economic development and cultural and national sovereignty. This view was recently indicated by an Indonesian government official on Australian television when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economic development facilitates the overall enjoyment of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to accord a greater priority and value to `economic rights' and to that extent it is a departure from the traditional western view. The Indonesian government official went on to make what I think was a case for some sort of cultural adjustment for human rights. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to talk cross culturally. We have different backgrounds, culture and so on. It is not just a matter of pointing fingers.</PARA>
<PARA>Conscious of this push for a change in the ground rules, non-government organisations, such as Amnesty International, have become alarmed. They are urging a reaffirmation by world governments of the indivisibility of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 180 of these human rights organisations based in the Asia-Pacific region have recently signed a statement asserting the indivisibility and independence of all human rights. Australia should support this position in Vienna. Economic and cultural considerations or concepts of national sovereignty cannot be permitted to override the right of individuals to enjoy equality, freedom and dignity in any country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should at least adopt the program put forward by Amnesty International of the creation of a high level position of United Nations special commissioner on human rights. We should seek adequate funding for the upholding of human rights by the United Nations but, most importantly, we should reject categorically the concept that collective and economic rights are more important than individual, civil and political rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday 22 April 1993 I had the great honour and privilege to attend a very special ceremony held at the RSL Riverside function centre at New Farm in Brisbane. This ceremony was the presentation to some 200 Queenslanders of the Malta George Cross 50th anniversary commemorative medal. This was a very special occasion for me and, of course, for the 200 Queenslanders who were recipients of that medal, but it was of special significance to one of the men present; that gentleman was Mr Don Mogg.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years ago, when I was first elected as the member for Moreton, I had only just started to feel comfortable in my seat in my office when Don Mogg came to see me. That was in April 1990. Don asked for my assistance to finally receive some recognition for the many thousands of allied personnel who had participated in the defence of Malta during the 3 1/2 years of the siege of the island by German forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may come as some surprise to honourable members that the thousands and thousands of allied personnel and the many thousands of residents of Malta have never actually received any official recognition of the outstanding efforts they made to defend Malta. Anyone who is a student of the history of the Second World War appreciates that the defence of Malta was crucial to the result of the Second World War and to the allied victory in Europe. Don Mogg, having been one of the survivors of the siege of Malta, felt it was time we paid some recognition to these people, and he sought my assistance. Don was, and is still, a member of the George Cross Island Association. That association gets its name from the fact that Malta was awarded the George Cross in 1942 by his Majesty King George VI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the only combat area in World War II awarded the George Cross. It was in recognition of the fact that the island had participated in an important event, but none of the individual participants has ever actually received any recognition. To mark the 50th anniversary of the siege and defence of Malta, the Maltese Government decided to strike a special medal, and it took some 2 1/2 years to convince it to do so. I am pleased I was able to take some small part in convincing the Government of Malta to participate in that process, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), who also supported this plea and wrote to the President of Malta seeking his support for the medal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to see, after so many years of effort, those 200 Queenslanders, who are part of a contingent of more than 2,000 Australians, finally receive that recognition. All of those Australians owe a special tribute to Don Mogg, because without his efforts I do not believe any of the Australians would have received the medal, and I do not believe that the Maltese Government would have been convinced of the importance of this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence of Malta and the participation of so many thousands of allied personnel demonstrated the qualities of courage, determination and enormous fortitude in the face of overwhelming odds that Australians have come to appreciate, recognise and commemorate each Anzac Day. It was fitting that the ceremony occurred so close to Anzac Day and gave us an opportunity to reflect upon the courage of those many thousands of men and women who participated in the defence of Malta. None of them were happy to be there; none of them were particularly happy to face intense bombing and warfare every day just to survive; they were there because they knew their role was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to have been present when Don Mogg and the other 199 Queenslanders received their award. I wish to pay  special tribute to the George Cross Island Association, to Don Mogg, and to all the thousands of Australians who played such an important part in the defence of Malta and, ultimately, in the victory in the Second World War. </PARA>
