<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. I ask the minister whether he made the following statement in the parliament on 27 August 1981 when, as the then shadow Treasurer, he was justifying the then opposition's decision to oppose the sales tax measures announced in the budget:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not blocking Supply. We are not suggesting a blockage of the Appropriation Bills and therefore putting the Government in jeopardy. All that we are saying is that there ought to be a blockage of these tax Bills because they are not in the best interest of this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask whether he then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is consistent with the fact that we have opposed various tax Bills in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the minister's statement make a mockery of the Prime Minister's feigned indignation about the way the present budget is being approached by the Senate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the Labor Party has never argued that we should block tax bills while saying at the same time that we should be reducing the deficit. That is the position that the opposition is in. The opposition is saying, `Stop these tax increases and let us have a lower deficit'. Obviously, the two things do not go together. The opposition is in an absolutely absurd position. How could it argue that this nation should be running a lower deficit while at the same time running a policy that would increase the deficit? Yet that is the position of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget the government has taken an entirely responsible approach to the national economic need&mdash;entirely responsible with respect to this year and to the out years. The small stimulus is appropriate for this year, and it is absolutely appropriate that that stimulus be withdrawn over the next few years.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our deficit reduction program is the kind of approach which various other countries around the world are employing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the minister about conventions and how the Labor Party had voted against tax bills in the past. Instead of supporting the ludicrous position that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday, the minister is now talking about a different matter. The minister should focus on how Labor is being hypocritical in arguing its case about conventions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has made a very valid point. However, the honourable member for Mayo was raising a point of order on the specifics of the question, and the minister will come to the answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been addressing that precise point. The position now is totally different from that in 1981. When the opposition was in government in 1981 it was not, in any way, in the position that this government is in now&mdash;because the Labor Party in 1981 was not arguing to have it both ways. Those opposite are arguing to have it absolutely both ways. They want to increase the deficit by some $3 billion in 1996-97. That would be the result of the blockage of the various measures which they say they are against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, they are saying to the world that we should have a lower deficit. It is an absurd position. The deficit reduction program that we have put in place in this budget, and which this parliament should be concerned to pass, is the entirely appropriate approach to be taken. The fact that members of the opposition are preventing that from being put in place is certainly a factor in damaging the standing of this nation in terms of the strength of the dollar and confidence of other countries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition laughs about that. He does not give a damn about the state of the nation because he is basically in total wrecker mode. He wants to do anything he can to make the life of this government more difficult, no matter what damage it does to the nation and the economy. That is a deplorable position to be in. His action is going to have the effect which he says is entirely inappropriate for the strength of the nation; that is, he wants a lower deficit but is taking action to increase it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has never been in that position. It has never argued that way&mdash;in 1981, or at any other time. Our position in this year's budget of requiring there to be a deficit reduction program in the next few years is absolutely in the nation's interest. It went down well with the financial markets when it was first announced&mdash;and it should be supported by this parliament. The fact that the opposition is trying to prevent it happening is economic vandalism of the worst order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has thrown away all semblance of economic responsibility. He is simply taking the populist approach of making the government's position as difficult as possible. Any kind of rational, economic approach has been totally forsaken by him. So the answer to the question simply is that the Labor Party has never been in the position that the opposition is now in. To go back to some past time and to say it justifies what it is doing is an absurdity.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FG4">Mr FITZGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House about recent signs of strength in employment? Is the government's budget designed to help employment? If so, what are the impediments to the government achieving its objectives?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1598" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the House that in recent days we have seen more signs of a strengthening in the labour market, with the ANZ job vacancy series out today showing a rise in September of four per cent, following an increase of 1.2 per cent in August. So the trend estimates being recorded in the series have increased by over two per cent for the last four months. The series is up now nearly 22 per cent on that of a year ago. That is encouraging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said last week, we also saw motor vehicle registrations rise in August to be 16 per cent above where they were a year earlier. Housing finance numbers are also up strongly for July and are nearly 31 per cent above where they were a year earlier. We saw the Department of Employment, Education and Training skill vacancies up three per cent in September, to be 25 per cent higher than a year earlier. As I said, in the non-residential building approvals as well as in the residential building approvals, for the past year we have seen a rise, and they are now almost 30 per cent above where they stood a year earlier. So we are seeing on a broad range of indicators an indicator coming through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one problem that the country now has, and should not have, is the question about the passage of the budget. The last place there ought to be impediments to the economic progress of the country should be in the place which is most interested in its progress, which is the Houses of parliament of the Commonwealth. Yet we are seeing this obstructionist tactic by the opposition in the Senate. At least it is now being noticed. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday, under the heading `It's time now to pass the Budget', said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shrewd tactics, however, suggest that now is the time to allow the Budget&mdash;finally&mdash;to pass.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to quote Malcolm Fraser's remarks of last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case can be made that this line has now been crossed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the line between sensible review and unreasonable and unproductive obstructionism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was what was stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 1 October talked about the `Dangers of rogue Senate'. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Still an economically vulnerable nation with difficult reforms ahead, Australia cannot afford an unworkable government. (Even the world's most productive economy, that of the United States, finds political deadlock a dead weight.)</PARA>
<PARA>It went on in those terms. I made the point yesterday to the Leader of the Opposition that he will expect to come back in 2 1/2 years time and contest the next election and seek endorsement as Prime Minister by the device of a majority in the House of Representatives. But does he believe he is then entitled to a majority in the Senate to pass the financial legislation of a government were he to be elected, when he is taking the view that the legitimate budgetary measures of this government&mdash;as the Minister for Finance has said, up to $3 billion; not a small measure; a core part of the deficit reduction strategy&mdash;are put asunder in the Senate by his actions? On what basis, therefore, does he believe that he could come back, seek in a conventional way to form a government and then say that he has authority when in fact he denies that kind of fiscal authority to the elected government in this term of office? I think these are questions that John Hewson has to answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These conventions are only safe from the first empty-headed opposition leader that puts them asunder, from the first person who wants to put them asunder. The opposition has to know that in the tactics that it is employing it is urging the parties in this parliament to rewrite the rules of behaviour in the Senate.

I will make two further quotes on this and complete his piece. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a falsification of democracy if, on any matter of government policy approved by the House of Representatives, possibly by a large majority, the Senate representing the States and not the people could reverse the decision. . . Otherwise, a Senate opposition whose party had just been completely defeated at a general election, would be in command of the government of the nation. This would be absurd and a denial of popular democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is from a leader of the Liberal Party&mdash;from the horse's mouth. Also, Prime Minister Holt said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one of the most firmly established principles of British parliamentary democracy that a House of review should not reject the financial decisions of the popular House. The terms of the constitution reflect this principle.</PARA>
<PARA>For petulant, spiteful reasons, having lost the last election, the Leader of the Opposition, a person who does not understand the conventions of this place or these houses, is now taking the view that he can hold up $3 billion of revenue from the Commonwealth government's budget to reduce it and, in so doing, is seeking to rewrite the conventions between the parties in this parliament. Were he to have approached the electors at the last election as a leader seeking to win an office in government by a majority in the House of Representatives, he could not have said that he expected any other party in the Senate to pass the financial measures of a government he led.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be led to that sort of position, instead of accepting the fact that it has been defeated for a fifth time, looking through why it has no appropriate contact with the body politic and society in this country and going back to its problems at source, the coalition is doing a spiteful blocking, wrecking tactic in the Senate at the expense of the Australian nation, the whole Australian public, so that we end up with a larger budget deficit at a time when it ought to be smaller and when the private economy is growing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party should understand the jeopardy it is placing itself in in following this tactic; in following the leadership of a person who is blocked in by the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;who now will not let him do anything on the republic, will not let him move on any of these other questions and supports this tactic&mdash;and the honourable member for Flinders, whose sole position in this place is to stand and wreck and spoil.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>I take great pleasure in introducing to the House of Representatives the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993. The bill is part of a scheme designed to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport and to reduce the administrative costs associated with road transport operations in Australia. It seeks to achieve the objectives of the heads of government agreements on heavy and light vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These agreements provided for a complementary legislative model to achieve a workable framework for the implementation of a national scheme of road transport regulation. Contradictory road regulations and charges imposed by each of the eight state and territory governments have seriously constrained road transport efficiency, and have impeded the flow of trade between states, to the ultimate cost of Australian consumers and industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is being developed by the National Road Transport Commission which was established in January 1992. Under the terms of the agreements, the Commonwealth is required to submit to parliament road transport legislation on behalf of the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory. The states and the Northern Territory will then secure the passage of adopting legislation through their respective parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Future amendments to the Commonwealth legislation and regulations on behalf of the ACT will automatically flow on to the other states and the Northern Territory. The Ministerial Council for Road Transport endorsed a proposal at its meeting in October 1992 to divide the task of creating uniform road transport law into modules. The road transport legislation is being developed at two levels: a set of broad principles to provide an overall legislative framework; and a series of regulations covering technical standards  which will be progressively incorporated into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill covers the module dealing with the operation of vehicles and traffic rules. It is designed to put into place a range of regulations covering issues such as heavy vehicle standards, driver standards, and traffic and vehicle operations. Further bills will be developed to deal with registration, driver licensing and compliance. These bills will, in time, be combined to form the road transport law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been developed by the commission in close consultation with all jurisdictions. A regulatory impact statement was circulated widely and submissions in response to that statement, including those from the road transport industry, were taken into consideration. Ministerial council voted in favour of the bill on 31 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first set of regulations under this bill has been drafted. The road transport reform&mdash;heavy vehicle standards&mdash;regulations have been submitted to ministerial council for formal consideration. I envisage that these regulations will be tabled during the latter part of the budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that regulations can be made to apply as laws in the ACT and Jervis Bay. The regulations will commence on a date agreed by the ministerial council and specified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum penalties in relation to offences for breaches of the regulations will be $2,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a body corporate. In the case of overloading, the penalties will be $3,000 and $15,000 respectively. The higher penalties for overloading offences reflect the more serious impact of overloading in terms of safety and road pavement damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the minister&mdash;being the relevant minister in each of the jurisdictions&mdash;may declare that the operation of the regulations are suspended in a specified area or even a whole jurisdiction. Such application orders will be made in accordance with the provisions of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and are subject to disallowance by the ministerial council. Similarly, there is provision for particular vehicles or persons within a jurisdiction to be exempt from complying with a specific regulation. Conditions for exemptions will be agreed to by ministerial council and included in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is committed to continuing reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the road transport industry and improving the environment in which it operates. The implementation of uniform or consistent regulations is regarded as an integral element in achieving reforms in the road transport industry. We therefore support the efforts of the commission to develop a truly national approach which will result in one nationally consistent and durable set of regulations covering the use of our roads and particularly the operation of heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments must also demonstrate their commitment to the reform process to ensure the objectives of the reform process are achieved and to enable the road transport industry to reap the benefits of these reforms as early as possible. The measures in this bill have no significant impact on government revenues or expenditure. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 undertakes certain housekeeping amendments to 13 different bills relating to the primary industries and energy portfolio. The first relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. Under it, the National Registration Authority will be required to release a summary of its evaluation of chemicals or chemical products before making determinations to allow public involvement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining comment on chemical products, and will be required to publicise those hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia. This is important to rural Australia in particular, when access to newer types of chemicals is freely available to our competitors abroad. The timeliness of that access is also important. The industry is keen to ensure that that process, without in any way watering down the vigorous standards applied to the sorts of chemicals that are used in agriculture in this country&mdash;many of which can be used to great advantage in the preservation of our delicate land and soil resources&mdash;is not in any way inhibited. AVCA has advised that it believes that this process is appropriate so long as consultation takes place close to the period of registration rather than earlier on, so as to maximise the opportunity to facilitate quick registration where that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority will also be able to seek the advice of certain organisations or persons by releasing confidential commercial information to assist it in its evaluation of applications. Precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority directors and staff are exempt from being sued for refusal to grant a clearance of a chemical product, and the amendments will extend this exemption to the authority itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of this amending legislation relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, and these amendments will allow the authority to progressively determine conditions of service for staff transferred from the Public Service. The age limit of 65 is removed, appropriately, and receipts will be able to be issued in a more efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. The government will incorporate ecologically sustainable development principles and priorities into the normal activities of government decision making and administration. This will mean the inclusion in legislation of objectives focusing on ecologically sustainable development for research and development corporations, and ensure that expertise in ecosystems management and conservation, as well as economic and social factors, are taken into account when people are selected for research and development corporation boards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boards will also be required to take ESD principles into account in determining priorities for allocation of funds, and report in annual reports ESD related research together with progress in achieving all of the corporation's objectives&mdash;including, of course, the new ESD objectives themselves. Again the maximum age for board members is removed. These same types of amendments are incorporated in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to a slightly more involved area, the Dairy Produce Act 1986 is also to be amended. The amendments to this act will remove any uncertainty about the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments which are financed by a levy on all milk&mdash;that is, a levy raised by the industry on its own people on the production of all milk. This market support scheme is administered by the Australian Dairy Corporation on behalf of the Commonwealth. The all-milk levy assists exporters to compete in world markets. In fact, it probably runs deeper than that. The levy focuses the sights of the dairy industry on world markets and exports, and assists exporters to compete in highly corrupted world markets, particularly in an environment where, for so long, the EEC and the Americans have refused to&mdash;or have been unable to&mdash;effectively institute major reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the system guarantees that the product normally exported is not dumped at low export prices on the domestic market. This market support system is being phased out and will cease to exist in 1999. It should be pointed out that it is not a protection scheme as there are no tariffs on dairy exports coming into Australia and no anti-dumping protection from New Zealand product. This will present us with ever greater challenges in the future because New Zealand has got on with the job of reform, and its food and fibre value adding sector is now able to operate much more efficiently than ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand's labour on-costs are lower, its taxes on input production costs and what have you are significantly lower, its waterfront has been cleaned up, and its industrial relations practices are more efficient. This presents Australia with an enormous challenge and will increasingly pressure Australian dairy farmers to match New Zealand's levels of efficiency. More assistance from government and union policy would be of great assistance here. Nonetheless, I think we can take great pride in the fact that it is reasonable to assume that, in terms of what New Zealand and Australian dairy farmers do on their own places, they are the most efficient in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the guidelines for the payment of money from the fund itself, exporters must deduct the amount they import of a like product from what they export. They are then supported on the net export amount. This is to prevent dairy companies from receiving market support payments on export product which would otherwise be sold on the domestic market and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale. If this arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation will be required to make back payments on the gap between net and total exports. In recent years, this would have reduced the effectiveness of the scheme by some $2 million each year. The scheme has operated since 1987 and every year since then the Australian Dairy Corporation has sent forms to all manufacturers seeking the amount of product exported and the amount imported. The market support payment has then been paid on the balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, two players in the export market believed they had found a legal loophole in the legislation and wanted market support payments on their total exports, not just net exports. Both have imported product, particularly from New Zealand. The industry claims that one of those companies in particular had used the offset system and cooperated with it prior to the year in question and was therefore, self evidently, aware of the rules. Normally, the Dairy Corporation would have paid out on the 1991-92 year in August of this year but has not done so because of uncertainty about the 1986 legislation. This amendment removes any uncertainty and allows the corporation to proceed to apply the arrangement for 1991-92 and 1992-93, and the other years following that, until the scheme ceases to exist altogether in 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the legislation is not passed, the price of dairy products will fall about $10 a tonne on average next year. This is because 15 other dairy companies have paid their offsets for that year and they would require adjustment. The Australian Dairy Industry Council, the industry's policy body which represents dairy farmers and manufacturers, and the Australian Dairy Products Federation, which represents manufacturers, both support these changes. I think that is of great significance and importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to the amendment to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991. When the 1991 fisheries legislation was passed it was anticipated that arrangements with the states and the Northern Territory on the offshore constitutional settlement would be completed by 3 February 1994. The timetable has been delayed and a further 12 months will be granted. The Fisheries Management Act 1991 is to be amended to reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a management plan. The court found that there had been an error in calculating the entitlements of some fishermen and a new plan had to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments allow more flexibility. Provision is made for a fisherman to hold a number of statutory fishing rights as a discrete package of rights that will authorise a particular fishing activity. An example of that might be a combination of quotas to take various species of fish, or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics, such as size of engines and characteristics of nets. </PARA>

They reflect a changed funding arrangement, with the Commonwealth providing $1 for every $2 spent by industry rather than dollar for dollar as applies to other rural industries. This is because half the forest and wood industry is deemed by nature to be a manufacturing rather than a primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide that money raised from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 will be directed to research and development relevant to the timber importing industry. Amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will allow for the collection of the levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will correct an anomaly in the act to ensure that it provides the necessary constitutional power for the states to confer functions on the Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intrastate trade in grain and grain products. While the states have passed legislation to allow the Wheat Board to trade intrastate in grain and grain products, there is some doubt that the Commonwealth legislation actually gives this power for grains other than wheat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In my electorate of Paterson primary industry is of great importance. Not only is there a strong dairying section, but we also have a viable forestry industry, a healthy fishing industry, a well-established fruit and vegetable industry and, of course, some of the best grazing country in Australia. It is important that the natural advantages of that part of Australia be preserved, and they will be preserved by this legislation because it places stress on our agriculture being ecologically sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is related to veterinary chemicals. When travelling to Canberra this morning, I read an interesting article about Australian rice. Honourable members are probably aware that Japan has recently agreed to import rice from many countries, including Australia. Until this year, the major argument that Japan put forward against the use of Australian rice was that the quantity of pesticide in it made it dangerous to eat. That report has since been superseded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian rice currently being tested by Japanese connoisseurs&mdash;we must remember that rice is a very important part of their diet&mdash;has been cleared. Not only has it been cleared of being dangerous because of pesticide content; it has been stated that Australian rice offers no threat at all and has a flavour equal to the very best rice grown in Japan&mdash;which, I am assured, is the best in the world. It has now been recommended that Australian rice be imported by the Japanese for human consumption. I would certainly strongly recommend that too. That example identifies some of the problems in our primary industry&mdash;problems which this legislation is attempting to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act. The area in which I live has long been renowned for its vegetable growing properties. But in recent years much of this land has been given over to growing cattle feed; lucerne, corn and the like. The major reason is that the people who traditionally have grown vegetables&mdash;on a typical lower Hunter vegetable operation, potatoes would be grown in the summer and cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli in the winter&mdash;are struggling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A family of farmers advised me recently that last year their taxable income was $14,000&mdash;from a farm that is probably worth half a million dollars. I said, `What did you produce?'. They said, `This year we are growing cauliflowers. We will probably plough in 60 per cent of them. We are getting 20c to 30c from the supermarket and it costs 40c to 60c to grow them'. As a result of this conversation, I contacted a research horticulturalist at the Somersby station&mdash;an employee of the New South Wales department of agriculture. I said, `Can we sell vegetables overseas?'. He said, `Yes, I could sell any amount of green soya beans, chinese cabbage&mdash;fresh or seed&mdash;and a species of white radish that Japanese and Chinese people use in salads and soups. It is very desirable to them'. I said, `Does anyone grow it in Australia?'. He said, `No. No-one has ever asked me about it'. That is the result of asking a research horticulturalist, `Can we export vegetables?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said over recent years about Australia's ability to provide the Asia-Pacific basin with food. We do have a remarkable environment. On the east coast of Australia from Cape York to Tasmania we have virtually every climate type that exists in the world. We have almost every soil type&mdash;the beauty is, our on-season is the off-season for the more populated Northern Hemisphere. But what research is being done to exploit the golden opportunity that we have? I venture to say that there is very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is significant that the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) stated in his second reading speech that it is very important to ensure that the best available people can be appointed to positions in that corporation. I support that. Our primary industry sector is languishing because we are not aggressive enough in our marketing techniques. We are not advising people of the technology and information available and of the markets that exist outside this country. That is where our horticulturalists need to be directing their efforts. I come back to the legislation to say that this is what will be driving our horticultural industry in the future. Let us get someone out there who is prepared to provide the initiative for our producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the Dairy Produce Act. I welcome the opposition's support of this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all appreciate that we live in an increasingly global civilisation. What we see in Australia today will exist in America tomorrow. That is so with the dairy industry.

They do not necessarily want to buy what the Australian producer is currently producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fisheries Management Act stresses that fisheries be ecologically sustainable. The major problem that fishermen are experiencing in my part of the world is not only the increasing levels of pollution in coastal waters for coastal fishermen and oyster farmers in particular, and the competition to the deep sea fishermen from external sources&mdash;that is, international fishermen&mdash;who are traditionally not observing the rules and regulations that Australian fishermen have to face, but also the fish stock that we are placing increasing pressure on is decreasing in quantity. Our fishermen's trips to sea are longer; their nets have to be bigger; their shifts have to be greater; and their return, unfortunately, is smaller. We must make sure that this very valuable resource&mdash;this major employer of people in coastal Australia&mdash;is maintained and is allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish up with the forestry industry. That industry, unfortunately, in the northern part of my electorate is in grievous danger of failing. It is in danger because of overexploitation of forestry reserves. The machinery that is rampant in the forestry industry today is  capable of processing far more timber than ever before. Unfortunately, we are not seeing the research, the value adding and the plantations that are necessary for our children to be allowed to see the forests that we took for granted. Those forests need to be maintained. Ecologically sustainable development has unfortunately become a by-word. It is one which is touted in virtually every sphere; it is one which too easily we resort to. I am proud to say that it is the underlying theme of these particular parts of the legislation that are before the House today and one that this side of the House wholeheartedly supports.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Paterson (Mr Horne), I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House in support of the legislation before the House and in support of the changes proposed under the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. As the honourable member for Paterson has said, there is no dispute in the House about the direction that this bill should take. I only remind the honourable member for Paterson, as a relatively new member in this chamber, that the sort of cooperation that has been expressed over this bill has characterised the chamber on most agricultural bills anyway and is something that I know the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), if not the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is conscious of and in most instances in his capacity as the Minister for Tourism is prepared publicly to acknowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the bill to which I refer, and the one that has attracted the most immediate attention, is the part that affects the dairy industry. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr  Anderson) has indicated in his address, this is a bill about which all parliamentary parties and all agropolitical parties feel some disquiet, but it is a bill which we feel obliged to bring into the House, present and pass in the long-term interests of the dairy industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last five years the dairy industry has had an arrangement where exports of dairy product from Australia are encouraged and assisted by the whole milk levy collected from the entire Australian industry. However, an anomaly has arisen. Some companies had been using imported product which was supposed to be offset against the level of support they received for their exports. These companies have not declared all of the imported product, and have not declared the offsets. Therefore, they have been in receipt of a greater level of support than the original legislation intended. The opposition joins with the government in seeking to have this anomaly corrected, recognising that this correction will involve a measure of retrospectivity, and will cause some disquiet. In the interests of equity, we see no viable alternative or satisfactory course for the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is to amend the legislation to iron out this anomaly, and so ensure that imports are properly offset against exports when application for assistance from the whole milk levy scheme applies. The government and the opposition join in recognising that, even though the anomaly exists and there is a good deal of disquiet, there is no other responsible course of action that can be taken in the interests of the dairy industry. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party pointed out, this particular course of action has the endorsement of the dairy industry itself. Last week, he and I met with the chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council in order to ensure that the direction proposed by the government was responsible and that it was reasonable for the opposition to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Paterson raised the other area of interest in the bill&mdash;the question of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Much of the impact of this bill has been on the dairy industry. I join the honourable member for Paterson in seeking the establishment of a national registration authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals in order to reassure Australian consumers that the food they consume is of the highest possible quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should consider some sobering and staggering statistics. At the turn of the century there were estimated to be 1.25 billion people on this globe. It is calculated that by the year 2000 the population base will be something like five billion people, and by the year 2050 it will have risen to 10 billion people. While we in this chamber are frequently concerned with what have been grain mountains and butter lakes in Europe, the simple reality is that we are still looking at a situation in which we need to have the best possible agricultural practice applied across the globe if we are realistically to go about feeding not only the world's present population, but the projected population of 10 billion people. It has been calculated that agricultural production needs to rise by 75 per cent. That increase has to be achieved on what is accurately seen as a diminishing land base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of our best agricultural country around the globe is being taken up by urban development, so there is an increasing pressure on every farmer and every parliament to find appropriate ways to go about maximising world food production. One of the keys to maximising production has been the astute and careful use of farm chemicals. Too often it has been far too easy to polarise the farm chemical debate and to have people shouting their concerns about what are frequently unfounded threats of pollution in the food we eat. In fact, as Australians we probably consume the cleanest food that has ever been available to any generation that has ever occupied this globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not generally recognised, and this legislation gives me an opportunity to highlight it, is the intensity to which we expose chemical companies in order to authorise or register any available farm chemicals. Few people appreciate that, of the 12,000 or so chemicals first submitted for consideration as potential new chemicals for use in agriculture or veterinary science, only one normally gets through to the final completion stage to be actually available to producers to use in agricultural practice. It is one out of 12,000. That elimination process takes somewhere between five and 10 years. Given the number of chemicals and the time lost in the process, it is not surprising that most chemical companies consider it costs them between $50 million and $80 million to register a new chemical for use in agriculture anywhere around the globe, and particularly in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reassuring to discover that, when the vast majority of chemicals used in Australian agriculture were exposed to the tests used for consumer protection, 99.7 per cent of the food samples used in the tests brought in a chemical residue level under the legal limit. In fact, in 80 per cent of the food sampled in Australia, there was no detectible residue of chemical available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal contained in the legislation before the House is to establish a National Registration Authority. Its task will be to further enhance what has been the very successful role carried out in the past by the agricultural and veterinary chemical registration scheme. It is fair to say that Australian agriculturalists have nothing to hide in the way in which they have gone about applying farm chemicals and that Australian consumers have nothing to fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all too easy to forget that the most hazardous time in applying farm chemicals is not when the consumer bites the apple, consumes the orange or picks up the packet of cornflakes but when the farmer picks up the concentrated chemical and puts it into the vat for dilution. In fact, the legislation before the House is not designed solely to protect consumers; it is also designed to protect farmers who are the users of agricultural chemicals. Farmers are most at risk because they are exposed to concentrated chemicals whereas the consumer normally faces a chemical that has been diluted 100 times, even when the apple is consumed straight off the tree after the spray plant has just driven past it, and further dilution automatically occurs as a result of its exposure to irrigation water, rainwater, sunlight or wind. So this legislation is designed to protect not only consumers but also those who are obliged by reason of their vocation to apply chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to point out that the decision to have a National Registration Authority has been welcomed by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia. The only concern it has is to ensure that, whenever the authority chooses to hold a public hearing so that people can express their concerns about agricultural chemicals, those concerned parties representing various consumer groups appear at one hearing rather than at individual hearings for every concerned party. It is rightly pointed out that that would further delay the registration of chemicals and would, for no good reason, mean a further delay in the time in which those chemicals could be made available to agriculturalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I opened my remarks about agricultural and veterinary chemicals by talking about their potential to increase our food production. It is important to note that to date the use of these chemicals has been assiduous and wise and that, as a result of these chemicals, we have successfully increased the potential of marginal land and the productivity of recently developed crops. That is to be welcomed, and it is important if we as Australians are to continue having the opportunity of making a realistic contribution to feeding the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads to other comments I want to make about this legislation. The honourable member for Paterson talked about the opportunities he saw as being lost for horticultural exports into Asia and to the Northern Hemisphere where, as he rightly pointed out, because of climatic conditions, our on season is its off season, and vice versa. I point out to the honourable member for Paterson that while I welcome his remarks and recognise that among the greatest opportunities we have for an expansion to our food base, to our productive base, and to increase our balance of payments in our favour is in horticultural development, we also have to recognise that much of what he sought to have happen is already occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Paterson was somewhat critical in his remarks of a number of horticultural industries because he felt they had not captured the export opportunities that had been presented to them. He may be right, but we should not lose sight of the fact that in my electorate&mdash;no doubt in his electorate; in fact, in all electorates in which horticultural industries are represented&mdash;there are innovative horticulturalists who are doing all they can to capture potential markets not only in Asia but also in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may illustrate that for a moment. While he was making his remarks I was reminded of a grower known to me in my own electorate who is busily exporting honeydew melons and rockmelons into Asia. I was aware of the fact that the Australian citrus industry this year will export navels into the United States and has just completed a season of exporting navels into New York state particularly, in the off season for the Californians, and has done so very successfully. </PARA>

I was referring to navel oranges being very successfully exported into New York state which occurred as a result of reciprocation between the Australian industry and the American industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On an even safer subject, I think we ought to laud what has happened in the Australian apple industry where currently exports of Australian apples have been in demand. Australians have been meeting their New Zealand opposition in very successfully developing export markets for apples. These markets had largely been lost because the movement of Britain into the EC meant that we had lost the preference that we once enjoyed in entering the English markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House and, in particular, the honourable member for Patterson that many of these exports are already occurring. I conclude by turning to an industry in which exports have been most successful and in fact ought to be encouraged. This is not an appropriation bill so I do not intend to talk about the wine tax, but I think it is appropriate for the House to consider that, of all the horticultural industries represented in this place, the wine industry has been seen as the most successful exporter. It has been a successful exporter without any direct government assistance, it has been a successful exporter without needing to be protected from imports and, in addition, it has been a successful exporter of a product that is value added and labour intensive. So, in that sense, the plea from the honourable member for Paterson for greater enhancement of horticultural exports, while well intended, ought not to be allowed to be left languishing, leaving the impression that the horticultural industry had been, of itself, failing to meet opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opening remarks I referred to the dairy part of this legislation. The changes that are proposed in the registration of agricultural chemicals are very important. It is exceedingly important that at no stage do we allow the registration process to frustrate the availability that Australian farmers have to the latest agricultural chemicals overseas. Chemicals registered overseas ought to enjoy a certain preferential access to the Australian market because Australian farmers need to exploit every opportunity they can in order to maximise their export potential and exploiting those opportunities will mean having available to them the latest in agricultural chemicals. We want those to be the safest in agricultural chemicals. The history of the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry in Australia would indicate that they have been safe in the past. This legislation should not in any way frustrate or delay the continuity of what has been a very successful registration procedure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking about the wine industry, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) provokes me to say a few words on that topic, but I will stick to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This is an omnibus bill on behalf of the various industries involved with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I am very pleased to see the Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) at the table. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has something like 240 acts and, therefore, it is involved with many diverse industries and tasks. There is a need for constant amendment due to changed circumstances in the industries themselves, changes in government policy, quite often legal interpretations and the correction of minor mistakes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consolidation of acts is very difficult, especially with staff restraints; but consolidation is also difficult due to the very diverse nature of the industries involved and the tasks being performed. I note that, in the budget, staff numbers are to be cut again in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I have always taken the view that if that department had a few more resources, particularly in the legal area, a lot more progress could be made on consolidation and in other policy areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we live in a time when deregulation and smaller public sectors are all the rage. Basically, the opposition wants total wage deregulation. I suppose if we got that, we could privatise government departments, send them offshore and get it done a lot cheaper. There are something like 60 countries with populations of less than one million people, so they should be able to give us a good deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Swiss Air recently sent its finance and accounting area to India, and is very happy with the result. So, we could export some of the people giving us economic advice to countries where we could get cheaper economists and financial advice, and this might be a good thing. But the industries we are dealing with here today&mdash;unlike other industries&mdash;are very difficult to send offshore.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on the opposition's approach to industry policy, I make the point that the effective guillotine now in place has been imposed by the opposition at the behest of the minor parties in the Senate. The guillotine not only limits debate, but ensures that the parliamentary draftsmen work under increased pressure, and therefore mistakes are more likely to occur as the legislation and the necessary amendments go through the system. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I hope the committee's recent report on better legislation will be taken on board by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992. The whole question of notification, testing, registration and clearance of these chemicals has a very long history. By analogy, it took this government something like six years to get the states to agree to the amount of sugar in jam, to introduce uniform food standards, and eventually be able to do something about applying some health standards to the imports of foods. In the whole area of agricultural and veterinary chemicals it certainly took a very long time to get the states to agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, each state had its own system of registration. There was a lot of duplication. There was always an argument by the states that there was a lot of variation between them. But when one is dealing with states as big as Western Australia and Queensland there is a lot of variation. Eventually, agreement was reached at the Australian Agricultural Council&mdash;as it was then named&mdash;that we ought to really sit down and see whether or not we could get national registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motivation coming from the Commonwealth was to get speedier registration of chemicals, avoid duplication and waste and concentrate our resources because of a lack of toxicologists and other people to actually review these chemicals. In the United States, an organisation called CAST, Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, is looking at this. Organisations such as that and Clean Food Australia are desirable in order to try to present to the public a more balanced view on the use of chemicals in the environment and in agriculture. Too often a good news story gets in the way of facts, and there is a need for an organisation to come forward that can actually help in obtaining feedback from the public and in developing some empathy with agriculture and for industry to try to provide accurate, unbiased information for effective planning and to provide assurances to urban Australia on the practice and products being used in Australian agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the move in this amendment to get more exposure. The NuForm Ltd incident was good news at the time, but when the inevitable backdown came and we saw the exaggeration of the story it did not rate a headline or a paragraph.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot is happening in the industry. I notice in the paper today that Japan now has to import rice and that it has assessed our rice as being the most chemical free of any rice that it is likely to import. In the cotton industry, progress has been made on the use of chemicals. Chemicals are used systematically across a wide range of industries. Internationally, some scientists now have integrated pest management strategies, partially derived from our experience. But the use of chemicals is going down. For example, in the Indonesian rice industry, there has been a reduction in the use of chemicals of approximately 40 to 60 per cent. This all bodes well. However, those are not big news stories; they are not horror stories. As I have said, there is a need to constantly get across to the public that this is a question that agriculture, the scientists and the government are dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act provides for the regulation of chemicals, but the amendments contained in clause 4 will substitute a new section 20 into the act and extend the range of information that may be disclosed and those to whom it may be disclosed. A major change is that, if the chemical contains an active element that was not used in Australia prior to the clearance of the chemical, a summary of the authority's assessment may be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may ask why the National Registration Authority would need to disclose confidential commercial information. The problem was that the existing procedure for disclosure was very complex. To date, the authority has not been able to readily seek advice from various Australian and overseas organisations and individuals because it involved the disclosure of confidential commercial information. However, I am pleased that precautions have been built into the amendments to ensure that trade secrets and certain other information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes are that, if the National Registration Authority is reconsidering the clearance of the product, it may disclose particulars of the product and that, subject to any conditions contained in the regulations, information about the toxicology of the product may be disclosed. As well, confidential commercial information may be disclosed to the Commonwealth, state or territory governments or their authorities; an overseas authority having the same functions as the National Registration Authority; a prescribed international organisation, authority or person; or a person who, in the opinion of the authorised person who is to disclose the information, has the authority of the person who sought the clearance to obtain the information. If you understand that, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a better man than I! However, all these changes are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question that can be asked is: why would the authority want to hold public or private hearings? The government is saying quite simply that it is committed to involving the public in determining the clearance of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product. For new products with new active constituents the registration authority will provide public release summaries of its evaluation and invite public submissions before it makes its decision. For wider issues the government has decided that the authority should be empowered to hold public or private hearings, and that is a very strong step towards the National Registration Authority's operations being open and transparent and being seen as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question is whether or not the authority itself will be exempt from suit or legal action in respect of the granting or refusing of an application for clearance. The proposed amendment will extend the exemption from suit in respect of granting or refusing an application for clearance to include the National Registration Authority as well as the directors and staff of the authority who are already exempt. The exemption is very specific and does not apply to the National Registration Authority in other circumstances, such as breach of statutory duty or negligence in performing its duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, these are all very worthwhile amendments. They go to the process of scrutiny. As I said, they might not satisfy some people in the general community, but I believe we have gone a long way over the last decade or so towards getting speedier, more uniform registration, having the capacity to take into account overseas information when the relevant authority is looking at new chemicals, and also allowing public scrutiny that should reassure the public to the maximum extent possible. Quite a few people in my electorate have been writing to me on this issue. Some of those people have been associated with the agent orange issue, and I believe the government has gone all the way in trying to have as much disclosure as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now quickly turn to the dairy industry. The two proposed amendments to the Dairy Produce Act will provide a clear legislative basis for an import offset arrangement operated by the Australian Dairy Corporation when making market support payments, and it will allow the minister to authorise the use of moneys from the dairy industry fund to underwrite the International Dairy Federation's world congress to be held in Australia next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some controversy on the first issue. The offsets are very important because if we did not have that offset requirement, people would take advantage of the situation and get additional payments for a product that is virtually being imported and re-exported. One company has said that the legislation is retrospective. The ADIC and the ADC contest, rebut and reject that. I am very pleased that the honourable member for Wakefield has said that the opposition accepts what the government has been saying by way of proving that this bill is not retrospective. Such measures have been in the present market support system since its adoption in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that when the amendments to the bill were reviewed there was a further possible problem detected by the Attorney-General's Department. The minister at the table has circulated some further amendments and he will be speaking to those later today. But that additional point was really about whether or not the mechanism was a tax, and the further amendment puts that all beyond doubt. I think this is all very necessary, sensible and minor, but it does show that there can always be different interpretations to legislation. That fortifies the point I made at the outset, that there is a need in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for constant amendment to all the acts that the department is involved with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to fisheries. When I ceased being the minister in that portfolio, we were in the process of setting up the Australian Fish Management Authority. It was the assumption at the time that the authority certainly had the powers that it needed and that the management advisory committees also had certain powers. But when we tried to put in various fisheries management plans often aggrieved parties would take the government to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and judgments would come out that really cast some doubt on some of the things that we were trying to do. Whenever we could get one group of fishermen to accept that what we were doing was in the industry's overall interests, we would find an individual whom we could never fit with a fair and equitable means of addressing fish management&mdash;particularly where stocks were in decline and where the resource itself was threatened. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the points I made a moment ago, the bill also makes minor amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to provide that a management plan for a fishery may include provisions to effect or allow the AFMA to effect seasonal or other closures in that fishery. There is a need to make that quite clear and quite legal. There is also a need to redefine the statutory fishing rights to provide that various combinations of rights can be required to allow access to a managed fishery and provide more flexibility in their application and control. Finally, there is the need to provide for a smooth transition from management arrangements applying under the Fisheries Act 1952, most of which were repealed in 1992, to the new Fisheries Management Act 1991 by waiving appeals provisions where the managed fishery access rights for specified fisheries are carried over to the new legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether it applies to these acts, but certainly in the amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 we are amending the maximum age limits on directors of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and corporation selection committees. I was not ageist at the time when we put that provision in the bills applying generally to all the statutory marketing authorities; that was the policy of the government of the day. But the 1990 review of Commonwealth primary industry statutory marketing authorities concluded that the selection processes for positions associated with corporations emphasised the appointment of the best available person with relevant expertise. Given that I am only 10 years short of 65, I can see the great wisdom in this. But cabinet has accepted here the recommendation of the review committee to remove the age limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the other amendments in this bill are straightforward. The establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation represents an enormous amount of work in the department over a long period and by the relevant ministers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as they go, the amendments in relation to ESD are a move in the right direction and it is probably necessary that they constitute part of that act. However, my concern lies with how much of this interest in ESD is window-dressing and how much will directly impact on the activities of the above corporations, and activities in development and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed to fully explain what it means by `ecologically sustainable development'. From talking to people involved in various aspects of the horticultural and meat industry, it becomes clear that some are ignorant of what it actually means. What is worse, in some sections of industry generally there is a real fear of ecologically sustainable development because it is seen as something running counter to development. The government should explain that, in many instances, the word `economically' could be substituted for `ecologically', because if something is not ecologically sustainable then it is also not economically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at some of the things that have been done in agriculture&mdash;for instance, in the Murray-Darling region&mdash;it is clear that if we had earlier looked at ecological principles and ecologically sustainable use, perhaps we would not be witnessing all the problems that exist today. We may still have some problems because we learn a lot about these matters with the benefit of hindsight. Nevertheless, these amendments will require us to put into practice that which we already know. The government has failed to explain why ESD is important: that 10 years down the track, today's ecological disasters will be economic disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had the chance in debates on previous bills to talk about ESD, so I take this opportunity to express some concern about what is happening to the whole ESD process. The ESD policy was announced with great fanfare and with consultation between industry, NGOs and all the people concerned. That process went on for over a year. It was a very positive process in so far as everyone involved had a chance to get to know each other, and it broke down the barriers that had existed between conservation groups and industry. They started working together, they started networking, and they started dealing with the bureaucracy. It appeared as though they knew where they were going and that everybody was working to the same end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of that initial period, things started to fall apart because matters were handed back to bureaucracy and government. The bureaucratisation of the process meant that those who had ownership of the process at the beginning were now losing it. They no longer felt as though they knew where the process was going, nor did they feel part of it any longer. Bureaucracy changed the process. It dropped some recommendations and changed others. The clear direction and goals that were there in the initial part of the process disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statements about ecologically sustainable development as part of the research and development must constitute something more than motherhood statements; they must be something meaningful. To achieve that, the government must explain what ESD means.

That is something that concerns me. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of the circumstances of what is now one of the most commonly used parasite worm treatments in our great sheep industry&mdash;an industry that needs every possible advantage at present. The product trade named Ivomec was introduced into New Zealand with no fuss or any bother in 1981, and it did not get full commercial release in Australia until 1986. It has been used since then. I use it on my farm, and I have not seen one sheep turn up its toes in all that time and, what is more, I am not aware of any others who put it into sheep having problems. The sheep are probably a little more worm free than some of their compatriots, but otherwise they seem to get along pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that there was plenty of evidence that the product was safe, it was necessary and it had a much broader spectrum in terms of dealing with worms, some of which had become quite resistant to other treatments. I can still remember an uncle of mine trying to drench animals with copper sulfate or something such as that because it was all that was available. These modern treatments of course assist, and we have had developments since then which allow cattle to be treated with a similar product by application to the skin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But the point I am making is that I have had those sorts of difficulties, delays and associated problems. I am aware of them because of the representations I made this year. I have to admit again that these problems have been with the health department more than the NRA. I refer to a product known in the trade as Formaz or, more broadly, as IPU 500, which is a herbicide. I understand it is one of the most consumed herbicides in the world. It has been in common use in Europe for decades, and it is possibly a herbicide that will deal with a huge problem in the Western Australian wheat growing industry of rye-grass herbicide resistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rye-grass is a very vigorous grass which causes a number of problems for industry. It can bring about a disease in sheep called rye-grass toxicity, where a fungus grows in the seeds of the rye-grass hand literally paralyses and can kill sheep as well as larger animals. People try to destroy rye-grass with spray topping before it goes to seed. Of course, if it gets a major hold in a crop it is a very vigorous grower and reduces yields dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering Australia's reliance today on growing and exporting wheat crops, one would think we would be desperately searching for a solution. Yet when this was produced commercially in Western Australia this year I found myself going through every possible avenue of bureaucracy to even get a trial conducted. The Department of Health in Western Australia was not much better than the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a reason for opposing the legislation, but I want to put on the record my concern as to how much further delay there will be in obtaining items that require no evaluation. These chemicals have no special attributes as to how they might work in Australia. Because we are at the bottom of the world one would think that somehow all these chemicals would have different applications and different problems. As I said, we go about reinventing the wheel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy for the NRA, the health department or anybody else to take an entirely new chemical and go through every proper process, but it seems that the bulk of these inquiries and delays are applied to products that are already in use in many parts of the world, and I do not think we are so smart that we will find anything different about them. All I can see coming out of the so-called public hearings is further delay and an invitation to certain sectors of the community to oppose these chemicals simply because they have `chemical' in their names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable members that farmers do not use chemicals they do not need. Chemicals are extremely expensive. On my farm, for a normal cropping program of a couple of thousand acres the chemicals cost me more than my fertiliser. I assure the House that I do not want to overuse them. In fact, the efficiency of my farm and of all those farmers whom I represent and their ability to survive in very difficult times can be advantaged by competition and by the introduction of competing chemical types. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Winston Crane drew it to my attention today that apparently there is a replacement for glean&mdash;an extremely expensive herbicide&mdash;which is 60 per cent of the price. But there is still a battle going on about endorsing it. It is not surprising that many people who might turn up at public hearings are surreptitiously representing those manufacturers who are already in the market. There are very good commercial reasons to delay the introduction of competing products, but that is not very helpful to the agricultural industry. I think this is a matter of considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making inquiries throughout the industry, I have had it pointed out to me that the NRA is taking a much more liberal view of this today. It is recognising the need to get on with the job of authorising the use in Australia of products that have been well established in other markets. It is to be congratulated. On the other hand, we are also told that there is an interdepartmental battle going on because the NRA&mdash;the National Registration Authority&mdash;with its proper responsibility for registration, would like to have total responsibility for assessing these products but has to knuckle its forehead to the health department. That is one of the great stumbling blocks according to the industry. Then state health departments jump in for a little extra. Surely today we should be debating a system whereby the NRA, if that is the appropriate authority&mdash;it appears to be so&mdash;should be up front making the full decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), I am told that the health department, when reviewing the decisions of the NRA, has four meetings a year. If for some reason it rejects the proposition put to it about a certain product, that is not dealt with in the intervening period&mdash;it goes to the bottom of the pile. Presumably, if the health department is a little busy it might be another six months before it gets up for further consideration. That is outrageous. These decisions should be made on an ongoing basis and every possible effort should be made to get safe product onto the market as quickly as possible in the interests of promoting the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other products that apparently would be very valuable to us. I am sure everyone will be able to spell these products. There is one called porcine somatophlin which is designed to actually reduce fat on pigs and turn it into muscle. It is an injection and is possibly a steroid of some description. But if we can get past the requirements of importing countries and produce, by this simple mechanism, a less fat and more muscular pig&mdash;meaning, of course, not tough muscle but edible muscle&mdash;that would be very helpful. But it too has sunk in the quicksands of this system. It should be out there making dollars for farmers&mdash;pig producers in this case&mdash;and, of course, consequently for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a similar product whose name begins with `bovine'&mdash;that is the easy bit to spell&mdash;which apparently will do the same with milk production. But, again, we cannot get it out of the bureaucracy and of course we should. I do not disagree that these are things that have to be tested to a reasonable degree. But, in my opinion, two or three years for a product in use in other parts of the world is just too long for national evaluation and we should be doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am taking this opportunity today to lodge my plea and again register my concern that public meetings are no way to overcome these problems when we have a section of the community that is totally negative about this type of farming activity and, consequently, will use these meetings to try to delay things. Some of the meetings could be private, as the act provides. That may be more sensible if the NRA is of the opinion that it wants further information, but one would not have thought that it needed a piece of legislation to find out things about these chemicals that it could not discover in its own laboratories. Part of the proposal contained in the legislation is to allow it to release certain confidential information regarding the chemical structure of these products. That does not seem very fair to the inventors, but I expect it may have some sense&mdash;although I wonder again why the decisions cannot be made internally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is my first area of concern regarding this legislation. I hope the minister takes it as a constructive contribution, because in the end it might do what the budget has failed to do&mdash;that is, create some jobs. That is a pretty serious matter. It might do something towards replacing the extra 5c a litre that all regional and rural people now have to pay under this budget just to get fuel and to pay for the cost of freight within their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astounded today to hear the answers to questions and the bleating about trying to get the budget deficit down when the simplest way to reduce the budget deficit is to collect taxes at existing levels through higher profits. In other words, create a prosperous community and we would not have a deficit problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the issue that this government should be addressing instead of trying to create myths about when, where and how the conventions of this place work in terms of the Senate's dealing with bills. These are the issues which will make Australia more efficient: getting the productive factors of chemicals and other things into the marketplace so the farmers of Australia, who have carried the place for so long, are able to contribute again and become profitable once more enabling them to pay their taxes and fix up the deficit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) without adding to their cost structure through fuel and sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take the opportunity to report quickly on the state of the fishing industry in a couple of areas because another segment of the legislation deals with this situation. I have concerns about the Commonwealth's administration of fisheries. I get a lot of representations about this throughout my electorate because people in my electorate who are established in places such as Geraldton also operate large fishing vessels, trawlers and such in the Gulf of Carpentaria and other areas under Commonwealth control. These reports are that it is a constant, ongoing mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the state Fisheries Department in Western Australia has a reputation unequalled in terms of fisheries management. It was at the forefront of limited entry, and it controls its fisheries on that basis. There is a huge controversy going on in my electorate at the moment because the catch that is applicable to the crayfish industry&mdash;the rock lobster industry, as the Americans prefer us to call it&mdash;has been reviewed. As a result the industry is recommending, with the assistance of an advisory commission made up substantially of fishermen, that there be a 25 per cent reduction in the number of pots being put in the sea to catch these crayfish. As honourable members will understand, those who have the pots in many cases are resisting, particularly those with fewer numbers of pots, because 25 per cent of that smaller number is a real problem. But they have the courage to stand up and do this. A very large proportion of the fishermen involved are prepared to accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach is needed because we now have such excellent technology in the industry. Once a fisherman used to go along and drop pots where he thought he might catch a crayfish, but now he drops pots only where he knows he will catch a crayfish because he can practically see them on the bottom. Furthermore, he can find them with the GPS system. It is quite amazing to see a fellow turn on his little television screen and see the pot there. The automatic pilot is turned on, and the boat can go and find one pot in millions of square miles of ocean. It can drive you to within a metre of it. The efficiency of each pot has gone up to such a degree that the industry has to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not related to the issue today, but I make the point that the majority in the fishing industry in Western Australia is standing up and saying that it accepts that something has to be done and it is arguing about what is the best way. But nobody is arguing against the fisheries having to be saved or that they are getting too good at catching fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there has not been a quick enough response in any practical way in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In fact, the fishery there might be lost because the breeding stock has been so thoroughly depleted through inaction. Action is being taken, but it is always too late. It does not address the fundamental act of catching fish, and that involves the size of the net, the amount of net in the water or, in the case of crayfish, the number of pots in the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament is being asked again today to deal with certain matters and, from reading the second reading speech, they seem to be matters which go some way towards getting better control of some of these situations. But I make the point that it is all too late. I hope it is not too late, but it is much later than it should be, and the policies are not necessarily good. One of the reasons for that might be either that the industry has not been prepared to give government the complete message or that the industry has not been listened to in the way that it has been listened to in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the controversy goes on. Unfortunately, to a degree it gets politicised over there. Recently I made a call to tell politicians to butt out of an argument about the biggest single fishery in Australia, the Western Australian rock lobster fishery. It is a huge exporter, one to be protected, and no side of politics should play politics with it. Concerned people are getting up and threatening the livelihood of one member of parliament who happens to have a business selling cars. People are being told to go to another town to buy their cars. That is outrageous, and I called for it to stop. I hope it does, because it is important that the right decision be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is time that the Commonwealth went over there to talk to a few Western Australian regulators, because they have certainly done a wonderful job. I lived in Carnarvon and watched the starting up of a greenfields prawn fishery. It is still going, and good money is being made out of that. Good money is being made out of the scallop industry there because of the controls that have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a little hard to understand, but involves only minor adjustments. I hope by now the message is getting through so that we will see some proper improvements and a more sensible approach to the industry, particularly in the Gulf of Carpentaria. That is a major fishery, a huge fishery and, as such, must be protected in the national interest. At the moment there are still grave doubts about its future viability because it has been fished to a level well beyond a point of recovery. On that, I will close.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My main interest in this Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill before the House at the moment is really with regard to the dairy industry. I was interested to listen to a couple of the comments that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made with regard to the National Registration Authority. I take heed of his comments. I can also see the other side of the argument: trying to gain a little more public involvement in the assessment of chemical products to be used in agriculture could be a very good thing for operators in the agricultural sphere, such as the honourable member for O'Connor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At so many other levels of government we have seen that the extension of public involvement in the assessment of these sorts of things is very positive. I suppose the longer we operate in this sphere, in this parliament, we tend to believe that between ourselves and the bureaucracy we hold all the wisdom. We certainly should not believe that because we do not; there is a lot of wisdom out there in the public arena that we should be tapping into and making use of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the House is aware that the opposition is not opposing any of these amendments. To a large extent they are commonsense amendments to various acts within the portfolio of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). As I said at the outset, I am more interested in making some comments on the amendments to section 94 of the Dairy Produce Act which was introduced in 1986. I believe these amendments will bring in a much clearer legislative basis for the import offset arrangements operated by the Australian Dairy Corporation. Obviously I am interested in the dairy industry because it is the major primary industry, worth something in excess of $60 million a year, in my electorate of Lyne. So I certainly have a great deal of interest in what is happening to the Dairy Produce Act, as it will affect a lot of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current system of import offsetting introduced seven or so years ago has been universally accepted within the industry and has worked extremely well. Earlier this afternoon I noted that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) spoke on this particular part of this bill. Of course, he introduced this legislation in the first place when he was minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody will remember that the industry went through a great deal of angst and heartburn at the time the legislation was introduced, particularly producers and particularly in New South Wales, in that initially it was believed the market levy was basically blackmail money to try to keep the oversupply from Victoria out of the market. Certainly that was a case that precipitated the bringing into being of this act. I note that none of my colleagues from Victoria are here this afternoon, but I will say that, so far as the suppliers from my electorate were concerned, at that time their market milk supply was being severely disadvantaged by Victorian producers dumping excess milk in a flush season over the border into New South Wales, thereby severely affecting the viability of New South Wales farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will add that this act has certainly stabilised, and ensured the future of, the dairy industry in Australia, in particular in my electorate. I have spoken to numerous members of the dairy industry within the electorate of Lyne and all have said that, although the all milk levy is a big slice of their incomes, that it is a burden to them and that it is an added overhead, they are very happy with how the industry has been remodelled, how it is developing and how this initial legislation in 1986 secured their future in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On two separate occasions cooperative managers have said to me that they have never seen their suppliers happier. The survival of the dairy industry in the late 1980s, and the subsequent growth of the dairy industry in the 1990s, can be directly attributable to some hard industry decisions made in those years. Included in these hard industry decisions was the introduction of the all milk levy and the system of import offsetting introduced under the Kerin plan, as it is called.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system works so well because it effectively pulls product onto the export market, thereby keeping domestic prices at an acceptable level to both producer and consumer, and thereby helping out all manufacturers in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most attractive part of this market support program is the equity that it gives to all parts of the industry. It is a universal levy which is universally accepted and it provides universal price assistance. This market support scheme has only seven years to run, phasing out in 1999. It is crucial to the restructuring of the dairy industry that it continue on an equitable and even basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already the dairy industry is Australia's biggest processed food export industry, with significant and growing shares in Asian and Pacific markets. The only way to avoid many of the problems that were in the industry is to stick firmly to the rule that support payments are available only for net exports. This is the only way to avoid many of the evils in the dairy industry that the industry has worked so hard to get rid of. Some of these evils include the flooding of domestic markets with excess supplies that could otherwise be exported, as I alluded to previously. By paying this levy right across Australia we are enhancing our exports of processed dairy products and will maintain a limited amount of milk on the local market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Dairy Produce Act is vital to the continued success of the industry. I am not against opening our market to imports. We have a very efficient and lean industry which is working very well. The effect of sucking in imports in this way&mdash;either for domestic sale or re-exporting&mdash;would mean that the total amount of product on the domestic market would be increased. This would push the domestic dairy price down, thereby frustrating the main objective of the market support system, which is obviously to hold all domestic dairy prices to a remunerative level. Furthermore, if market support funds are spread over an export tonnage, which is inflated by imported product, the rate per tonne is again obviously less which, again, is to the detriment of all exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment is not supported there will be no winners. All those in the industry would lose from the across-the-board fall in prices on the domestic market, which we need to remember still absorbs two-thirds of milk produced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a few comments within the industry that this is retrospective legislation. This is simply not the case. The other night I had the opportunity to speak to Mr Peter Gallagher, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Dairy Industry Council. He put a very strong case. He said that the amendments to the legislation will not be retrospective. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Council would accept that the legislative powers conferred by the amendment are retrospective, for two reasons. First, the offset policy and the arrangements employed by the Corporation since 1987 were endorsed by the Council at least five years ago and have been well known to, and accepted by, manufacturers since that time. Several firms have paid offsets against imports in years prior to 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADIC records show that the offset arrangements have had ADIC approval since at least August 1988 when the Executive directed the Corporation to continue the practice already then current of applying offsets.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that all operators in the industry have known of the arrangements since 1988. Mr Gallagher continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second reason for my belief that the Council would not regard proposed legislation as retrospective is that the offsets for 1991/92 are a current liability of firms that have received market support payments for that year. The Corporation advises me that they have not sought to pursue the offsets for that year, or since, pending resolution of a legal challenge to the practice. I should add that members of the Council consider that this is a current liability to the industry, not to the Corporation, both because the funds are the proceeds of industry levies and because the offset sums will be added to the total support payments available for distribution to the industry this year in accordance with the provisions of the market support program.</PARA>
<PARA>The offset arrangement has been a feature of the market support system since it was adopted, with industry support, as part of the Kerin plan arrangements. As I said before, all those operating within the industry have been well aware of the arrangements that have been in place since 1988, whether they be operators under one company name or another. It has become well known to manufacturers who have been claiming the support payments, and paying offsets, since 1987. There are therefore no surprises for anyone in the continuation of these arrangements, and there are no surprises in this amendment being brought to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the offset payments for 1991-92 have not yet been sought by the Australian Dairy Corporation pending the clarification of this legislation. After parliament passes this amendment and the corporation applies the offset it will not be acting retrospectively as people have known about the offset system for a long time and have already received levels of market support payments which, under the scheme, they are not entitled to keep. People are fully aware of the reasons for the introduction of the scheme and of what is required from each and every supplier. For a few companies to use a legal loophole is a simple case of someone trying to get an easier ride at the expense of his mates, and he certainly cannot claim that he did not know what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of three processors in my electorate, two fall into the category where they have been complying since 1988 and one has not been complying. So there are both sides of the argument in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this amendment is not passed, and the offset arrangements cannot be applied, the corporation calculates that the industry will have approximately $3.2 million less in its pool of support funds. The lower amount in the support fund will mean lower payouts to exporters. Butter exports will be down by $10 per tonne; cheddar exports will be down by $10 per tonne; skim milk powder exports will be down by $8 per tonne; and whole milk powder exports will be down by $9 per tonne. Also, the loss on the domestic market from lower prices is forecast by the corporation to be an additional $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just because one or two exporters have refused to meet their offset obligations for 1991-92, the industry as a whole could lose more than $5 million in support for its exports. That is not right. It is not fair for those suppliers and operators who have continually supported this program.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly obvious that this amendment is important for the continued success of a $1 billion export industry and, just as importantly, it is important for the continued success of what is turning into a model industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a model industry. Since 1986-87 it has got off its backside, helped itself, restructured itself and sorted out its internal problems. There are still many problems because different systems are operating in each state. It is a leading rural exporter and a leading rural industry today. It should be used as a model industry, not only within the rural sector or the rural production sector but right across the board with many of our industries. The export side of the industry is being supported so that it can compete in what is a very unfair and uneven playing field on the international markets. This industry is worth in excess of $60 million per year to the electorate of Lyne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in contact with many companies that operate within my electorate which are heavily involved in the dairy industry. I include here Mr Ken Isaacs from the Hastings Cooperative, which has 67 suppliers, and John Wignall from Australian Consolidated Foods, which has 70 suppliers at Taree and another 34 at Comboyne. Australia Consolidated Food believes that this amendment is important to maintain the market support to the local suppliers. While ACF is not in the export market, by its suppliers paying this levy it can clearly see the benefits that the current scheme provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACF produces approximately 450,000 litres of milk, with approximately 180,000 litres of that being manufactured milk. Forty-four trailers, twice per day, head down to Newcastle for distribution of this milk supply, with the rest going to either Gloucester, Lidcombe, or the huge general by-products station at Wetherill Park in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People at Australian Consolidated Foods clearly say that suppliers have never been happier, and that the current system of an all milk levy is working extremely well. I have spoken with local suppliers, including people like Elwyn, Robert and Leslie Walsh of Killawarra near Wingham. They have told me that, although the levy costs them on average $10,200 per year&mdash;which is an added overhead and about which, initially, they were not convinced in the mid-1980s when it was introduced&mdash;they now believe that it stabilised their industry, it stabilised their operation locally, and it certainly helped them to be able to budget into the future with their operation. These people are all fully supportive of the introduction of this amendment, and they believe it to be vital to their, and their industry's, continued success. The Hastings co-op is a classic example of how important this amendment is to the dairy industry. The Hastings co-op has just had its best year since 1973. </PARA>

The Hastings co-op believes that the benefits far outweigh the costs of the all-milk levy. It is not only important as a protection from overseas importers, but the state to state dumping, which was precipitated by a lot of action by the Victorian dairy industry in the mid-1980s, has been virtually destroyed by the introduction of the Dairy Produce Act in 1986.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment to section 94 of the Dairy Produce Act 1986 will remove any uncertainty about the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments and, in doing so, will secure the future of many of the non-exporting suppliers by keeping the domestic market as a viable alternative. The dairy industry is currently a model industry, and does not need to be eroded by some companies trying to exploit the system&mdash;the system that they have known to be in operation since 1987. This amendment needs the full support of this place, so that the Australian Dairy Corporation can collect its market payments for 1991-92 and, in doing so, secure the future of both the domestic and export markets of the dairy industry, not just in New South Wales and Victoria but right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week when I spoke to representatives of the industry about the implementation of this amendment, they supported it wholeheartedly. These were representatives from Queensland, not from New South Wales or Victoria, which are the major dairying states in Australia. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Queensland operates a different system. These Queensland representatives are fully supportive of what the current scheme has done to the dairy industry in Australia. It has certainly taken a great deal of hard decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I live in a dairy area and there was a lot of heartburn in the mid-1980s. But today, although my constituents are paying in excess of $10,000 annually on the all-milk levy, they agree that it is a good investment towards the balanced nature of their industry by comparison with the other primary industries, and the misfortunes and the difficult market times that those industries are experiencing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a little guidance from the bureaucracy and government, the dairy industry has got itself to where it is today&mdash;unlike the beef, timber and sugar industries. We do not want to see that strong industry position eroded; we want to see it continued for the benefit of all concerned, not just a couple of companies that have restructured their organisations and found this loophole. It is pleasing to see both sides of the House support this amendment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In summing up in this debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, I would firstly like to thank all honourable members who have taken the time and put in the research effort to make quite commendable and constructive comments. In particular, I would like to thank the shadow minister for primary industry, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson), for his comments. I might not agree with all of his statements about New Zealand, but on most other matters there would be agreement on both sides of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), made some quite visionary comments about his belief that there is great potential for increasing horticultural exports from Australia. I know that he is a very keen supporter of the government's clean food export strategy which, under the auspices of the Agrifood Council, is developing a clean food export strategy to promote Australia's clean and high quality food exports into Asia. I know it would also have your support, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the support of all honourable members in seeking to boost Australia's exports into one of the world's fastest growing regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) both referred to the claims that there is a retrospective element in the amendments which affect payments to the dairy industry, and I do not dispute the comments made by either honourable member. We do acknowledge that these measures will affect future payments, not past payments but, at the same time, will take into account previous imports by some individuals. However, it is the government's view that there is no retrospective element to these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield went on to make a comment in passing about the wine industry and, after praising the wine industry, said that the rapid expansion in the export of Australian wine products has been done without direct government assistance or protection from imports. While I understand that he is a very strong supporter and defender of the wine industry, particularly in South Australia, it is important to acknowledge the assistance which governments from both sides of the House have provided to the Australian wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation received over $1 million in the six years to 1991-92, and wine exporters received over $26 million in the seven years leading up to 1992-93 in export market development grants. The wine industry has only received those grants because it has spent a lot more than that in promoting Australian wine products overseas. It is through schemes such as EMDG that the government is providing assistance to the Australian wine industry, and we believe that there is still great potential for that industry to boost exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I had the honour of representing Australia at our national day at the expo in Taejon, Korea and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may wonder how that is connected with this bill. The major Australian producer selling products at our expo pavilion is The Hardy Wine Company, which out-sold its targets within a few weeks of opening at the expo. It is another way that the industry and government is continuing to work together to try to promote Australia's wine products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne also mentioned the Kerin plan a few times. It was interesting to hear the comments made by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), given that he was the man responsible for the reform of the dairy industry in Australia, and that he had to persuade quite a few people that these reforms were in the long-term interests of that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) made the comment in passing that she had concerns about whether the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) remained committed to the ecologically sustainable development process. As the Minister for Resources and the minister responsible for the forest industry, I assure the honourable member for Hindmarsh that both I and the Prime Minister strongly support the ESD process as outlined in the national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a firm commitment in that statement towards encouraging greater use of plantations and encouraging the forestry industry to increasingly rely on plantation timbers as years go by. The government's commitment to establishing the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation also makes it clear that government and industry in future will work together to try to develop new technology and new Australian research and development so that we can use our resources in a more sustainable manner. That is a very clear demonstration of the commitment of the Prime Minister and the government to ESD processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) expressed his concern about delays in the registering of chemicals which are commonly available overseas. He expressed the concern that in Australia we were seeking to reinvent the wheel each time a new chemical or product was sought to be added to the market. I commend the honourable member at least for acknowledging that the NRA is now more prepared to allow registration than it has in the past when the product is widely used overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the honourable member for O'Connor, I refer to a couple of the products he mentioned in passing. He mentioned that PST, porcine somatophlin, is able to convert fat into muscle tissue in pigs and that that would improve the productive efficiency of people involved in the pig industry. Advertisements will be placed tomorrow in newspapers stating that the assessment on PST has been completed and is now available. There will be 21 days from tomorrow for public comment on that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On BST, bovine somatophlin, which the honourable member for O'Connor also referred to, I have been advised that the United States has deferred approval of BST while further research is carried out. Last Saturday, on this very issue, the government advertised that new legislation will be made available for public comment and that all members and senators will receive copies of that new legislation for comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that new legislation, we are seeking to provide for fixed time frames for assessments to take place by the NRA. Those time frames will depend on the type of application, whether it is a new drug or whether it is a drug that has been used widely overseas. The procedures have been developed as a result of discussions with the industry. A maximum time frame of 15 months, but in most cases three months, will be provided for the assessments to take place. I hope that eases some of the concerns of the honourable member for O'Connor. I thank all honourable members for the contributions which they have made to this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition accepts these government amendments and the spirit in which they are put forward. They allow for the continuation of the all milk levy and its objectives in assisting export development in the dairy industry and raising prices on the domestic market. That scheme, as many speakers here today have attested to, has been extremely successful. As a result, we have seen the dairy industry remove itself from the front pages of the nation's newspapers. The industry was blighted by problems of farms not being big enough and of extreme poverty in rural areas where dairying was the major industry. Today we find that we have an aggressive, outward looking, professionally managed and, in many ways, a very impressive rural industry all round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kerin plan, to give credit where credit is due, has been instrumental in bringing that change about. The industry is being allowed to continue in a sensible way. The arrangements which pertained in the past, whereby a levy was raised on people who had imported by being set against their exports, have been substituted by the system outlined by the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), in that payments subsequent to a declaration of the level of imports made in the previous 12 months will now be deducted from the producer's market support payments from the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot but fail to return to this question of competitiveness. The dairy industry has done an enormous amount.

However, transport costs in this country are too high&mdash;they remain too high&mdash;and this budget does nothing but increase them. Labour on-costs in the food processing and fibre processing sectors of this economy are substantially higher than they are in New Zealand and we will not be able to raise any sort of protection against New Zealand imports under closer economic relations. We have no choice whatsoever but to match New Zealand at its own game. I believe that in that regard more needs to be done. However, I accept the thrust of the remarks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to seek from the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), inasmuch as he is able to give a commitment, his views in relation to the concerns that have been raised here this afternoon about public hearings on agricultural and veterinary registration. Whilst the industry and the coalition both accept that the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purposes of obtaining comment on chemical products, we believe that it is important that this process be facilitated and streamlined and that one hearing should be held as close as possible to the final registration process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of reasons why this is a desirable objective. Firstly, several bodies such as the National Food Authority will want to be assured that new chemicals do not leave residues in food or affect soils unnecessarily. It is important that the NRA is able to cover the range of relevant issues and views in as brief a hearing process as possible. Secondly, that hearing process needs to be as close as possible to the final point of the registration process to ensure that competitors do not have access to material that would be made available in a public hearing in a way which might imperil their commercial standing. Very few patents or other forms of protection are available to chemical companies. In view of this, I seek the minister's assurance that the government will seek to ensure that, where there are to be public hearings, they be designed to facilitate both the commercial interests and the rapid adoption of registration rather than hamper the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is particularly appropriate that the estimates before the committee should include the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, because that gives us an opportunity on this side of the chamber to say something about the extraordinary behaviour of the ministerial head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Those of us who have been in this parliament for a few years would have to assert, without any fear of contradiction, that the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in terminating question time today was about as erratic and as authoritarian a piece of behaviour as we have ever seen from a Prime Minister sitting at the dispatch box in this parliament. Whatever the Prime Minister may say, however much he may try to rationalise it, however much some of the apologists in his own party and elsewhere may try to put a gloss on his behaviour, the fact is that the Prime Minister lost all control today. He was clearly aggravated by a series of events, and he is plainly showing the pressure of the great public office that he holds and for which he is manifestly unfit.</PARA></TALK.START>

There was no excuse for what the Prime Minister did today. He plainly embarrassed people on his own side, and the rather anguished, embarrassed looks of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), and the stunned mullet reaction of most of the occupants of the government backbench, will long live in the recollection of us on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the pressures are accumulating on the Prime Minister. He has coming together this week four of the major issues which he would hope would be a hallmark of the time that he spends in the prime ministership. Mabo has gone from bad to worse. He has succeeded in alienating every single interest group around the entire Australian nation on that particular issue. On the industrial relations issue, he is on the verge of an unconditional surrender to his industrial and political bosses in the ACTU. We were promised a new world of workplace bargaining when he addressed the Institute of Company Directors within a few weeks of being unexpectedly re-elected on 13 March. We were told bravely and boldly that we were going to have workplace bargaining; that the 71 per cent of non-unionists in private sector workplaces were going to have the opportunity of entering into enterprise bargains; and we were promised that the government would stand up to the trade union movement&mdash;and it has been in a headlong retreat ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already agreed to destroy the secondary boycott provisions, which have stood for 16 years as a valuable protection for the business community against trade union excesses. Despite that track record and the fact that by destroying those provisions the government will be placing trade unions above the law in this country, it has resolved to go ahead with that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come to the issue of workplace bargaining. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) promised a Claytons form of workplace bargaining&mdash;not genuine workplace bargaining of the type wanted by employers, of the type advocated by the opposition or of the type adopted in many Australian states, and adopted with very good results in other parts of the world. It was not that kind of workplace bargaining, but it offered at least a tiny step forward which would give some modicum of additional freedom of movement for non-unionists within the system. That was not good enough for the ACTU. The Minister for Industrial Relations has been sent packing by Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty. He has been told that the only form of workplace bargaining that they will agree to is one that embraces the use of the award flexibility provisions and one that might involve the creation of a large number of workplace unions. The ACTU came up with this marvellous idea that the problem of non-unionists in the workplace would be solved by getting rid of them, rather like solving the problem of poverty by allowing all of the poor to die. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of pressure is accumulating on the Prime Minister, and that pressure came to a head today. The reason that the Prime Minister went over the top, the reason that he lost control, the reason that he demonstrated before the national parliament his unfitness to occupy his great office, is that he was angry at the response given by the Minister for Finance.

The only person who has been branded as a wrecker today is the Prime Minister himself. He has been the instrument of his own destruction today because he lost control of himself.

He has made considerable comments with respect to the pressure that the Prime Minister is under. It is clear that he is under substantial pressure in many areas. Mabo is one of those areas where he has taken a particular line to the Aboriginal people in this country and has then backed away from that line. He now finds himself under increasing pressure because of the attitude that he took early in the piece. </PARA>

The fact is that the Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from the union movement for it to have some involvement in the workplace based agreements. Over a period of time, we will see this pressure being increased by the union movement. This is of great concern to many small enterprises where there has not been union involvement and where, in the past, they have been able to operate quite efficiently and effectively under agreements and arrangements reached with their employees independent of these systems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over the last few weeks, and in particular in the last few days, in relation to the budget shows all the characteristics of somebody with a dictatorial mind. First of all, the Prime Minister takes the view that, if people disagree with the government's budget, it is intolerable and they deserve to be crushed. It is totally unacceptable for anybody to criticise the government's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Prime Minister, despite the fact that it is a dishonest, regressive and damaging budget, it is utterly reprehensible for anybody to criticise it. To the dictatorial mind of the Prime Minister, it is also completely unacceptable for the parliament to have the audacity to stand up for Australians in defiance of some of its measures. Obviously, the Prime Minister is resorting to the traditional propaganda tactics that have been so well practised throughout history by people of his mentality&mdash;what some people describe as `Goebbels tactics'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Prime Minister makes an assertion which he knows to be untrue, but he believes that by continuing to repeat it some people will eventually believe him. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box a few weeks ago and asserted that the coalition opposed tax cuts. That is not true. Anybody who follows politics in this country knows that that is not true. We explained at the time that it was not true, yet the Prime Minister continues to assert it. He believes that, if he asserts something totally untrue for long enough, eventually enough people will believe it. That is how he won the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His latest concoction is that the coalition is breaching convention by opposing some measures contained in this budget in the Senate. As little as 1.5 per cent of revenue measures in the budget are being opposed by the coalition in the Senate, but according to the Prime Minister that is a breach of convention. I could wheel out no end of constitutional lawyers and officials with great experience in the area of parliamentary practice to prove that the Prime Minister is wrong&mdash;because he is wrong&mdash;and still he would continue to assert the lie in order to instil the idea into the minds of some people that his proposition might be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I received a letter from the Clerk of the Senate in response to my telephone call to him, which effectively stated that the decision of the coalition to oppose some tax bills was entirely constitutional and consistent with convention. The Clerk of the Senate, a distinguished public servant, made the point that the Senate has every right to oppose tax bills if it so chooses, and that the Senate has done that since 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1901, the Senate rejected an appropriations bill three times before Sir Edmund Barton returned to the parliament with a completely redrafted bill. So from time to time, from 1901 until today, the Senate has been opposing tax and money measures. The Clerk of the Senate made that point in his letter to me. He made that point very clearly by quoting Senator Lionel Murphy, that great icon of the Labor Party. The Labor Party loves Senator Murphy and quotes him to support any case which it believes to be sacred. As the Clerk quoted him, Senator Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its power to refuse its concurrence to any financial measure, including a tax Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the icons of the Labor Party speaking, as quoted by the Clerk of the Senate, one of Australia's most distinguished public servants. Yet the Prime Minister continues to assert that to oppose any of his measures in the Senate at all is a breach of convention which, if it were a convention, he breached in this chamber in 1981 when he opposed certain tax measures. He was a member of the shadow cabinet at the time and he and his colleagues organised the Labor Party in the Senate to oppose tax measures which constituted exactly the same proportion of Commonwealth revenue as the tax measures the coalition is opposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's assertion&mdash;this repeated and dishonest assertion&mdash;that the coalition is somehow breaching convention is yet another example of the dictatorial mind at work: repeat the lie over and over again and in the end someone may believe it. I can absolutely assure this chamber that we will not take these tactics from the Prime Minister lying down. Every single time the Prime Minister tries this stunt, every time he tries to manipulate pubic opinion, we will be there pointing out the dishonesty and the disreputable arguments he puts forward, and exposing the hypocrisy of the case that he presents. We will do that every time this Prime Minister sets out to promote that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to hear the Prime Minister saying that the coalition is wrecking his budget; that we are wreckers and vandals. We get that from the Prime Minister over and over again. That is yet another example of the Prime Minister's technique of telling an untruth and then repeating it over and over again in the hope that some people will eventually believe him. Is it true that we are wrecking the budget? Of course it is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is opposing only 1.4 per cent of the revenue measures in this budget. If we take into account the views expressed by the Greens and the Democrats and look at what they and the coalition will oppose, in the context of this financial year that amounts to the government losing something like $140m worth of revenue out of $100 billion worth of revenue in total. In other words, if the Democrats and the Greens vote as they say they will vote on the amendments to the budget proposed by the coalition, the Democrats, the Greens and the coalition would reduce revenue by 0.14 per cent. Is that wrecking the budget? Is it wrecking the budget to reduce revenue by 0.14 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) run around saying that people will not get their tax cuts by Christmas. They are not getting five-eighths of them at any rate because they have been cancelled altogether by the Prime Minister, despite the fact that he promised them. They are saying that people will not get their tax cuts by Christmas because they will not be able to finance them. As things stand with this budget, the government will lose $140 million worth of revenue from measures opposed by all parties wanting to oppose them in the Senate, and they say that will destroy $1.66 billion worth of tax cuts in the 1993-94 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is that wrecking the budget? Is that destroying the opportunity to finance the tax cuts? Of course it is not. That is manifestly untrue. It is totally dishonest propaganda to suggest that the coalition is wrecking this budget or making it impossible to finance the bringing forward of the tax cuts. It is about time that this chamber took account of that and brought an end to the dishonest propaganda of the Prime Minister of this country&mdash;a man who is no longer worthy of that job, given his utterly disgraceful and contemptible performance over the last few days. </PARA>

I thought I might start with a couple of points of order. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 30 April 1981, at page 1808, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Standing Orders provide that an answer should be relevant to the question . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On page 1809 the same person went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. There is a Standing Order&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not numbered, of course, because I do not think this person would know where to find it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which says that an answer will be relevant to the question.</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker at that time, having had that point made to him, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Order! The Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as I recollect&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will draw his answer to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA>Who made those points of order? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows the present Prime Minister did. He wanted to complain about it. But what did the Speaker do? The Speaker instructed the minister to bring his answer to a conclusion. I have here a two-page list which takes us through from 30 April 1981 to 15 September 1981, not a very long period, and which gives 10 examples of Speaker Snedden telling ministers of the Fraser government that they should bring their answer to a conclusion. In one example Mr McVeigh was further told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The honourable gentleman will bring his answer to a conclusion or I will require him to resume his seat.</PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who were present at that time will recall that was a common practice. That was how Speaker Snedden dealt with the government that elected him. He dealt with the opposition fairly and he gave it a go. When it comes to relevance, it is interesting to note that a lady who later became Speaker, Mrs Child, drew his attention to his own ruling when she said:</PARA>

If the honourable member for Hunter does not know what his question was, nobody does. He asked a question about unemployment, an issue of grave importance and sensitivity. That is to his credit. He was trying to throw a little light on the hill because he wanted to raise the ANZ Bank's job advertisement statistics. The figures are a little better. What did the Prime Minister do?  He started with a bit of an answer on that, and the opposition heard him in absolute silence. We recognise how sensitive and how proper it is to raise these questions, as I hope the honourable member for Hunter did when he asked the question. What did the Prime Minister do? He turned around and used that question and the fact that he was standing up and abusing the processes of this place to try to re-establish his Goebbels like approach and paint a picture of an opposition doing something that was entirely&mdash;</PARA>

I was waiting for him to read something from Billy Hughes when he was a Liberal; he might as well, for all the relevance it has to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this place is clear: over almost a century the Senate has rejected bills prepared in this place, including taxation bills, and all political parties have been involved in that. There is nothing different about that. It is an absolute farce for the government and the Prime Minister to tell the people that they cannot have their tax cuts because of our opposition to the nasties in the budget&mdash;the bits the government never told anyone about. I have not been in the Senate today, but I know what our intention was&mdash;to pass the tax cuts. The Liberal Party, the National Party, Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;a majority in themselves&mdash;are all willing to pass the tax cuts for people for Christmas. The only people who are reluctant about it are those opposite. They come in here carrying on about it and trying to make this juvenile logic. It has always been like this, but it has never been so bad. It is absolute kid-stuff. I do not think the press gallery is that silly. I do not think it will cop this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister closed down question time today because the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) was reluctant to come out and say that he did not do things that he did, and he was dodging and ducking. Of course, his dodging and ducking on the world today was even bigger. He said straight out that he did not want to be answerable for what the Prime Minister said. He must be enraged by being dragged into it in the way he has. He is the person who, in 1981, put the then opposition's case and said why it was appropriate to do these things. Of course, he was right, and now he is having it put back to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was getting very worried today about what his minister might say in answer to the next question, so he closed question time down. In truth, he abused the parliament but, worse, he chose a question on unemployment to put on his stunt, when all he had to do was answer it properly and demonstrate that little bit of a light on the hill. </PARA>

They only went off when he abused the privilege of this place and turned around and raised matters which were totally irrelevant and which would have been dealt with summarily by Speaker Snedden, as I have shown the parliament today. Speaker Snedden would never have tolerated it, and he demonstrated it time and time again. He disciplined ministers and he required them&mdash;Prime Minister and all&mdash;to do the right thing by the then opposition and give it a chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94 moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is yet another example of the effective bowdlerising of great parliamentary traditions that the opposition has engaged in. It used to be the case that when an opposition had an objection to a budget it would move what was effectively a censure motion&mdash;that the budget be reduced by #1. From that point there would be a discussion on the totality of the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the opposition done on this occasion? Because it did not get the whole of question time, it has said that the expenditure for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet should be reduced by $10. Great parliamentary institutions are thereby reduced to sheer farce. It is sheer farce that the opposition has managed to produce the proposition that because it did not get the whole of question time we ought to reduce the budget by $10. It is unfortunate that the opposition did not permit the tabling of the $10 of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous). We could have got this out of the way and gone on to talk about the budget quite sensibly, the opposition having collected its $10 penalty for having missed out on 20 or 30 minutes worth of question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members missed out on question time not because of the absence of $10; they missed out on question time today because they were purely disorderly&mdash;disorderly beyond the capacity of any Speaker to control. This is not a unique experience in this parliament. In the last couple of weeks question time in the Western Australian parliament was closed down after four minutes, and nought minutes. There are a few other disorderly oppositions around the place including, apparently, one of our own. The opposition here was disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always amused when the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) stands up and pontificates on these matters. We counted the interjections of the honourable member for O'Connor during one question time&mdash;a question time when he was not ejected&mdash;and he managed to break the century; he got in 110 interjections in the 45-minute question time. It was a truly magnificent performance in its own way. Of course, that sort of disorderliness means that no questions are answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had this pabulum that there was no noise when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started to answer his question. The Prime Minister never stands at the dispatch box of this place in question time without producing an immediate orchestrated hubbub from the gibbering array of pathological exhibits who sit on the opposition front bench and, whenever question time comes around, proceed to get stuck into him to ensure that no answer is heard. Every now and then the experience palls a bit. One is tough, but one has feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no sense in trying to make points if they cannot be got across. It is not possible for Mr Speaker to operate on the basis that the entire opposition front bench is disciplined; that is obviously out of the question. The basic job of members of parliament in this chamber is to assist Mr Speaker to maintain order. In the final analysis, it is not for Mr Speaker to keep order; it is for honourable members to keep order over themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A point about relevance was raised. From time to time ministers stray from relevance. A question was directed to the Prime Minister as to whether there are, in his view, any impediments to the budget's capacity to create opportunities for employment in this country. I would have thought it was manifest that the prospect of substantial sections of the budget being carved up did constitute such an impediment, and it was so ruled by Mr Speaker when the point of relevance was raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no question of relevance. When Mr Speaker ruled the opposition position out of order, and the Prime Minister in order, we got this inane baying. What had been generally a gibbering on the opposition front bench converted itself into an inane baying over which absolutely nobody could hear themselves think, let alone speak. At that point in time the Prime Minister considered that, for sensible good order in the House, the best thing for him to do would be to shut down question time. The opposition is seeking justification not just on the issue of question time, but also on its general proposition that what it is really doing is not all that heinous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remind opposition members not just of history but also of our contemporary situation. Whatever may have happened in the past, this is now undeniably true: it has only been since this government has been in office that we have effectively operated a deregulated financial sector in the economy, a sector which is enormously sensitive to effective fiscal management, whether we like it or not. Some of us on both sides of the chamber, I suspect, do not like it at all; nevertheless, it happens to be the case that money markets and others in business these days focus far more heavily on the government's fiscal performance than they ever have in the past. That imposes enormous disciplines on governments; it imposes enormous disciplines on parliaments. That situation, of course, is a post mid-1980s situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second point that can be made&mdash;this can go into a historical illusion as far as this debate is concerned&mdash;is on the question of how oppositions choose to oppose budgets. Generally speaking, oppositions have done it in this way: where they have had the certainty of defeat in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, they have chosen to oppose them in both places; where they have had the certainty of defeat only in one chamber&mdash;the House of Representatives&mdash;they have chosen to formally divide and oppose it only in that place; and where oppositions have found themselves in a situation whereby their actions are likely to defeat a budget in the Senate, with the exception of a performance of the Liberal Party on supply in 1975, they have pulled back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has minded the odd $100 million trim around the edges of the budget. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his press conference today, he has introduced a whole raft of financial reforms&mdash;some associated with budgets, some out of budget season&mdash;on which the opposition, the Democrats and other Independent members of the Senate have had a million things to say. Changes have been made; there is no question about that. Changes have been made. But none of those propositions involved the systematic, full-scale attack on the budget that the opposition has raised today in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the articles the Prime Minister might have quoted in question time in this area, there was one he might have made more play of but he chose not to, instead going to Sir Robert Menzies&mdash;and I suppose if one wants a source for the Liberal Party it is not a bad one to cite, given that Sir Robert was the founder of the Liberal Party and the only decent Prime Minister it produced. But one of the conservative columnists, Gerard Henderson, had much to say on the absurd performances of the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and the way he has conducted himself in the course of this budget debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What upset Henderson is what ought to upset all tories about this position: as he points out, the opposition has, directly as a result of its behaviour, elevated people who are unquestionably ideologically unsympathetic to the Liberals to a point of legitimacy on interference with or manipulation of budgets that will be a longstanding trait and opportunity for them. The levity with which it is done is also a cause for remark. Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there is a way of stopping Alexander Downer's faxes. It's just that, as yet, I have not come up with the appropriate five-year plan. However, I do know that it pays to clear your receiving tray before retiring for the evening lest two or more Downer faxes increase and multiply overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So every morning, every night and frequently during the day media releases from the shadow Treasurer continue to arrive uninvited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My favourite is one which commenced "If I might take the luxury of making one prediction today . . . " to which was attached a memo from a chap called "Stephen" addressed to "Alexander" advising how to maximise media coverage. From memory, Stephen's message was of the "send more faxes" genre. God help us.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition could have negotiated the Budget through the Senate after seeking appropriate changes to the proposed industrial relations legislation. Instead, John Hewson, in revenge mode, decided to give a series of free kicks to the main surviving strand of left-wing thought in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the chamber cannot necessarily be expected to approve of everything that Mr Henderson has to say, but from the point of view of the conservative side of politics one would have thought that some of the things he has had to say would constitute some pretty sound advice. The opposition might well have looked at it a bit more seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that a soft point has been found in the opposition's political defences in this place&mdash;and it has been the cause of its baying over the last week. It is no accident that the opposition has got more than usually hysterical over the last week or two. It is always easy to get out there and make hay with an unpopular budget. It does not have to be a particularly brilliant opposition to do that. From time to time governments have to introduce tough things in budgets. Money markets happen to want to see those tough things, of course. But generally speaking it is fairly easy, if one wants to make cheap political capital at a government's expense, to take those elements of a budget which have found some form of unpopularity and exploit them. That is no real achievement as far as an opposition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here the opposition is creating a set of precedents which will rule. When the Labor Party confronted its bitterness at defeat in 1975, it eschewed&mdash;and I do not think, given the trauma that we experienced, many of us personally, that we on this side of the chamber have been given credit for this&mdash;using the Senate in that fashion ever again. Should we happen to be in opposition, we would not take our opposition in the Senate to any point of jeopardising the totality of a budget, or a substantial portion of a budget. We might well divide the Senate on it in circumstances when we knew we would lose, but not in circumstances in which we knew that there was a possibility at the end of the day that there may be a victory for us. The opposition rewrote the rule book back in 1975. It seems that this mood strikes it every 15 or 16 years, or whatever, because it has decided to rewrite it again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dwell on the subject of appropriation and, in particular, appropriation in relation to the Department of Finance and the disturbing situation which has arisen in relation to the Australian National Audit Office and its lease of office space at the Australian Labor Party's headquarters, otherwise known as Centenary House. Many honourable members will be aware that the bizarre details behind this arrangement reveal an arrangement which will take money out of taxpayers' funds and channel them into the Labor Party. It is a deal which illustrates that in situations where there is a conflict between public interest and party interest the Labor Party puts party interest first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General and the office which he administers, the Australian National Audit Office, are independent and external to the government. In historical terms the office is responsible in a broad way to both the parliament and the executive. The Auditor-General is appointed by the Governor-General which means, in effect, the government. But the Auditor-General reports to the parliament. The arrangements by which he obtains office space and indeed the arrangements by which he is financed come through the resources of the government: in the case of office space, the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services; in relation to finance, the Department of Finance. This arrangement means that the Auditor-General and his office have to negotiate with the Department of Finance for funding when in fact the Department of Finance may be the primary focus of their audit functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse is the tendency of the government to hold purse strings over the Australian National Audit Office in circumstances which I will come to eventually. Even worse is the tendency of the government, whenever it gets an audit report which it does not like, to personally turn on the Auditor-General and attack him as if the fault in government financial management were his. It is a classic case of shooting the messenger. It happened in one of the most regrettable instances in relation to audits when the Auditor-General produced his report No. 34, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The National Bankcard: Who Will Pay the Piper?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of the Auditor-General and his office space. The Australian Property Group of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services negotiated a lease for his office to establish premises at a building initially known only to the Auditor-General as a Lend Lease building. What he did not know was that the Australian Property Group was negotiating a lease to a building which would be owned by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Property Group negotiated that lease with the owner, which turned out to be the Australian Labor Party, on terms which included a nine per cent rent increase every year for 15 years. Comparable leases in Canberra provide for a one per cent inflation based increase over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Finance believes that the rental payment, a nine per cent increase every year for 15 years, is out of the ballpark, out of the grandstand, and even out of the car park as far as Canberra is concerned. It has said that in relation to commercial property it should be only one per cent per annum, therefore the Australian National Audit Office will be given an increase of only one per cent per annum in relation to rental for the duration of the lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is obvious. The audit office is locked into a lease, which escalates at nine per cent per annum, but will be funded only for increased rent at one per cent per annum. As the Auditor-General has stated in hearings of the Senate estimates committee, this leaves the Auditor-General with no other choice but to reduce staff to pay the rent. He has stated that by 1996 the office will be in a totally untenable position and will be unable to carry out its functions properly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The function of scrutinising government and looking after taxpayers' money will now be run down in order that the Auditor-General can make lease payments, which are uncommercial, to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not contend that the Auditor-General has acted without fault. Clearly, he should have taken a much closer interest rather than just leaving this to the department. Maybe he should have asked some questions or maybe he should have sighted the lease and looked into it as a good auditor, one would think, might do before allowing it to be undertaken on behalf of his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has told the Senate estimates committee that he was unaware of the escalation clause in the lease agreement. That being the case, it is now clear that the Auditor-General will not be in a position to perform the critical role of scrutinising government departments and authorities because he will be debilitated by devoting the best part of his resources to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nine per cent increase will be going off to the Australian Labor Party and coming out of officers who should be scrutinising the Labor government in relation to where its expenditure is going. The fact is that, unless something changes in a few years, the audit function in relation to the Commonwealth of Australia will have been run down and the ALP will grow fat on the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General may have been too trusting in relying, as he did, on the advice of the Australian Property Group. Those whom he relied upon for expert advice were probably less than competent, but the Australian Labor Party has been less than decent. It has succeeded in diverting millions of dollars from the Commonwealth into its own coffers. Quite often in this House we hear how it claims or feigns to stand up for the little battlers. But when it comes to operating as a capitalist, it wants to extract every ounce of blood it can get from every commercial deal it does. The ALP cures its escalating debt with public money. It is prepared to rob a public function, which is essential to the careful scrutiny of government, to protect its interests at the taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both of these issues need resolution. It is not healthy in a democracy such as Australia for the government to sit back and watch the necessary and critical functions of an independent watchdog disappear and dissipate. By the same token, it is hardly healthy in a democracy for the Department of Finance to agree to an uncommercial nine per cent rent increase for the next 15 years when it is not required by commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an answer. The Australian Labor Party, if it had the decency to do so, could either merge the lease or reopen it and renegotiate it on commercial terms; it could eschew unconscionable conduct; it could elevate the public interest over private financial gain; it could ensure that audit functions continued whilst it received a commercial rent; it could put into practice what we have so frequently heard lectures about: conscionable dealing by commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's office has been performing a very valuable role. That valuable role should not be brought to an end; in fact, it ought to be enhanced. That valuable role of scrutinising government departments, seeing where taxpayers' money goes, making sure that it is not wasted and protecting taxpayers against government ought to be continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that the Auditor-General should have even greater independence. Senator Watson will introduce a private member's bill in the Senate, which will have support from the opposition, to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, to free the Auditor-General from some of the constraints that currently operate on him where he is funded by, and scrutinising, the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been recommended for many years. It came out of a report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament</EMPHASIS>. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has not seen fit to take any action on it over the last four years. We on this side of the chamber believe that some action should be taken and Senator Watson will be introducing that bill to ensure that the Auditor-General's independent statutory function is protected. </PARA>

All it takes is a bit of honour&mdash;the honour to open up that lease and renegotiate it, the honour to say, `We will not rob taxpayers' funds and run down scrutiny of government. We will put public interest in front of private interest and unconscionable dealing'. A bit of honour from the Labor Party could solve this problem.

It is interesting that at the last election the coalition had a very comprehensive policy on the structure of ATSIC. It is interesting to note that since that election much of the policy that we took to the people in March has been legislated in this place because, to its credit, the government recognised the worth of that policy and introduced it as legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the coalition's initial resistance to the formation of ATSIC some time ago, in the last three years I think there has been very considerable bipartisan support for ATSIC in this place. That support is based on the view that, whatever we have been doing as a nation in the past in respect of indigenous affairs, clearly it failed by whatever measure or yardstick we want to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throwing money at the Aboriginal problems and ignoring the cultural differences or the lack of skills and experience to administer some of those resources in the Aboriginal community were certainly not having a sufficient positive effect. We believe that the best thing for human dignity and a meaningful life is, wherever possible, independent effort and self-reliance. This should be the aim in Aboriginal affairs, the same as in any other area of endeavour. I believe that is compatible with the basis of ATSIC's existence, which is a continuing devolution of responsibility and decision making to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years we have been committed to a bipartisan&mdash;in fact, a cross-party&mdash;approach. However, this does not mean that we as an opposition can forget our role to try to keep the government honest. We have questioned and, when appropriate, will continue to question whether ATSIC is achieving what it was set up to do. I want to issue a word of warning to some who seek headlines around the country with the more strident and publicity seeking sensationalist comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we all recognise that it is no use trying to assess the effectiveness of long-term programs in a short time frame&mdash;after all, ATSIC is in its infancy. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 1989 was only proclaimed on 7 February 1990 and ATSIC commenced operations on 5 March 1990&mdash;just 3 1/2 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps instructive to look at performance indicators in areas such as housing, education and health today which often reflect decades of indifference, poor policy decisions and downright neglect over a long period of time. Can we truly therefore lay the blame for those poor outcomes at the doorstep of an organisation which has been in existence for only 3 1/2 years? ATSIC's statement of purpose at its inception stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC will work towards the achievement, in the longer term, of a situation of justice and equity where Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have sufficient economic and social status to enjoy fundamental civil, social and economic rights.</PARA>
<PARA>For example, we could hardly look at the past three years educational achievement statistics to assess the effectiveness of a preschool program which has been running for only three years. We cannot yet assess the benefits of infrastructure such as the provision of water and sewerage in a particular community in a short time frame to see what benefits it will  have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About two years ago I visited the community of Woorabinda in Queensland which was in a shocking condition. I went back there a couple of months ago. In the meantime, the community had installed sewerage works, sealed the roads and made a number of other infrastructure changes. Visibly, there was not a lot of change but, clearly, by putting in that infrastructure that community will be in a position to actually advance quite rapidly from now on. So we must have realistic time scales. People from either the Aboriginal or the wider community who expect miracles are being very unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The spotlight has been on ATSIC in recent months and ATSIC seems somewhat ultra sensitive to this. I have to tell the commission that it should not be, so long as the criticisms are constructive, realistic and made with some understanding and appreciation of the problems involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three years since I have been in this place the statement that I have heard frequently is that Aboriginal organisations are the most audited in the country. I do not believe that is necessarily true. Perhaps we should ask the Australian Taxation Office about the activities of a certain lady senator! The point is that any government department administering taxpayer money must expect to be called to account for its actions. The true measure of independence sought by Aboriginal communities surely is that one must be prepared to be answerable for one's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst recognising that we cannot expect ATSIC to perform miracles overnight, the questions I would ask are these: where are the public and easily understood performance benchmarks? What are ATSIC's priorities? I have mentioned its statement of purpose&mdash;and it is a very generalised statement&mdash;but I ask: what actual and detailed targets have been set for achieving this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that one important performance area would be housing. For example, according to Industry Commission estimates it costs $150,000 to build a standard three-bedroom house in remote areas of the Northern Territory. I was in Maningrida, a little community on the northern shores of the Northern Territory, two or three months ago. That community consists of 1,159 people, not counting the out-stations, 42 per cent of whom are aged under 14 and only four per cent of whom are aged over 50. There are 300 family units, with up to 38 people in a single house. There is no accommodation at all for single men. Just imagine the pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Including the people in the public gallery, there are probably 15 or 16 people in this chamber at the moment. We are talking about more than double this number of people living in one three-bedroom house with one toilet and one shower in a hot climate&mdash;young families, kids trying to do homework, older parents, screaming babies and all the pressures that go with that. Those issues are very important and should be dealt with. In that community, if one takes out the substandard accommodation, the average is 9.8 people to a single bedroom. If we were to build a standard dwelling for each family unit in that community it would cost $45 million in construction costs alone, and that story can be paralleled right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 census showed that 67 per cent of the general Australian population own their own home&mdash;the figure for the Aboriginal community is only 28 per cent. It was stated in the government publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social justice for indigenous Australians 1993-94</EMPHASIS> that a housing needs survey in 1987 indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 16,000 additional dwellings were required to meet the needs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders living in substandard and overcrowded conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Just meeting that backlog alone would cost something in excess of $2 billion. There are other issues concerning the appropriateness of housing; the larger number of extended families in the Aboriginal community; the fact that there are more lone parent families in the Aboriginal population compared with the general Australian population; and more multi-family households&mdash;eight per cent in the indigenous population compared with one per cent in the rest of the community. The Industry Commission report on public housing said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the expected increase in both the population and the number of ATSI households, it is very unlikely that the level of funds provided will ever meet all the housing needs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty daunting statement. So in that climate, when we spend our dollar in the Aboriginal community, what should we be spending it on? I ask ATSIC, in its self-determining role, to ensure that the expenditure of every dollar achieves the maximum long-term efficiency and effectiveness. How much of that administration and how many conferences are really essential? When it comes to funding some of the legal activities that have been going on for clearly political purposes, I have to ask: why is that so important? It may be desirable, but where are the priorities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC has a fundamental issue to face: priorities on where it spends its money. Does it spend it on the nice things, the esoteric things, the desirable things or on the hard, tangible areas on the ground? I am almost out of time. Later in this debate I will seek to obtain the call again to talk about some other issues concerning not only housing but also health and education and what I think the government needs to do about some of those things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate in support of the amendment that has been moved with one or two things in mind. One of the reasons&mdash;not the prime reason&mdash;that the amendment has been moved is the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this House this afternoon. I think it will go on record as one of the more disgraceful episodes that we have seen in this new Parliament House for quite a few years. His behaviour only heightens that which I have said in this House before, that democracy in this Parliament House and this chamber is fast disappearing. Some of the conventions that we have held dear over the last 90 years of federation have slowly been watered down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that I have expressed in the past is the arrogance with which ministers treat this House. When they are supposed to be presenting a bill, they leave a parliamentary secretary or someone else with no relationship or without any feeling for the bill itself to attend to it. In fact, the other night the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) dealt with a matter to do with science. He was quite out of his depth. The executive power is very real in this parliament today. One wonders just what power an individual, a backbencher or a properly elected person has at this time. The Prime Minister's adage is that when the going gets tough&mdash;not that the tough get going&mdash;he gets out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Curtin is absolutely right. It is a very rude and arrogant attitude that is fast becoming the hallmark of this government. The manner in which he badmouths Australia overseas concerns me greatly. I refer particularly to the republican issue. All of the running on the issue of the republic is done overseas, as is his criticism of our flag. We have to wonder what international people think or believe of Australia when the Prime Minister, in the position in which he was elected to this place, does not have the decency to support Australia, as he should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal with the republican matter fairly and squarely by referring to the lack of equity and justice in the appropriation for the Republic Advisory Committee on constitutional reform. I understand that it has probably already been funded to the extent of under $1 million. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame because this budget provides for another $600,000 in 1993-94 and a further $200,000 per year until 1996. I think that is arrogance at its worst. We have not had a decision made by the people of Australia. This parliament has been elected under the constitution which has been with us since 1901. It is to all intents and purposes a democratic constitution. Fairness would indicate that the organisation Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy should be favoured with at least an equal amount of money in order to put the alternative viewpoint. At the moment in Australia we have the spectacle of one of the major newspapers carrying an advertisement for designs for the new flag. I suggest that anybody who looked at that advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last weekend should take it out, draw a picture of the current Australian flag on it and send it back to the originators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that with a purpose. Much has been made in the last two weeks about the win by Sydney of the Olympic games in the year 2000. I suggest to this chamber and the people of Australia that that bid was won because Australia is recognised throughout the world by its flag, its constitution and its known link with the monarchy. Anybody who now suggests that there is a reason to change when we have been so successful under the monarchy I believe is throwing the beliefs of the majority of Australians back in their faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I refer to are the recent 75th anniversary celebrations of the occasion on which Australians defended the Somme at Villers-Bretonneux and also Bullecourt&mdash;an area that is known for its very good relationships with Australia. I was there just two years ago and the Australian flag is proudly shown within the shire chambers of the local council and the school is prepared to always acclaim the generosity of Australians. For the Prime Minister to have used that occasion as a negotiating tool against the French by denigrating the efforts of those people who were there at that time, who fought under the flag and fought for Australia was uncalled for. I believe that in another circumstance and another place that would have been quite appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father fought at Villers-Bretonneux, Bullecourt, Pozieres and right along the Somme. My uncle was killed in Flanders and is buried near Ypres. I believe those Australians who fought in that war fought for the flag and for a principle. That principle is now being put into second place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has no mandate to change the flag or the constitution. I think it is quite inappropriate for the Republic Advisory Committee to be allocated the amount that it has. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is the only honourable member on the government side prepared to stick by the principles of what the monarchy means to Australia, what that monarchy means as to the democratic rights of all Australians and what he believes is the part that Great Britain played in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country goes from one crisis to another regarding our debt, this budget outcome and our competitiveness. Talking in terms of such irrelevancies indicates that our priorities are not correct. I call these matters irrelevancies because the majority of Australians want the monarchy to continue. Certainly the impression I get from my electorate is that under no circumstances should the flag be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Department of the Treasury is thinking of putting out a new $10 note. That is not too bad, I do not mind what changes the department makes, but I know that a lot of my constituents have been concerned about the $5 note. It may be that a new $10 note will only have the value of a $5 note of two or three years ago. The matter that I find a little concerning is that the new $10 note will be the same length as the $5 note issued last year but will be 7 millimetres longer to help people who have problems with their sight to recognise the new note. The new $10 note, like the $5 note, will be made of polymer, which is a type of plastic. There was an adverse reaction to the $5 note. There are people who cannot handle it, particularly the aged. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about the fallacy in this place of calling bills deficit reduction bills. The main concern out there in Australia is not about the republic or the monarchy; it is about the fact that our national debt, as the Auditor-General disclosed, is escalating beyond our ability to repay it. Our national debt, including our foreign debt, is now the highest per capita of any country throughout the world&mdash;Somalia, Ethiopia, or anywhere. I think it is a nonsense to describe these bills as deficit reduction bills, especially when they are not reducing the deficit and particularly in a situation where they should be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has before it Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, which deals with appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Treasury and the Advance to the Minister for Finance. We would not know that, of course, from listening to most of the input from the opposition. We had earlier this afternoon, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) so succinctly said, a stunt move by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). To get his own point of view across, he used the mechanism of proposing that we reduce the appropriation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet by $10. He then went on a rather lengthy dissertation of the terrible things that have happened in this chamber since the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose everything that has happened since the election has been pretty terrible for the honourable member for Bennelong. He did not get to be Leader of the Opposition again; he did not get to be a minister in a Hewson government&mdash;though that probably would have been as galling for him as the position he is in now. He and all his colleagues are rather unhappy that the Australian people chose us and not them, which I think shows a remarkable amount of sense on the part of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In parts of this debate the opposition has expressed some real fear about what is going to happen with the republican issue, what is going to happen with the flag, what is going to happen tomorrow at question time. I think government members could say to the opposition that, since the election, the government has been involved in a number of issues which are of great importance to Australians, and the appropriation for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has assisted the government in some of these endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support that PM&amp;C has given to the Mabo issue, for instance, is one instance where the government can rightly say that it is doing something to address an issue that has been of concern to all Australians for many years. I think that all of us, as Australians, need to be able to come to terms with the Aboriginal community, and all of us, as Australians, will not be able to go into the 21st century unless we successfully do that. The Mabo process, which has been supported by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, has been a mechanism for us to address, as Australians of European descent, our having to come to terms with those people who have lived in this country for many thousands of years before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is something that the opposition does not really want us to address. We have some people on the opposition side who genuinely and sincerely want to see this process come to fruition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) is sincere in wanting to see an outcome, but he has not been able to influence many of his colleagues at all. The redneck approach of the National Party was to dig things up, run over people and, whatever the mining and agricultural industries want, they should get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in the papers that have been prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet another view on this. That other view which has been put forward in many of those papers, and which this appropriation supports, is one that ensures that we take a balanced view. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was just about to get up and take a point of order on me. He will do anything to cut off someone having a debate on something sensible, because he wants to move down the front and maybe get a little closer to the action&mdash;he is not going to get any closer to the action than where he was years ago&mdash;and have a shot at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which is what the amendment of the honourable member for Bennelong proposes here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell and some of his colleagues need to understand that all this chiacking, all these slick attempts and all these sillinesses do not disguise the fact that this proposal put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong is the nonsense that it is. It is a shot by a person who may have gone on to great things in this country but, in recent years, has just become more and more irrelevant. I did not think I would ever see the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;who is a member of parliament I used to have a lot of respect for&mdash;come in here and push his colleague aside at the beginning of drive time, as he did this afternoon, so he could put forward this silly proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not think that my good friend from the National Party would have been supporting him in the way he did, but the point is that the money being appropriated here for the Republic Advisory Committee will be money well spent. Surely one thing that we can do in this country in the run-up to the turn of the century is talk about and think about what we are as Australians and where we are going as Australians. A healthy debate on something such as that is useful. It is not something about which we should get up and say, `It is a disgrace that the government is appropriating for that'. All of us, I would have thought, should say, `Anything that is a catalyst for this sort of consideration is something that we, as members of parliament, should support'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The canard has been brought in here again that there is money in these appropriations for new flags and things such as that. What is wrong with Australians, in the run-up to the turn of the century, considering whether the flag we have is appropriate or not? That is not something that we should try to generate a lot of fear and loathing in the community about. It is something that we, as an educated sensible people, should be able to talk about. It is something that we should be able to have some discussion on and, if people decide that that is what they want, it is something we, as members of parliament, should legislate for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of talk from members of the opposition that somehow or other the flag that we have now is sacred. Not too many of them were here only a few short years ago when we legislated for that flag. Until then there were a number of flags people could have flown from their house, ship or whatever if they were Australian. They were red, they were blue and they were white. But Malcolm Fraser decided&mdash;not the people of Australia&mdash;that the Australian blue ensign would be the flag. He did not have widespread consultation. He did not go out and talk to the country. He came in here and proposed a bill. Those in the merchant navy had a new flag, because that is what the merchant navy had after that&mdash;a new flag. But there were no catcalls from this side and there was not any outrage in the community, because that was what was decided.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with the Australian people considering a new flag; I agree with the honourable member for Watson when he says that. But the Australian people ought to have the opportunity of making a decision as to whether they wish to have a new flag or not. That is the argument that I get out in the electorate. Some people want a new flag, but my experience is that more people do not at this stage. What they all want is to have some role in that decision.

<PARA>No such requirement appeared in the 1992 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. I cannot recall any legislation passing through parliament over the past year that would authorise such a request. Accordingly, I set out to establish under what instruments taxpayers were being required to furnish this information. To be fair, the information officers in the tax office who were first contacted by my office in relation to this matter were, to put it kindly, not at all helpful. Rather than offering to take my inquiry on board and provide a considered reply, they brushed it aside with highly generalised comments about the tax office having the power to ask for anything if it wished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although not specified by the tax office, I gather those officers had in mind the powers contained in section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, but I will come back to that later. Naturally, I considered the response unacceptable and asked for assistance from the Parliamentary Library's research staff, and they gave me a very detailed response. Whilst it is not appropriate to canvass all their advice here, I will mention some of the considerations which caused them to conclude that there were real doubts as to whether the tax office was correctly authorised to ask for this information in the way it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Research Service was of the opinion that section 161 of the Income Tax Assessment Act does give authority for the taxation commissioner to request a certified copy of any will, a certified copy of a death certificate, and a balance sheet at the date of death from a person who furnishes a return of a deceased taxpayer. However, the operative word is `request', and doubts have been expressed as to the validity of a request which appears as a boxed `advice' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that on page 3 of the actual tax return form a request is made for a group certificate to be furnished and attached to that form. That is considered to be a valid request. However, the request for a will, death certificate and assets-liabilities statement is not made on the return form. Instead, it is made at page 44 of the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. Such a request does not, in the opinion of my advisers, constitute a request which can be regarded as being part of the return form. Rather, it is presented in a manner which might well cause it to be overlooked by some people as just another one of the more than 30 boxed pieces of information and 15 advertisements in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate at this point to raise the matter of section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The key words are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner may by notice in writing require any person, whether a taxpayer or not . . . to furnish him with such information as he may require;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the provision which I referred to previously as being the authority cited by the officers at the tax office inquiry desk to justify the page 44 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have said to me that there is doubt as to whether the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> advice is sufficient to meet the legislated requirements that requests for information must be made by notice in writing. I think that when we look at it there is a great deal of validity to that opinion. I add, too, that I cannot remember any legislation going through this parliament in recent times which would justify that inclusion this last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> when it was not included before. I am not encouraging people not to furnish a will or a death certificate or assets-liabilities statement for a deceased taxpayer. Rather, I am concerned that there appears to be some informed doubt as to whether the tax commissioner is technically correct in seeking this type of information as a boxed request amongst&mdash;I remind honourable members&mdash;95 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can imagine that there may be some people in our community who genuinely overlook the page 44 request. What will be the commissioner's attitude to such people? Will they be treated as felons or will the commissioner acknowledge the unsatisfactory nature of his request and follow up with a formal section 264 request in writing for this information? We have to remember that the tax office in recent times has gained a reputation for what could be described as uncompromising tenacity towards anything that hints at a taxation liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is so skint for revenue that the tax office has been given the task, quite deliberately, of going out and getting every last cent. That page 44 request&mdash;page 44 out of 95&mdash;is an instance where such an attitude, I believe, would be totally misplaced. I trust that the tax commissioner, in following up his duties, will not seek to convict or to take punitive action against people who, quite understandably, could overlook that boxed request on page 44 of the 95 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me a very strange inclusion at this stage when it has not been included before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94 presently before us, there are some general comments I wish to make. For those Australians who look for leadership from their government, this government is undermining confidence in the future. Everything upon which they have come to rely is constantly under threat of change or extinction. The government, which exhibits a hypocritical attitude, is led by a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with the same attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the Republic Advisory Committee, a chosen but unrepresentative, publicly funded group, reported to the government its recommendations for the way in which Australia could become a republic. The Australian public has been treated with disdain in this process. The Republic Advisory Committee is basically and almost completely comprised of people in favour of changing our current system of a democratic constitutional monarchy to that of a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the government used $55,000 of public money to fund this group, while in the financial year just past it spent $551,000. For the coming year, $200,000 has been set aside for constitutional reform, making a total of $805,000 of public money being used by the government to push one of the Prime Minister's pet barrows. If that is not hypocritical, nothing is. I draw the attention of the chamber to a statement made by the Prime Minister in this place on 28 September this year. He reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said publicly in London that it is not because our affections for Britain are reduced or the friendship between us frailer, or our respect and admiration for the institutions Britain has bequeathed us in any way diminished, that Australia is considering the option of becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA>Having listed all the reasons on which he has not based his push for becoming a republic&mdash;carefully pointing out that we have no particular gripe with the British people&mdash;the Prime Minister then moved across the waterways to Ireland and said that it was because he is a Catholic that we will become a republic. Whichever way one looks at his arguments, it was a display of sheer cynicism and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divisiveness is reaching heights that I have not seen in Australian political life before. I would like to read to the chamber the definition of `bigotry' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . intolerant attachment to a particular creed, opinion or practice.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not calling the Prime Minister a bigot, but I believe that he encourages bigotry in others through his statements. He says of himself, `I am pure; I only have the interests of Australia at heart', but he draws on all sorts of arguments set to create conflict, differences and problems between groups in our community. I thought such things had long vanished and long been dead. No-one could regard his statement in the House as anything but a contemplated statement and one encouraging bigotry. While I do not believe that he is a bigot, he encourages bigotry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister has said that he has not given the command to go full speed ahead on the issue of a republic, and while he has said that he would not introduce a republic contrary to the wishes of the Australian people, on the same date, 28 September, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said the Australian government's view was that . . . it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of federation in the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has an agenda&mdash;he has a set agenda. It is no good his saying that he will draw back, sit on his hands and stay out of the debate. I refer the chamber to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> dated 4 October where the Prime Minister found that things were not running well for him in opinion polls. After telling England, Ireland, France and every other nation how important it was for Australia to become a republic, he returned to Australia to find that he was not doing so well in the opinion polls. Having made that statement in the House on 28 September, a statement indicating that there was an agenda set down by his government to have a republic by the year 2001, only five days later the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating wants to take some of the political heat out of the debate by emphasising that the issue is one for the people to decide and that the Government has no intention of imposing its view or its timetable.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opinion polls showed that the government was on unsteady ground, so the Prime Minister quickly manipulated the system to suit himself. The methods employed by the Prime Minister and his government are like something we would read in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Prince</EMPHASIS>. The way the government does things is black, dark, and machiavellian. The Prime Minister shows that his government is prepared to manipulate people and attitudes. He only has to press the right button to divert public attention from the main game&mdash;from unemployment, the budget and all the other important things that are burning Australians up. The public is really not that concerned about the issues the Prime Minister is raising, but he tries to create a split and a difference between people&mdash;a split and a difference that is not there until provoked&mdash;in order to divert attention from the main issues. In answer to a question on the Mabo issue on 31 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has developed a piece of what I hope will be landmark legislation. I am certain that it is superior to any Aboriginal land law in this country and something which this government will be very proud of.</PARA>
<PARA>Since that date, the Prime Minister has been changing his tune almost every day. From every interview it is possible to discern that the legislation he talks about now is not the same legislation about which he was speaking on 31 August, but some revised version that has come about after he has spoken to John Fahey, Richard Court or some other premier. He shows no consistency, but is prepared to manipulate not only mainstream Australians but also Catholic Australians, black Australians, or any Australian in a group that he can identify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has been backtracking ever since his initial announcements on Mabo legislation. I draw the attention of the chamber to other statements he has made. On 30 August, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's position in respect of the High Court's historic decision is that it will do what is necessary to award and protect native title in this country.</PARA>

He decided, by some twist of logic, that the real issue in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the blocking of the budget. We have only to read the amendment to question that conclusion. I will say, for the sake of the committee and for the information of the honourable member, that we are not talking about blocking the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is under discussion. This committee is considering several elements of it. It is true that the budget announced certain taxation measures which cannot be dealt with in the appropriation bill. We do not have any serious intent of blocking it yet the Prime Minister, with inane defence by many on the other side, is repeating Goebbels-like the contention that somehow we are about blocking the appropriation bill. We are about nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bill largely deals with expenditure.

I mean no disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, but we are discussing appropriations for the departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Finance and Treasury&mdash;and other appropriations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not but be amazed at the honourable member for Calwell mounting a defence of his stressed out Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister who only a few years ago was seriously touted as considering the Paris option&mdash;I think it was called&mdash;when his predecessor allegedly did not honour a deal he had made in the presence of Sir Peter Abeles and Bill Kelty at Kirribilli, to hand on the prime ministership to our precious Prime Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have crazies defending a Prime Minister who has lost all credibility and who has nearly lost, not his marbles but his self-control.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no basis for suggestions that a convention, as claimed by our stressed out Prime Minister, can modify or override the terms of a written constitution&mdash;and that is what we have. For him to canvass the falsehood that somehow what the Senate might have in mind is breaking a convention, is a load of codswallop&mdash;it should be recognised as such. It was only as recently as 1970 that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam, not only wanted to stop some budget measures, but also claimed that the then opposition was out to destroy the coalition government's budget&mdash;and the government. Yet our stressed out Prime Minister is waxing eloquent about breaking some convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the chamber that the very first appropriation bill after Federation was referred back to this chamber by the Senate three times. That is some convention. In the years from 1951 to 1982, the Labor Party in opposition opposed budget legislation on at least 13 occasions&mdash;and that is after the Second World War. Our stressed-out Prime Minister is carrying on like a nit in a fit. In 1967 Senator Lionel Murphy, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, representing the Labor Party, talked about legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke earlier in this debate under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I said specifically that we need to recognise that it will take some time to address many of the issues that are relevant in the Aboriginal community. I said that ATSIC needs to take great care when it is deciding its priorities between those things that are desirable and those things that are essential. I started to talk about some of the housing issues. I referred to places like Maningrida, where there was an average occupancy rate of 9.8 people per bedroom, and to the costs of fixing up some of the quite appalling housing conditions in the Aboriginal community. I want to continue on that particular track, because I think the government needs to do a lot more to address some of these issues. It is not just a question of finding money; it is a question of how that money is being applied in a tangible way and in on-the-ground programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent Industry Commission report on housing was quite damning. While recognising that not all problems identified were related to ATSIC, it said specifically:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At government level there is no clear demarcation of responsibility. This contributes to confusion and duplication of services. The poor delivery of services is exacerbated by the on-going dispute between local governments and communities over the payment of rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst recognising that negotiations have begun between the Commonwealth and states to enter into bilateral agreements to increase efficiency, it was the view of the Industry Commission that those arrangements whilst being helpful were unlikely to `substantially improve funding and administrative arrangements'. The commission is saying that, although talks are going on to improve the system, it really will not make any significant difference. It called for basic changes to enhance transparency and accountability in programs which presently suffer from conflicting objectives and a lack of clarity about which level of government is responsible for what. I agree with most of that, but I do not lay that responsibility at the door of ATSIC. It is the government's responsibility. I think sometimes, unfortunately for ATSIC, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is all too ready to do his Pontius Pilate act, stand back and say that it is up to ATSIC so he will push the matter in its direction. He should be dealing with issues that are far bigger than ATSIC, because often interdepartmental and intergovernmental activities are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to talk a bit about the health situation in the Aboriginal community, because it seems to me that it is one of the major areas where, as a nation, we are failing to come to grips with issues that are relevant. It is a very visible area in terms of service and demand; it is actually quite well researched, and there is quite a lot of statistical data. In the papers presented with the budget this year, all the health statistics were left out. A phrase states something along the lines that the government is still doing work and it will publish them later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The picture is not good. A recent report that I have seen on maternal deaths in Australia between 1988 and 1990 shows that direct deaths amongst Aboriginal women during this period were the highest that they have been since 1972. In other words, they are the highest in 20 years. The incidence of maternal death for Aboriginal women through pregnancy and childbirth is eight times higher than for non-Aboriginal women. A couple of months ago at a tropical diseases conference in Darwin, Dr Christine Phillips highlighted research from central Australia in which 374 Aboriginal people with diagnosed diabetes were monitored between 1984 and 1991. During that seven-year period, 130 of them&mdash;60 men and 70 women&mdash;died. A total of 130 out of 374 Aboriginals died. Diabetes mellitus, which is not insulin dependent, is between two and five times more prevalent amongst Aborigines than amongst other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One health worker has estimated that on any one day 50 per cent of Aboriginal children in a classroom may have a hearing impairment due to middle ear infection. That is not just a health problem; it also augurs badly for their educational prospects because they will not be in a fit condition to learn. A report by Professor John Mathews, the Director of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, told the same conference that nearly all rural Aboriginal infants at six weeks of age were permanently infected with harmful bacteria. He has more recently made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know that chronic bronchitis and damaged lungs in later life are a sequel to childhood infections that aren't treated properly. These bacterial infections undermine a person's health later in life. Death rates from pneumonia in people with damaged lungs are very high in middle age and that is probably a consequence of what's happened in childhood.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, Professor Mathew's comments mean that the consequences for today's six-week-old rural Aboriginal infant who is permanently infected with harmful bacteria will be realised in his or her middle age. Frankly, I think this is a national disgrace and it requires a national effort to combat it. It will take time, but the government needs to take that action now. If ATSIC does not have the expertise, then the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) should take control of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently visited a number of health centres in the Pitjantjatjara land in South Australia. The standard of basic cleanliness&mdash;the infestation with mice and goodness knows what else, where doctors stood there not batting an eyelid&mdash;was quite appalling. I am not trying to sensationalise it. I am shocked and disgusted, as I think any decent person would be, that we are actually running health centres such as those in this country in 1993. It seems to me that the government has to take more positive action to deal with those issues. I will not go on with a lot more statistics, but we have to look at where we have been successful; we have to look critically at where we have failed; and we have to decide what we need to do to try to lift our game. We cannot just worry about bureaucratic sensitivities. We must take an honest look at ourselves and make every attempt to get close to what is working and what is not. We must recognise that this problem is not something which can be fixed overnight. We must have a realistic, tangible set of benchmarks by which to measure our progress. A series of smaller, shorter-term targets rather than an amorphous long-term target might be a better way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be much more tangible about this issue. We have to look at things like cultural requirements in the programs that we put in place. We have to look at the importance of involving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;the people at the coalface. Perhaps we ought to look at the example of people like the late Fred Hollows who came up with a very specific, targeted program to achieve a specific purpose. If trachoma can be taken head on, surely we can do something about the permanently infected six-week-old Aboriginal babies and determine the most appropriate mechanism&mdash;both culturally and medically&mdash;which will enable us perhaps in a five-year time frame to be able to announce a vast improvement in these dreadful statistics that we are all aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government: where is the program for AIDS? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) some months ago came up with an itemised, non-expensive, 10-point plan that could make a significant impact on the potential damage that AIDS might do in the Aboriginal community. We have had no reaction from the government at all. A lot of work needs to be done. Frankly, it is not enough for the government to set up a structure such as ATSIC, give it funding, and then say that it believes in self-determination so ATSIC should deal with the problem. The federal government must deal with the states and local government as well as ATSIC. The federal government must judge when extra resources are needed. The government must take some responsibility for the wider issues involved. I have never doubted the good intents of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in these matters. I worry about the effectiveness of some of the things that he is doing. Regrettably, if he is wrong in what he is doing, the indigenous people of this country will suffer yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that we have to take the view that ATSIC is not beyond criticism. It should not be too sensitive. We have to make some hard decisions about where we place the money between those issues that are desirable and those that are essential. Rather than spending millions of dollars on conferences, administration or amorphous subjects, we need to be looking at short-term practical measures. I urge the government to re-examine the way it spends the money being allocated in this appropriation for the benefit of the indigenous people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Potentially one of the most divisive, and certainly one of the most poorly handled, issues this country has faced in recent times, the response of the Commonwealth government to the Mabo decision, is dealt with in the vaguest terms in this year's proposed budget. This probably reflects the government's inability to reach a satisfactory resolution of the decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) have a close involvement in the resolution of the decision, but this is not reflected in the Attorney-General's portfolio program performance statements. In fact, it is hard to find references to Mabo anywhere in the budget. It does appear in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's statements. Provision is made there for expenditure of $0.1 million for an interdepartmental committee to investigate the decision. An unexplained additional item provides a further $0.1 million for `Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander strategic initiatives'. Combining both these amounts appears to provide quite inadequately for expenditure already incurred in respect of the IDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Attorney-General's Department statements do not clearly provide for Mabo may reflect the fact that no specific allocation of future responsibility for administration of Mabo matters appears to have been made. The Attorney-General has important responsibilities having regard to the issues raised, particularly constitutional and those relating to the exercise of judicial power. As an example, the government proposes the establishment of a national native title tribunal which, if established pursuant to the proposals, would exercise Commonwealth judicial power. I say nothing at this stage of the merits or otherwise of the proposal but it is a tribunal which, if it were established, should be provided for in the Attorney-General's program performance statements, and there are no allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements indicate that the Office of General Counsel within the department had an extensive role in developing the Commonwealth response to the Mabo decision and in the Commonwealth's consultation process in relation to this issue. Before one of the Senate estimates committees, a representative of the department, Mr Dale Boucher, the Australian Government Solicitor, stated that for the last several months resources had been applied at `senior executive level and below that' to the Mabo issue. Mr Boucher also stated that the department will need to develop its resources in that area. It must be assumed that the Attorney-General's Department is currently cap in hand to the Department of Finance in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Boucher stated that he anticipates that the department will be seeking extra funding, probably to build up to, he estimated, six or seven people working on consideration of Mabo issues, in addition to those lawyers already engaged in Mabo litigation. Mr Boucher conceded that there are no moneys in the Attorney-General's Department performance statements for Mabo as such. We are therefore left up in the air as to just how much Mabo will cost the Attorney-General's program this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another subject appropriate for comment in relation to the estimates is the push of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a republic. My comments will be brief because there is little of relevance to it in the Attorney-General's Department's statements. Again we see that increases in outlays have been announced not in the Attorney-General's Department's statements but in the statements for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In this case there are funds provided for the establishment of the Republic Advisory Committee, for the establishment of a constitutional reform unit and for increases in outlays for the Centenary of Foundation National Advisory Committee. In addition, it was announced in the budget that community information activities on constitutional affairs will be undertaken, and no doubt it is fair to assume that this is for the purpose of promoting the Prime Minister's republican push. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be asked why each of these items is being administered by Prime Minister and Cabinet rather than Attorney-General's. But the question should be asked in particular in respect of the constitutional reform unit. Genuine constitutional review is not limited to the Prime Minister's republican push. It is also not clear at all what role the Attorney-General's Department has played and will play in the republican debate and the constitutional reform process. It clearly concerns complex constitutional questions which will require detailed legal advice which it is hard to believe is not already being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operations and funding of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also warrant comment. There are significant variations in expenditure and outcome recorded for the 1992-93 estimates. Of the funds provided, $2.1 million has been carried over to this current year as `slippage'. According to the papers, it resulted from the late appointment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the late appointment of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the delayed implementation of the report by this House's Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, and also unfulfilled commitments in respect of the community relations strategy for the national agenda for a multicultural Australia. Given the size of this sum in relation to the total commission budget, the explanation of slippage is somewhat skinny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be noted that substantial responsibility for the slippage that did occur on the explanations given does not lie with the commission; it lies with the government. In this light the Attorney-General's proposed review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, while welcome, is not relevant. It should be added that that review should provide appropriate opportunity for public participation in the review process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two current issues relating to the commission are also of relevance in the commission's budget. Recently we have had debates in this House on the declaration under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. There is no indication of the impact on the commission budget of those two events. What the debate revealed in a major way was that there is a requirement for an extensive program of information provision to the public on what the commission does and, in particular, what the commission's role will be in relation to those two declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question arises in relation to the commission budget in respect of the role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks tonight to that portion of the budget relating to the Attorney-General's Department and, in particular, to the provision of the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services. In the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services five family service programs are being funded by the federal government pursuant to the provisions of the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. Those programs are the provision of marriage counselling, marriage education, mediation, parent adolescent mediation and family skills, which, in effect, are parenting programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total budget provision for these programs for the current financial year is $20,681,000, simply a cost of living increase on the $19,657,000 which was provided in 1992-93. The figure of $20 million for preventive and remedial programs can be contrasted with the amount of money spent, for example, on the Family Court in Australia of $52 million and a further $8 million of federal government funds on the Western Australian Family Court, making a total three times that $20 million of some $60 million. It can also be contrasted with the estimated cost of family separation and breakdown in Australia, namely, in the order of $3,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the preventive programs within that $20 million, we see that $1.4 million is spent on marriage education and less on family skills. An amount of one one-hundredth of the total budget of the Office of Legal Aid and Family Services and one three-thousandth of the cost of marriage breakdown and separation each year is spent by the federal government on preventive measures in Australia. There seems to be a considerable imbalance in the amount which we spend as a society on prevention compared with what we spend picking up the pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who have responsibility on a day-to-day basis for these measures, are considering some changes to the structure of the provision of family services and, with that, the structure of the funding itself. These measures must be considered against the background of some major changes which have occurred in society&mdash;measures and changes which relate to cultural, demographic, roles, marriage, fertility and other changes which have occurred over the last two to three decades in Australia. The changes include an increase in the number of persons born overseas from 9.8 per cent in 1947 to 21 per cent in 1993; a dramatic widening of the gap between the rich and the poor; parents having fewer children; an increase in the number of children born out of wedlock or outside marriage, from five per cent in 1950 to some 24 per cent born last year; more and earlier divorce; decreased fertility rates; an ageing population; and changing roles, including increased participation of women in the work force, many of whom wish to be there and many others who do not, as was reinforced by a study released late last week by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. Taken together, these changes represent a dramatic change for many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committees have examined two recent bipartisan reports on family changes and the impact that will have on American society. Many of these changes have been looked at by that nation. These reports repeat what is happening in Australia. In the first report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond Rhetoric</EMPHASIS>, the National Commission on Children pointed to the breakdown of the American family, especially in urban areas. The mayors of America's most populous cities had written that `the major cause of problems of cities is the dissolution of families'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a subsequent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Families First</EMPHASIS>, issued in January this year, the National Commission on America's Urban Families called into question popular current opinion about families. It pointed to the inadequacy of the responses so far, namely, firstly, to deny that there is a problem in existence; secondly, simply to treat the symptoms; and, thirdly, to deal with the issue only in economic terms. The commission set out a number of objectives for policy makers including empowering the family, strengthening the family and the relationships between parents and children, increasing community support for families, and changing the nation's culture. Each of these broad areas of recommendations are matters which I believe, as we approach the International Year of the Family 1994 in Australia, are well worth considering in this context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When changes are being made by the government in relation to these matters, I believe that there are a number of principles which ought to be considered in the way in which family services are provided by a range of bodies and agencies throughout the country, partially with the support of the federal government funds. The first principle is that all agencies&mdash;whether they be in far-flung rural and isolated areas or major agencies in capital cities, such as marriage guidance councils and Centacares, or whether they are made up of paid professional workers or voluntary professional workers&mdash;ought to be included in the process of advice to government about these matters. A corollary of that is that as a matter of social justice we ought to include in that advice and in the way in which decisions are made all those who are concerned for the welfare of Australian families.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is that decisions, advice and the provision of those services should be free, so far as possible, from the bureaucratic strictures that often involve empire building within particular agencies more than the provision of services to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can speak from personal experience about two of the five currently funded peak bodies. The five peak bodies are Marriage Guidance Australia, Centacare Australia, the Australian Council of Marriage Counselling Organisations&mdash;all of which are primarily involved in the provision of marriage counselling, which takes the major part of that $20 million worth of family services funds&mdash;the Australian Association for Marriage Education and the Catholic Society for Marriage Education which to date have been partly responsible for the advice and national programs in relation to the minor part, the preventive part, of just $1.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two bodies, with a minimum of bureaucracy, have effectively worked together to represent almost all marriage educators in Australia, estimated to be some 5,000 people across Australia if all those providing services are taken into account. That is an interesting figure which can be contrasted with fewer than 300 marriage counsellors who are funded through the family services program or through the agencies that provide those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the annual general meetings of these two bodies in Hobart. They reaffirmed their commitment to each other to continue to work together to provide marriage education and family services in Australia. They also sought&mdash;rightfully I believe&mdash;a real say in discussions about the way in which family services will be provided in the future. In addition, they urged continuing funding for a number of important national initiatives: a national training program to raise the standard of educators throughout Australia; continued research into ways in which these programs can be delivered more effectively; the publication of the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Threshold</EMPHASIS> which goes to many of the marriage educators and is particularly important to those in isolated areas; and support for annual national conferences so that the raising of standards can continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are real social justice issues which need to be addressed in the context of the operations of the Attorney-General's Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate in committee on estimates relating to the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen how the government has imposed the guillotine here. We have seen how MPIs have been scrapped.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that we are now prevented from censuring ministers. Last week we saw the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) caught out. The Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) sought to move a censure motion against the minister, but the government refused to allow that very important matter to be debated. So the people listening today will realise that if the Prime Minister is successful in bringing in his republican changes parliament will become even more of a joke. Also the Australia we love, the Australia in which we grew up, and the Australia we respect will be no more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Republican Advisory Committee brought down its report and passed it on to the Prime Minister. It is very sad that a number of people who accepted appointment to the Republican Advisory Committee, and who had offered great service to this country in the past, allowed themselves to be used as tools by the Prime Minister and the government. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in his media statement following the committee's report, the real question to be determined is whether we need a republic in this country, not how we implement a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a phone poll taken in my electorate by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> newspaper over the weekend. The question asked of the people of the Sunshine Coast was: do you want Australia to become a republic? A massive `no' vote was recorded. This was reported on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunshine Coast Daily</EMPHASIS> yesterday, Monday 4 October, under the headline, `Coast shuns republic bid'. In fact, 2,881 people responded&mdash;86.6 per cent&mdash;saying they did not want a republic, and only a mere 445 people&mdash;13.4 per cent&mdash;were prepared to go along with the Prime Minister's attempt to gut our constitution, to gut our constitutional monarchy, and to gut our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Republican Advisory Committee has indicated that any change simply seeking to remove the Queen and the position of Governor-General, replacing them with a president, is not a minimalist position. Indeed, we only have to look at the Australian constitution to realise that even the so-called minimalist approach to constitutional change would require around 200 changes to that very important document which has safeguarded our way of life, safeguarded our future, and contributed very much to the stability and freedom that we enjoy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a question to the Prime Minister, which he has refused to answer properly, I have foreshadowed the possibility of the disintegration of Australia. At the very least, we would certainly have constitutional chaos if the government and the Australian Labor Party are successful in gutting our constitution and destroying our constitutional monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the various months the Prime Minister has spoken about the Senate. He refers to people in that place as `pansies' and `unrepresentative swill'. Is that the way that we want our Prime Minister to refer to the upper house, which at this very time is seeking to hold the government to its promises? I am very pleased that the Senate is refusing to allow the government to get away with breaking more promises. I am of course referring to the government's proposed tax hikes. Thank heavens for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not really know what is contained in the Prime Minister's secret agenda. What does he intend to do with respect to the states? Who knows what is in this Prime Minister's mind? Indeed, it has even been suggested that Australia may not have a head of state. We all know what that would mean. It would mean that the Prime Minister would also in effect become the head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we can sum up the government's republican agenda as meaning more power to the Prime Minister and Labor. Australians of Liberal, Labor or National Party persuasion speak with one voice and say that the one thing that they do not want is more power to politicians.

Ninety-two per cent of people answering the survey said that they opposed the idea that the 2000 Olympics should be a deadline for Australia to sever its constitutional links with Britain. Eighty-eight per cent said the Prime Minister was wrong to discuss a republic in the context of the games.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country we have a system that works; a system of checks and balances; a very cleverly devised system that is fair to all; a system that denies any individual too much power; and a system that guarantees our stability, freedom and way of life. I am not afraid to stand up in this parliament and say that I publicly support our constitutional monarchy; I publicly support our flag; and that I publicly support our constitution and our way of life. The onus has always been on the Prime Minister to say why we need change. The onus has always been on the government to make out its case for change, and it has failed dismally.

At the outset, I would remind the House that in the adjournment debate of 26 November last year I raised issues surrounding the Jodhpur probe into the meat industry by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the ABCI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This probe was established in 1991 as a result of grave concerns about the continuing criminal penetration of the meat industry. Its subsequent report, part of which I tabled at the time, highlighted allegations of fraud, drug importation and other abuses. Little government action was taken on issues arising from Jodhpur, though the then Minister for Resources, now the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), did strengthen the industry's fit and proper persons requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, as I pointed out, this strengthening did not stop the Smorgon group taking over four meatworks of the Angliss group in late 1992, despite disturbing references to the Smorgon group in Jodhpur and the conviction of one of its companies, Pacific Meat Supply Pty Ltd, under the Contravention of Secret Commissions Act in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court on 20 February 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Smorgon group donated $102,000 to the ALP in the last federal election campaign, according to the returns of the Electoral Commission published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 August last. It also gave $1,000 to the coalition. As is well known, my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has also raised questions about the meat industry in this House, the first occasion being in October 1991. In fact, throughout 1991 and 1992 allegations of corruption in the Australian meat industry featured a number of times in public debate and were reported in some detail in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By early 1993, a federal Labor government that was obviously extremely nervous about the constancy of allegations in respect of the meat industry, and facing an imminent federal election, finally took decisive action. Decisive action aimed at pursuing the allegations in Jodhpur and cleaning up the industry? Of course not. What a silly, naive thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the finest traditions of the Labor Right, the AFP as a result of complaints from the National Crime Authority was ordered to raid the premises of virtually everyone in Victoria who had commented at some stage on Jodhpur, ostensibly to determine how the report was leaked. As a consequence, on 27 January 1993, the AFP executed search warrants on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the home of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> journalist David Wilson, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS>, the home of one of its journalists, Steve Cooper, the office and home of the honourable member for Gippsland, the offices of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, the home of the union's leader, Wally Curran, plus the home and office of a private detective. Not a bad day's work, I guess.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raids were clearly an intimidatory exercise to discourage adverse comment about the federal government's abysmal record in failing to tackle the hard questions in the meat industry. Moreover&mdash;this is a particularly interesting point&mdash;the warrant executed on those searched was extremely wide ranging, giving the AFP on at least one warrant that I am aware of the authority to remove documents relating to 68 organisations and persons. It listed documents relating to the AFP, the Commonwealth police, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of the Commonwealth police is particularly curious as it was disbanded 14 years ago and, of course, had nothing to do with the Jodhpur probe. Mr Alan Kohler, Editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, called the raids for what they really were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 28 January.

<PARA>In addition, it has to be asked why, if the federal government and its law enforcement agencies were so concerned about the leaking of the report on Jodhpur, they took so long to act after it was first referred to in the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little history at this point may help in understanding the problem. Prior to 1991, the Victoria Police were gathering information on the illegal activity of certain meat contractors. Further detailed work was then undertaken by the ABCI and the report resulting from those investigations was forwarded to the then Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Around September 1991, it was common knowledge in the media that a copy of the Jodhpur report was circulating. On 25 September 1991, an article by Peter Wilson appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. Peter Wilson, incidentally, is not to be confused with David Wilson of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Peter Wilson article made extensive reference to Jodhpur and the fact that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> had seen the contents of the report. It is known that Peter Wilson had a copy of the report, as did a journalist of another paper who was also briefed on its contents. Publicity about the report and the industry continued throughout 1991 and 1992, being further spurred on by a dispute at Camperdown meatworks in 1991 with resultant court cases during 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About the same time, there were rumours in the industry that Mr Wally Steiger, who had fled Australia to avoid prosecution in the early 1980s, was trying to get back into the country. This was potentially a major problem, as he was being linked to former criminals in the meat industry who were also moving back. Mr Steiger did eventually return to Australia in mid-1993, was charged and convicted of corruption offences and sentenced to about two years gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these industry problems were, of course, centred in the Maribyrnong area where most of the industry is located. This is also the electorate of the then minister. Even more to the point is the fact that the briefing of the media throughout 1992 in regard to Jodhpur and the actual leaking of the report is alleged to have been done by the then minister's assistant, Mr John Brumby, now leader of the state opposition in Victoria. The AFP were appraised of this fact by at least one of those individuals raided on 27 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to several compelling and serious questions to be asked of the government. Firstly, why did the AFP not follow through the allegations that Mr Brumby leaked the Jodhpur report? Secondly, if Mr Brumby were empowered to officially release the report, why were intimidatory raids by the AFP authorised last January, nearly 18 months after the report was known to be in circulation? Thirdly, if Mr Brumby illegally leaked the report, will the government proceed against him under the Crimes Act? Finally, is all of this a diversion from properly tackling corruption in the meat industry? I am sure all of those raided on 27 January this year and the community at large will be interested in the government's response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Transport and Communications allocation in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) deals with areas that are of great interest to me, particularly road funding. Areas such as shipping and waterfront industry reform and rail and road transport reform are all in one way or another affected by the appropriations under this department's title. I thought I would first of all speak about the way the government has cut back, and very savagely cut back, on road funding allocations in the budget. It is interesting to look at last year's road funding allocations. Some $1,628 million was spent on roads last year according to the budget papers. This year, according to the budget papers, the expenditure is to be cut from around $1,600 million down to $1,019.6 million, to be exact. For any of us who are pretty plain in the maths department, that means a $600 million cutback out of last year's overall budget of $1,600 million. That is a very sizeable cut by anybody's book.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end of it. The forward estimates in the budget papers for the next financial year indicate that the government intends to cut road funding even further, to $813 million. So in the course of two years road funding under the current government's priorities will have been cut, according to its budget papers, in half. One can imagine the net effect that that will have on the state of our roads around Australia. Every one of us knows that better roads are safer roads. Safer roads mean that fewer lives are lost and less injury is incurred on our roads. The corollary is that if we spend less money on our roads, they will be less safe and therefore we will have a subsequent increase in the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who takes an interest in the condition of roads around Australia will recognise that in many areas the state of the roads has reached a quarter to midnight situation. Any of us, particularly country members, who spend a great deal of time on the roads performing our electoral duties would recognise that roads are falling apart. I have been into many shires in my electorate where roads have rapidly deteriorated simply because they have reached their full life expectancy. Some of the roads have been around for more than 40 years. They should have been repaired, with a complete renewal of their surface, foundation, drainage and so forth, several years ago. That has not been done because the money is not there. All that this budget will do is make that situation even worse. For country people who travel so many miles on roads, on roads that were not well built in the first instance and which are getting worse as a result of this budget, this budget is a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is it in the general road funding area that the government has cut back, but also it has cut out the black spots road funding project. The black spots project has been going for the last few years. It was a good initiative of the former Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anybody would be better than the current one in this particular matter. The honourable member for Charlton instituted the black spots campaign. It has now been cut out in this budget, most unfortunately. It is interesting to note that when the honourable member for Charlton introduced the black spots road funding program he claimed that it would save 220 lives per year. He said that it was money well spent. For every $4 million we spend on improving our roads, we save a life. For every $500,000 we spend on the black spots campaign, we save a life. So there is eight times more benefit from our dollar being spent on black spots than there is from it being spent on the general road funding allocation. The axing of this program from the budget brought down on 17 August this year is indeed something many honourable members from both sides of the chamber, and everybody who takes an interest in the safety of our roads, would be very upset about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whilst that has been the case, whilst road funding has been cut from some $1,600 million to $1,000 million, and will be cut next year to $800 million, the government has been busily putting its hand into the pockets of motorists. It increased fuel excise by 5c a litre for unleaded fuel and by 7c a litre for leaded fuel. In fact, the government had a crack at 10c a litre for leaded fuel. That means that fuel excise revenues will increase from $7.2 billion last year to virtually $10 billion by the year 1996. It is interesting to note that by the year 1996, less than 10c in every dollar&mdash;indeed, around 8.6c in every dollar&mdash;collected from the motorist in fuel excise will be returned in the form of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government came into power 10 1/2 years ago, fuel excise amounted to 6c a litre. After this government has had a crack at it, it will be up around 33c or 34c a litre. Yet, at the same time, road funding in actual dollars will be less than it was when this government gained office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the government is doing, as my honourable colleague points out to us tonight, is engaging in a scandalous act&mdash;an act of highway robbery, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used to describe it when he was a shadow minister in the former government. That former government was taking only 6c a litre in fuel excise and returning 4c of it for road improvements. As the honourable member for Dawson pointed out, it is a scandal of the highest proportions for which this government deserves to be condemned and for which the motorists of Australia will pay for a long time into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whether we talk of road users or those involved in the shipping industry, which has seen the excise on fuel oil increase from 5.5c a litre to 10.5c a litre in this budget, we are doing very badly indeed. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) often speaks on shipping matters in the House and he would be particularly interested, and no doubt concerned, about the consequences of this government's decision to increase the excise on fuel oil for the shipping industry by 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net impact of that will be an increase in operating expenses of $360,000 per ship per annum for Australian flag vessels. If we compare the increase in costs of $360,000 a year for each ship in the Australian fleet&mdash;because of the decisions of this government in its budget&mdash;to the savings of $440,000 a year that each ship in the Australian fleet would have experienced had the Fightback package been introduced on 17 August instead of the Labor government's package, we can see that the shipping industry will be $800,000 per ship worse off each year as a result of the election of the Labor government on 13 March. The Seamens Union of Australia must be regretting the advertising campaign it ran during the election campaign urging people to vote for the Labor Party, because the net result is that the Seamens Union and its members will lose jobs as a result of the savage increase in operating expenses for the Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not the only ones. It is the same for truck operators. Transport operators around Australia have been really hit for six in this budget. There are extra fuel costs of $6,400 for the average road transport operator per truck per year, and there are extra operating costs of $2,400 because of the sales tax increases. All of that means that truck operators are going to cut out jobs. They estimate that one in every six jobs in the road transport industry will disappear as a result of the decision to put up fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whether they are shipping operators or transport operators and road users who are going to experience worse roads, this budget&mdash;part of which we are debating tonight&mdash;has been a disaster for this country. It will lead to fewer jobs, a less competitive economy for Australia, and less safe roads for Australians to drive on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). It is quite interesting when he talks about going to these roads in his electorate. Many of them have been funded by the state government, so perhaps he should take up this matter with some of his state colleagues and not the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little surprised that when the honourable member for Hume was making these comments he did not give the government at least some credit for the magnificent Goulburn bypass, which I use on my way to and from Canberra. It is federally funded and it is a magnificent piece of roadwork. I would have thought that, as it was finished and opened since the last budget, the honourable member would have at least commented on it. Before he gets too concerned about the seamen, let me assure him that the Seamens Union of Australia&mdash;which is now known as the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;has no regrets for the advertising and the sterling work that it did to make sure that a Labor government was re-elected at the last federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Chairman, there has been a massive attitudinal and structural change in Australia's shipping and waterfront industries over the last decade. This government's reform programs were developed and implemented with the full cooperation of the industry unions and employers during a time of unprecedented industrial harmony. But one would hardly think so much has been achieved. The achievement has passed largely unnoticed by the community and, indeed, by the editorial writers&mdash;especially the editorial writer of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;let alone those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maritime reform has been a major priority in the government's drive to improve Australia's international competitiveness. The most comprehensive and successful reform program undertaken by any government has transformed the waterfront and shipping industries into highly reliable and efficient contributors to the nation's economic wellbeing. On the waterfront, performance gains are continuing following the three-year program which concluded at the end of September 1992. Container terminal labour productivity has more than doubled; average ship turnaround time has almost halved; container handling rates are equivalent to efficient ports overseas; stevedoring labour has been downsized by 57 per cent; and stevedoring contract rates have fallen between 20 to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continues to build upon the strong foundation of cooperative reform with waterfront employers and unions, encouraging the maximisation of reform benefits to waterfront users and bringing a stronger focus on improving efficiency in other port services and at the port-land interface. The Industry Commission report released in June 1993 on port authority services and activities provides a strong basis for the government to pursue further reform in the port sector with state and territory governments. This government will also be progressing initiatives at port-land interface to encourage implementation of electronic data interchange in the transport sector and facilitation of efficient cargo movement through state establishment of interface efficiency councils at major ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last shipping reform program, completed in mid-1992, achieved similar efficiency improvements. There was an average crew size reduction from 28 to 21; new ships are being introduced with crews of 17 to 18; there are long-term labour productivity cost savings of $50 million per annum; and investment was introduced for 22 modern ships with multiskilled crews, modernising a third of the Australian fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the government announced support for a package of measures developed with the industry for further streamlining in the efficiency of crewing arrangements. The current average crew size of less than 21 is to be reduced to an average of 18 by the end of 1993 and aims to go down to a level as low as 16.25 by the end of 1995. The new crew cuts and other reforms will result in further labour productivity savings of up to $50 million per annum. As with the previous reform program, the bulk of the labour adjustment costs will be met by the shipowners. The government again will assist the early flow-on of reform benefits by contributing up to $25 million towards the voluntary retirement packages and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to furthering the efficiency and quality of Australian shipping, the government continues to pursue national and international action to improve the standard of foreign ships to minimise the risk of maritime accidents and the potential pollution of our coastal environment. The recommendations of the government commissioned report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>, provides a strong basis for future action. The government is also pursuing the outcome of the comprehensive review of Australia's national plan to combat seaborne oil pollution to ensure optimal national preparedness for responding to a marine casualty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part X of the Trade Practices Act, regulating international shipping services, is undergoing a wide ranging review of its effectiveness in meeting the interests of Australian shippers. The review is due to report to government by the end of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of maritime reform will continue to be monitored and assessed by the government, with the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission playing key roles in identifying inhibitions to the flow of reform benefits to Australian exporters and import reliant industries. Maritime reform must remain a dynamic process to meet the imperative of international competitiveness. The government's initiatives will maintain the momentum of cooperative reform and ensure industry structures optimise the delivery of cost-effective and high quality services to Australian exporters and import reliant industries. I suggest that only the Keating Labor government could have achieved these sorts of massive reforms in shipping and on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week a document was released from the Industry Commission purporting to outline impediments to regional industry adjustment in Australia. One of the recommendations was for the termination of the policy of cabotage for coastal shipping. At a time when the world's ocean transport industry faces an unprecedented crisis, and when the international fleet has become critically over-aged and suffers from a deteriorating safety record, the implications for the removal of cabotage would be devastating for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet those opposite continue to push for our Australian coast to be opened to the ageing rust buckets of the world. The argument of those opposite is that if other countries are foolish enough to use taxpayer funds to subsidise shipping, and if ship owners and crews are prepared to run huge risks in running cheap, untaxed, unsafe ships, Australia should participate in this free lunch and not bother about developing its own shipping capability because the free market will take care of it for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not good enough for a nation with the fifth largest transportation task in the world. The removal of cabotage would lead to the immediate disappearance of the Australian flag fleet and its input to the economy. The fleet would have to flag out to tax havens to survive. Australian ships pay tax, their crews pay tax, and they carry the cost of complying fully with all the international safety conventions. We are therefore uncompetitive with the untaxed, unregulated and unsafe ships which would be allowed in by the removal of cabotage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia now has one of the most modern, if not the best, merchant fleets and one of the best trained seafaring work forces in the world. For that we can largely thank a tripartite 10-year effort by government, industry and unions. The reform of Australian shipping has been one of the major achievements of the government's micro-economic reform process. It has resulted in a major reform of this traditionally difficult industry, something almost totally unremarked upon by either the press or the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign flags are cheaper because they do not pay tax, but that is no reason to import them into our domestic economy. The argument that this would lead to a competitive balance between Australian flag ships and foreign flag ships is nonsense. The Australian ships would flag out immediately in order to gain the tax advantages of their competitors and we would finish up with no Australian fleet at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is what the opposition is proposing, it is proposing that we in Australia exchange safe, well-maintained and well-manned ships for foreign ships. Additionally, it would put several thousand seafarers on the dole and significantly increase our balance of payments problem because of the profits and wages repatriated out of Australia. For the sake of Australia, for the sake of Australian shipping, we must maintain cabotage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking about black spots alone. The roads of Australia are the arteries that provide transport for goods and people, and they are doing so in increasingly less safe conditions. The federal government has axed road funding by $608.3 million this financial year. That is a massive cut of 37.4 per cent. We know that the government is broke. We know that it has mismanaged the economy. We know that it has delivered a budget of betrayal&mdash;but how can it cut road funding in one year by 37.4 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the end of it. In 1994-95 funding will drop to a total of only $813 million, which is less than was spent on road funding in 1982-83&mdash;less than was spent over a decade ago. In fact, in the next financial year less than $1 in every $10 raised by the fuel tax will be spent on roads, compared with the $6.66 spent on roads for every $10 raised by fuel tax when the coalition was last in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The axing of black spot funding is absolutely disgraceful. It was a program that saved lives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any road funding program deserves to continue it is the black spot program.

I believe that that special case still exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also axed the provincial cities and rural highways program, as well as the arterial roads program, and is leaving the funding of my pet highway, the Pacific Highway, to the state government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention something that happened recently in Coffs Harbour, which is where I live, because what is happening there is symptomatic of what is happening all over Australia. In the last week or so, the Coffs Harbour City Council surveyed its road network. It estimated that in order to bring its roads up to a reasonable standard, and in the light of the continued cutbacks in road funding by this government, it has a 112-year backlog of road works. Who can believe that? It estimated that, unless it receives an injection of funds, it will take 112 years to resurface Coffs Harbour's roads to an acceptable standard. That 112 years represents a 71-year backlog in rural roadworks and a 41-year backlog in urban roadworks. Admittedly, Coffs Harbour has grown significantly and dramatically, which is part of the problem, but it is not in isolation. Every community right around Australia would be in the same situation to a greater or lesser extent. </PARA>

Within that was the provision last year of $163,400,000 for the black spots program. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot bemoan the end of the black spots program&mdash;it was an interim program&mdash;and also lump it into the road safety package and say that that package has gone down by 93 per cent. The figures show it. I say to my colleagues opposite that if they are going to use those figures they should open the book and read the estimates. The explanations are all there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The king hit is that this year we are moving to a system where only the national highways are funded by the federal government. The rest of the money has been transferred across to the states in untied grants. Whenever honourable members on the other side rail against increases in fuel excise, they should remember that each of the states has its hand in the same pot and are also getting a share of the money. So they get two dips: one as specified road funding under the national highway program and another under the general revenue grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they want to use more money out of that, that is their decision. They can use the lot on roads, if they want. But they choose not to.

Their state colleagues are syphoning off the money for purposes other than roads. That is the real story. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is easily proved. That information is readily available and I will get it for the honourable gentleman, to clarify it for him. The money is being syphoned by state governments in New South Wales and Victoria for purposes other than roads. That came under the heads of government agreement between Mr Greiner and former Prime Minister Hawke. The second last paragraph of page 303 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding in the new program will be limited to the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This flows from decisions of Heads of Government that each level of government should have more clearly defined responsibilities for roads.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us put an end to the rubbish that is going on. Those opposite are not doing themselves a service and they are doing the issue of roads and the interests of motorists a great disservice. State governments can take as much money as they want out of general revenue and use it on roads. That is their decision. Similarly, local government now has untied grants. Its money is marked `roads', but there is no supervision to see whether it is spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members opposite, including my good friend the deputy chairman of the transport and communications infrastructure committee, and&mdash;we have heard and read it in evidence&mdash;the state roads ministers, whatever they are called, did not want an end to specified road grants because they knew that if their money went untied to state treasuries they would have to run the gauntlet of state cabinet. That is what is happening; they are losing some of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the money going to local government is losing priority around the council table. We can go as far back as anyone wants; we can go back to the Fraser government. It brought in personal income tax sharing. On a state by state basis&mdash;looking at the analyses&mdash;in the middle to two-thirds of the way through the 1980s the priority on roads at local government level did not change. The additional money went to other purposes. I recognise that there were some exceptions. Some country councils spent a very large proportion of their budget on roads, but state total by state total that is not what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to remember is this: it is clear that we should be looking not simply at a comparison of the number of dollars last year, 10 years ago or next year. It is: how well is the money spent? All honourable members in this chamber know that they can go around to councils in their electorates and point to instances where equipment could be better utilised. They can point to inefficiencies where money could have been better spent. They can point to methods of repair where money could have been used more wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the inquiry that we&mdash;the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), other members of this committee and I&mdash;have been conducting, evidence upon evidence points to at least a 20 per cent improvement in productivity. We spend almost $6,000 million each year in this country, over three levels of government, building and maintaining roads, but no-one on the other side of the chamber ever asks whether we can spend that money more wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get a 20 per cent productivity improvement, as we believe we can, that is equivalent to getting another $1 billion worth of roadworks done without spending one more dollar. In fact, motorists in this country are being robbed of the equivalent of $1 billion of roadworks each year through inefficiencies. They include a number of things: lack of coordination, the stop-go nature of road funding, under-utilisation of plant, insufficient money spent on research and insufficient knowledge on performance of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes that I have left I want to say something about the waterfront and the transport change from the warehouse to the wharf. Before I do, I would like to say one more thing on roads. I want to register as strong a protest as I can that, as we improve roads in this country, the number of traffic infringements goes up. There is an interesting contradiction: as the level of road casualties goes down, the level of road infringements goes up and the take from road infringement notices goes up. Motorists are obviously driving better. There are fewer crashes and fewer casualties, but the revenue goes up and up. What we really have here is a taxing of motorists&mdash;a revenue raising process masquerading as a road safety measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have scarce resources to supervise and manage roads for the states. We accept that. But those resources should be used on the hazardous sections of road, such as sections of the Pacific Highway where strangers on that road doing the wrong thing are likely to get into trouble. I am referring to neither the straight stretches of national highway at the bottom of a hill nor that stretch in my electorate where, in the space of 2.3 kilometres, there are four different speed limits and a camera or radar gun is trying to catch people if, on the changeover, they do not quite make it. That has nothing to do with road safety; that is revenue raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing I want to mention concerns ports and transport changes in the waterfront. I refer to the plea of the manager of BHP Transport Ltd for state treasuries to take their hands out of the pockets of port users. He states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to follow the contribution made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) to the debate this evening. His contributions are always interesting, and he probably knows more about transport than any other person sitting on the government side, including the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). It is always worth while to listen and respond to the comments that he makes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the end of the honourable member's speech where he made comments about port authorities. I happened to read the speech given the other day by the General Manager of BHP Transport. It is a very worthwhile speech, as the honourable member for Shortland has pointed out. It points out something that we on this side of the chamber have been talking about for a long time now, and that is the need for state governments to engage in port authority reform. It is reform which we, at this level of government, cannot dictate but which we can suggest and encourage. Indeed, we should be suggesting and encouraging it, as the honourable member for Shortland has pointed out. Through the increases in taxes that state governments impose through their port authorities, Australian ports are on average now about 2 1/2 times more expensive to use than New Zealand ports providing similar or the same service. So the point made is one well worth making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only point that I would make in response to the comments by the honourable member for Shortland is that, when I made my comments a year or two ago, I remember being attacked in the Senate by the now Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). He said that the Commonwealth had no role at all and no right to interfere in this area and indeed that the honourable member for Gilmore, as I was then, was obviously displaying his ignorance by speaking on a subject that the Commonwealth had no role in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, as the Industry Commission has also made the point, that we do have a role. It is an important one and one which leads to Australia's ability to compete, because it is through our ports that probably 95 per cent of all Australia's exports end up going. They are therefore affected by the tax raising policies that state governments engage through their port authorities. So the point has been well made, and I am glad the honourable member for Shortland has made it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the second last point the honourable member for Shortland made about revenue raising techniques in the guise of fines on motorists is concerned, I share with him that concern. In the area that I represent, I understand from folklore, the Hume Highway at Goulburn is the highest revenue raising area for the New South Wales government in the form of motor traffic fines. I must admit, sadly, that I have contributed to that on a number of occasions over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent years, the Goulburn bypass, as the honourable member for Throsby points out, has made motoring in that area much safer. It is something that I think we need to look at. In relation to some of the roads we now have, particularly in those sections around the Cullerin Range, Goulburn bypass and any of these major four-lane highways that have been properly built, I question whether 110 kilometres an hour is an adequate speed. I think it could probably go quite higher.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Shortland has interjected, perhaps even 130 kilometres would be a respectable speed limit and quite safe for those roads. The only thing motorists are likely to do on those roads is fall asleep, run into the centre of the road and get themselves bogged after a weekend's rain such as we have just had. That is the worst thing likely to happen to motorists. So the point has been well made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby made the point that in my remarks I do not give credit to the Goulburn bypass. I make the point that the scheme to put a bypass around Goulburn and to make the Hume Highway a dual carriageway from Sydney to Melbourne was established by the Australian bicentennial road development fund, which was set up by the Hon. Ralph Hunt when he was the transport minister in the former Fraser-Anthony government. So, if one has to give credit for the Goulburn bypass, the dual carriageways of the Hume Highway or any other such road, one should give credit to that government, that minister and the poor, long-suffering motorists who have paid their taxes through the petrol bowser in increasing spadefuls over the last few years and provided revenue for governments to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I speak of the poor, long-suffering motorists, as the honourable member for Shortland suggested, we should go to our budget papers and check the facts. The facts are that the long-suffering motorists have been ripped off in bigger spadefuls under this government with this budget more than ever before. For those interested in history, when this government came into power I think the amount of revenue raised from fuel excise was, off the top of my head, of the order of $1,000 million per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the decisions of this budget, fuel excise will raise $9.8 billion by 1996. If we again go to the budget papers, as the honourable member for Shortland urges us to do, and check the facts exhibited in those papers&mdash;I refer to page 3.155 of Budget Paper No. 1&mdash;road funding will go from $1,627.9 million to $1,019.6 million in this budget and will go down to $813 million in the year 1994-95. If we follow the advice of the honourable member for Shortland and check the facts according to the budget papers, we see that road funding is being reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland can put forward excuses such as these were three-year programs, one-off programs or whatever he might like to put to justify these reductions. The fact is that road funding is decreasing, petrol excise is increasing and the motorist is being fleeced. That is something that concerns all of us. As the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) pointed out in his impassioned speech, which he has consistently given in this chamber on matters relating to the Pacific Highway, the state of that road is getting no better, the traffic is growing at a rapid rate and it is simply a matter of time before we see major accidents repeating themselves on that stretch of highway. We have been very lucky in the last two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the contribution of the honourable member for Shortland. As people interested in this subject would appreciate, his contribution carries a considerable amount of weight. His contribution raised points for debate in this chamber about the amount of road funding that we are receiving under this government. If we use the budget papers, by any measure road funding is being reduced and fuel excises are going up from 6c a litre when this government came into power 10 1/2 years ago to 31c and 32c a litre, depending on which type of fuel we use for our cars. That is irrefutable and will cause the average citizen of this country to damn this government and its policies. It will not lead to safer roads or a more competitive Australian economy. It will not lead to more jobs being created. It is instructive for us to consider those facts as we debate this appropriation bill tonight because it is the irrefutable cutbacks and the increases in taxes that will lead Australia down the path of financial and social ruin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points because I think they are important points which concern particularly rural people but also all Australians since we all use the roads. We are all affected by the cost of transport in our daily lives and, therefore, all of us should be concerned about what this government is doing to our roads, our transport industry, our shipping industry, our waterfront, our ports and our railway operations. As a result of this budget and these bills, they are not being helped&mdash;indeed, they are being made worse. </PARA>

<PARA>In other words, the money that was going to the states under specified road grade programs other than the national highway system goes to the states untied, for them to do as they will with that money. The honourable member for Hume should help us all and get on to his state colleagues and Premier Fahey and tell them that syphoning off roads money to other purposes is not good enough for country people. That is what is going on. The honourable member for Hume knows it, I know it and everybody else here knows it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar thing is happening in Victoria. A number of us knew it would happen. Similarly, we should get on to our friends in local government who are getting untied moneys for roads&mdash;the state transport minister did not want that to happen either&mdash;and who are against any end to specified road grants and tell them that ratepayers want to see that money being used for roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the honourable member for Hume forgets to mention that that increase in fuel excise in the early years of this government was not so much an increase in excise but a change in terms, because what the Fraser government collected as an accrued oil levy was changed in category and retitled a fuel excise. The accrued oil levy ended and it was replaced by a corresponding increase in excise, so the take was pretty much the same sort of take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been increases in recent times and there are increases in excise in this budget. That is part of the budget policy. But part of the money that comes from fuel is earmarked for roads and part of it goes to the states as untied revenue grants. I say to the states, `Do what you wish with the money. You are there at the state level and know best how it ought to be used. But do not complain to us when you do not use it for the purpose that people want it to be used'. It also goes to help pay for schools, hospitals, defence and a whole range of other government and family support services. It is a general revenue source, part of which is earmarked for roads. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Hume for those nice things he had to say about me and I hope he looks at those pages in the program performance statements that I have referred him to now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the chamber about the budget allocation to the Department of Employment, Education and Training of $12.2 billion, representing about 11 per cent of the Commonwealth's yearly total expenditures. Ten years of Labor has left Australia with a legacy of one million persons unemployed. What a legacy for this department! According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a person is counted as employed if he or she works for pay or is a volunteer for more than one hour a week. Many thousands of Australians might be working very few hours and not be happy about that, yet officially they are regarded as employed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community might have a different idea from the statistics gatherers on how many Australians are really unemployed. I would like to examine the operation of the labour market programs in these appropriations. DEET has recently acknowledged in the July 1993 edition of its Job Report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the principal impact of most of the labour market programs run by the CES, skillshares and other brokers is currently to "shuffle the queue" rather than create additional jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . new job creation is also occurring under programs like jobstart.</PARA>
<PARA>Those statements from DEET obscure the real issue. With the $1.36 billion being allocated for labour market programs in 1993-94, an increase of 10 per cent on last year, is Australia any better off since the government has quadrupled the expenditure over these programs from just $307 million in 1990-91, three years ago? I draw the attention of the chamber to this remarkable increase in these labour market programs but no increase in the jobs that Australians are able to achieve. How many people have found any long-term work due to this extra $1.3 billion being spent by the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 DEET conducted a study of jobstart. This current year $356 million is being allocated to jobstart. Jobstart is a straight-out wage subsidy program, as honourable members would be aware from moving about their electorates and seeing the various programs in action. The study found that only 21 per cent of participants became employed due to these subsidies. A major reason is that wage subsidies push other workers from their positions. We often see this as we move around our electorates. The offer by the government to subsidise certain wage rates encourages firms to put people on for a short time but, unfortunately, other people leave the job, leave the factories, and we have no improvement in the total position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley): what has really changed through these job subsidies? Contrary to DEET's claim in its July Job Report, wage subsidy schemes such as jobstart are least effective during recessions as the bulk of employers are actually reducing their work forces rather than increasing their size. The aim of employment policy should be to create more long-term jobs and not just improve short-term job prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one way that this can be done in any sustainable manner. It will not be done by tripling or quadrupling expenditure on labour market programs as this simply does not work. DEET should be winding back its expenditure on the 62 labour market programs in this whole area of job creation that have been featured over the past 10 years of this disastrous Labor government. Rather than shuffling the unemployed, Australia must try to increase the number of available long-term jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be proud of the efforts of the CES in the year just gone when it states in its program performance statements accompanying the budget that in the 1992 calendar year 1.7 million job referrals, over 430,000 placements on labour market programs, and 320,000 job placements, including some 96,000 subsidised places, were provided. It seems to think it has done something quite good. The Commonwealth's employment agency found real jobs for only a minority of its clients. The number of people with a job in Australia in the year to August increased by only 5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a real indictment of the job creation potential of the current Labor government. So much for the claims of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation statement that 500,000 new jobs would be created over the next three years. We all knew this would be a fallacy, a false hope for the many unemployed people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be incensed that the OECD's July 1993 employment outlook predicts that the 1993 percentage change in Australia's employment opportunities will be only 0.7 per cent and that New Zealand will grow at a suggested 1.1 per cent and the United States at 1.1 per cent. The growth in the number of jobs available to Australians this year will not be enough to keep up with the additional number of Australians who are able and willing to work. And Labor concedes that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to a very important comment made in a recent speech by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, that to achieve an unemployment rate of six per cent by 1999 Australia needs yearly growth in the workplace of three per cent, far above what is happening today, as honourable members would be aware. There is only one way to solve Australia's unemployment dilemma, and that is to facilitate the growth of business investment. Every member on this side of the chamber is aware of that. The program that we put forward as a fundamental premise at the last election was based on that approach. If we concentrate on increasing our spending on CES shuffling of the pack, we are doomed as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step in encouraging business investment is for everyone&mdash;business, government, welfare groups and individuals&mdash;to realise that today's situation is very serious. In 1992-93 there was a fall in new capital expenditure of 1.4 per cent, which came on top of drops of 1.6 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 17.2 per cent in the three years from 1989-90 to 1991-92 inclusive. Those figures demonstrate that in fact investments have fallen quite dramatically and, as a consequence, no new jobs would be created in that business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is very much below Australia's potential to make this new investment. The lack of new investment emerges from the lack of confidence in the present Prime Minister and the present government. I do not think businesses will be reinvesting in the current climate. Businesses may also think that they can obtain better returns elsewhere, in countries in the South-East Asian region where governments might be seen to be more business friendly and where there are incentives for businesses to invest and to create job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Professor Judith Sloan pointed out when she delivered last week's Bert Kelly lecture, between 1970 and 1992 the only two sectors in Australia where jobs expanded rapidly were the local, state and federal government sector and the service industries. Honourable members would be aware that in the government sector it is changing. For instance, last year alone the Victorian government was forced to shed 20,000 jobs in the government sector because that government could no longer afford the cost of employing those public sector employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current recession businesses have recognised that the only way that they can maintain their profitability is to cut the number of persons employed in their particular business or enterprise. Businesses also know that the taking on of new staff is difficult because of the on-costs and the highly regulated labour market. The training guarantee levy, compulsory employer-funded superannuation which this government will continue to increase to the turn of the century, the holiday leave loading, RDOs and the time spent on form filling to comply with government requirements in areas such as equal opportunity all take many hours and add to the on-costs of giving young Australians jobs. Of course, most young Australians&mdash;and most people on the dole queues&mdash;would be keen to get a job. They are not too worried about the wages and on-costs that employers have to bear in actually trying to put those people into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though some of DEET's programs in the labour market area, such as the doubling of spending to $26 million this year on job clubs, might be relatively effective, it is not really the main game. The main game is increasing Australia's productivity so that Australians can export, compete internationally and attract business investment so that businesses will become profitable and be able to create jobs. In its basic way that will help Australia make some impact on the million-plus unemployed persons who have come about under the regime of this current government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the employment and training measures contained in the budget are the establishment of a $3 million community activity program, which I particularly welcome; the expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme, the NEIS program, which of course has been very effective; the landcare and environment action program, better known as LEAP; and, of course, group training schemes. The experiences of people in my electorate of Oxley with programs such as these prove that they are very effective in promoting employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community activity program, which I very much welcome, will assist up to 7,000 unemployed people this financial year through a number of pilot programs throughout Australia which will enable these people to gain valuable work experience in the community sector. The program will add to the range of opportunities available for unemployed people to maintain their contact with the world of work&mdash;a very important component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the program will have a modest budget of only $3 million this year and will cater for some 7,000 people nationally, if it is expanded it has the potential to be of great assistance to a large number of unemployed people, particularly in my region of Ipswich and, of course, nationally. An example of a successful community volunteer program currently operating in the Ipswich region is the MATES skillshare volunteer program for the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program provides volunteers for non-profit community activity on the basis that the activity involved could not be done by a paid employee. The coordinator of the program registers individual activities within organisations as suitable for volunteer activity and recognises the need not to disadvantage any full-time worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program avoids any possibility for exploitation of the unemployed by operating within strict guidelines and meets the requirements of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the skillshare program. The overriding priority for people involved in the MATES program remains job searching activity and there is an understanding that if a person received a job interview it had priority over volunteer duties. This happens quite often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis of the program is on job matching, with the coordinator interviewing potential volunteers to find out previous work experience and courses that they have done so that they can use the experience they get from voluntary activity to get a job in an area where they have specific training. It gives them the opportunity to have some hands-on experience in those areas rather than just finishing a training course and waiting at home for a job to turn up. They have the opportunity to be working in the community doing something worth while and continuing with the skills which they obtained through training. It is very important that people, particularly the long-term unemployed, are given some incentive, a feeling of belonging to the community. This particular program helps them to do that. When the economy improves these people will again be placed in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The volunteer program is useful in helping to ensure that people maintain skills which they have learnt in their skillshare courses and it also gets unemployed people back into a work routine in an environment where they can hear about potential job opportunities. When they are at home feeling rather depressed, they are missing out on those opportunities because they are not out in the community mixing with other people. Quite often when mixing in the community they find contacts who can help them get back into the work force. The Ipswich MATES skillshare experience, with its own volunteer program, puts the participants in an ideal situation to participate in the new community activity program. I am sure that they will take the opportunities presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $19.5 million expansion of the new enterprise incentive scheme that I mentioned earlier, which provides financial assistance and advice for unemployed people who want to establish a small business will, also directly benefit unemployed people in my electorate. I have a major concern about it. It has been a very successful scheme and I very much welcome the initiative by the government in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extra funding means the creation of an extra 1,651 places this financial year. That is very important. NEIS has proven to be one of the federal government's most successful and cost-effective labour market programs. Over 40 new small businesses have started in the Ipswich region in the past two years under the SEVS-NEIS program with a high rate of success. The SEVS element is the state government's part of that joint Commonwealth-state program. The cooperation between the Commonwealth and the Queensland state government is to be commended. Over 70 per cent of the jobs created in recent years have been in the small business sector, and the $19.5 million expansion of the NEIS program is therefore an effective way of encouraging employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the successful group training schemes is also welcome news for the Ipswich region, containing the Ipswich and Moreton community apprenticeship scheme, better known as IMCAS. They are extremely successful even though every year there are the same problems of having to justify why extra financial assistance is needed to continue. It is one area that I believe we should be promoting even more. Once again, I welcome the initiatives by the government in maintaining the group training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IMCAS has played an important role in finding employment opportunities for young apprentices and trainees who would otherwise be unable to complete their apprenticeships and traineeships. At present, over 100 apprentices are receiving employment through the scheme. IMCAS employs local people who know the area, are familiar with regional employment conditions and have a rapport with the local business community. It is very important to have that two-way communication with the business community in order to place those young people, particularly in the apprenticeship area.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the time and resources of the local people are devoted to approaching employers directly to encourage them to employ people rather than wait for people to come to them. The Ipswich City Council and the Moreton Shire Council are available as host trainers and they pick up a lot of those people. They should be commended for that. The increased funding for group training schemes will ensure that groups such as IMCAS will continue to play an important part in providing employment and training opportunities right across the nation. It is important that we maintain a lot of apprentices for the long-term employment growth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $10 million increase in federal funding for LEAP announced in the federal budget, which will allow the provision of an extra 5,000 places nationwide, will give further scope for the expansion of the program in the Ipswich region. LEAP stands for landcare and environment action program, which has been well received throughout Australia. The extra funding for LEAP means the allocation of 10,000 places in the program in 1993-94, bringing the total number of young people assisted by the program to 15,500. A total of 49 young Ipswich people are currently receiving on-the-job training in environmental projects under LEAP in the Ipswich region, with a further 50 to commence shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants in the program will learn skills including bush regeneration, plant identification, weed removal, selective tree planting, landscaping and horticulture, apart from learning a whole lot of other skills. In addition, the young people are undertaking training in carpentry, the use of chainsaws and trail construction activities. They will also undergo off-the-job training at the Ipswich College of TAFE in subjects including plant identification and culture and nursery and landscape practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The valuable skills which the nearly 100 young people in the Ipswich region will gain from LEAP substantially improve their ability to find employment following the completion of the program. I visited one particular program recently and discovered that the supervisor in that program was a product of the jobskills program. He is now supervising these young people in this area. It is good to see people pass through these programs and assist other young people, particularly in areas of training and employment. The government's labour market programs are just one aspect of its overall employment, education and training strategy. The budget also contained a number of measures in the area of student assistance which will encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to continue with their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past six years the number of students receiving some form of assistance has increased by over 236,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the first few words of his budget speech said quite chuffedly that it was a budget about jobs. He told parliament that the government's commitment to the solution to the growing unemployment problem in Australia, now some 11.1 per cent, was a priority of the government. The Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too many are out of work. Too many have been out of work for too long. The primary objective of this budget is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to outline his desire to provide a further fiscal stimulus to the economy hoping that jobs will eventuate and wait for the rest of the world to recover to help solve our long-term problems. What happens if the world does not recover?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these brief and simple words, the Treasurer has given a very clear indication of how he interprets the current challenges faced by our country. Although he may think himself sincere in his deliberations over the budget, it becomes plainly obvious that he does not understand fully the machinations of business and is underbriefed when it comes to understanding the challenge and solutions to our nation's greatest problem, that of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am at a loss to understand the motives behind his assertion that this budget will improve the opportunities for employers to employ when clearly it increases overhead expenses, thus diminishing the motivation for employing people. Which employer would act so irrationally that he would set out immediately to employ people when he has increased overheads, limited opportunity to negotiate with staff, as proposed by the ACTU, and the indirect costs of employing someone ever increasing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Treasurer and, for that matter, most of his comrades opposite have just missed the point when it comes to financial responsibility. Any budget conscious homemaker will simply tell those opposite that one way to go broke very quickly is to spend more than is earned. This is what the Treasurer proposes, although under the guise of improving employment conditions. It is bunkum to suggest that employers will act irrationally and play fast and loose with the company till and employ when overheads have increased as a consequence of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to unemployment, before we can solve the problem we first have to understand the probable cause and then seek consensus on a solution, not the paternalistic big stick approach so dominant throughout the history of the Australian Labor Party and its fellow traveller, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March this year Mr R. G. Gregory of the ANU said that Australian job losses within the employment market have been very considerable over the last 20 years and have seemed to concentrate on the male group. After adjusting for population growth, one in four male full-time jobs have disappeared since 1970. Women have done absolutely and relatively better than men in obtaining employment during this period. However, it would be a wrong assumption to suggest that the fall in male employment was attributed to the increase in female participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the peak of employment in 1929 to the depth of the Great Depression in 1933 the unemployment population fell by 12 per cent&mdash;approximately half the fall in the male full-time employment population ratio between 1970 and 1983. At the beginning of 1993, unemployment in Australia was at its highest level since the 1930s. Average unemployment rates increased from the so-called dark years of the 1960s at 1.8 per cent to 3.6 per cent in the 1970s, and 7.2 per cent in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this period the OECD, which the Treasurer and Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so proudly quote, had similar experiences, but viewed on a decade by decade basis, Australia's deteriorating unemployment performance is amongst the worst. The biggest job loss is within the middle job market. This market is the middle 60 per cent of the job market and covers mostly non-managerial positions. Most growth in employment has been in the high and low paying jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further highlight the difficult position our country is faced with, if male full-time employment in non-managerial jobs from 1976 to 1990 had kept pace with population growth, there would have been a net employment growth of 31 per cent. Instead, we have a growth of seven per cent. All this small growth has occurred within the high and low paid markets, thus placing more pressure upon the middle group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we should consider for the loss of employment in the middle group is the reduction of the manufacturing sector where importing has increased over the past few decades. Furthermore, there is a tendency for manufacturers to move towards technology, also increasing the job loss within the middle employment group, which seems concentrated within the manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong reduction downward employment trend in the middle pay occupations is surprising in a mature, wealthy economy and, generally, would not be expected to fall behind population growth and behave in the same way as in the low pay occupations. The fact is that it has. What is the government doing about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord&mdash;like most moves towards centralised wage fixing&mdash;was expected to compress wage relativities and thus increase employment in the middle of the earnings distribution and reduce employment growth in the bottom and top segments. But it seems to have had no effect other than to reduce real wage levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would it surprise those on the government benches to realise that the real wages for those with low earnings have fallen 10 per cent since 1985 and are now 10 per cent below 1976 levels, and real wages in the top 10 per cent have also fallen since 1985 to be equal with 1976 levels? So the accord and the subterfuge of being the workers' party has lost its meaning to the ALP and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another attempt at solving the problem has been the desire of the government to increase education standards so that the unemployed could more readily enter the work force. Many education planners, including the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), have stressed the need for a better qualified work force and advocate the need for university graduates. However, most job growth has been in the low pay jobs and there is no evidence that the economy has been generating employment demands for an increasing proportion of well educated graduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The middle market jobs are just not there for the university leavers. Since 1976 the average number of years of schooling of a full-time work force has increased by one year from 11.6 to 12.5 years, yet wages for non-managerial male workers have not increased in real terms. It is often argued that because the unemployed are unskilled, it is the unskilled jobs that are disappearing. Consequently, many advocate&mdash;including the government, and most specifically the minister&mdash;that if skills were to be increased within the unskilled unemployed, they would then have access to the middle level jobs. However, it is the middle level jobs that are disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unskilled are unemployed not only because unskilled occupations are disappearing, but because employees from the disappearing middle level are taking jobs that were previously held by the unskilled. Displaced workers from the middle pay jobs cannot move into the high pay jobs in any significant numbers because those high pay jobs are just not there. If the middle group workers are displacing lower level unskilled workers, as the job loss is primarily in the middle group, then unemployment is likely to be long term. Therefore, the notion of educating our unskilled worker is not necessarily impacting on reducing unemployment&mdash;and it will not, unless the government addresses the middle pay group employment opportunities and provides incentive to employ in this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what has the Treasurer done? He certainly has not addressed the challenge of unemployment in a sustainable sense. He has not shown any inventiveness in providing incentives to business to provide long-term employment opportunities and, therefore, strategies. The challenge, in my view, cannot readily be solved through fiscal resolutions, as is badly attempted in the Treasurer's budget; rather, it requires an entire rethink on the way we do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the midst of a major worldwide shift from industrialisation to information or knowledge based industries. Yet the government, supported by the ACTU, continues to move towards the archaic rules governing industrialisation. The times require us to be flexible, and it is time that the government addressed the challenges of the future. The future is nothing but tomorrow, yet this government seems more interested in yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has not addressed unemployment in any real sense within this budget, and it remains to be seen how the government will address the other challenges it will be faced with over the next few weeks. I do not believe that the government is capable of understanding our nation's challenges until it repeals the paternalistic thinking that dogs its history. Unfortunately, too many unemployed Australians will suffer whilst the government seeks wisdom. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a process commenced in 1990, the government was able to finalise a white paper which has been supported with significant funding in the context of the last three budgets. The policies of this government have focused on improving English language skills amongst Australians, particularly those adults&mdash;perhaps a million adults&mdash;who do not at the moment have effective reading and writing skills in English. Specific measures in this year's budget include $11.4 million for workplace literacy programs; over $20 million for TAFE sector literacy programs; and $2.4 million for the establishment of a national languages and literacy institute. The report also resulted in a significant increase in the funding for the adult migrant education program to ensure that new arrivals to this country who do not speak, read or write English will have an opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper also concentrated on the school system. Before the changes of government in Victoria and Western Australia, we had agreement with state ministers to ensure that there would be a better assessment of literacy skills amongst kids in primary school so that we could not only measure the skills of kids at the end of primary school, but also identify those who have difficulties and take remedial action. This particular reform complemented the national curriculum profile processes that would have ensured a minimum standard across the country in schools&mdash;a minimum standard that did not prevent any schools or school systems setting higher standards. It is a shame that this major reform has been scuttled by the irresponsible actions of Liberal state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy also makes the point that, for Australia's participation in the world community, both as a trading nation and as a participant in the Asia-Pacific region, we need to do more about second language learning in Australia. It is for that reason that we have seen the writing of a curriculum for foreign language learning in Australian schools and now a new incentive scheme to encourage the learning of second languages up to year 12. This will mean that between now and the turn of the century an additional 150,000 young people will be studying a second language at secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the government's responses to the literacy issue stem from a report tabled in the Senate in 1991 from the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on literacy needs in the workplace. The importance of the report was in its recognition of the need for lifelong learning in a rapidly changing information based and technologically driven world. I wish to emphasise particularly recommendation 17 of the report, which concerns early intervention, and recommendation 18, that all students leaving school should be literate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before doing so, the following background information is, I believe, relevant. In 1980, the Australian Council for Educational Research conducted a literacy survey of 10 year olds and 14 year olds in Australian schools. The total test was mastered by 71 per cent of the 10 year olds and 83 per cent of the 14 year olds. This follows a similar national survey in 1975. There was no significant area in which student performance at either age level declined in those five years. However, the report pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While some will wish to emphasise the high proportions of students who could do most tasks, others will be most concerned about the educational and social consequences for the students who are unable to do some tasks.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the emphasis placed on literacy by schools, the number of adults who have difficulty accomplishing everyday literacy tasks is unacceptably high. The first national survey of adult literacy was conducted in 1989. That report found that at least 10 per cent of the adult population&mdash;more than one million adults&mdash;are estimated to be functionally illiterate in English in terms of the demands of contemporary Australian society. About 700,000 of those people are of English speaking background and about 300,000 of non-English speaking background. The alarming cost to the nation of these functionally illiterate Australians has been estimated at at least $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no doubt that the starting point to remedy literacy problems lies in our education system. The committee report quoted a submission which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An adult with literacy problems has first been a child with literacy problems.</PARA>
<PARA>In recommendation 17, and indirectly in recommendation 18, the committee has made a strong case for early intervention. It is totally unacceptable that between one million and 1.8 million of a population of some 17 million Australians are functionally illiterate. In a nation that has as its greatest challenge the need to be internationally competitive, it is totally unacceptable that between $3.5 billion and possibly as much as $6.5 billion is lost in productivity because of basic literacy problems. Not only do we need to catch up with the clever countries like Japan and Germany but also we need to create an edge to get in front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations in the report suggest a wide course of actions, but the key to the successful implementation of those recommendations will be the urgent need to address the largely unmet needs of the foundation stone of our education system&mdash;the Australian school systems. Unless those needs are met, all attempts at redressing this nation's literacy problems will be wrongly focused and the results will be highly marginalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult and community education is also a policy area that this government is addressing in a positive fashion. Most recent government action in this sector has come as a result of a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella: the emergence of adult and community education</EMPHASIS> was an initiative of this government and was the first of its kind since 1944. The report documents the scope of the adult and community education sector and its contribution to the personal development of individuals and the educational, economic and social wellbeing of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult and community education responds to the needs of a diverse client group: from the early school leaver with a need for basic education, to the professional seeking continuing education, to women returning to the work force. It can already number six out of 10 adult Australians as past or present clients and it is growing faster than any other area of education. The sector provides educational opportunity where it has previously been denied and creates pathways into further education and training for those otherwise denied access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through its community houses and networks, it also bridges the health, welfare and education divide and demonstrates how interdependent education, health and welfare really are. While recognising the scope and complexity of the sector, the committee also characterised it as consumer driven, client responsive, flexible, non-compulsory and performing an important compensatory role. At the same time, the committee found that the sector's clients increasingly want recognition of the work they undertake either for employment or further study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 August 1992 the government's response to the report was tabled in the Senate and there have been further developments since then. Consistent with the report's recommendations, the government has endorsed the establishment of a working party to develop a national policy for the sector, reviewed what arrangements might be appropriate within NBEET to cover the sector, set up a unit within the Department of Employment, Education and Training to provide a focal point for the development of Commonwealth policy concerning the sector and agreed that the issue of funding for the sector needs to be reviewed as part of the development of a national policy, while considering that the self-funding and project based nature of the sector should not change in a significant way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State and federal education ministers have agreed in principle that the national involvement in the sector should become part of the responsibilities of the Australian National Training Authority. This is expected to occur from 1 January 1994. They also agreed to the setting up of a joint AEC-MOVEET working party to assume the role of developing national policy for the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has also responded to the sector's needs with funding of $600,000 a year for the next three years to encourage the adult and community education sector to increase its efficiency and professionalism. There are two components to the funding. Firstly, the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education will act as a focal point for Commonwealth contact with the sector and will be involved in developing strategies to address specific sector needs. Additional core funding of $150,000 a year for the next three years has been allocated to facilitate this role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second component, which has $450,000 a year allocated to it, aims to address needs that are not being addressed through ongoing funding sources. This money is being used to support efforts to: encourage management training for community provider administrations; improve networking within the community and adult education sector; provide seed funding for the revising and accrediting of the sector's curriculum materials to reflect competency based training approaches; and development of marketing campaigns to support each of these elements, in particular, networking and competency based curriculum materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be aware that when the department advertised for the submission of proposals relating to the above objectives, over 350 copies of the program guidelines were mailed out to inquirers, which reflects the very high level of interest for this initiative within the sector. However, the development of the sector is not primarily a function of government involvement or assistance. Rather, the challenge is for the sector to maintain customer orientation, client focus and flexibility, and its capacity to offer individuals a second chance in the education arena, while increasing the professionalism of its members, the quality of programs and, where feasible, the consistency of educational outcomes in terms of national competencies, credit and articulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the hallmarks of the sector is its fierce independence; this is also its strength. While the federal government has recognised the importance of the sector and is taking positive fiscal and policy steps to address its needs, the capacity of the sector to address these issues is of greater importance to its long-term growth and vitality than any role governments could sensibly play. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security figures show the number of people on unemployment benefits as of August in the Coffs Harbour area as 5,776 and in the Kempsey area, 3,829. It is a bit worrying that, in the past 12 months, the Kempsey rate has increased by 12.8 per cent and the Coffs Harbour rate by 9.9 per cent. It does illustrate the fact that unemployment on the north coast of New South Wales is, in reality, a growth industry. If people have to be unemployed, they would much rather be unemployed in an area which the CSIRO describes as having the optimum climate for the human animal and where the costs of living are far less than in, say, Queanbeyan, represented by you, Mr Deputy Chairman, where the heating costs are so much higher. On the north coast of New South Wales that is one of the elements which is a significant factor in keeping costs down. Equally, clothing costs are cheaper because there is not the stress of the cold winters. Fresh fish, fruit and vegetables are much cheaper as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where unemployment is booming. The sad thing is that this budget, this failed budget, this budget of betrayal, has absolutely nothing in it to create employment. I cannot understand how the people on the government benches believe we can increase employment by increasing the costs of business. That is all this budget has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has increased the costs of business by increasing the fuel excise levy and the sales tax. Surely it should have learnt by now. After all, it had a very close look at Fightback in the lead-up to the last election. The government studied it very carefully&mdash;and, of course, it has pinched quite a bit of it already. But it has not seized upon the salient fact that if it wants to help business expand and create jobs, it has to reduce the costs so businesses can be more competitive against imported goods and more competitive on export markets. I am afraid that the north coast of New South Wales is a prime example of the failure of this government to do anything which will actually create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment level on the north coast creates a lot of jobs in itself. Our friends in the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service are some people whose employment is owed to the growth in unemployment. People who put petrol in cars, those who work in supermarkets, doctors and nurses, also have been provided with a fair share of their employment by the unemployed people of the north coast. I want to make it quite clear that we have to have a turnaround in this country; we have to have a different culture and we have to believe that it is not good enough to train people to be the best trained unemployed work force in the world. This is what we are doing. If we are to talk about the long-term unemployed, the figures on the north coast are equally as bad. I do not want to get into statistics, because the `P' in politics stands for people. We are talking about real people&mdash;mothers, fathers, and kids living in families where there is no breadwinner at all. It is very sad. It breaks my heart to come across so many people in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, while the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might get carried away with his republic and other things, ordinary people in Australia could not care less. They are concerned about the economy and a job. Above all, they are concerned about the future of their children. We now have a much higher school retention rate&mdash;and that is a good thing. More and more people want to go to university. Of course, not all of them can get there. But what is the point of all this education for them? I believe that, widespread throughout our community, there is an aura of sadness and despair, and it is something that we as members of this chamber should be addressing. The statistics can be carried away, but when it is boiled down we are talking about individual people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to talk about the university at Coffs Harbour. It is a very exciting project and, as from 1 January 1994, the existing Lismore based university, which is part of the extended University of New England, and the existing Coffs Harbour based campus of the University of New England will merge into a university for and of the north coast of New South Wales. That is a great thing for the whole of the north coast. As well as having the two campuses at Lismore and Coffs Harbour, it will incorporate open learning access centres in the Tweed, Grafton and Hastings areas. I am not loath at this minute to forecast that in the fullness of time we will have full campuses of the university of the north coast in Port Macquarie and in Grafton. We will have open learning access centres in places like Kempsey to serve the whole of the north coast. I am on a pretty safe bet in making that forecast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As time goes by, the university will extend from the two initial campuses and we will have a series of campuses up and down the north coast. The new university will be sponsored by the University of New South Wales for three years. I would like to make a special comment about the Coffs Harbour campus. The students who are studying and graduating from there are doing at least as well as students at Armidale and Lismore. In many cases they are doing better. Next year the new university will have 4,500 Commonwealth funded places and a further 1,000 places privately funded or industry sponsored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coffs Harbour will have 440 equivalent full time places next year. The current Coffs Harbour student population is 330 equivalent full time places, represented by 500 people undertaking courses at that campus. That will double by 1996 and will climb to almost 800 student places by 1998. I believe that those estimates are conservative and that as time goes by we will see the Coffs Harbour campus continue to grow at a greater rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new university will be provided with an additional 90 student places for both 1994 and 1995, and at least 140 of these 180 new places will be provided in Coffs Harbour. The Coffs Harbour intake for 1994 will be 215. The growth in university places is good news for potential students on the north coast&mdash;not just Coffs Harbour but the full north coast region&mdash;because it will be serving the whole of the region and it will provide increased access to university studies for a great many people who, because of geographical circumstances at present, do not have the opportunity of getting that study. I am very pleased to see that the university will put on five additional full time staff next year, a further five in 1995 and a further five in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new university will spend $3.3 million on operations in Coffs Harbour next year. That is a very significant boost to the local economy. By 1996 this will increase to more than $6 million. Next year's direct university contribution to the local economy will be close to $70 million, with student spending and capital expenditure at Hogbin Drive. The indirect contribution is estimated at more like $50 million. It is a very significant economic input, a very significant educational input and I look forward to the university of the north coast continuing to grow and expand. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Woolcott is expressing the concerns of numerous of my constituents who have become quite confused, very nervous and worried about the measures that the Department of Social Security is taking. Each fortnight they are being reassessed with a complicated formula. I took the opportunity of asking a couple of representatives from the Department of Social Security to explain the formula to me in my office. It can vary, and does vary, on a fortnightly basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on pensions who have small amounts of money invested in managed investment trusts do not know from one fortnight to the next what actual income they have to live on, so they are finding it very difficult to budget. I have not had just one or two constituent inquiries coming into my office on this matter, I have had many. As you may be aware, Mr Speaker, in the electorate of Lyne 40 per cent of the population are retired. Many of these people were concerned initially about the capital appreciation of their small shareholdings being treated as income. Now we are finding&mdash;as of early September&mdash;that people with money in investment trusts are having a great deal of difficulty in budgeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are very disillusioned with the government. When they retired they went to their financial advisers with their retirement money and they were advised to invest in these managed investment trusts. Their complaint is that the government has moved the goalposts unjustly and they feel that they are being treated unjustly. Now they are being forced into a much lower standard of living than they were accustomed to when they were working. It is a lower standard of living than they budgeted for when they retired under the rules of the day before the government moved the goalposts forcing them into this much lower living standard. I put those concerns of Mr Woolcott before the House. </PARA>

Last year, celebrations were held at Amberley to acknowledge 50 years of service to the Australian Defence Force by No. 3 Aircraft Depot and 482 Maintenance Squadron and to acknowledge the formation of 501 Wing, which is the RAAF's newest and biggest unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 September this year, No. 38 squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force based at RAAF Amberley celebrated the 50th anniversary of its formation, which makes it the only squadron with 50 years of continuous service in the RAAF. No. 38 Squadron was formed at the RAAF Richmond base, New South Wales, with Lockheed Hudson MkIV aircraft on 15 September 1943. It was re-equipped with Douglas Dakota DC3s in 1944 and 1945, and with de Havilland Caribou in 1964, which are still flying today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning, No. 38 Squadron built a tradition of hard work, and that hard work continues today. The squadron has an outstanding record of service to the Australian people in the Indian and Pacific oceans in 1944 and 1945, as well as the Berlin airlift in 1948, supplying and servicing the Australian component of the occupation forces in Japan, and operations during the Malayan emergency. Other fields of operation have included training ground and air crews during the Vietnam War, supporting the Pacific Island Regiment in Papua New Guinea between 1965 and 1975, and other operations in India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. A particular source of pride for the No. 38 Squadron is the fact that one of its Dakotas was the first RAAF aircraft into Singapore after the surrender of Japan. </PARA>

At this moment in Wangaratta, the people involved in helping to control the spread of the flood are desperately trying to prevent more houses from being submerged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is that the police and SES services of Victoria, the CFA, members of the Army establishments in northern Victoria, along with many volunteers are adding sandbags to the levee banks as the two rivers coming into Wangaratta&mdash;the Ovens and the King&mdash;have reached capacity and already the floods are at a level which exceeds the highest recorded level ever. That is a blow to everyone because after the last high in the 1970s levee banks were built which were expected to contain any known flood. It appears that they are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would have noticed the publicity yesterday about the city of Benalla being almost totally submerged. When I was there yesterday the whole of the main street was under water. Every shop in the main street had been subjected to very serious flooding. Windows had broken due to the pressure of the water against them. Hundreds of families had been evacuated through the previous night in the city of Benalla. They were being sheltered in the school buildings in Benalla. At one stage I understand that three feet of water was flowing through one of those schools where the families had been brought. They were pretty wet and miserable when I saw them, but their spirit was still good and they were all very concerned for others, not so much for themselves, which is an attribute of the people of Australia which I admire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for north-east Victoria is that this flood, which has been described by senior members of the State Emergency Service as the worst natural disaster in Victoria since Ash Wednesday, will leave communities, farmers, townspeople, business people and families in a position where, frankly, they will not be able to cope with the financial cost of restoring their properties and their stock. I believe that there will be substantial hardship. I naturally welcome the fact that the Victorian government has declared the area an emergency area and that funding is available&mdash;for example, up to $700 per household&mdash;for immediate cash requirements for the families. There is also a limited amount of money available, subject to means tests, to help towards restoration of buildings, but it is a very small amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, many of the people will find that, even though they had insurance on their buildings, this particular occurrence will not be covered.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that insurance cannot be provided willy-nilly because of the risk factor, but the problems experienced in Australia in obtaining adequate cover against diasters such as this should be examined in a contemporary sense by the parliament in the hope that some recommendations can be put forward which might make the insurance available more relevant and more useful.

People from all over the world want to experience the natural holiday&mdash;pure water, fresh air, a healthy outdoor experience where one can communicate with nature and not witness the sort of human interference that has degraded our indigenous environment. We boast to our offshore visitors that such venues abound in this country and we, the natives, nod our approval. But do they exist here?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be at a caucus committee meeting today where we discussed the possibility of importing dogs and cats, and the rules applying to such importations. I raised an objection on the grounds that there were already too many dogs and cats in this country. Consequently, I went to the library this evening to research the problem Australia faces from feral animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we need to define `feral animal'. Most of us recognise that rabbits, foxes, pigs and goats are feral animals, and that from time to time and from place to place they will pose a major threat to our environment. But how many Australians really understand what danger their little moggy poses to native fauna, or what their pet bitch can produce when mated with a successful feral dog?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cats generally kill animals up to their own size, such as possums and rabbits&mdash;we even released thousands of them last century to counteract a rabbit plague&mdash;but they also kill koalas, lizards and birds. All those creatures are prey to the common cat. The average cat weighs about four kilograms and needs 300 grams of fresh meat each day. That converts to about 70 native animals and birds per week, or 3,600 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic cats are predators, and in the garden or about the home they will kill native animals when the opportunity arises. Add to that the fact that the average tabby can have three litters a year with an average of five kittens per litter and we start to appreciate the scope of the problem. Female cats are capable of reproducing from the age of 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former teacher of science, I am a strong believer in the process of evolution&mdash;the survival of the fittest and the natural advantage of the most able. That is a law of nature, and that law is being expressed by some of these domestic animals gone wild. Cats of much larger than normal size have been captured in the wild. That shows how successful they have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feral cats are frequently infected with disease, some of which can be transmitted to domestic cats, livestock and even humans. They have the potential to carry rabies if it were ever accidentally introduced into Australia. This is not intended to be a denigration of felis domestus&mdash;I appreciate how people can be fond of such an animal&mdash;I just wish to point out the damage they pose to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feral dogs pose a similar problem. The name `dingo' has been applied generally to feral dogs, but in many cases the genetic linkage does not lead to the indigenous dingo. Significant populations of feral dogs appear to be cyclic. But in my own electorate, deer, goats, sheep and horses have all suffered attack from dogs&mdash;single dogs and packs of dogs. Disease is also a major risk posed by the presence of feral dogs; not the least important is hydatids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of introduced animals into Australia is not a proud one. Some 26 species, as a minimum, have been ranging up and down our countryside for the past 200 years, taking advantage of species that have not had to adapt to this new type of predator. One only has to think of the cane toad as a more obnoxious member of this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these animals are not restricted to land dwelling species. Introduced fish are posing a major threat to our native fish. The common European carp is a particularly voracious predator that has placed many freshwater species at risk. </PARA>

These children have autism, which is a neuro-integrative dysfunction. It is therefore very fortunate that a small committee of interested parents of these children has seen fit to do something about the problems faced by their children and other people's children who have autism and related disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have discovered a program called giant steps, which is running very successfully in Canada, British Colombia and Connecticut in the United States. Giant steps was founded by Ms Darlene Berringer, who recently visited Tasmania.

This pilot would be a satellite of the giant steps centre in Montreal, Canada. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, the proposed site is the beautiful rural town of Deloraine, which is approximately 30 minutes from Launceston and within commuting distance of the north-west coast of Tasmania. The children will benefit greatly when the program is placed in such a rural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local community and service groups, such as Rotary and Lions, have demonstrated a keen interest in the project. The number of children planned for 1994 is 15. Some of them will be attending part-time&mdash;thus, the equivalent is 11.5&mdash;with staffing to be on a one-to-one basis. The estimated budgeted start-up cost amounts to $122,000, with first year operating costs of $561,000. Child numbers will increase at an estimate of 20 by 1995 to 30 by 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The giant steps centre will be unique to Tasmania and, indeed, Australia. Giant steps will initially involve three- to 13-year-olds in Tasmania. It is generally accepted that the ratio of those affected with autism is about six to 10,000, thus making it more common than blindness and nearly as common as deafness. Extrapolating the incidence of it thus indicates that about 60 children in this age group in the Tasmanian community have classical autism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures do not indicate other children with neurointegrative dysfunction. These figures alone are evidence enough of the demand for such a service.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that the 113 Chinese nationals who landed at Christmas Island in October 1992 were the victims of a scheme to buy passage to Australia, where they were led to believe they could work and earn high wages. While we have no hard evidence of an immigration racket operating, loose links have been established between the four boats which reached Australia from the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the period December 1991 to October 1992. The focal point for the organisation of the boats and the recruitment of passengers was Beihai, a small port city in Quangxi Province, and nearby towns and cities. Over the last decade or so Beihai has been prominent as a staging point for the flow of Vietnamese boat people and others joining that flow. In the last few months, it has been the organisation and assembly point for Sino-Vietnamese resettled in China who have left China by boat for Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only a partial understanding of the organisation of the boats to Australia and the recruitment of passengers, and boat arrivals have generally been unexpansive on this issue. What has emerged is that significant organisers have not travelled on the boats, and passengers have generally advised that they paid amounts of around 4000 RMB ($A1050) for the journey, with some recruiters, organisers and crew apparently receiving free or discounted passage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, the US is the principal target of groups engaged in the illegal movement of PRC nationals, although some European countries are also affected. Passage costs to the US are around $US30-35,000, often with a downpayment of a few thousand dollars and the remainder paid after arrival in the US. The flow to the US is also highly concentrated, with almost all those entering the US coming from Fukien province, and the organisation of the smuggling concentrated in Fuzhou City. The smugglers involved in the US trade are reaping huge profits from what is reportedly a billion dollar business, and their links into organised criminal groups have been widely reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PRC authorities have acknowledged the problem of illegal migration and have implemented a series of measures aimed at discouraging illegal departures. These include investigating the activities of smugglers and prosecuting organisers and others involved in the illegal movement of people; the dissemination of information about the dangers of illegal migration through the local media and increased coastal patrols to apprehend boats departing illegally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia maintains close liaison with regional governments, including the PRC Government, about the illegal movement of people throughout the region. We have received close cooperation on the provision of information on specific boat movements, and the return to the PRC of those who do not engage our international protection obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The total cost to the Commonwealth of dealing with the 113 boat people who landed on Christmas Island was $359,500. This includes  travel, salaries, overtime, accommodation and fares for staff and interpreters; food, accommodation and medical costs for the boat people; the destruction of the boat for public health reasons; and charter of an aircraft for repatriation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) After a lull in boat arrivals of some years, there have been 654 unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia since 1989.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) 457 are still in Australia</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes. As I said at the recent Conference sponsored jointly by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, it has always been my view that issues of indigenous peoples' rights and issues of reconciliation are inseparable from the process of long term constitutional reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to stress that recognition of the key role for indigenous people in constitutional change is a matter which has won support across the political spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing unanimously to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991, the Parliament supported this view as part of building a new relationship between indigenous and other Australians. The Council of course includes representation from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate on the position of indigenous people in the Constitution is also being encouraged by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. The Foundation is chaired by former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, enjoys cross party support and includes representatives from both the Government and the opposition. It is very significant that the Foundation's 1991 Constitutional Centenary Conference took the view that the Constitution should recognise indigenous peoples' rights and that the reconciliation process should explore constitutional change as a means to that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, lent his weight to the debate earlier this year in saying that he believed that the establishment of an Australian republic must become the catalyst for a more positive and constructive partnership between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of what, if any, constitutional amendments might be necessary to effect reconciliation is a matter, initially, for consideration and advice from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. As part of its task over the period leading to the centenary of Australia's federation, the Council will consult Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents of reconciliation, will report to the Government on these views, and, if it considers such a document or documents would benefit the Australian community as a whole, will make recommendations to the Government on the nature, content and form of giving effect to such a document or documents. Such a role and function for the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was unanimously supported by the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a)(b)(c) Under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901 and the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations of the Export Control Act 1982, the export of certain mineral, energy, and natural resource commodities requires the permission of the relevant minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minerals and energy commodities currently subject to export controls are alumina, bauxite, coal, uranium oxide, heavy mineral sands concentrates, and liquefied natural gas. The natural resource commodities are wood chips and certain classes of wood intended for further processing following export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations referred to above prohibit the export of these commodities unless a permission in writing to export the goods is given by the minister or an authorised person and that permission is produced to the Collector of Customs. The permission may specify conditions or requirements to be complied with by the holder of the permission and a time by which the requirement shall be complied with; and may be revoked if the person fails to comply with a condition or requirement. The minister may not unreasonably refuse permission or refuse to consent to assignment or surrender of a permission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) (b) In addition to the commodities referred to above, for certain periods since 1983 the permission of the minister or an authorised officer was required for the export of copper ores, metals and scrap; iron ore concentrates and agglomerates; lead ores, concentrates and residues; manganese ores; nickel ores and metallurgical products; petroleum and petroleum products; common salt in bulk; tin ores, concentrates and residues; tungsten ores and concentrates; and zinc ores, concentrates and residues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for export controls have varied according to the commodity. For most minerals and energy commodities, they have been essentially to ensure that export prices align with world market prices. In some cases, it was also to ensure domestic supply. Mineral sands controls relate to environmental considerations. In addition to pricing, uranium oxide and nuclear materials controls relate to nuclear safeguards. Exports of wood chips and certain classes of unprocessed wood are controlled to ensure environmental values are protected, market prices are obtained and value adding opportunities are maximised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) published an analysis of the impact of controls over Australian coal exports in Research Report 93.8 entitled The Economics of Coal Export Controls, released on 27 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) It found that changes in world coal market structures have affected the pattern of Australia's coal trade to the extent that the bargaining position of Australia's coal producers has improved. By diversifying into other markets and by the development of steaming coal trade, Australia is now less dependent on Japanese coking coal demand. It concluded that there is not a strong economic case for the use of export controls in the marketing of Australian coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The study is an economic one based on economic analyses of the issues raised. As such, it becomes a component in the Government's consideration of coal export issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) In retaining export controls on coal, the Government has taken account of other considerations relating to the need to provide assurance to the Australian community that Australia is receiving a fair and reasonable return for its coal exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(a)(b) See 5(a). Knowledge of a wider diversity of markets and the growth of commercial market analyses have led to increased market intelligence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) There are constant developments in contractual and tendering processes. As indicated in 5(c), these have not affected the reason why export controls on coal have been retained.</PARA>
