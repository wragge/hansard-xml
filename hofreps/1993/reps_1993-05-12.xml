<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 replaces Taxation Laws Amendment Bill  (No. 7) 1992 which lapsed with the proroguing of the 36th Parliament. The new Bill largely follows the provisions of the lapsed Bill, but with the addition of some transitional measures for one of the proposed capital gains tax changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes change in the area of the assessability and deductability of accrued leave transfer payments, so that the employer who makes the payment will be able to claim a deduction for the amount of that payment and so that the amount of the payment will be assessable income for the employer who receives it. This measure has an element of retrospectivity in it which is of interest to the Opposition, given our stated policy in that connection, and will probably end up, because the guillotine is being applied, being addressed in the Senate once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces new anti-avoidance provisions for the capital gains tax in the case of the transfer of assets within company groups to which a capital gains tax rollover applies. A number of changes are also made to the capital gains tax provisions dealing with depreciable property on crown leases. Further amendments are made to capital allowance provisions, the depreciation cost price limit rules, as well as making some changes to the dividend streaming arrangements. Again, the coalition is concerned about retrospectivity entailed in the amendments to the current depreciation arrangements contained in the Bill, while otherwise being supportive of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 is primarily concerned with the introduction of the various business taxation measures that were announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the Federal election campaign. These include the introduction of a general 10 per cent investment allowance, a reduction in the company tax rate from 33 cents in the dollar and changes to company tax collection arrangements. The tax rate for pooled development funds is also to be reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. This measure is significant in that it suggests that the pooled development funds legislation has not proved as attractive for investors as the Government had at first hoped and told us it would. The Bill also makes some minor amendments to the foreign investment funds legislation that was passed late last year and in a few other areas, such as fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the company tax payment arrangement reintroduces quarterly payments of tax for companies and serves to bring forward some company tax payments, particularly for larger companies. These changes we are told are designed to reduce the lumpiness of the current company tax payment system which requires that companies pay 85 per cent of their notional tax on 28 July each year, with the balance being payable on the ensuing 15 March. This represents long overdue recognition of the impact of the Government's previous company tax payments system changes on business cash flow, changes which sent many companies to the wall soon after the time they were first introduced. Those changes were designed to bring forward revenue collections to help balance Labor's Budgets, although it should be noted that these new measures once again serve to bring forward the collection of revenue from some of the larger companies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, eating into the cash flow. It says a lot about the Government's real attitude towards national savings and savings in the private sector, because by depreciating those cash flows in this way, of course, it detracts from the private sector savings which the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) likes to pretend he is so much in favour of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of business cash flow, the less lumpy payments system may well be more than offset by the bringing forward of tax for these larger companies, so that they are worse off in cash flow terms. Under the new arrangements, smaller companies with notional tax of less than $8,000 will make one payment of tax on the first day of the sixth month of the tax year, instead of paying quarterly as they now do. Companies with notional tax of between $8,000 and $300,000 will pay in equal quarterly statements on the first day of the final month of the income year; on the first day of the third and sixth months of the tax year, and a final balancing payment or refund on the first day of the ninth month of the tax year. Companies with larger tax bills will also pay quarterly, but the first payment will be due on the first day of the ninth month of the income year and then quarterly until the sixth month of the tax year. Transitional arrangements are to be put in place to avoid any overlap with the current company tax system for larger companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed reduction in the company tax rate from 39 to 33 cents in the dollar, while desirable in itself, does give cause for concern in terms of the way in which it will interact with the top personal income tax rate. The considerable divergence between the top marginal personal income tax rate and the company tax rate may be distortionary by encouraging some taxpayers to incorporate, at considerable expense to them, in order to gain a tax advantage by virtue of the lower company tax rate. The Government says that the general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be sufficient to counter any avoidance that may be encouraged as a result of this divergence between the two tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such anti-avoidance measures will not, however, alleviate the costly and distortionary impact from those who will be able to legitimately incorporate under the tax law but who would not otherwise have done so without the incentive of the lower company tax rate. The tax benefit of incorporation will in many cases be dissipated by the taxpayer's incorporation costs, but taxpayers can still be expected to incorporate if they can come out ahead at the end of the day, and it is as simple as that. This means that again it is the lawyers and accountants who stand to gain considerably as a result of this measure, given the high marginal tax rates of personal income tax. Of course, this is not an argument for keeping the company tax rate at its current level, but instead for reducing the high marginal rates of personal income tax to a level more in keeping with that which will now apply for companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We should also be mindful of some of the Government's more extravagant claims about the effects that its reduction of the company tax rate will have on business investment. Given that most company tax is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for the company's goods and services, it would seem unlikely that the reduction in the company tax rate will have a significant impact on company profitability or investment. But it is at least pleasing to see that the Government has come to the realisation that slugging companies does nothing to improve the equity of the tax system since these measures will ultimately be worn by consumers regardless of their own income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government talks about the impact of this measure on investment we should also remember that the dividend imputation system washes out many of the benefits of corporate tax concessions to shareholders as the gap between the company tax rate and the top marginal tax rate widens, which is the effect of this legislation. Furthermore, the benefits of the reduction in the company tax rate will accrue mainly to foreign investors rather than local residents, which is no bad thing in itself but is contrary to the impression given by Labor's rhetoric in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1993, the last of the three Bills we are discussing today, introduces those superannuation arrangements that were announced last year in the Government's security and retirement statement. The provisions of this Bill largely follow those of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1992. These provisions simply give effect to the Government's various superannuation policies as originally set out in this statement to which I have referred. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been hundreds of amendments in the past 10 years, but that is another story. With these tax Bills the Government seems to be indicating that it intends to live up at least to some of the taxation commitments it entered into both before and during the last federal election campaign. The Government has already legislated for the promised reductions in personal income tax rates and with these Bills will provide for the reduction in the company tax rate. But, if the Government does indeed intend to deliver on these promised tax cuts, we can only be left to wonder at how it proposes to reduce the Commonwealth Budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97 as it has also promised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of a commitment to reduce the Commonwealth's own purpose spending we can only come to the conclusion that new taxes are on the cards to make up for some of the revenue being conceded with these Bills and some of the other taxation and expenditure commitments. All sorts of rumours have been doing the rounds on what the Government will do in this regard. It would be fair to say that the Government itself at this stage probably has only a very incomplete idea of how it intends to raise the necessary revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But new and increased taxes are obviously under serious consideration within government circles and it is only a matter of time before the Government comes into this place with a swag of new revenue raising measures with which to slug the Australian people. This was amply demonstrated by the non-answer of the Minister for Finance (Mr Wills) when he answered a question by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in this place the other day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to listen to any member of the federal bureaucracy these days without being given the clear impression that new and increased taxes are on the way. This was confirmed earlier this week with a number of newspaper reports of a speech given by Mr Rod Sims, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. In his speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, CEDA, Mr Sims highlighted the difficulty of meeting the Government's deficit reduction target of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, particularly in the absence of expenditure restraint by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then dragged out the hoary old chestnut about Australia being a low tax country, as did the Prime Minister the other day which was clearly aimed at softening up the audience with the prospect of new and higher taxes in the years ahead as part of the Government's solution to its budget deficit program. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Kerr" NAMEID="RH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why does the Minister not have a look at the States' taxes and include them in his feeble considerations? This was certainly the impression gained by those present at the particular address to which I refer. Given the Government's continued failings on the expenditure front and its apparent intention to press ahead with the personal income tax cuts as well as the reductions in the company tax rate, we can only come to the conclusion that new and increased taxes are on the way. This will be, of course, in complete violation of the Government's mandate from the Australian people at the most recent federal election, which was overwhelmingly for no new taxes from the Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not unexpectedly, the Prime Minister carefully avoided giving the electorate the opportunity to read his lips in this regard, and he gave no specific undertakings about the possibility of new taxes. I suggest they might have to speed read his lips in the very near future though. Nonetheless, the message from the electorate was loud and clear, and it is one that the Government ignores at its peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also possible that the Government will seek to renege in whole or in part on its promised personal income tax cuts or the reduction in the company tax rate. There have already been suggestions that the Government might seek to defer the proposed personal income tax cuts to help meet the Budget deficit reduction target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the Government should be reminded of the mandate it was given by the people on 13 March. The Government was voted in on a specific commitment to reduce personal income tax rates in accordance with the schedule that is already embodied in legislation. The Opposition will be working to ensure that the Government respects that commitment given to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as any new taxes are concerned there is already plenty of speculation as to what these new taxes might consist of. But we should not overlook the fact that Labor is determined to press ahead and squeeze every last drop of revenue out of the existing tax base even without the addition of new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of these efforts is likely to be a considerable increase in the complexity of the tax law and its associated compliance costs but with relatively little gain to the revenue. Hence we have the horrendously complicated measures such as the foreign investment funds legislation and some of the new fringe benefits tax measures, which are dealt with in these Bills, and a host of other measures designed to ferret out revenue from every corner of the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these specific taxation measures, the Government's tax compliance and enforcement measures are aimed at increasing the resources available to the Australian Taxation Office to ensure a higher level of compliance on the part of taxpayers now operating within the current tax base. These measures take advantage of the complexity of the law to trip up taxpayers and hit them with back taxes. This was illustrated last week when it was revealed that the Australian Taxation Office finds an average error of $52,000 in its audits of fringe benefits tax returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such massive errors can only be attributed to the complexity and uncertainty of the law that leads to honest mistakes by taxpayers or differences in interpretation of the tax law between taxpayers and the ATO. It is a sad state of affairs when the government of the day relies on the injustices of the tax system to plug holes in its finances. But that is what this Government is doing when it puts forward Budget forecasts which rely on the revenue generated through such compliance and enforcement measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor's taxation system we have nothing less than taxation by complexity, which is surely no way to run a taxation system. Nowhere is taxation by complexity more apparent than in the ATO's large case audit program of the top 100 companies in Australia. To date the adjustments to company tax returns as a direct result of the large case audit program amount to some $1 billion affecting about 50 companies. However, a huge 31 per cent of that amount is being disputed by the companies concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This suggests massive and widespread uncertainty in the application of tax law as it applies in this country. This in turn suggests that some of the benefits of the reduction in the corporate tax rate and changes to the company tax payment system will be lost to the continued complexity of the tax law and the way it wastes the time, money and resources of taxpayers in high compliance costs and other wasted resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also suggests that there is something seriously wrong with the large case audit program. Instead of fostering compliance with the law, which was the audit program's claimed intention, it has corporate taxpayers up in arms about the injustices they have experienced at the hands of Tax Office audit teams. If the various corporate taxpayers concerned win a significant proportion of these disputes with the ATO, then the return to revenue from the costly large case audit program will begin to look very paltry indeed. It should be remembered that companies do not take issue with the decisions of the Tax Office lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as individual taxpayers must face up to enormous costs if they want to take on the ATO, so must companies also incur considerable expense if they want to take issue with the results of a large case audit. So these companies must think that they at least have a reasonable chance of success if they are going to challenge the outcomes of the ATO's large case audits on the scale suggested by figures supplied by the Corporate Tax Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is quite possible that the amounts in dispute would be larger if it were not for the fact that some companies would take the view that a challenge was not worth the expense in relation to the amount of money sought by the Tax Office in particular instances. Potential disputes about when tax is payable, rather than the amount of tax payable, fall into that category. In other words, people say, `If they are going to make us pay this financial year, we will cop it rather than argue the case at great expense', whereas they may not legally have to pay at that earlier time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything, the available figures underestimate the extent to which the large case audit program has taken advantage of the complexity of the law to raise revenue. It is thus not surprising that the Corporate Tax Association this week attacked the ATO's large case audit program at the Australian Taxation Institute's convention held in Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CTA's executive director, Mr Bob Bryant, suggests that the ATO's large case audit assessments amount to ambit claims from the Tax Office over which the Tax Office will seek to negotiate with the company at a later date. If this is true, it means that the outcome of these audits is determined in an arbitrary way by the Tax Office rather than as a result of close adherence to the letter of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Office case manager in a large case audit is given enormous powers to issue an assessment more or less at his own pleasure rather than as a result of the strict observance of due process or careful consideration of the legal issues that may quite legitimately be in dispute. Taxpayers are forced into defending themselves against these arbitrary impositions at great expense to themselves and with the burden of proof falling entirely upon them, the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporate Tax Association has argued that we should draw on the experience of the United States in these matters and adopt a more cooperative approach between taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office. Such a cooperative approach would recognise that both taxpayers and the ATO have a responsibility to work together to ensure that the tax law is adhered to and that no-one is obliged to pay more tax than is legally due, given the fairest and most reasonable interpretation of the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have become an agent of the Government, particularly under the previous taxation commissioner. That is to say, black letter law should apply and not what the Australian Taxation Office sometimes wishes the law would be in its ideal world of maximising the tax take. It is one of the enduring features of the internal culture of the Australian Taxation Office that it sees its role not in terms of administering the tax law as it stands but in terms of maximising the revenue despite what the law might actually say in a particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporate Tax Association has called on the Government to adopt a more cooperative approach to relations between the ATO and corporate Australia, and the Opposition would urge the Government to respond in the same vein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of these longstanding complaints against the ATO's large case audit program, it is reassuring to hear from the new Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Geoff Carmody, that the large case audit program is to be discontinued in its present form. According to Mr Carmody, the Tax Office will from now on be taking a more selective approach to auditing the top Australian companies instead of the continuous two-year audits of all major companies, which was the main feature of the large case audit program in its previous incarnation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Carmody has also said that there will be greater emphasis on clarifying the law in the conduct of the ATO's audit activities, which is also reassuring in view of previous experience and the militant rhetoric of the previous taxation commissioner. Hopefully, the ATO will live up to these remarks in its audit activities, which would mark a significant departure from the previous commissioner's sledgehammer approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that these issues are addressed at the same time as we address such matters as the company tax rate and the company tax payments system. It is all very well to have a low rate of company tax, but not if the benefits of this low rate are to be dissipated through higher compliance costs as a result of Labor's failure to simplify taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is plenty of scope for such simplification, as you understand only too well, Mr Speaker, which should take  priority over the extraction of even more revenue from the existing tax base. Unfortunately, Labor's main priority over the next few years will be exactly the opposite, that is, to maximise the tax take so as to help reduce future Budget deficits which have blown out to such alarming proportions. This means that tax law simplification is likely to take a back seat to measures designed to raise revenue from taxpayers, regardless of the compliance costs that such measures might impose upon them. In short, we can expect the Government to continue with its policy of taxation by complexity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In following the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in a debate about taxation, I would have thought that members of the Opposition would have a bit of difficulty participating in a debate about tax issues after their past experience both in opposition and government. When they were in government last time around the tax avoidance industry grew massively and the tax system haemorrhaged dramatically and the Labor Government was faced with the important role of repairing the tax system, putting integrity back into the tax system and getting people to pay tax. In opposition, they developed the GST and all that went with that, which was soundly rejected by the people of Australia. Currently, it is fair to say that they have no idea what tax policy they may or may not have. The Opposition does not have a tax policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been assertions made about and fairly personal attacks made upon the former Commissioner of Taxation because he sought to ensure that companies paid their tax and that the tax system was returned to a sense of integrity. In the provisions now before the House, the Government is taking positive steps to create a competitive environment for Australian companies and create an environment where we can accelerate the pace of economic growth. None of those things came through in the honourable member for Curtin's contribution. Indeed, issues such as the development allowance and the investment allowance, which is part of this package of taxation Bills before the House, did not rate a mention. He made many assertions in his speech about the impact of what the Government was doing about the profitability of companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things are clear from this package of Bills. The company tax rate will be reduced from 39 to 33 per cent and the investment allowance will be introduced at the 10 per cent rate to build on the development allowance arrangement introduced following the One Nation statement and also the provisions of accelerated depreciation that were redefined in the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin was bemoaning the fact and creating a scare that the Government would have all these new taxes and would not live up to the taxation promises it made in the run-up to the election. But the package of Bills does precisely that: it ensures that the provision relating to reduced company tax is implemented as soon as possible in this current parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That demonstrates the Government's bona fides on maintaining its commitment to reducing the level of the company tax rate. The personal tax cuts were legislated in the last Parliament. All of those things highlight this scare which the Opposition continues to run. We had all sorts of suggestions by the honourable member for Curtin about what sorts of taxes might be applied, rather than a focussing on the potential value of these measures for the Australian economy. When we look at the measure before the House, it is important that we recognise the strength of the provisions that were in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment in the nation</EMPHASIS> package. We had, in that package, a very clear determination on the part of the Government to accelerate the pace of economic growth and recovery, and a recognition that some of the measures that had been outlined previously needed to have further assistance from government because we wanted to encourage the pace of investment and productivity growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely what we need to recognise&mdash;that lowering the company tax rate is all about creating an environment where our companies can be competitive with comparable trading countries which we are dealing with and competing with. It is why having low inflation rates matters, it is why having low interest rate regimes matters and it is why having low company tax rates is so important. That is precisely what we are seeking to do through this legislation that is before the Parliament this morning. One would have thought the Opposition would not throw up this sort of phoney scare but rather would be getting behind and supporting all these measures. Clearly we only get growth if we create that sort of competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is exactly what the legislation is designed to achieve. All the studies that have been done recently highlight the fact that the small to medium sized companies are the ones that are going to create that growth and be the key to economic revival through this decade. It is precisely because of that recognition, in studies like the McKinsey report, that we have taken the step to introduce the investment allowance provision that is contained in these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment allowance is very important. I think one thing that can be said is that it would have been a good measure to include in the One Nation package. But the Government does not sit inflexible on policy development. There has been a recognition that it will be a positive stimulus at this stage to the measures announced already over the last 18 months in the One Nation statement and in the Budget of 1992. That is why I think the additional provision relating to the investment allowance is important, as it enables companies that are contemplating investment to bring that investment forward and to reap the benefits of that change. That will assist many of the smaller companies which may have missed out on the development allowance arrangement for major companies that was part of the package of measures before the Parliament last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we move from that provision to the means of the payment of company tax we had the Opposition lecturing us last year about the impact of cash flow of the company tax instalment payment arrangements at that time. It is clear from what has been said by industry that the package of Bills that are before the Parliament go a substantial way towards overcoming many of the criticisms that were contained in the way company tax payments were impacting on businesses cash flow in previous times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They removed some of the lumps, as they are referred to, in that process. This hopefully gives the companies the chance to have a more secure pattern of cash flow and a more determined pattern to consider investment decisions and so on. That will be important because we want to create an environment in which there is certainty for business investment. The measures that the Government has taken relating to pool development funds were all about creating a more strongly oriented investment ethos within our business community, and the measures relating to creating a competitive tax regime are designed to do precisely the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at other measures in the package relating to more flexible arrangements on child care taxation provisions&mdash;again not a matter that the honourable member for Curtin referred to at all in his contribution&mdash;they demonstrate a positive recognition by the Government of an important item on the national political agenda. It is an important item for the women of Australia, an important item in terms of what we are all concerned about in work patterns, recognition of what work patterns are in the country today and recognition of the continuing and expanding role of child care as a mainstream political issue&mdash;something which clearly the Opposition, based on the omission of the honourable member for Curtin, suggests is not part of the Opposition strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We move from those areas to the other sorts of steps that can be taken to encourage economic growth. Already it is clear that the Australian economy is growing, despite all of the protestations of the Opposition through the last election campaign and before. It said that there was going to be a double dip recession, and that there were going to be hikes in interest rates. The Opposition mentioned everything it could think of to talk the economy down. Nevertheless the economy has been growing and will continue to grow. The Government has been determined all the way through the discussion about the economic recovery to take steps to encourage that growth and to accelerate it in a constructive and sensible way. The measures contained here relating to company tax and the already legislated personal tax arrangements are part and parcel of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas where the Government can ensure our economy is open and competitive. I just want to touch on a few of those measures that have tax implications, in particular relating to the potential that regional financial headquarters offer to Australia, and as part of economic recovery, the potential they offer to improve both our financial and capital base and therefore the investment potential that goes with that. These matters are currently being considered by the Government and I think it is important that early steps be taken to encourage those regional financial headquarters. The impact as far as taxation is concerned has been overstated in some cases. There are measures we can take to ensure that the withholding tax revenue does not suffer, but at the same time we get the benefits of the economic stimulus that go with having the regional financial headquarters that Australia can create and, where there is significant interest, particularly in our region, in encouraging more activity in Australia, encouraging more financial impetus in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that some of the measures that the Government and the broader community have been concerned about involving encouraging the pool of financial resources that companies can use to invest, I think that additional measures to promote regional financial headquarters would be not only a very positive contribution to the stimulus to our economy but also be sending a very positive signal as to our seriousness about those issues as far as the region is concerned. It is clear that the other measures the Government announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment in the nation</EMPHASIS> package, such as those relating to promoting the banking sector to take a stronger role in promoting economic activity, are important. The Government took steps in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment in the nation</EMPHASIS> package to promote the banks to have more resources available for lending, both through the Commonwealth Development Bank with additional funding and also through the assistance it provided to the individual banks to have more funds because of the Reserve Bank paying market interest rates on funds it holds. All these things are important because when we look at the various measures that are needed to create increased economic growth in Australia, they come in part from businesses having the capital and financial backbone to invest themselves, but as well as that they come from their having access to the financial resources to embark on new growth and investment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those things can only be done with a positive direction from the Government with a competitive tax regime. That is certainly what the package of Bills which is before the House is designed to do. The financial institutions are both open and positive in taking on new business proposals which look at issues like cash flow, and really that is what business opportunity is all about rather than, as has been the case in the past, the heavy reliance on property oriented investment decisions. The impact of low inflation on our economy, the value that low inflation gives us, is very real indeed. We now have an inflation rate which is certainly amongst the lowest&mdash;I think the second lowest&mdash;of the OECD countries. That offers tremendous opportunities, but I am not sure all in Australia as yet appreciate both the opportunities and the challenge that brings. Getting lower, competitive company tax rates is clearly part of the important ingredient we need to get the real benefit of having a low inflation environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is delivering on policy announcements it made prior to the election to create an environment that would give companies good competitive investment prospects. It will certainly send a positive signal to Australian companies, and it has the potential to show overseas companies that Australia is a good place to invest. That certainly will be one of the products of the package of Bills before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we add to those things the present growth in the economy and the fact that we will have taxation arrangements which are extremely competitive internationally, the Opposition should be saying, `Our record in opposition has been pretty lousy on taxation. We went to the people with a GST which no-one wanted and people would not buy. Amongst others, business was totally hostile to it as well. Small business could not stand the thought of all the paperwork and rigmarole involved with the GST'. The Government has been returned and is now delivering on its policies relating to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from the Opposition seeking to create more scares, which is all we get from the Opposition on taxation, we need the Opposition to say, `Yes, we want to have competitive tax arrangements, and a reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent is precisely about achieving that, and the Government is rightly delivering on a key policy announcement and commitment that it made'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief intervention in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. Most of the remarks on behalf of the coalition have been made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who will be taking my place to lead a number of the debates on tax legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this is the first package of tax Bills brought into the House since the last federal election, I thought it might be appropriate if I made a few remarks about them. In responding to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), let me remind him that it is not true that Australians&mdash;all 11 million voters&mdash;did not want the GST. Whilst we accept that the GST was the principal cause for our losing the election, there were a large number of people in the business community, people in the accounting profession, tax experts, and of course public servants who understood that that type of indirect tax system, used in almost all countries around the world, is a preferable one to the ragbag, indirect taxes we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, in the next few weeks we are going to hear about a lot of other new indirect taxes and higher indirect taxes which will be introduced in Australia. Those on the other side of the House are going to be made to squeal all the way to the next election, because they were re-elected on the basis of a scare campaign against a consumption tax. They have a mandate not to introduce any new consumption taxes or to increase existing consumption taxes. If they have no other mandate, that is the mandate they have. If they break that mandate&mdash;and they are obviously going to; they are softening up the electorate&mdash;then we will be reminding Australians of the pain and the disadvantage that that will put this country to, in terms of its competitiveness, all the way to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two or three points I want to make on these Bills. I know the debate has been guillotined. That is a reflection of the degree to which the Labor Party wants to debate tax issues, I suppose. It wants to keep the debates to an absolute bare minimum. The most significant of these Bills is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which takes up, as others have said, the election commitments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement. In particular, this is legislation which reduces the company tax rate from 39c to 33c at a peak cost in 1994-95 of an estimated $1.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposed to the reduction in the company tax rate; that is certainly no bad thing. But it has to be understood in a proper context. First, we have to be able to pay for the reduction in the company tax rate. In the end, it will be paid for with a range of indirect taxes which will increase business costs. So the net effect of the cut in company tax&mdash;which is of course a tax on profits, not a tax on costs in the way indirect taxes are&mdash;on business, the competitiveness of our businesses and the attraction of Australia as a place for our own businesses and foreign businesses to invest in is not likely to be positive at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be different on its own, if we did not worry about the costs. The Labor Party did not worry about the costs in the lead-up to the election. It never worried about how much anything cost. That is part and parcel of being Labor, I suppose&mdash;never worry about the bills; just go out and tell the people all the goodies the party is going to give them. For a hundred years Labor governments, State and Federal, have been doing that. If we do not worry about the cost then the cut in the company tax rate is not a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC, which was established by the Hawke-Keating Government, has said that the reduction in company tax can deliver only very limited benefits. As I said earlier, that is because it is a tax on profits, not a tax on costs. It obviously affects the capacity of businesses to reinvest. As the honourable member for Curtin pointed out, it also increases the disparity between the top marginal rate of tax&mdash;which after 1 July this year will be, with the ever rising Medicare levy, 48.4 per cent&mdash;and the company tax rate at 33 per cent. I happen to recall in 1985, when option C was produced, the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister saying that an important objective of government tax policy was to ensure that the highest marginal rate and the company tax rate were at the same level; otherwise it left the game wide open to distortion&mdash;in other words, individuals incorporating in order to ensure they paid lower rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years later, after a white paper that advocated the GST, we have the Government, led by the then Treasurer, doing precisely the opposite: increasing the disparity. There is an incentive for incorporation. Therefore, it does widen the opportunities for the rorting of the tax system. The Australian Taxation Office no doubt has been forced to say that its anti-avoidance legislation will be adequate to cover this. Not many people, I have to say, agree with the Australian Taxation Office on that matter, which makes me think that officers of the Australian Taxation Office have been persuaded to pump that line around rather than that in the privacy of their own offices they quietly believe in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a question of whether the Government is going to reactivate division 7. A lot of people in the business community are of the view that it will. If this is to be a constructive debate, I hope that we will hear from whoever is going to reply to this debate for the Government a clarification of the question whether division 7 is going to be reactivated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of this Bill, given that it does reduce company tax&mdash;and that is a benefit&mdash;are not quite so beneficial. One of those aspects is that the Bill brings forward company tax payments. Obviously for larger firms that reduces cash flow and is a cost. The Government claims that the revenue it will collect from the bringing forward of the company tax payments will help to compensate for the reduction in the company tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is probably true, but it proves the point that the net benefit to companies is going to be much less than the Government is claiming. Also, small unincorporated businesses, of which there are an enormously large number in this country, do not benefit from this legislation at all. This is a measure which is good&mdash;although not very good&mdash;for the big end of town, but the vast majority of small Australian businesses, which are not incorporated, are not going to get the cut in company tax; they are going to get all the tax hikes that will come later this year and in subsequent years to finance all these election promises that were made by the Labor Party to try to get re-elected on 13 March. So the small unincorporated companies will be the big losers out of these tax measures. That is a point that we will be making over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some brief remarks about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill. There are two areas within the very technical Taxation Laws Amendment Bill where the principle of retrospectivity&mdash;or perhaps I should say the principle of non-retrospectivity&mdash;is actually breached. One is the area of provisions relating to accrued leave payments, and the other is in the context of depreciation and broad banding. In the area of accrued leave payments, it is a retrospective benefit, not a retrospective cost. While that is not something about which we will kick up an enormous fuss, I remind the House that the notion of retrospectivity has been a controversial one in Australian parliaments since the wash-up of the Costigan royal commission in 1982. I do not think that we really want to go down the path of retrospectivity in taxation legislation. Then there is the potential cost to companies that may have wanted to move to a higher level of depreciation on a broadband basis. This legislation, therefore, potentially imposes a retrospective cost on businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think that is appropriate, and in another place my colleagues will be moving an amendment, which we hope will be supported by the Australian Democrats, to ensure that  retrospective cost is taken from the legislation. In so far as they read the Bills drafted for them, the Tax Office and the Government must refuse the temptation to introduce retrospective legislation. We are going to oppose it all the way and I am sure we will get a lot of support from the Democrats on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I draw to the attention of the Parliament the need to carefully watch a couple of these Bills&mdash;the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill in particular&mdash;for references to taxation information being provided, in one case, to the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission and, in another, to the immigration department in relation to illegal immigrants. We do not oppose the provision of such information. We do not want to stand in the way of the work of the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission and we do not want illegal immigration in Australia to be aided and abetted; we want to do what we can to support the tracking down of illegal migrants. However, there are real privacy issues involved here. I would like to think that the Privacy Commissioner will be fully involved in these measures. Perhaps the commissioner should be able to report to the Parliament from time to time about how the relationship between the Tax Office and other agencies is actually working and the extent to which privacy provisions could be breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that honourable members on the other side of the House share my concern about that. I hope that either the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) will take up that point, and I certainly hope that the Tax Office will take note of it. I am sorry that this debate has been guillotined. There are many other points I would like to make but I know that there are others who wish to speak and I do not want to stand in their way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to concentrate particularly on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1993 because it introduces certain measures which were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement: planning for tomorrow today</EMPHASIS> statement of 30 June last year, as well as amending other parts of certain Bills relating to superannuation. I might just say that superannuation and the broader insurance industry are now an interest and responsibility of mine, so I want to track through some of the changes introduced in this Bill as they specifically affect superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular importance are the amendments to the taxation of death benefits. At present, death benefits are taxed in a complex manner. The changes contained in this Bill will mean that recipients of death benefits will know with greater certainty the tax treatment of the benefit they receive. The Bill proposes that death benefit eligible termination payments&mdash;ETPs&mdash;within the deceased's retirement benefit limit paid to dependants will be exempt. However, death benefit ETPs within the deceased's retirement benefit limit paid to non-dependants will be taxed as ordinary eligible termination payments. Dependants whose death benefit ETP represents the commutation of a reversionary annuity, together with non-dependants who are aged less than 55, will pay less tax than under the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see amendments relating to the taxation of income derived by an annuity provider in respect of allocated annuity policies. Broadly, these changes bring into line the taxation treatment of income derived from life insurance companies and registered organisations with respect to allocated annuities and normal annuity products. This is an important change because it brings into line the treatment of allocated pensions and normal annuity-type products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I spoke about the importance of weaning Australians off their lump sum mentality and the role that these types of allocated pension products could play. It is important that we keep Australians interested in the notion of paying for their own retirement benefits. I am pleased to see that the industry itself is creating products whereby, in lieu of taking a lump sum, people will put away their money so that it can be paid to them in the form of a pension. The new products really revolve around the notion of whether a person is paid a pension or an annuity, and choice about the rate at which money is withdrawn&mdash;be it on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. In a sense, there is some measure of judgment and even risk involved with how quickly retirement savings are drawn upon. I understand that many people like the freedom of that idea but, as I said, to some extent it shifts the risk onto individuals because they have to make decisions about how quickly they will draw on their pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of an allocated pension is welcomed by the Government. As far as taxation is concerned, we think that it should be treated the same as annuities. The spread of new products will only further enhance the notion in the retiree's mind that it is better to put away and draw on money rather than take it as a lump sum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important change introduced by these amendments is the taxation of the excessive component of an ETP at 47 per cent, rather than including the ETP in the taxpayer's accessable income. In addition, there are certain changes to the notice provisions for personal superannuation deductions in the Income Tax Assessment Act. These changes were requested by the industry because the prior notice arrangements led to confusion on the part of fund trustees, and often led to too much, or in some cases too little, tax being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that certain amendments are made to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, and also, in part 4 of the Bill, to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. These amendments relate variously to transferring retiree members of superannuation funds. The first amendment here is important because it allows certain retiree members to transfer their moneys into another superannuation fund. That has the effect of allowing superannuation fund members to move to other superannuation funds that might, for instance, be providing a better pension deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the arrangements existing prior to this amendment, members who wished to receive their benefit in income form had to actually be a member of the fund from which that benefit was paid before they retired. This led to the situation late last year where people who were about to retire had to open a superannuation account with a $20 deposit. In other words, they had to use a fairly transparent device in order to be able to receive those moneys. We are now making it perfectly easy for them to not use a device and have access to the money. The amendment in effect will remove some of the barriers to the efficient provision of retirement income stream products and, in addition, it will increase the opportunity for people to choose between pension providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments relate to the obligation of trustees where breaches of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act have occurred, the ability of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to publish certain information about superannuation funds in order to discharge its superannuation guarantee obligations, and the notice requirements that have to set the retirement benefit limits regime. In effect, these amendments clarify and simplify the obligations of trustees in a situation of breach, allow for more informed choices to be made by employers in the discharge of their requirements under the superannuation guarantee legislation, and will reduce some of the complexity of the paper trail in the administration of the reasonable benefit limits regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should note that the above measures have an insignificant revenue impact. This is because, despite the prevailing fiscal conditions, the Government has not cut into its tax concessions for superannuation. Superannuation is still a preferred vehicle for the accumulation of savings and retirement benefits. Similarly, with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge and the consequent reductions in personal superannuation deductions, the Government tax concessions have been spread more equitably between low and high income earners. The measures also tighten the integrity and certainty of the superannuation system. In particular, the amendments relating to death and excessive benefits add equity and neutrality to the system of taxing eligible termination payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that this Government tackles the superannuation agenda is to confront these sorts of problems as they arise and to solve them, which is pretty much in stark contrast with our opponents who, in the last two years, have taken the old boiled lolly from some parts of the industry and thought that the way through this was simply to provide some tax cuts to people and induce them to put away for their own retirement benefits, which we know, and the vast majority of industry knows, simply does not work. It will not produce the dollars at the end of the day. Under our scheme of compulsion, making people put away money for their own retirement benefits, even though those moneys are held in private hands&mdash;in industry funds, life insurance funds or whatever&mdash;means that today we have over $150 billion which Australians have put away towards their own retirement. </PARA>

By the end of the decade we would hope to have $600 billion. I do not think there is any inducement via the Tax Office great enough to get people to put away for their own retirement income. It is absolutely essential that we have a degree of compulsion where we can say, `You really need to put this away'. We might debate the speed at which we lift the levy or the guarantee charge, but we surely cannot resile from the fact that people must put these funds away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the important exercises over the course of this Parliament is how quickly we move towards our target of having people put away about 12 per cent of their income, which we believe will be essential if they are to have sufficient income in retirement, not forgetting&mdash;I guess I should remind people of this&mdash;that there will be those who will never have sufficient access to the work force to build up funds sufficient for them to retire in comfort, or those who will never enter the formal paid work force. We should not forget that there will be a pension system in place. I think both sides of this House agree with that. In the course of the next decade or two we want to make sure that we do not place too much reliance on those government pension funds which, in fact, is what the current pension system is. To lighten the reliance on those funds, we need to have people put money away for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there has been some criticism of the fees and charges that are made by some sections of the industry on people who are taking out superannuation. We are very conscious of that. We want to put a great deal of pressure on the industry, first of all, to reveal the fees and charges and, secondly, to make sure those fees and charges are kept at an absolute minimum so that we do not breach the trust which workers now have in superannuation. We must reassure them that it is a good deal. They will have to get used to the notion that it is a very long-term investment; it is a lifetime investment in their retirement. They cannot expect to get access to those moneys in the very short term, or for certain charges not to be made for the handling and prudent investment of their funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the market driven solutions to the problems of fees and charges in the insurance and superannuation industry, the Government is contemplating action on that issue. To this end, I look forward to the comments tomorrow night of Mr Ian Salmon, Chairman of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, at its annual dinner. His comments will be important as they will show the attitude of one of the major players in the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also look forward to hearing the attitude of LIFA on such issues as dispute resolution and the conduct of agents. I think it is fair to say that in the past the behaviour of some agents in the insurance and superannuation industries has been quite offensive. They have not revealed the sorts of fees and charges that they have been making, and they have also been selling some products that are simply not appropriate to certain workers. I think there is a great deal more work to be done on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments of Mr Salmon tomorrow night will be keenly listened to so that we can see how far LIFA, as an organisation representing the industry, has come in attacking these practices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few moments I have to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill and cognate Bills, I want to pay particular attention to a few areas. The first is in connection with the reduction of the company rates of taxation from 39 to 33 per cent. The Government's intention is that this would make Australia one of the cheapest countries in the developed world for foreigners to invest in from the point of view of taxation. I want to dispute that for two reasons. Firstly, in the reduction of taxation from 39 to 33 per cent, we have to appreciate that a certain burden has been passed from the company to the individual shareholders with the imputation of dividends and the franking of dividends. I would dispute that the cost of this package to the Government has been taken into account. I will not say it will be an offsetting amount, but I would say that with this measure we have passed the burden once more back into the hands of the individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about cheapness of operations within Australia, it is a fairly commonly known factor that, quite apart from income tax or company rates of tax, Australian companies and businesses bear the burden&mdash;20 per cent of their costs being either State or Federal charges. We would have to look further into the effect of taxation on small business and on companies. Sales tax, fringe benefits tax and training levies&mdash;the whole lot&mdash;go some way to making Australia uncompetitive from the point of view of doing business. The reduction of taxation to 33 per cent will not alleviate that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of days at Question Time we have heard that the Government will just transfer the burden. In the transfer of the burden of taxation there is an absolute requirement that we look at the taxation of union funds right around Australia. In the last election we saw that the unions within Australia, and the ACTU, were able to make available to the government of the day millions of dollars tax free, to fight the campaign on their behalf. Why would they not make that contribution when they know that what was probably up for grabs was the biggest inequity: the exemption of taxation of union funds. I think it is a disgrace. If there is going to be something done by way of amendment, this is the way it should be done. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government proposes to amend Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 to insert the correct date from which the general investment allowance is to be available. The Bill presently specifies that the allowance is to be available in respect of eligible property acquired or commenced to be constructed after 9 February 1993. That date is to be changed to 8 February 1993. These amendments give effect to the Government's original decision and so have no impact on the estimated costs of the measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation laws amendment Bills before the House today continue the Government's long record of tax reform. It is a very historic day when the company tax rate in this country will be moved from 39 per cent down to 33 per cent, which will make us competitive not only internationally but, more importantly, in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also gives a 10 per cent investment allowance in addition to the development allowance announced last year. It is very important that Australia makes these moves and keeps abreast of developments in the world. We want to ensure that Australian and foreign companies are able to invest in this country under a competitive tax regime. I am sure that the reforms that the House will pass today will go a long way to making that a reality. Since 1983 the Government has introduced a number of taxation reforms to both the company and the personal rates. This Bill provides for quarterly tax payments for companies. That will improve equity between different levels of industry, and it will also improve the outlook for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all honourable members who took part in the debate today. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) asked about division 7 tax. I can answer that question by saying that the Government will not be reintroducing division 7 tax. The reduction in rates is to allow companies to reinvest. To go back to division 7 would work counter to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate there was some talk about retrospectivity in relation to the broadbanding depreciation measures. When these measures were introduced it was made crystal clear that the Government's intention was to change those broadbanding rates. Some people have been able to take advantage of the language in that earlier Bill, and this Bill closes those loopholes. The original intention of the Bill has been reinforced, and therefore the Government's view is that there is no retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was happy to see that the Opposition recognised the benefits of the accrued leave transfer payments. This will be particularly advantageous for industries undergoing micro-economic reform, such as the waterfront where we do have employees changing employers, and the disadvantages in the taxation situation will be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also criticised the large case audit program. The Australian Taxation Office moved in to audit the largest 100 companies in Australia. In view of the amount of revenue collected from that audit, it has been a worthwhile exercise on the part of the Government. Some people who were affected by that may disagree, but certainly it was a move that was long overdue, and possibly should be the focus for the way in which the Tax Office operates&mdash;that is, going out into industry. I am sure that, as a result of this large case audit program, when the companies are filing future tax returns they will do so in a way more consistent with the intention of the tax laws of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An independent review of the large case audit program found it to be hugely successful. It is far better to use the resources of the Tax Office in this way to ensure that the taxation laws of the country are supported by industry and that the correct rates of tax are paid. The dropping of the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent may be some compensation for those who viewed the large case audits in a  slightly negative way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased that in this legislation the issue of whether donations to charitable organisations are tax deductible has been tidied up and made a lot clearer to read. People who may in the past have had some difficulty in finding out whether contributions were tax deductible will find this legislation a lot easier to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's record in tax reform is a long one; we are continuing that. In the future there will be cause for a re-evaluation of the way in which the tax rules are applied. We never reach the end of the road. We have to be sensitive to the way in which taxes impact on companies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have had a look at that. Certainly we will be conducting dialogue with industry to make sure in the future that the tax laws in this country keep pace with the developments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill is to rectify an error in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991. The fact that it is required at all should be seen as a consequence of the Government taking Parliament for granted. The 1991 Bill was a document of more than 80 pages which proposed quite significant changes to the Bankruptcy Act. It proposed major changes to the rights of creditors and major changes to the rights and obligations of bankrupts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill was debated in both Houses on 19 December 1991. That was a day on which the attention of government members and senators was not focused on the merits or demerits of the large volume of legislation before Parliament: their attention was dedicated to who was going to lead the Labor Party. That day was the last sitting day of the year and the Government rushed a large number of Bills through both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill was debated in the Senate, from second reading to completion, for 51 minutes, concluding at 12.40 a.m. The equivalent debate in this House went for 33 minutes, concluding at 2.20 a.m. It may be symptomatic of the manner in which the Government treats Parliament as the rubber stamp of the Executive that there was not one contribution from a Government member or senator to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition did support the principle of the 1991 Bill. It was designed to ensure that high-living bankrupts make a contribution from their incomes for the benefit of their creditors. However, it was proposed that a trustee in bankruptcy have power to sign a certificate having the effect of a final judgment of a court without the bankrupt ever having the right to be heard before a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More detailed consideration of the 1991 Bill in this House might have disclosed that what was proposed was possibly unconstitutional, its being a purported exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a person who is not a judge and not a holder of other judicial office entitled to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. More detailed consideration of the 1991 Bill might also have disclosed that the procedure proposed was inherently unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pointed out on 19 December 1991 that the Act passed that day would stand as a monument recording the accession of the honourable  member  for Blaxland  (Mr Keating) to the Prime Ministership. Bankruptcy has continued under the Keating Government to be the thriving industry it was under the Hawke-Keating Government. In the year ended 30 June 1991 there were 13,091 bankruptcies; the following year there were 16,803. In the first three quarters of the current year there have been 11,123, and there is no end in sight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the pattern of treating parliament as a mere agent of the Executive, this Bill to correct the earlier error is, along with 29 other Bills, subject to the guillotine. Also consistent with the pattern is that there is no anticipated contribution to the debate at all from the Government benches. One might have thought, given the significance of the scheme for the administration of bankruptcies, that the Government might have taken the opportunity to report to the Parliament on the manner in which the scheme has operated&mdash;whether it has been successful or whether it has been a failure. My information suggests that there have in fact been practical difficulties irrespective of the challenge to the validity of the scheme. There is no information from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government does not get it right the community pays the cost. We have the cost of government involvement in a constitutional challenge in the High Court, and constitutional challenges generally are matters of concern to both Federal and State governments. There is also the cost of the drafting and passing of an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very limited time available for parliamentary debate of important issues has been restricted even more by the Government declining to call this House together for more than 10 days in the first six months of this year. We are presently focusing our attention on a matter of procedure in the administration of bankruptcies to correct an error in previous legislation. Instead of debating that, we should be considering the state of the economy and how to reduce the number of bankruptcies arising out of the current economic recession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate on the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill for a similar reason to that of the shadow Minister and honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), and that is, of course, the effect of bankruptcies and their overall influence on small business. Firstly, I too want to look quickly at the matter of administrative competence that this particular Bill raises. The shadow Minister has just pointed out the rush and, in fact, the complete arrogance of the Executive Government in bringing this measure to the Parliament and guillotining it through. Of course, we are actually discussing this particular amendment under guillotine. So nothing has changed. The Government is back on these important measures giving no opportunity for people to draw attention to problems that might arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the problems are numerous. This is clearly an occasion under the relevance rules of this Parliament to make sure that the Government is made aware of the disastrous situation which is still confronting the community and of the massive growth in bankruptcy. But, again, many honourable members who would like to participate and make those points on behalf of their constituents have not even bothered to put their names on the list simply because they know they will not get the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this not a nice start for a new parliament when, in the first 10 days, we are reminded of the Government's administrative incompetence in terms of the pay TV issue? We again had the absolute disaster of a Minister signing the front page, yet having no understanding of what was going on in his department or how proper process and administrative competence should be practised. Yesterday the Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), got up with a stunned look on his face when he was asked what were the rules for which he is responsible relative to the transfer of Commonwealth funds to tertiary institutions&mdash;remembering of course that the Commonwealth has no constitutional right to make such direct transfers and the Government had to introduce a device into this Parliament, which is not of great significance in itself, to make such transfers directly legal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Minister who brought that legislation to parliament could not even tell us what the rules were when he was asked to do so. That is a matter of serious importance. Nor was the Minister aware that in fact his department had transferred at least $900 million in a manner which is clearly either illegal or unconstitutional. If some person decided, for whatever reason, to create a situation where universities would be tipping all their students out onto the street simply because they had to give the money back, I do not know how long it would take to fix up that mess. That is unlikely to occur, but again I ask: why cannot this Government get it right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have this case of a taxpayer being put to expense in the High Court. The Government has been advised that the challenge, which is set down for hearing on 7 June, may well be successful. People would not need the qualifications of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney&mdash;they could be first-year suburban lawyers&mdash;to understand that, unless this is one of the constitutional amendments the Government intends to introduce when it makes us a republic, under Australian law they cannot make some receiver in bankruptcy a judge. But that is what this legislation did. People do not have to be very smart to identify that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the government front bench we have a line-up of people who are there basically because of the untruths and lies which were told prior to the last election. They want to project themselves to the community as being the cream of the crop; the people with great skills. Some of them have great rhetorical skills: they are pretty good at making a speech, dodging the issue, or refusing to answer questions in parliament by giving us long history lessons. They are good at that, but that does not run the country. Straight administrative competence is required, but in one week we have had three glaring examples of the Government's failure in that regard. Two of them have been huge, both in terms of Australia's reputation and its ability to administer government and large sums of money. The real issue before us today is the inability of this Government and its new Ministers to run the country on basic, funny little administrative issues which should be their first responsibility, rather than strutting around here carrying on in that fashion. It is worth putting that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only seconds ago another of the new breed sitting over there did not even know that it was his committee. We were sitting here confused about what was coming on next while he wanted a committee but he did not even know how to ask for it. He then said that he thought it was 1993, but maybe he was talking about 1992. I do not know how that will appear in the record. Perhaps the legislation will be back in this place at some time in the future, remembering of course that in difficult cases the judiciary is obliged to establish the intention of parliament. I am sure it has a very clear message from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) as to the date being talked about, although he did not seem to know. He read 1992, and then presumed that it was 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is outrageous, and it is time those opposite went back to school. If there is any good reason for compressing this parliamentary debate, it might be so that those opposite can go back to school during the break to learn about their departments and to learn how to run the country, because a lot of people who are going bankrupt at the moment would like to think that the Government is in charge and that it knows what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue was highlighted by the honourable member for Tangney in his address. Whilst we are talking about bankruptcies, let us talk about the figures. The last official figures available are for the year ending 1992. They tell us that in that year 16,880 Australians went bankrupt. Very few of them are in the category this legislation deals with&mdash;in other words, very few of them are very wealthy people using the device of bankruptcy to avoid their responsibilities to their creditors but who are then seen driving around in the latest model Mercedes, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree entirely with the intention of the original legislation, which was to say to those people, `If you still have those sorts of personal resources or income, at least half of it should go to your creditors'. It was a pity the Government did not get that principle right the first time. It is clear that the person who has the money to go to the High Court on this issue has quite a lot of money to protect. The simple fact is that this person has got away with it and, until this particular legislative amendment gets through the Senate, that person will not be subject to that legislation. In other words, due to the incompetence of this Government, the creditors will not receive some of that money which the law was supposed to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the situation is worse than that. We see that the number of bankruptcies in fact grew by 3,800 in that year. If the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) wants to tell me that is a decline in percentage terms, he is quite right; the base has been growing so quickly the percentages are falling. But the figure for 1990 stood at 8,552, and in that very short two-year period we have seen a 100 per cent growth in bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very large number of these are small business operators who have gone broke. A number of them made investments on the strength of government promises. Do you remember them all, Mr Deputy Speaker? There was the promise that interest rates would fall when in fact they went through the roof, as well as the constant plea for people to go out and invest because the economy was on its way up. Some people believe Prime Ministers and Treasurers when they say things like that. But these are some of the people now joining the queues petitioning for bankruptcy. It is a tragedy that small business, which I have the responsibility to represent in this place, features prominently in the statistics I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I already have quite a proud reputation in the area of bankruptcy law. I was able to convince&mdash;and I think against the recommendations of his own department&mdash;the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, to look at the situation where people could become instant bankrupts by going into the bankruptcy office and asking for advice. I understand that when the then Attorney-General went to his department and said, `Listen, it seems pretty crook that people can become instant bankrupts; they are not counselled or assisted and they do not understand what they are doing', apparently he was told that his department was in the business of bankrupting people, not about giving them advice&mdash;which is pretty tragic. But the law has been changed, to the credit of this Government and of Lionel Bowen who listened to my examples of people going to the bankruptcy office without knowing what they were about. If I have done little else in this place, I am proud that my representations at this dispatch box on that occasion convinced the Government to do something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the issue of the guillotine which does not allow honourable members the time to raise issues. Bankruptcy law does not come before this House every week. There are very limited opportunities for honourable members, under the rules of relevance, to raise issues and to bring to the attention of government side issues, if you like, which are of great importance to individuals&mdash;such as having a system whereby people can be counselled or where there may be a cooling-off period before they find themselves in the dreadful situation of facing bankruptcy, which very few understand. Considering the intent of this legislation, people must wonder when they see some of our more notable bankrupts on television driving the latest model Mercedes. But that is just another reason for such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the news?  What is the future for 721,000 small businesses that currently operate from 900,000 different locations in Australia&mdash;the only part of industry that is identified by all the experts as being an employment generator? Those in small business farming enterprises have not got much to be hopeful about. They are in the worst possible situation of the cyclical price cycle joining up with a downturn in the seasonal cycle, and for many it is a disastrous situation. Some of us had the opportunity in very limited time to discuss that matter last night and point out to the Government how much more help is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are people like small business retailers. What was the news they got yesterday:  a 1.2 per cent fall in retail sales. For the information of the Parliament, 1.2 per cent does not sound like much; it was $100 million for a month. Where does that $100 million come from in terms of big retailers and small retailers?  It comes straight off the bottom line. It is not well understood by many honourable members in the Labor Government that that is the problem. Business does not get anything out of its risk or its enterprise until its turnover exceeds a certain figure. It has to wait for that last little bit of turnover which turns into profit. Such falls in retail sales&mdash;might I add the third fall in the last four months&mdash;is not good news for small business. Clearly it is not good news for the potential to reduce the number of bankrupts that this legislation attempts to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, a lot of these people are making investment decisions based on the rhetoric of the Government. We have a new group of potential small business people, those who are losing their jobs, getting the golden handshake and going out and desperately trying to buy themselves employment. They are paying $100,000 or $200,000 for things like TAB agencies. Recently I was discussing some franchising initiatives with someone and it was suggested that maybe an advertisement should be placed in the paper to try and find the level of interest. The person there, who is an expert in this field, said, `Don't. You won't be able to handle the paperwork. There'll be so many people desperately trying to buy themselves a job through the franchise market, through TAB agencies and many of those other sorts of operations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my knowledge of the racing industry, it is absolutely painfully silly. Some people were actually paying $150,000 for a TAB agency that had a theoretical life of about six months because its agreement with the TAB was about to run out. Of course, that created great problems for the TAB because these people were stuck. But that is the level of their desperation. How many of them will end up as statistics on the bankruptcy lists unless something happens?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that it is wrong for governments to go out and claim economic growth, interest rate falls&mdash;you name it&mdash;no more taxes, if that is not its intention, because for those poor people it is their last chance in life. They have got their redundancy payment, their golden handshake. They are too young to be on the pension and they think, `I will make a business investment because the Prime Minister  said  so.'  The  Treasurer  (Mr Dawkins) is strutting around telling us that the economy is growing at 2.5 per cent. He does not tell us that the Government's own borrowings, $16 billion this year&mdash;in fact, 16 per cent of government outlays&mdash;is having a major impact on that economic growth. It is artificial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the two figures can be compared, but it is interesting to read and work out that a $16 billion deficit&mdash;in other words, government putting funny money into the economy&mdash;is roughly 4 per cent of GDP. If we can pick $400 billion as a reasonably sound figure for GDP it is 4 per cent, and we only have economic growth of 2.5 per cent. If that deficit were removed from the structure, if someone had the kindness to our children to say, `We are not going to keep stacking debt up on you to maintain our position of political dominance in this country'&mdash;because it is the kids who are going to pay that $16 billion that has been overspent this year&mdash;and removed it from the equation, what would be the level of economic growth in Australia? Clearly, it would be negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be argued that the Government is acting properly in propping up the economy, but what is the measure, the rule for these people going out&mdash;and there are thousands of them going out through decisions being forced on them. The total incompetence of the previous Victorian Labor Government is a classic example. We do not only find it here, where Ministers do not know what their departments are doing and do not know where the billions are going; we saw it in Victoria, and no-one would know that better than you, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was rabbiting on about the closure of the Midland railway workshops in Western Australia. He wants to pick this isolated issue. He chooses to ignore that the railways have been telling successive governments that if they did not get rid of the workshops, the entire rail system and all the associated employment was at risk. The simple fact was that in the open, competitive market that now exists in transport, in this case in Western Australia, Westrail could not carry the lead in the saddlebags of a $20 million-plus loss each year from its workshops and be competitive with the road transport industry. In many cases it is down to shifting less than 1,000 tonnes a kilometre along the rail system when, of course, in the north-west the iron ore producers shift 80,000 tonnes of iron ore per kilometre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point at which the switch is turned off on the lot?  That is what happened in Victoria. The Labor Government sold the trams to pay the wages. It sold the buses to pay the wages and it sold the railway rolling stock to do the same. Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, your constituents are stuck with paying $800 million a year to Japanese financial institutions to rent back those sorts of things. These are the problems and this is the issue:  how many more people are going to go bankrupt under such a slack administration, and how many more people will find themselves making unwise investments and going bankrupt because they believed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said, `Everything is okay'; a Prime Minister who believes the Treasurer when he says, `No new taxes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In closing, how many of these people have been bankrupted by the current tax regime?  We have just finished debating a Bill to reduce tax on companies. Of course, very few small businesses are incorporated, one of the reasons being that this Government has never been able to work out a practical system of closed corporation.

He has a strong record of interest in the area of bankruptcy reform. I note his comments in relation to the former Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, and I am pleased that he recognises that, notwithstanding the normal circumstances that characterise debate, that is, often a debate on the death, there are occasions when good suggestions can be put forward by members from either side of the House and adopted in a spirit of compromise and good administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, simply for clarification, that there has been a drop in the level of bankruptcies in the last five quarters&mdash;simply to place in context the comments that have been made in relation to the overall incidence of bankruptcy. But the background to this particular legislation flows from a concern regarding the validity of measures that were introduced in order to ensure that bankrupts with a stream of income made a proper contribution to their estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more prominent of those that might be subject to this regime is Christopher Skase. In due course his estate assessed him as being liable to make substantial contributions from income. Mr Skase did not make the payments as required and the trustee attempted to file the certificate in the New South Wales District Court under the impugn section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation the certificate filed by the trustee would have had the effect, and be enforced as if it were the judgment, of the court in which it was filed. Mr Skase commenced proceedings in the High Court in February this year to have subsections 1 to 39ZG, subparagraphs (3),(4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Act declared unconstitutional in that it conferred the judicial power of the Commonwealth on a person other than a judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case is expected to come on for hearing before a full bench of the court in June. The Government has been advised that the High Court is likely to hold that the impugn provisions are invalid and, accordingly, it is bringing forward this legislation to ensure that the trustees are able to initiate court proceedings to recover unpaid income contributions from persons who have refused or failed to pay them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill will give the Australian Dairy Corporation more commercial flexibility in financing its arrangements by allowing the corporation to undertake future dealings with banks, although this will be restricted to hedging. The effect will be to remove uncertainty concerning the ability of the corporation to secure exchange rates and cover the financial risks involved in international trade. The powers are similar to those previously conferred on other marketing authorities such as the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wheat Board. The coalition fully supports and welcomes the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is an important Australian industry&mdash;a very progressive and forward looking industry that has come a long way in a short time. Export income from dairy products this financial year is expected to exceed $900 million, up from $761 million last financial year&mdash;a very strong performance in anyone's language. This year, Australia's production of milk is expected to exceed 7,000 million litres of milk, which will be the highest level of production for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in contrast with several past occasions, this high level of production has not resulted in calls for cuts in production. This year the extra production has been welcomed and the only product causing some concern is butter. Australian dairy farmers have been through a vigorous restructuring program which, in some senses, is not unlike the magnitude of the restructuring program being confronted by the very troubled members of the citrus and tobacco industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that some 20 years ago there were no less than 47,000 dairy farmers in this country. Today there are only about 8,000 dairy farmers and they are producing as much milk if not more than was produced by the 47,000 farmers 20 years ago. They certainly can hold their heads high as being amongst the most efficient, perhaps the most efficient, in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just 10 years they have achieved a 25 per cent increase in the annual amount of milk produced per cow, by better breeding, concentration on nutritional matters and so forth. In actual volumes, 10 years ago it was something like 3,000 litres; this year it will top 4,000 litres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time the average herd size has more than doubled as a result of the rationalisation of the number of farmers, and at the same time sales of milk in Australia are continuing to increase. During 1991-92 sales increased by 32 million litres to 1.8 billion litres in total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Australia's per capita consumption of dairy products at 102.9 kilograms per head per annum is still a considerable way behind many similar countries abroad, which indicates that there is still room for expansion in Australian domestic consumption. The Irish manage to eat their way through 184 kilograms of dairy product per year per head of population&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition to all the potatoes. They certainly export a lot of beef; I do not know how much they eat at home. The Finns consume some 172 kilograms of dairy product per year per head; the Scandinavians around 156 kilograms, and New Zealanders 134 kilograms. The Danes, the Swiss and the Americans also consume more dairy product per head than we do. So there is room for expansion. The dairy industry has shown that it is capable of innovation and of clever and appropriate marketing. It shows every intention of ensuring that it is able to capitalise on that potential for further expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be appropriate to mention that the European Community is still engaging in massive subsidisation of a range of products, and dairying is no exception. As a result, Australian dairy farmers have had to trade into highly corrupted markets for many years. And it should be noted that they do not have tariff protection in the domestic market apart from an EC tariff quota arrangement. This latter simply means that, after the European Community has shipped 11,000 tonnes of cheese into Australia, we are entitled to put on an import duty which is equivalent to the amount of export subsidy actually paid by the EC to its exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March of this year, the EC actually cut some of its huge subsidies. That is a very welcome development and has the potential of lifting returns to the Australian dairy industry by some $30 million. Regrettably, many people in Europe do not seem to realise just how much it costs them as taxpayers to keep the EC dairy industry going. But, even after these reductions in payments to its exporters, the EC still pays out moneys amounting to something like a subsidisation of 240 per cent over world prices. For example, the butter refund paid to EC exporters is $3,393 per tonne&mdash;a quite remarkable figure. For butter oil, it is $4,362 a tonne; for cheddar cheese, $2,910 a tonne; for skim milk powder, $1,212 a tonne; and for whole milk powder, $2,620 a tonne. If only we could make European consumers aware of the true cost of those arrangements we might be further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention for a moment to AQIS and its relationship to the dairy industry. It seems important to state that our dairy exporters would be considerably helped if the Government let the industry become more responsible for its own quality control and forced the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to be more efficient. AQIS currently charges the dairy industry about $2 million a year&mdash;a not insubstantial amount of money. In round figures, 70 per cent of that money is for overheads while only 30 per cent relates to the actual cost of inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that those figures ought to be the other way around. If overheads can be reduced to constitute just a 30 per cent addition to the cost of actual inspection, the cost of export inspection would come down by 50 per cent. That would be a very desirable objective, not just to the dairy industry but right across the range of agricultural exports. Australia is put at an international disadvantage in terms of its competitiveness not only by the level of those charges but also, in some instances, by the mere fact that they are levelled on a user-pays basis vis-a-vis the Americans, who do not face that situation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Dairy Products Federation believes that the methods currently used by AQIS to recover costs and to administer this system add substantially to the overall operating costs of AQIS. For example, each individual export certificate is charged for instead of the more sensible approach of simply levelling an overall charge. It would be interesting to extract an answer from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) as to why commercial certificates have been introduced for trader-to-trader deals. If the traders do not need or want them, why does AQIS issue them? At this time, AQIS should be winding back its involvement in the dairy industry rather than extending it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is highly sophisticated. It is adopting world best practice quality management techniques at a faster rate than any other commodity groups. The dairy industry has a vested interest, which it obviously recognises, in getting the thing right. It seems to me that there is real need and justification for less interference, not more. The dairy industry would like to deregulate exports and, in the eyes of the coalition, the only time AQIS ought to be inspecting is when the importing country demands such an inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, why should the dairy industry be different from other processed food industry sectors such as biscuit and confectionary manufacturers? These sectors also use dairy products but they do not require AQIS inspection. On top of all of this, if we look at the situation logically, all milk produced must meet the standard set by a State milk authority. Surely, if the milk is fit for us to drink, it must also be fit for manufacture into dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need then for less inspection. At the moment, milk must pass the State milk authority and then AQIS. And, as companies enter into more independent quality control programs, they are then audited by organisations such as Standards Australia. We also have the ridiculous system that, if a dairy is being modified for a dairy company which produces for both domestic and export markets, the building must be approved by both the State and the Federal bodies. Surely, this is another example of where we could cut back on both costs and red tape. For example, the Commonwealth might be able to accept a State accreditation even if it had to insist on a few extra columns in the paperwork being filled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of doing business in this country is too high and here are some examples of areas where reform could be effectively implemented. The dairy industry has led the way with value added product, but it is being hampered in its expansion by cost and closed markets. The Government has yet to properly address the issue of reducing costs. Our factory owners still pay payroll tax while their competitors abroad, generally speaking, do not. The milk tankers are still subject to a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent; there are 18 tyres on a milk tanker and the tax on each tyre is $90 and the excise on fuel is some 27c a litre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill provides the Australian Dairy Corporation with greater commercial flexibility in dealing with banks and, as the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has just indicated, the coalition parties support that sensible improvement in the ability of the Australian Dairy Corporation to do business. The Australian Dairy Corporation is an important element in the dairy industry and has a significant role to play in Australia's exports to certain countries, particularly Japan. But the major exporter in the dairy industry is not the Australian Dairy Corporation but the individual dairy companies or the specialist dairy exporting companies. I want to talk more about the dairy industry as an exporter and also the Victorian dairy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry in Australia basically has two elements: firstly, the milk for human consumption, otherwise known as city milk or market milk&mdash;that industry being based in each State&mdash;and, secondly, the manufacturing sector, the major part of the industry, the majority of which is in Victoria. Victoria produces 61 per cent of Australia's milk while having 59 per cent of the national dairy herd. It produces 75 per cent of the locally consumed manufactured dairy products&mdash;that is, butter, cheese, milk powder, et cetera&mdash;but 90 per cent of our dairy exports. In fact, the dairy industry is the largest food processing industry in Australia. It is the largest value adding agricultural industry in Australia, and one of the largest value adding industries of any type in Australia. In Victoria, the dairy industry is also the largest volume exporter of any product made in Victoria. That is quite often forgotten in Victoria and elsewhere. Just recently, the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria had a special dairy week referring to the dairy industry as the quiet achiever. Too often, no-one recognises the significance of this industry to Victoria and to exports from Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is quite often forgotten when one looks at our exports or compares them. One of the reasons why manufactured exports have increased is that the statistician has moved butter, cheese, whole milk, skim milk powder, et cetera&mdash;dairy exports&mdash;from agriculture to manufacturing. When we look at agricultural exports we see beef, wheat and wool and then depending on what is happening in a particular year, cotton or sugar is quoted as the next most significant agricultural export when neither of them is the next most significant export. </PARA>

There is over $1,000 million in dairy exports each year and that is increasing. Over $900 million of those exports come from Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the problem because they are not shown as a commodity export in agriculture and they are broken up into different components whether it is butter, cheese or whatever in manufacturing. When people are using some of the rather naive and superficial comparisons one hears in this place, including at Question Time yesterday, there is no understanding or acknowledgment of the fact that we are really talking about a great agricultural industry being used to bolster the exports of manufacturing products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly a strong supporter for an increase in manufactured products. After all if fewer than five per cent of Australians, that is farmers, can produce about 25 per cent of our exports, surely 15 per cent of the employed work force, meaning the manufacturing sector, should be able to do far better than that five per cent, without fiddling the figures. I would hope that that happens. There is evidence that progress is being made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concentrate now more on the manufacturing sector of the industry. The city milk or human milk sector is controlled by State legislation, and it is the manufacturing sector of the industry that is controlled by Federal legislation. There was recent Government legislation, supported by the Coalition parties, to provide a new stability in planning and marketing arrangements, through to the year 2000. We supported that, and that was confirmed in the primary industry policy for the recent election. The coalition does fully support that policy, going right through to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commended the Government when the legislation came in, and I commend the Government again now, that it does provide that stability. But I want to talk about the single most significant dairying area of Australia. That happens to be my electorate. The Northern Victoria irrigation area, of which almost all is within the Murray electorate, produces over 40 per cent of milk in Victoria, or about one-quarter of all the milk produced in Australia. If one includes the production over the river in the irrigation area in the electorate of Farrer, the electorate of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the total percentage for Australia goes up to over 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gwydir, the shadow Minister has indicated, the dairy industry has been through a dramatic rationalisation over the last 20 or so years. Over the last 12 years there has been a 24 per cent reduction in the number of dairy farms in Victoria. That is the same as elsewhere in Australia, but in that time dairy production in Victoria has risen by 31 per cent and in my area it has risen by 37 per cent. The productivity per dairy farm over the last 12 years in Victoria has increased by a staggering 73 per cent. I am not aware of any other industry in Australia, agricultural, manufacturing or tertiary, that has that record of productivity. Certainly, in my area, the rate of productivity is actually increasing rather than declining. That is partly because of the development that is going on there, year in year out, as it quietly becomes an even more important part of the total industry in Australia. Partly because of the confidence that is there, it is in the right part of Australia, and also the price outlook, although still volatile, is better than for other agricultural industries at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That rationalisation I referred to has not been restricted to dairy farms. For example, in Victoria, the number of companies and factories in the last 12 years has basically halved, and the average throughput of those factories is up 300 per cent. This indicates the dramatic change in efficiency in those factories as well. In the Murray electorate there is the greatest concentration of food processing or value adding factories in agriculture in Australia. There are 8 1/2 dairy&mdash;and the half is Plumrose which is both dairy and horticulture&mdash;and eight others. There are two Bonlac; two Murray Goulburn&mdash;the giant cooperatives&mdash;Tatura, the third cooperative;  Kraft has two factories; and Nestle has a factory. In addition, there are seven other horticultural processing factories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the real action in value adding in agriculture and food processing is taking place in this nation. If we are to turn around our declining market share in value added agricultural products in Asia, and to expand our value added agricultural exports generally, a lot of the action will have to take place in my electorate. That means a significant amount of investment, both on the farm and off the farm, and a significant amount of investment is taking place. I will refer to that in a minute. But&mdash;and this is a great worry in the area&mdash;there is not as much investment taking place as there could be, there should be and there needs to be, particularly in relation to horticultural companies looking at New Zealand versus Australia as the best place in which to base their operations for further exports to the Asian area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why there is not the investment that I would hope there would be is, first of all Australia, unlike New Zealand and a number of other exporting countries, does not have a goods and services tax or value added tax. That, by itself, removes a five per cent export impediment or added cost that we have in this country, by the working through of the indirect tax system to which the previous speaker referred. This gives the New Zealanders a tremendous start in costs over us. Also, compared to New Zealand, the cost of putting a kilogram in a dairy factory or a can in a horticultural processing factory in New Zealand is now at least 20 per cent less than in Australia and in my electorate, because of the improvements that have taken place in work force productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at waterfront costs, Owen Jennings, the head of the New Zealand Farmers' Federation was quoting here recently that the average turnaround of a ship in Auckland is $4,500 and in Melbourne it is $25,000. Another figure that the dairy industry has put up is that the net income of the average New Zealand dairy farmer has been increased by over $3,000, due to the improvement in waterfront productivity in that country compared to Australia. This gives its dairy farmers and exporters of dairy and horticultural products a tremendous advantage over us. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party also mentioned, there are these AQIS costs which are unnecessary intrusions by AQIS into the export dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason why there is not the investment that we would all hope there would be, is that there are restrictions by a number of Asian countries into their importing of value added products. Quite often the import duty, or outright restriction, will come into place the more the value adding takes place with a particular product. This is true for the dairy industry as it is for wool and horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also, because of those restrictions, the uncertainty about how far to go into brand development in this country. There is also the continuing uncertainty over the export subsidy policies of the European Community and the United States. The recent reduction in export subsidies or restitutions by the European Community for its dairy exports has meant strengthening in the dairy market. However, the United States has increased its export subsidies through its version of EEP for the dairy industry, called DEIP, the dairy export incentive program, and that is now having an impact in some of our markets. There is also now the uncertainty over Russia which for a number of years was quite a reasonable market for some of our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of this, at the present time in my area there is over $200 million of investment taking place in dairy factories. Kraft, at its two factories, is spending about $90 million. Nestle, based at Tongala, is quietly spending about $15 million at a time. Murray Goulburn and Bonlac are both spending about $50 million each, and Tatura in a joint venture is spending another $40 million. There is other expenditure as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just two points I want to make about that investment. First of all, at a big function at the Nestle factory at Tongala about a month ago, it was declared the first Nestle factory anywhere in the world to be a recipient of an international quality standards award. I think it was about the fourth such dairy award made in Australia. Its commitment to exports based more and more on the northern irrigation area was confirmed. Its commitment to export quality was confirmed and it indicated that in the next three years it wanted to increase its dairy exports from $150 million a year at the present time to $250 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nestle has indicated that it sees its brands of dairy exports into Asia as coming more and more from Australia; hence its quiet expansion all the time. It sees the amount of dairy exports coming from Europe as declining, and Nestle should know what is going on in the dairy industry in Europe given that it has its base there. That export potential is a very encouraging prospect, and not only for my area but for the industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also refer to Tatura where there is a cooperative factory in a joint venture with Snow brand, one of the major dairy companies in Japan. There are several advantages in having this joint venture at Tatura. Firstly, it overcomes the critical and perennial problem of having enough capital in cooperatives to be able to provide what is necessary for further processing, et cetera. Secondly, it means that the packaging and value adding is now taking place in Tatura and not in Japan. It also indicates the commonsense thinking of the management of a dairy company here which is working with another firm in another country to guarantee continuing access for Australian product to that country. What Tatura is doing is not unique; there are quite a number of other dairy companies doing the same thing at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the dairy farms in northern Victoria, a similar investment is taking place. The efficiency of irrigation technology is increasing and at the same time the dairy farmers are overcoming the biggest problem confronting the industry in northern Victoria and southern New South Wales&mdash;the watertable problem. A tremendous effort is being made by dairy farmers because they are the major users of water in this area. They are trying to increase their productivity and reduce the access of water into the watertable by lasering and other techniques. There is a significant investment taking place in on-farm equipment which will further add to that productivity and further add to the concentration of the industry in this part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a most encouraging story, but it could be better. I hope the Government does take into account some of those cost impediments whose removal or reduction would further add to the ability of this great industry to expand in the area that the Government and the Opposition and all of us would want it to expand in: in value adding here in Australia. It is good to hear a positive story about an industry in Australia at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next to the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), I represent the largest dairy electorate in Australia. The electorate of Gippsland encompasses more than 2,000 dairy farmers and their families, who are largely centred on the Maffra irrigation area&mdash;south Gippsland and east Gippsland dairy districts. Gippslanders full well appreciate and understand the economic and social importance of the dairy industry to their own way of life, because so many of the smaller and even larger regional towns in Gippsland are heavily dependent on the dairy industry for their very viability. What happens to the dairy industry is of critical importance to all Gippslanders, so dairy farmers are very well appreciated throughout the length and breadth of Gippsland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for Murray have stressed, the last decade or so has been a very turbulent time for the dairy industry. This has been brought about particularly through government legislation during the mid-1980s. Over two or three years in this place we debated at great length the legislation brought forward by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). More recently, last year, the legislation to succeed the so-called Kerin plan was introduced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), who is at the table. There are some people who would have us rewrite history and, with the legislative changes in the 1980s that were called the Kerin plan, they so easily forget the role of the National and Liberal parties at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody would better remember that period than the honourable member for Murray, given that he had the responsibility of the shadow portfolio of primary industries. It was only the work by the honourable member for Murray and others occupying the opposition benches that changed very significantly several aspects of the Kerin legislation and that brought about the best possible result, given the framework of the legislation. We used the Senate to bring about those changes after the honourable member for Werriwa refused to make some of those fundamental alterations. So it was the coalition, using its numbers in the Senate, which laid the groundwork for the later legislative changes, as I say, last year. The National and Liberal parties have had a very significant role to play over the last 10 years in legislation passing through this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry also has been rocked by the general economic conditions that have left nobody in the rural sector unscathed. We keep repeating a constant theme of costs, as the honourable member for Murray stressed, given the Government's reluctance to take up the battle in that regard. It is not true to say that governments can have little influence over the downturns and swings of the international marketplace and how they affect commodity prices. Governments can create an economic setting which allows our export industries, such as the dairy industry, to be so much more competitive, if they bring down costs. The honourable member for Gwydir especially stressed this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the dairy industry is enjoying a period of stability and relatively high returns for dairy farmers, there is no reason for complacency at all. After all, those good returns have been coming through only over the last 18 months or so. There is reason for optimism, as the honourable member for Murray rightly states, but, whilst a number of the factories, cooperatives and companies processing milk have tried to cut their own costs so as to pass on higher returns to the farmers, there is a limit to what they can do. Government imposed costs and a still inflexible and rigid industrial relations system constrain them. There is plenty of scope for the Government to do a great deal more yet so that dairy farmers can enjoy higher returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry, although it has more confidence than it has had for a long time, still feels very exposed and vulnerable to sudden shifts on the international trading scene. On the best assessments available to us, there is reason for cautious optimism, but things can change very quickly, especially given the uncertainties of eastern Europe and what that means for European producers of milk. So we have to take this breathing period, if you like, grab the opportunity and fully utilise the time we have available to us to put our own house in order. It is true that we cannot blame governments for everything, and particularly not for downturns in international prices, but we can blame them or, more properly said, sheet home responsibility to them, for costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairy farmers, almost unanimously, enthusiastically  embraced the National and Liberal parties at the time of the last election because they saw this as an opportunity to reduce their costs in a way that the Labor Government could never bring about. Any factory that did the calculations of abolition of payroll tax, abolition of wholesale sales tax and abolition of 26c a litre petrol excise could see how farmers would be so much better off. They could pass on to the farmers, by way of higher prices, these savings from government imposed taxes. We should not for a moment believe that dairy farmers have lost the incentive to force government to bring about tax reform. We know that this Government's orientation is towards tax cuts for middle income earners, but we must get taxes off the point of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot hide at all from the demand of dairy farmers for micro-economic reform in transport and handling, in the waterfront. On all of this New Zealand does set benchmarks. Whatever the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy may think about aspects of New Zealand economic policy, the fact is that it has lowered costs remarkably. To take a specific example, in processed foods&mdash;forgive me for saying it&mdash;we are just going to be creamed by New Zealand in so many areas. Dairy farmers are in the main unprotected, particularly in regard to closer economic relations with New Zealand. Occasionally a theoretical economist in Canberra dreams up the most complex and weird and wonderful formulas to show that there is some percentage of protection for dairy farmers, but we know that, in regard to the most obvious forms of protection, such as tariffs or trade agreements, dairy farmers are quite on their own. Dairy farmers have learnt for a very long time to compete in the international marketplace without government assistance. They have to cope now with imports from New Zealand under closer economic relations, but they cannot do it while they have a fixed structure of costs that is many times more oppressive than that which their New Zealand counterparts have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are voting with their feet. We are losing manufacturers from Australia to New Zealand on almost a daily basis, and certainly on a weekly basis. Some of the figures are staggering. Some months ago I visited an electrical supplier to the automotive industry in the southern suburbs of Melbourne, which is where so much of the manufacturing belt resides. That supplier showed me the vast warehouse and former factory space from which it supplied the car industry in Melbourne. That supplier has moved to New Zealand. The reason for that move was simply that the per hour payment to an employee, including the government add-on costs such as payroll tax, workers compensation, land tax and the like&mdash;which are not all federal taxes, admittedly&mdash;was $17.50. In New Zealand it is $9.80 an hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I visited a whitegoods manufacturer who, in the last 12 months, has shifted from Melbourne to New Zealand. Again, I saw the same scene: an empty factory with a `for lease' or `for sale' sign out the front, with weeds growing up it. The disposal of property is another story, of course. For that manufacturer the add-on cost in Victoria, before a change of government&mdash;which I hope and expect will make a difference&mdash;was 56c. So for every dollar another 56c went in add-on costs; in New Zealand it is 19c. That is one-way traffic, but there is also traffic the other way, into Australia. That traffic has implications for a whole range of manufacturers, including makers of processed foods, and also for dairy farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take a great deal of delight in the stability and good returns which the dairy industry enjoys at the moment, but those things could disappear overnight with a sudden change in international trade. Also, let us take the opportunity to furiously drive home the need to lower costs by way of tax reform and micro-economic reform. This is not some theoretical economic debate; it matters tremendously to rural areas such as Gippsland, where the economic health of the dairy industry directly influences the people beyond the farm gate many times over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Firstly, Mr Deputy Speaker, congratulations to you on your new position. Secondly, whilst this legislation does not have opposition from the other side, there are a few issues that I would like to refer to. By way of preamble, let me say that I am very pleased that there is recognition that, despite the rural gloom, the dairy industry is one industry that at least is showing very encouraging signs. It has been recognised that the plan that was put in place last year has been an important underpinner of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the girls from the Sacred Heart College in my electorate are present in the gallery today. I am also pleased that we can demonstrate to them the mix between the rural and the urban sectors, the significance of the dairy industry to this country and, I suppose more importantly, what my role is as the representative of an urban based seat representing rural interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a very good example of how this Government has been prepared to sit down with industry and develop a long-term strategy. It is one that has resulted in declining support for the industry over time in a phased way, but in a way which the industry has accepted. It is one that has established a basis for confidence into the future. On the cost side of it, I do accept that it is, in an ongoing sense, important to address the means by which we can get the cost structure down, not just for the dairy industry, but also for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, however, that the solution does not rest in the policies that were promoted by Fightback. The problem with Fightback&mdash;as with the arguments that are still put in this House about what Fightback would have done in reducing the costs for rural producers in particular&mdash;is that it did not go to the question of what the increased expenditures for rural producers would be as a result of the introduction of a GST. The so-called benefits could have been delivered&mdash;and even then they were problematic&mdash;only if a tax had been introduced that would have yielded something of the order of $24 billion in revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In relation to the so-called savings that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has talked about&mdash;payroll tax, the petrol excise and the wholesale sales tax&mdash;tax cuts could have been delivered only if they were accompanied by the introduction of a GST. I note that the opposition parties have dropped the GST, so I would be very interested to know how they are going to address these cost savings. Another point I would make&mdash;and I made it also in the lead-up to the election campaign&mdash;is: in the Opposition's package how is it guaranteed that the benefits are going to be passed on? We saw an interesting example in the home State of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) with the coming to power of the Kennett Government. It actually abolished the 3c petrol tax that the Labor Government had had in place as a result of the Pyramid difficulties, but that did not result in lower fuel prices in Victoria. Interestingly, we also note that in the last couple of days the State Government of Victoria has reimposed a 3c petrol tax. This is what we said it would do. If the federal opposition parties were in power and were to introduce it, the State governments would just come in and fill the void, so the benefits would not have been realised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to see the honourable member for Murray arguing that point with Jeff Kennett in the circumstances in which he finds himself. I accept that we need to continually tackle the need to get cost structures down. At the NFF conference this morning, I put to the dairy industry&mdash;this is something that both the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Murray might reflect upon&mdash;that one of the areas in which we can produce efficiencies, and therefore cost savings for the dairy industry, is by tackling the mechanism by which the bulk product is distributed from the farm to the processing operation. There is a mishmash of crossing vehicles, a very inefficient system. If we could get away from the tying of those vehicles to the respective processing plants and actually get more efficiency in the distribution network, it seems to me that that could bring real savings to the dairy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an example of where real micro-economic reform can be tackled. It is something on which I have made a commitment to the dairy industry and to the NFF that I am prepared to follow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister told the House that Cabinet had been misled by submissions from Senator Collins in relation to the prospects for microwave television being up and running well before satellite digital compression technology. I ask the Prime Minister: why then did the Government introduce an amendment to part VII of the Broadcasting Services Act in November last year specifically to permit pay TV subscribers to microwave transmissions to migrate to satellite transmissions if they wished? Is it not also a fact that the tender documents issued in December for the additional microwave licences stated specifically that the licences would be available for pay TV? Can he say whether it is also a fact that Senator Collins had been publicly quite open about the possibility of the early introduction of microwave pay TV, and that on the Channel 10 program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> in November 1992 he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether the Opposition&mdash;I do not say this in a pejorative way&mdash;is genuinely confused about this issue or just after a bit of devilment. The point is that when the satellite was considered as the primary delivery system for pay television, in the first instance it was considered for an analogue system; that is, basically one channel on each transponder. Of course, given the fact that with that technology it would have been a much earlier introduction of services, anyone owning narrowcasting licences for MDS could have presumed to have been able to deliver services at about the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government changed that when it decided to mandate digital technology on the satellite; in other words, it decided to establish a standard for the delivery of compressed digital signals off the satellite. The development of that standard and the development of all the software that went with it meant that there would be a delay of some time, maybe two years, in the delivery of that system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no objection to MDS as a technology playing a role in pay television services. It probably will under any model because even the satellite, under digital compression, at the end reaches what is called infill. Cable and MDS will probably play a role. The point is that it should not play a role as a primary system before the satellite&mdash;not two years earlier. That is the point. That was never intended by the Cabinet and that is what could not be permitted: we were not to have a system which could cream-skim the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and maybe Brisbane, reach about 30 per cent of the community, but tie up all the primary film suppliers and, in a de facto way, cut off the broader national option of the satellite cable and MDS infill as a primary system because it had got up and started commercially. The position is as simple as that. That is the position that remains today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I know, the Opposition has agreed to pass legislation so that that would be the case; that is, that MDS does not get the jump on the satellite. That is all we are saying. There is no obscurantism here&mdash;no view that MDS is some inferior technology that cannot play a role, with the `a' underlined; rather than the role, with the `the' underlined.

Is it not the case that the primary footprint of the satellite, whose qualities he supported yesterday, provides quality coverage for some, but not all, capital cities?

I obviously struck pay dirt yesterday with that little answer, because here they are, the toffs, as usual, saying, `Well, look, if we have got it in Bellevue Hill and Vaucluse, or if we have got it in the lower North Shore and Toorak, who cares about Forbes, Junee, Wagga, Canowindra or rural Queensland?

He said that MDS will be available as a technology, but will not be available as a broadcasting system, ahead of standards being set by and for the satellite; that is, for the digital compression on the satellite. In other words, he is saying it is still available as a technology but it cannot be a primary delivery system first. There is no point trying to smother the Opposition's position on this question.

Telecom&mdash;if it were to succeed in any of this, or have its network involved with any of this&mdash;was one of the very few telephone companies in the world to fibre up parts of cities with fibre-optics to the street corners.

I have seen newspaper reports about it and, probably like most honourable members, I have received some representations from constituents.

I am pleased to say that Sega, which is the company involved in that particular game, has, of its own accord and in response to community concern, indicated that the game will not be released. However, that is only one game from one company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the Office of Film and Literature Classification does not classify video games at all. The current system that applies in relation to films and videos, with which honourable members would be familiar, would not easily lend itself to video games. These matters were considered by the Australian Law Reform Commission recently in its report on censorship administration. The commission recommended that censorship legislation should be altered to recognise computer games. Some games may be subject to banning if they offend community standards and others should be subject to restriction or carry an appropriate warning. In June these recommendations will be considered by a meeting of State and Commonwealth censorship Ministers, and I am hopeful that the Commonwealth and the States will combine on this matter to devise a regime fleshing out the proposals recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</PARA>

No matter how passionately people might think they feel about this issue, the fact is there is not that much information about it. There have not been very clear models of republican structures ever proposed in Australia. So the thinking will not just go on on the Opposition's side of politics; it will also go on on the Labor side of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Government is concerned, the instinct of the Leader of the Opposition on this&mdash;to have his party consider the issue&mdash;is correct. For the Government's part, we say to the Liberal Party, `We want you to be in this with us; that is, we want you to be part of the debate'. We do not seek to have a proprietorial grip on this issue. This is an issue which will be dealt with by the country. We will reach a time&mdash;if not now, one wonders how many years in the future&mdash;when we will not have the monarch of another country as our head of state. That seems to me to be a pretty obvious issue. It is now on the public agenda and it will be subject to debate.</PARA>

The honourable member for Bennelong might be groaning away over there, but the fact is that we will give him the room to think about it carefully without trying to put him into some sort of pincer on the issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite think that because we have made that offer we will give them a free ride on all the other issues, think again, we will not. But, on this issue, those people who sat down a century ago in the 1890s to think about a federal structure for Australia did so in the face of the national imperatives, looking at the things they thought and felt passionately about, and they came together in a spirit of achievement to get something done. This is something that needs to be done. As we have said, we think it desirable that it be done by the centenary of our Federation, and that is quite a number of years away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this paper published today will help focus some of the issues, but it will be the report of this committee that will help focus it. In a sense, that will be the start of the process, and the process will then go on so that we think about what process is then best, whether it be a constitutional convention, how we sit down with the States, how the parties are fully represented and how the matter is then progressed. So there is no need for indecent haste on this on the part of anybody. So I am only saying to those opposite that I think their Leader's instincts on this are dead right.</PARA>

On that latter point it is important to remember that the eight levels of achievement described in the profile are statements of expected outcomes from students.

We are seeing a growth in trade and business development as a result of their language capacities, understanding of cultures and general ability to penetrate these markets and do things with them.

It reminds me of a reference I read earlier today in a newspaper which said that talk of a republic&mdash;the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) will be interested to hear this&mdash;is a bit like the crew of his favourite ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>, debating as they approach the iceberg whether the ship should have a change of name. It is not a very productive activity given the problems we face at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that that statement is very appropriate given the enormous problems this country now has as a result of Labor's spending spree at the last federal election. We are noticing, day in and day out, just here and there, little leaks emerging about not only the depth of concern in the bureaucracy over this problem but also some of the alternative taxes that the Labor Party is planning in government to impose on Australians. As far as concern in the bureaucracy is concerned, there was a very significant article on the front page of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. That article reported that Ministers have received, in particular the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)&mdash;presumably not his sidekick, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) or whatever he is called&mdash;a Treasury paper advising that the Government's objective of providing income tax cuts and achieving a Budget deficit of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, to quote the paper, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unattainable unless it heavily prunes spending or increases taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what the Government is about is not heavily pruning spending. We know that from the way it is progressively leaking plans to increase taxes and building expectations about new and damaging taxes on the Australian community. It is not interested in reducing spending; it is interested in collecting taxes. It is no wonder that the bureaucracy, the financial markets and the business community are worried about the size of the Budget deficit in this country, because if the Government's target is to be achieved, that is, to reduce the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, depending somewhat on what assumptions are made about growth and the rate of inflation between now and then, it will have to take something like $7.4 billion off spending or increase taxes by that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To increase taxes by $7.4 billion would be the equivalent of increasing the wholesale sales tax&mdash;Labor's consumption tax&mdash;by 61.8 per cent. That is basically the proposition that Australians in the next few years under this Government will be confronted with. It is interesting that we heard nothing about that during the election campaign. During the election campaign we had statement after statement&mdash;depending on the vagaries of the opinion polls&mdash;about new promises. We had a government that went around the country arguing that it did not matter how much these promises cost because they would always be financed through growth in the economy. Not only did the Government realise at the time that that was untrue but also the campaign mounted by the Labor Party at the election on this issue alone was one of the most fraudulent and dishonest election campaigns ever conducted in this country. Those people on the other side were re-elected on a fraud, and I will prove it to them with their own words. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our stuff will whirr back towards balance, no trouble at all . . . You will find that that structural thing just disappears by about 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen is, providing that the underlying structure of the outlays has not significantly changed&mdash;and they won't have&mdash;the cyclical return of revenue will see the Budget balanced&mdash;the Budget start shifting back towards balance.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an absolute fraud. The Government offered the income tax cuts to try to match the tax cuts in the Fightback plan&mdash;$8.6 billion in tax cuts&mdash;but it had no method of funding them. It went around pretending that they could be funded through increases in revenue resulting from higher rates of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know from Treasury documents and from advice the other side of the House has been getting that that is impossible. It cannot be done. It is a fraud. It is a complete fraud&mdash;and the Government was re-elected on the basis of a fraud in the 1993 election. On 9 March on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program on the ABC, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a deficit reduction plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the Government had a deficit reduction plan&mdash;a plan to increase taxes after the election and not tell anybody about the regressive and damaging taxes it had in mind. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the economy grows, the Budget will repair itself. That is an entirely responsible thing for us to do. It's something which, I might say, the Treasury is entirely happy with.</PARA>
<PARA>Wrong! The Treasury was not entirely happy with it. Even the Assistant Treasurer knows it is a barefaced lie to say that the Treasury was entirely happy with the spending plans of the Government. The point has been made in Treasury documents and Treasury submissions over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a government re-elected on a fraud. It promised no new taxes, and now it is softening up the press gallery and the electorate for new taxes. It promised that its policies could be funded by growth, knowing damn well all along that its policies could not be funded by economic growth. During the election campaign, we said that Labor's figures did not add up and could not add up. We were right and the Australian public was simply presented with a fraudulent policy by those on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What new taxes are Australians going to be confronted with? We have already spoken in this place about the way in which the Government is proposing not only to broaden the base of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;I understand that it is now considering applying the wholesale sales tax to airline tickets and restaurants&mdash;but also to increase the average rate of the wholesale sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson&mdash;a de facto member of the Government&mdash;said that the Government wanted to reduce the deficit and that, frankly, the Government could not continue to say that it was going to reduce taxes. In other words, the Government is going to increase taxes. He went on to explain how:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one way or another, we are going to have to look at the issue of taxes over the next couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Government is going to increase taxes, and in the end it will increase the overall burden of taxes over the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU is talking about a wealth tax. A wealth tax is, of course, part of the old game; the politics of envy. But the real point about the wealth tax is that it will raise virtually no money at all. A wealth tax will not solve the Government's problems. It is not the multimillionaires of Australia, some of the Prime Minister's mates&mdash;such as Warren Anderson on whose big property out at Tipperary the Prime Minister has enjoyed pig shooting over the years&mdash;who will end up contributing to the solution to the Budget deficit problem; it will be ordinary people. The wealth tax will raise nearly nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the Assistant Treasurer. About the only time people notice him is during an election campaign, other than when he pulls the occasional bizarre publicity stunt, which, by the way, the Treasurer and other Ministers have told him to abandon. But during the election campaign it was the Assistant Treasurer who ran around saying, `Hey, I've got a great idea. Let's increase the Medicare levy'. What did he want to increase it to? He wanted to increase it to 2 1/2 per cent. He is now the Assistant Treasurer, so that gives honourable members a pretty clear indication of what his little mate over there happens to have in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also has in mind some of our old friends that we saw before the last election, such as the interest withholding tax. What is an interest withholding tax? Do honourable members remember that in last year's Budget? If honourable members read through last year's Budget papers, they would be reminded&mdash;as I was when I took the trouble to have a look at them this morning&mdash;that the Government said, `Well, if we do have some problems with a Budget deficit, we might consider introducing an interest withholding tax'. When we talked about that a bit before the election, the Government said, `Oh no, we won't do that. We have decided we won't'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is an interest withholding tax? It is a tax on the interest that people such as pensioners get from their very small savings. It is a tax on that interest, taken away at source by the bank. So people will be slugged. So the Government, having put up the Medicare levy to 2 1/2 per cent, having introduced its little tax of envy&mdash;the wealth tax&mdash;on some of its mates, will then introduce a new tax on pensioners, on those least able to look after themselves, through its interest withholding tax proposal. It ran away from it because of the election, because of the fraudulent campaign it was putting together. Now that the election is out of the way, it is back into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the States? This Government's rhetoric is that it has reduced the overall level of Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of GDP during its time in office. But we should take into consideration that the amount of Commonwealth grants to the States has fallen in the life of this Government over the last decade from 9.6 per cent of GDP to 7.2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Commonwealth's Budget for its own purposes? What about the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays? They have actually substantially increased during the life of the Hawke-Keating Government. The pressure has been put on the States. The easy way to make the cuts is to cut funding to the States and then say to them, `Oh, you go and raise some of your taxes. They are very narrowly based taxes. They are actually very regressive taxes. You go and raise your own taxes'. What is the advantage of that? This is what the Government will do now. It will do that to four Liberal State governments so that it can go around saying, `Oh, look, Liberal State governments have put up all the charges. The States will have to put up their charges while we at the Commonwealth level make cuts to try to fund our fraudulent election bribes'. The fact is that those taxes that the States will have to put up will be Keating taxes. The coalition State governments will tag those taxes as the Keating Government's. </PARA>

They did not get much of a mention from the honourable member for Mayo. There was certainly a lot of whingeing about losing the election, how the Government is supposed to be going to bring out all these secret taxes, and how the Opposition will hound us all the way to the next election. Honourable members opposite should wait for the Budget and see how the Government addresses the problems that they were talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Government has not proposed any new taxes. It is only the high taxing Liberal Party that is talking about new taxes. It was going to introduce the goods and services tax which would have raised far more revenue than anything this Government has ever proposed. Wherever a goods and services tax has been introduced&mdash;and people who have travelled through Europe know this&mdash;it is only the tip of the iceberg. Once it is in, it invariably goes up. It is to the Opposition's credit that at least it was open about getting it in. The Opposition was terribly closed about what might happen in the future, but it does raise a lot of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo talked about people on incomes below $20,700. The simple fact is that this Government has already delivered tax cuts to those people. When we took government the lowest marginal tax rate was 30 per cent. We have cut that to 20 per cent. The top tax rate was 60c and it is now down to 47c. Taxes have been lowered. When we talk about tax reform in this country there has been only one tax reformer&mdash;this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember the debates in this House when we removed the tax-free lunch. The removal of the tax-free lunch was anathema to the Liberal Party. We heard from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton)&mdash;at the time, I think he occupied the same job as the honourable member for Mayo, but I am not sure&mdash;who led the charge against the terrible practice of taking away tax deductibility for business lunches. We heard dire predictions about the impact that that would have on the Australian economy, but not about the fact that taxpayers who never took a tax-free lunch were subsidising those who did.

In actual fact, I think the industry has welcomed the fringe benefits tax system as it has removed a lot of the doubt. People know what the rules are.

We wait with a great deal of interest for the debate in the Liberal Party, whether it is now or in two years time, on the way in which it will go about raising the revenue should it ever become the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return now to the record of this Government and just point out that since 1983 the improvements in the tax system have increased the disposable income for pensioners, allowees and families on low incomes. Changes include increasing the tax free threshold, which the honourable member for Mayo was just bleating about; cuts in the lowest marginal tax rates; and increases in the indexation of rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real household disposable income per capita in December 1992 was 13 per cent higher than it was in March 1983. This is due to the tax reforms of this Government, along with social reforms. These include the family allowance supplement which is paid to people on low incomes. It, in fact, targets low income families via an incomes and assets test and is paid in addition to the family allowance. The family allowance supplement is linked to the CPI to make sure that it keeps pace with inflation. Between March 1983 and March 1993 the maximum family payment for a two-child family increased in real terms by nearly 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This Government has dramatically increased the number of child-care places. The number increased from 46,000 in March 1983 to 193,000 in June 1992.

There has been assistance to carers, home and community care, the supported accommodation assistance program and the emergency relief program. If the Opposition needs more proof it can go to the ABS study on the effects of government benefits and taxes on household income. This study found that the Government's welfare system and tax system ensured that there is a redistribution of income in favour of low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party always talks about low taxes; it never talks about low spending, which is the sort of thing the honourable member for Mayo is talking about implicitly here today. We always have the idea from the Liberal Party that it is a low taxing party, and that taxes always have to be cut. The simple fact is that it is not a low taxing party. If we look at the way in which it was purporting to raise taxes at the last election, and all the utterances since&mdash;and even when it was in government&mdash;the simple fact is that taxes go up under the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a look at where Australia stands in relation to other countries, we see that we are not a high taxing country. Of the 24 members in the OECD, we are either the second or the third lowest taxing country. When we became a government we were the fifth lowest. So in the last eight or nine years we have actually gone down the league when we compare how much tax we pay as a percentage of GDP relative to other countries. We are quite proud of that record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that we do not talk about high taxes or low taxes: we talk about appropriate taxes. We will raise the appropriate amount of taxation in a way which we believe is fair so that we can undertake the sorts of programs that this Government has introduced and maintained&mdash;things that are taken for granted in this country. When people in other countries find out about the social security systems and the income support systems in our country, they can only marvel at them. People who come here from other countries actually marvel at the sort of income support we give people who are unemployed, aged or sick.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his lame defence of the Government's taxation policy, I am really driven to ask the obvious questions: if government taxation is so low, why are the pockets of Australians so empty? If taxes are so low, why are middle and low income earners suffering so grievously? If this Government is such a great manager of our economy, why is the Budget deficit $16 billion? If this Government is so compassionate, why are 700,000 children living in poverty and why are there record personal bankruptcies? If this Government has a tax policy that is so wonderful, why are Australian industries moving overseas? If this country is so successful, why are there one million unemployed and why is there so much misery everywhere?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer quoted some of the tired old Labor statistics. They remind me very much of the old story which likened statistics to bikinis: what they reveal is interesting, but what they conceal is vital. The clear fact is that Labor governments are the great taxers. Labor governments have been the biggest taxing governments in our national history. Under 10 years of Labor, total tax has more than doubled, from $40 billion to almost $100 billion. Individual tax has almost doubled, from $23 billion to around $50 billion. Company tax has more than trebled; sales tax has trebled; customs duties have doubled; superannuation fund taxation has increased from $25 million to $1.2 billion; fuel excise has increased sevenfold, from less than $1 billion to over $7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just the increases in all of those taxes; Labor has made an art of inventing new taxes. There have been scores of them in the history of this Labor Government. When Labor came to office no-one had heard of a Medicare levy, a prescribed payments system, fringe benefits taxes, the capital gains tax&mdash;in fact, we now have the world's toughest capital gains tax&mdash;the superannuation levy, the training levy, the tertiary education tax. We have had new tax after new tax. This Government shows extraordinary dexterity in inventing new taxes to meet its bills. Labor has been the grim tax reaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That taxation net stretches into every transaction in the country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there is a tax on antique clocks, but do not dare suggest it to the Government because someone might get the idea. The Government taxes every item in every store. Every time there is a transaction in the country, the Government has its hands in the pockets of Australians. Australian families meet the tax man every day they go to the supermarket, the shop, the restaurant, the fuel bowser. This Government has set up tax offices in every corner in every place as it grabs more and more revenue from the Australian people. If our taxation policy is going so well, why is it necessary for the Government to impose a whole new range of taxes? Whenever Labor sees something in good working order, its first reaction is: `Let's tax it'. Never dare in this country to succeed because your reward will be more taxes! Instead of encouraging initiative, Labor taxes it. Labor has been extraordinarily creative in inventing new taxes. If it were half as good at solving the country's problems as it is at inventing new taxes, we would not need the taxes that it creates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At every election the Government comes to the Australian people with a promise of lower taxes, but it never delivers. Each government collects more taxes than the one before it. When the Government announces tax cuts, in reality it collects more tax. It uses words like `simplify', `reform' or `streamline' as smokescreens to actually raise the tax burden. The classic recent case was the amendments to the wholesale sales tax system, which we were told would relieve so many people from tax burdens and simplify the system. The reality is the Government has now admitted that it will collect hundreds of millions of dollars in extra tax as a result of what was supposed to be a tax cutting mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government seems to believe that families and businesses simply exist to provide extra tax revenue. The Government has not yet learned that it is not government that creates wealth&mdash;money is not made in the mint; it is produced in the businesses, farms and factories of our country. Instead of rewarding those people who have put in the extra effort, Labor resorts to taxing them. So Australian families, low and middle income earners, are particularly disadvantaged as they work that little bit harder to try to provide some benefits to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of higher taxes, the Government should be axing programs. But Labor is never likely to axe the grants to the trade union movement, the political lobby groups, the Medicare advertising programs or make cuts to the bureaucracy. It is easier to provide more taxes, which is what the Government is on about at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in recent times the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) seems to have acknowledged that he is searching around for more taxes. He has to do that because he has to fund promised tax cuts, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us are cast in concrete. That promise should not be taken too seriously&mdash;remember, we were not going to have a capital gains tax either, but it did not take Labor long to forget that. So we have to have new taxes to help fund tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing to remember about these tax cuts, as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) so ably pointed out, is that not one cent will go to people earning less than $20,700. That includes most women, most families, and all farmers in the current circumstances. Those people will get no tax cuts. Looking at Labor's proposed taxes, those low income earners will have to carry the biggest share of the burden. In his response today, the Assistant Treasurer again would not deny the Government's intention to introduce a range of new taxes. All he could say was, `Wait and see'. In the language of this Government that is the nearest one will ever get to a confirmation before the axe falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sorts of taxes does the Government have in mind to impose in this new Budget? According to the Assistant Treasurer's response, no-one is talking about it apart from the Opposition. That is nonsense. Lately I have been making notes about some of the taxes that various government people are proposing. We should start with the Assistant Treasurer himself who said he had made a positive contribution during the election campaign. He started off in a very positive way by proposing a higher Medicare levy of 2.5 per cent. Yesterday the ACTU&mdash;hardly a friend of the opposition parties&mdash;also proposed new taxes. It wants a wealth tax. ALP leaders are on record year in, year out wanting to reintroduce death duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories proposed a new energy tax to penalise those who live in the country and those who do business in faraway places. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) has been a fertile source of new tax ideas. Last year it proposed a new tax on home owners to subsidise renters. What about his bobby-dazzler, the new tax on babies, that he had to quickly withdraw after his office floated that idea?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is currently advocating a tax on fishing. Last year the Government's Resource Assessment Commission proposed fencing off all the beaches and taxing anybody who visited the beach. Last year, the environment department floated the idea of a super tax on food and clothing to help pay for the environmental damage which it claimed was caused by farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Treasurer himself? There are no limits to his imagination: he wants to extend the prescribed payment system to tourism, taxis, doctors, pharmacies, farmers and all interest earnings. The Prime Minister has been full of imaginative ideas over the years. After all, it should be remembered that he once said it was impossible to have a fair tax system without a GST. So now we hear proposals to extend the WST system so that it covers tourism, accommodation and a whole range of other measures. Yesterday the former Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), laid down another suggestion: an extra tax to help the unemployed. That sounds rather like the Australian Democrats' ludicrous idea during the election campaign for a special tax on jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the conservatives were thrown out in 1983 was that the only people paying tax were ordinary wage and salary earners; for the rest of the people in the community it had become optional.

The Liberal and National parties went to the last election proposing a new 15 per cent goods and services tax on every item, on all goods and on every service in the community. The Opposition wants to go back to the bad old days of the 1970s, the days of the bottom of the harbour schemes; to the system where the ordinary wage and salary earner paid all of the tax in this country and where the people it represents&mdash;the well-to-do and the rich&mdash;paid nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was what the GST was all about. What these people on the other side of the House hark back to are the days of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. What the Opposition wants for this country is a flat tax system where, irrespective of how much income a person earns or of a person's circumstances, everyone pays the same amount of tax. That is the sort of tax system that the Opposition stands for&mdash;a flat tax system&mdash;and that is why it went to the last election with a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) to come into this House today and suggest that those on the other side of the House stand for a fair taxation system is simply laughable. This is the same man, along with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who had to be told by a market research company at the end of last year that a GST on food was unfair. This is the same man&mdash;a spokesman for the Liberal Party in the last election&mdash;who could not go out into the community and find out that a GST was unfair; he had to ring up Andrew Robb and say, `What does the market research company say? They think a GST on food is a bit unfair. We better drop it'. </PARA>

Whilst that is a commendable piece of honesty from the honourable member for Flinders, it still indicates the deep attachment of those sitting on that side of the House to flat taxation. Whether it is eight per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent they still  believe in the principle that we pay the same amount of tax irrespective of how much we earn. That is why they brought forward the GST. What Labor had done in the 1980s in this country was bring in a fair system of taxation, where we paid tax according to how much we earned and that hurt the Liberal and National parties. It is one of the reasons why we continue to be in government in this country. Australians have made a lifestyle choice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask for leave of the House to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the inaugural meeting of the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum, held in Tokyo from 13 to 15 January 1993, and to make a short statement in connection with the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words about the delegation. I thought my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) would be in the chamber. If he comes later he might add to my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation, as the report will show, comprised the honourable member for Bradfield, me as the leader, and the President of the Senate. We were accompanied by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and Ann Stewart who was my senior adviser at the time. I would like to thank the delegation members and the officials for the support that they gave me as the leader of the delegation and for the job that they did for Australia at that conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum has an interesting history&mdash;a history of participation for which Australia can take great pride. The proposal to set up this forum, which is a parliamentary body and which will generally follow the work of the APEC ministerial council and provide a parliamentary perspective to the work of APEC, was an idea of former Prime Minister Nakasone of Japan. His idea was that we should have a wide forum that works in the Asia-Pacific region to provide contact at parliamentary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that when honourable members go to conferences in Europe they find that there is a plethora of parliamentary bodies that overlap each other in Europe, North America and South America. But in the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;which is the most dynamic part of the world, and the part of the world where Australia's future lies&mdash;although there is the fledgling ASEAN group APEC, there is nothing which brings together a wide range of politicians from the various parliaments in the region to talk about matters of interest to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia got very strongly behind this proposal because we believed it would be an excellent vehicle for us to have an input at a parliamentary level in the region, and an excellent vehicle for those democracies and mature parliaments in the region to provide some impetus for the movement of democracy in our part of the world. The proposal had been around for a couple of years. Finally it took some form at a meeting that was held in Singapore in August 1991. At that meeting I asked the Australian delegation to propose Canberra as a forum for the next meeting of the organisation, which was held in Canberra in December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Singapore meeting 10 countries from the region participated, at the Canberra meeting 15 countries participated, and at the meeting in Tokyo in January this year 15 countries participated. I think we have seen with this organisation the very successful birth of a body for which we can take a lot of credit. If it had not been for the persistent pushing by the Australian delegation at both the two preliminary meetings and the final meeting, I think we might not have seen this body get off the ground. We circulated a number of papers both at the preliminary meetings and at the meeting in Tokyo, which I think very much added to the form that this body will take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was elected to the executive committee. The honourable member for Bradfield and I were both elected as members of that executive committee. We will have an ongoing interest in the way the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum evolves. The work that was done and the logistical assistance that was provided by the office of former Prime Minister Nakasone showed the awesome logistical work that the Japanese parliamentary groups can provide when they set their minds to it. Nothing was spared to ensure, from that side of it, that the conference went well. From the point of view of the Australian Parliament, this organisation should be one of the most important bodies that we participate in. It is the parliamentary vehicle which will allow us a window into the region. It will show the other parliamentary groups in the region that Australia&mdash;not just at a governmental level but also at a parliamentary level&mdash;wants to stake a claim to this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years the Parliament in outgoing delegations has started to shift its focus from one that had almost entirely a European perspective to visiting countries in the region and, importantly, to becoming affiliated with parliamentary organisations in the region. Our participation in the ASEAN parliamentary group has been upgraded to the extent that Australian delegations now attend the ASEAN inter-parliamentary union meeting and are given observer status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this new body can claim very widespread support in the region and Australia is there at the beginning as a fully fledged participating parliament and as a parliament that is seen as taking a very strong position in ensuring that this body gets off the ground. We are not riding on anyone else's coat-tails here: we are one of the initiators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Bradfield and Senator Sibraa for the support and the work they did on the delegation. I particularly thank the Clerk for the report that he has provided. I thank Ann Stewart, who was my senior adviser, for the work she did in all the toing-and-froing in the run up to both this meeting and the meeting in Canberra. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would also like to be associated with this report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the inaugural meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, which was held in Tokyo in January 1993. I would also like to commend the former Speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), for the substantial role that he played in the development of the concept, especially at the Canberra conference of last year and also at the inaugural meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would briefly like to go back to the genesis of this concept because I think it is almost a matter of amazement to us that in such a short time&mdash;a mere three years&mdash;we were able to get together a not inconsiderable number of representatives from parliaments of some 15 nations. As a result of the Tokyo conference we have also received applications from Russia, Mongolia and Peru, as well as Taiwan. The first three countries have been accepted as members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APPF is the first organisation of this nature which, in a Pacific context, has on its eastern rim now all the nations of ASEAN, with the exception of Malaysia, all the nations of north Asia, all the nations of North America, and clearly there is a growing interest on the Pacific rim of South America. That is demonstrated by the fact that Mexico first attended the conference in Canberra. Peru has now applied to join and we would anticipate that probably Chile and some other states will join in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this has been achieved in less than three years demonstrates more than conclusively that we struck while the iron was hot. Although there was a clear perception in the Asia-Pacific region that the time had come for the development of a truly Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum, it was not the universally accepted position. For example, I have detected a tendency for people in IPU circles to ask, `What is wrong with us? Why can't we represent the parliaments of the world?'. Part of the answer rests with the fact that its conferences attract over 900 delegates. That speaks for itself. The IPU has reached a size where it is very difficult for Australians to feel that we are in a regional structure in which we have a role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in April 1990 the then Secretary-General of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party was in Australia. The delegation included Mr Tatsuo Ozawa. He outlined to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, a proposal for a Pacific parliamentary league for educational, cultural and economic cooperation. I think it is fair to say that the idea was not fully developed at that stage. Nevertheless, the Japanese were prepared to take the initiative, and the former Prime Minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone should be given full credit. I went to Tokyo in July 1991, quite independently of the Japanese initiative. At that stage I was not aware of it although I had spoken in this chamber of the need to take the initiative in this particular area. In my discussions in Tokyo with Mr Ozawa I found that we had a considerable degree of mutual understanding about the direction in which we wanted to go. I offered to prepare a background paper on the subject, which subsequently formed the basis for the first informal conference held in Singapore in August 1991 attended by delegates from nine parliaments.. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the basic thrusts of my paper was that, while APEC&mdash;which was still a fledgling organisation&mdash;had been given substantial governmental support through most of the region, it was fair to say that the communities of the countries represented in APEC were totally unaware of its existence. It was a ministerial council with considerable public sector involvement. That was the beginning and end of it. It had no public persona at all. It certainly did not involve the representatives of the people. As the honourable member for Watson has rightly pointed out, when one looks at other assemblies such as the Council for Europe, one can see the obvious advantages in having a parliamentary organisation which links into the EEC, as with the annual conferences of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not suggest at this time that APEC will grow into some sort of EEC, one cannot discount the possibility of closer relations in the future. Even at this early stage there are very real advantages in having a parliamentary assembly which has essentially common, though not necessarily exclusive, membership with APEC and ASEAN on the one side and the APPF on the other. For example, representatives of APEC can come to the annual conferences; give reports on the progress of the region and policies for the economic, and other developments taking place in the region; and allow the parliamentarians representing the people of the region the opportunity to be involved in the overall process. We must establish a two-way communication which is clearly not there at the present time. That was the initiative that I put into the development of the APPF concept. It was also thought worth while to add other organisations, such as PBEC, the South Pacific Forum and other organisations active in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canberra informal meeting in December 1991 saw these matters developed further, leading to the Canberra declaration. Subsequently, last January, we had the first full meeting in Tokyo with representatives from some 15 nations. We have gone from strength to strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to commend the honourable member for Watson for the role he has played in establishing the forum. There can be satisfaction for both of us because it is fairly rare that a member of parliament has the opportunity to say that he played a not inconsiderable role in the birth of a new organisation. I trust that future generations of Australian parliamentarians will add to the foundations we have endeavoured to lay. This is the first time that a regional organisation of this nature has been established linking Japan in the Northern Hemisphere with Australia in the south and most nations in between. The APPF is an additional indication of the growing relationship between our two countries and our mutual desire to see a community of interest in the Asia-Pacific region further developed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to address the House on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill. This is a Bill to support and strengthen competition in the telecommunications area. It does so in an uncontroversial way and we see ourselves supporting it. However, the principle of competition which the Bill purports to support, and does make a contribution towards supporting, albeit in a relatively minor way, is a principle which is important for the House to consider in the context of telecommunications policy because it is a principle which the Government has had enormous difficulty in applying. I propose to make a few comments about the specific amendments in this Bill and then address the broader issue that the Bill raises&mdash;that of competition in telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to provide the three mobile telephone carriers with land access powers which are presently not available to those carriers under the existing legislation. The present Act does not extend to the mobile telephone carriers&mdash;Telstra Corporation Ltd, Optus Mobile Pty Ltd and Vodaphone Pty Ltd&mdash;access to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate, install or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general communications services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to extending land access rights to the mobile carriers, the amendments to this Bill also impose the same obligations on the mobile carriers that currently apply to general carriers: for example, giving reasonable written notice to the owner of the land prior to entry. The amendments also include new provisions of a land access code which should further safeguard the interest of property owners through the regulation of powers given to both general and mobile carriers. In essence, the Bill places the mobile carriers on the same footing as the general carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe) described the Bill as ensuring greater competition in the industry. He said that competition was the focus of the Government's telecommunications reforms. Having witnessed, over the last two weeks, the extraordinary twisting and turning of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) in the Senate and of the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) in the House, and a similar performance from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the House yesterday and today, one could be forgiven for doubting whether competition is indeed the focus of the Government's telecommunications reforms. That statement by the Parliamentary Secretary constitutes yet another of the manifold contradictions that have been apparent to honourable members of this House whenever the Government speaks on telecommunications policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications, who sits in this House&mdash;the junior Minister in this area&mdash;was reported in the press this morning as seeking to back away from the Government's commitment to competition in the telecommunications area. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the Minister is reported as having:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . raised new doubts about the Federal Government's long-term plans for the telecommunications industry by suggesting that extra carriers may not be allowed after the industry is deregulated in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA>The reporter commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecom-Optus duopoly has widely been expected to give way to open competition after 1997.</PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister for Communications is alert to the desire of the officials, the experts, in his department to encourage competition, and he for one will not go along with them. He presented a paper and made comments to the conference of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group which seemed to dissociate himself from the views of his department. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, my department might find this a bit of a revelation.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, the department had not been informed by the Minister before he made those remarks of what he intended to say to the Australian Telecommunications Users Group conference. Indeed, the Minister is full of muscle with the new ideology of the Government, an ideology which expresses grave doubts about the significance of competition. He said that he believed a `deliberately forged and active partnership between government and business' was the best way to achieve industry development. Just to make sure that nobody confused him with Senator Collins, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But ministers are entitled to have a different opinion to their departments.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is true, but it is also the responsibility of Ministers to make up their own minds and, if they do not agree with the advice offered to them by their departments, they are perfectly entitled&mdash;indeed they ought to; they have a responsibility&mdash;to reject that advice. That is not what Senator Collins did and is not what he says a Minister's role is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications will not be drawn into that whirlpool of controversy that has been stirred up in the relationship between Senator Collins and the department. He will come out and say that he is a person with a mind of his own and that he differs in his view from that of his department. As we know, he also differs from the bulk of the telecommunications industry in his view as to the value of the licences that have been applied for and are currently under examination by the winning bidders in the process that Senator Collins initiated on 19 January. The Minister for Communications is a man of his own mind and his own determination. He differs from his department and the industry, and he is proud to say so. Unfortunately, the respect in which he differs is that he is much less convinced than the officers of his department of the value of competition in the telecommunications industry&mdash;the very matter with which this Bill is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the Government's unwillingness throughout the whole development of policy in this area to commit itself clearly and within a defensible framework which everyone in the industry understands to a competitive structure for telecommunications in Australia. The Government has been through a series of the most extraordinary U-turns in enunciating policy in this area. No-one has been more responsible for this than the Prime Minister himself, the Government's self-appointed expert in telecommunications, a person who has contradicted himself again and again in this vital area and who is unquestionably personally responsible for the chaos that is now apparent in policy and in this area of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who is at the table, says that this is a cheap shot. Let me just inform the Parliamentary Secretary of the statements that the Prime Minister has made on policy in this area. On 31 May last year, the Prime Minister&mdash;and people listening to this will consider this comment with great interest in view of the Prime Minister's answers in the House in the last two days&mdash;said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I've been quite uncomfortable about the fact that we're about to exclusively nominate satellite television as the only vehicle for Pay-Television between now and the year 1999, particularly when other technologies are available, like fibre optic cable and MDS . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In this famous interview with Laurie Oakes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, in which the Prime Minister gave us that little touch of excitement by throwing policy in several areas into complete confusion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've kept the slate clean on pay but at the eleventh hour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and he warned his colleagues&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we look like choosing a very limited technology&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, satellite technology&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and denying to ourselves the right to at least choose alternative, and maybe superior, technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>In June, just shortly after that, he made it quite clear what he thought. He said that regulation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would have closed off to Australia the higher technology of fibre optics and MDS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>multipoint distribution services or microwave television&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in favour of plastic dishes and satellites for a decade. I was never prepared as Prime Minister to shut that technology off.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Prime Minister will now say, `Well, we have not shut it off. It will still be available after it has climbed over all the hurdles that we have now constructed in its place'. But let us look at what happened after the Prime Minister made those public remarks. The Government embarked on a very clear public process&mdash;and, as it appears from documents which have become available, a very well understood private process within the Government and within the Cabinet&mdash;to permit the development of alternative pay television technology besides satellite. It adopted a very clear policy to do this. A number of actions were taken, which I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Dr Theophanous) about, to implement this policy. There is no question whatever that the Government clearly contemplated that microwave pay TV could provide a viable system for broadcast pay TV technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Prime Minister's edicts in May and June, Senator Collins&mdash;this poor Minister who now finds himself in such confusion as he tries to work out what on earth the Prime Minister wants in this area&mdash;was in no doubt about what was to happen. He lauded the Broadcasting Services Act&mdash;the Broadcasting Services Bill, as it then was&mdash;in his second reading speech for the support that it gave to technology neutrality. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The technology neutrality of the Bill is no more apparent than for Subscription Broadcasting Services. Licensees are encouraged to use whichever delivery mechanism suits their commercial needs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear statement of the Government's support for neutrality. Did the Prime Minister jump on Senator Collins at this stage and demand that he retract this statement about technology neutrality when, as he now knows&mdash;and presumably he knew then since he is the universal expert in this area&mdash;this is an inferior technology? There was not a word about it. Instead, the Government went on. When the Broadcasting Services Act came up for amendment in November it was amended to allow subscribers to microwave pay television services to migrate from those services to satellite pay television services if they were not satisfied with microwave pay television services&mdash;MDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment contemplated the fact that there would be MDS pay television services operating alongside the satellite transmitted services. Is the Prime Minister going to say to us that that will still be so some time down the track after all the hurdles put in place have been climbed? But that was not the intention then. What happened was that the Government established a tender process to issue licences to those involved, or who might become involved, in the industry to undertake microwave pay television services. This tender process began in December last year, and the tender documents make it absolutely 100 per cent crystal clear that these licences were to be issued for the purposes of subscription pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no ambiguity whatever. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that the Government was heading down this track, and known to be heading down this track. If there is any final doubt, there was a note to the Minister from the secretary to the department, written prior to a meeting between the Minister and Mr Steve Cosser, and it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are meeting with Steve Cosser in your office at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 November, to discuss his business plans for participation in pay TV using microwave (MDS) technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the officials went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have talked with Cosser on several occasions about his business plans. He is also known to have consulted on the regulatory aspects with other Cabinet Ministers and Caucus members, the Opposition and the ABA, and he is to meet with the Trade Practices Commission later this week. He has exposed to us some highly commercial-in-confidence aspects of his business plans to ensure that he is doing nothing that would breach the spirit or the letter of the Broadcasting Services Act, and has invested considerable capital in pursuing MDS options for subscription narrowcasting and subscription broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA>When this document was issued under FOI there were some blank spaces in it. But when the document was produced in court proceedings it did not include those blank spaces. It is very interesting to see what was left out of this document. I will read from the document as it was issued under FOI:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Availability and use of other technologies such as MDS and cable for pay TV from the outset have been transparent features of each pay TV model since Part 7 of the original Bill. It was a central plank of the Prime Minister's position in June.</PARA>
<PARA>A blank space then follows, but these were the words omitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .and was clearly reaffirmed in the latest model when it was put to Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA>So the whole process was clearly reaffirmed, and it was known that microwave MDS TV was an alternative technology. The Government was operating on the basis that it was neutral as between the technologies. There was no doubt because, according to this note, Mr Cosser had been fully open with the department about his intentions in relation to these licences.So the Government knew exactly what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the process proceeded through January with the press reporting mounting pressure from applicants for satellite licences to halt the process for the allocation of microwave licences for fear that they might be too competitive with the satellite technology. At this time there were negotiations going on between Australian Consolidated Press and Mr Cosser's Australis Media for the purchase of Mr Cosser's existing microwave licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context of mounting debate and concern, it emerges that there was growing concern in the Prime Minister's office; something was twigging that office. One wonders what it was that was alerting it to some problem here. On 25 January Mr Don Russell called Mr Roger Beale, the acting secretary to the department, to indicate his concern about the stories circulating on the interest being expressed in MDS for the purpose of the national pay TV system. He said, `This does not seem consistent with Cabinet's decision on pay TV'. It is a very strange comment to have made, given the note that had been provided to Senator Collins by Mr Graham Evans. But there is no doubt that this mounting concern continued, and on 27 January negotiations between Australis Media and Australian Consolidated Press broke down, and Mr Cosser said he would not be selling his MDS licences, even though the contract was right there in front of him to sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then? There were stories in today's media that the Prime Minister had further discussions with representatives of Australian Consolidated Press, but in Question Time the Prime Minister said that they had no foundation, so I will not repeat them. What we do know, and what is uncontested, is that the day after those negotiations broke down the Prime Minister phoned the acting secretary to the department and said that Cabinet had been notoriously misled in this matter. Today, in the House, he said that Senator Collins then stepped in and took independent action. The word `independent' would bear careful scrutiny here. Of course it is possible that Senator Collins was at more than arm's length, that he was completely divorced from all this manoeuvring that was going on around the Prime Minister's office and within the industry over the applications for the MDS licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister says Senator Collins took independent action. That is not quite how I read a minute, which was produced in court proceedings, written by Miss Christine Goode, who has since stepped aside. The minute said that it had been decided and approved by the Prime Minister that the tender process was to cease the following day. Of course, the Prime Minister's sudden concern in this area has thrown the process into complete chaos. It is interesting to note that it is in this very context that on 19 January, not nine days before the halt was called to the MDS tender process, Senator Collins approved the cover note but not the contents of the determination issuing the rules for tenders for the satellite pay TV licences. Senator Collins was obviously concerned about what was going on, because his defence is that he wanted to keep at arm's length; he was worried that the Government might be seen as acting in relation to pressures from certain groups in the industry, and he did not want that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His effort to dissociate himself led him to make a colossal blunder in relation to the guidelines for the satellite pay TV licences. He set up a process which he himself now says was flawed and which the Government is now seeking to change by rushing retrospective legislation through the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in January is the most extraordinary mess and chaos in this area that one could contemplate. The universal expert, the Prime Minister, the person responsible for this chaos, now tells us that he always knew that microwave pay TV technology was an inferior technology. Let me say that it was not at all clear on 28 January whether the problem with microwave technology was that it was too competitive or that it was no good. The Government's statements on this matter sometimes seem to suggest that the problem with MDS was that it was going to compete with satellite pay TV transmissions and that this could not be allowed. The Prime Minister is now trying to tell us that the reason he stepped in is that it was not any good. But if it was not any good and it was not capable of establishing a national service which could so readily be established by satellite pay TV, what was the problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has completely failed to explain to the Parliament what was the basis of the Government's concern. He told the House yesterday that satellite transmitted pay television can provide a national service. But is this correct? The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked the Prime Minister in the House today whether it is not a fact that the primary footprint for the satellite covers only four of the capital cities. Is it not a fact that the satellite does not deliver any direct service via a 60-centimetre dish to any area other than the east coast to Adelaide and Perth, that there is in fact no service except via a nine-metre dish costing around $100,000 to most of regional Queensland, to New South Wales, to South Australia, to Western Australia and to Tasmania with no coverage at all in the Northern Territory? This is the Prime Minister's national service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the persuasiveness of this claim that satellite television could offer a national service that apparently induced him to step in. Then he was asked, and he did not answer&mdash;and I think we have got to underline that point&mdash;a direct question from the Leader of the National Party concerning whether there is anything in the tender conditions that require the successful licensee to offer a national service. The answer to that question is that there is not. There is nothing in the tender conditions that require the licensee to offer a national service. So the Prime Minister has clearly misled the House on this point, and he has misrepresented once again what the situation is in relation to government telecommunications policy&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that at the conclusion of his speech the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) made the statement that we are not a government of principle. I find that very strange, quite frankly, coming from any member of the Liberal Party or the National Party of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from the State of Victoria. The honourable gentleman says that we on the Labor side have no principles. The honourable member for Goldstein walks out of the chamber and does not want to hear the very simple fact that anywhere in the State of Victoria today one can walk down any street and publicly say that the Premier of Victoria is a liar. We can say that publicly, loudly, clearly, anywhere and be totally safe from any action for libel. Why is that the case? It is because truth is always a defence to a charge of libel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria we all know that those who fly under the banner of the Australian Liberal Party have to bear the odium of that simple fact. So if people on the other side want to come into this place and make allegations that I belong to a government or a party that has no principle, just let them look at the State of Victoria; let them look at Charles Court in Western Australia; let them look at Fightback; let them look at the way they ran the campaign leading up to the election of 13 March; then let them come into this House and say to any of us who stand here that there is no principle in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a great deal of interest in this Bill. I am aware of the reputation of the honourable member for Goldstein. I understand, of course, that he is a noted academic from Monash University in the area of economics; indeed, he might well be interested to know that he lectured my son when he went through the economic faculty at Monash and graduated. I am pleased to say he is a Keynesian economist rather than the dry right wing type that the good professor tries so hard to produce there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought this was my first chance to sit back and listen to the good professor, the honourable member for Goldstein, put forth his views on where the Opposition sits on telecommunications policy. Initially he spent three minutes on this Bill. He then spent 27 minutes explaining where he says the Government is wrong. Not once did he tell us where the Opposition stands. I find this a rather strange debating tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand we have this very highly skilled academic, a professor of economics, who is highly regarded by the Opposition, who goes almost straight onto the front bench and who is put into this major debate to attack the Government's position on competition policy and telecommunications policy. He spends 27 minutes in a careful and one would say studied way and yet at the conclusion, what do we have? We still do not know where the Opposition stands on anything. I would have thought it is fairly fundamental that, if people want to be critical, they put their own proposition forward first. If the honourable ladies and gentlemen on the other side wish to come into this place and debate matters with us&mdash;and we are happy to debate them any time, anywhere, as they well know&mdash;surely they should start with a positive proposition on where they stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today at Question Time I thought the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quite clearly stated the rather simple fact that technology in this area is probably changing at a faster rate than we as politicians have the capacity to draft legislation. We are always behind the eight ball in terms of where technology is leading us. I would have thought what the Government said is quite truthful. I know that the honourable member for Goldstein did not really disagree with the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of this policy, this House should produce the best service for the country in the long term; it should not jump in quickly, pass legislation and produce a result which will need rapid change as new technology comes in down the track. That is exactly what the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) said. He said that we have to change because technology is changing. The Prime Minister clearly put that view at Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I do not fully understand the various methods by which one can beam out signals through the airwaves. I understand, for example, that the microwave system is a line of sight system. One does not have to be an Einstein to understand that if there is a hill or valley in the way of that particular type of signal it cannot be received. In the electorate of McEwen, which has a few hills here and there and some wonderful mountains as well, I have noticed that when I am using a mobile telephone&mdash;which I am told is similar technology&mdash;on many occasions the conversation I am having will be cut off as I drive down a hill. That being the case, it makes an awful lot of sense&mdash;to me at least, with my rather technologically unskilled brain&mdash;for us to look at ways of getting better technology and a better method to give more people a chance to beam in to pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are those opposite opposed to this approach? Did I hear the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Goldstein, say that those opposite are opposed to it? I ask any honourable member in this House: has anyone on the opposition side said that he or she does not want equal competition in technology? I have to say that I am a bit disappointed that the professor of economics, who has probably sat down in various theatres at Monash University and spent months lecturing young, eager students on what we mean exactly by competition in an economic sense, did not really define what he meant by competition. Is he saying that each individual type of technology capable of delivering pay TV to a house should be equal in competition terms or equal in technological terms? Where do we go with competition in this sense?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the reality is this: if I am a consumer of this product, wanting to sit at home and pay my money to buy pay TV, and if there are various technologies which will deliver a better service to me wherever I live, then I should be entitled, in competition terms, to choose the technology which best suits my purposes. Surely I should be entitled to that choice. I do not know whether the Opposition supports that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of his speech I am sure the honourable member for Goldstein left this House totally bemused as to where exactly the Opposition stands. I guess there was a real attempt to put a case against the Prime Minister and against my colleague the Minister for Communications, who is sitting at the table. There was a similar attempt to put a case against Senator Collins in the other place. But it was a rather tedious and lengthy attempt and I must say, as a lawyer, that at the end of the case I felt like shouting out, `Nolle prosequi; no case to answer, your worship.' I thought it was a rather poor attempt to mount any sort of attack on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I noticed over the last few days, in the rather heavy communications debate that has gone on here, is the Opposition's attack on the broadcasting legislation. It accepted this legislation in this House and in the Senate, and it was this legislation which gave rise to the tendering processes which have now caused so much pain and anguish. It seems to me that if people really believe in open, unlimited, laissez-faire competition&mdash;as I understand the term&mdash;there should be no restrictions on tender whatsoever. The marketplace should be told, `We have a service we want to provide. We ask you to put in your cost and your vision as to how this service can be provided and there will be no strings attached as to who can apply'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought from the viewpoint of the honourable member for Goldstein that that was free, open competition&mdash;no restrictions, no hedges, no bars. In that sense, people would not have to be Packers or Murdochs to compete for one of these licences; they would not have to have a huge merchant bank or multinational behind them somewhere. Anyone would be able put in an application and apply for a licence. The process down the track should then be that someone who was first considered for one of those licences ought to satisfy the Australian Broadcasting Commission that he or she can do the work and provide the service. That party would also have to satisfy the Trade Practices Commission that the process was not anti-competitive under the requirements of the trade practices legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there anything fundamentally wrong with any of the tenderers who tendered for the licence having paid-up capital of only $500,000, $100,000 or $500? In competitive terms, is there any reason why anyone could not have applied for that tender and, if successful, gone into the marketplace and said, `I have the right to provide this service; can I raise the money and float a company'? Could potential players not go to the market to raise the capital to deliver the service? What is wrong with that? Is that anti-competitive, or is that the most open form of competition one could possibly have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somehow or other I get the view that the honourable member for Goldstein does not like that kind of competition. It now seems he is saying that in order to get a licence one must have a sufficient capital base to put up a fair slice of cash before a tenderer can go down the track to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Trade Practices Commission. The number of potential players in the scene is reduced right away and the process is loaded in favour of the people with the big cash, who are the only ones who can play that kind of tendering game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a bit surprised by the Opposition's approach to this issue. After all, those opposite are the free enterprise people&mdash;the laissez-faire economists&mdash;who say `Let's open it up to everyone to have an equal and fair go'. But perhaps I was wrong. Maybe what I heard during the last election campaign about competition and where the Opposition stands on opening up the marketplace was a dream. Maybe the Opposition threw out its views on competition with most of Fightback and the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, I suppose this legislation is an omnibus Bill in that it is quite basic and simple in what it will do. I agree totally with the honourable member for Goldstein when he says that it is designed to foster competition in the delivery of mobile telephone systems. I certainly have a great interest in getting better facilities for mobile telephones as soon as I can. As I have already explained, there are certain parts of my electorate where, when going up and down hills and mountains, it is rather difficult to pick up a signal over the mobile telephone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will watch with interest the proposed code which will come out of the legislation. I recall my days in local government and in legal practice when I always had a fairly fundamental concern about government resuming property, by legislation, from private property owners&mdash;albeit for the good of society as a whole. I have always had some faint concern about the way governments can, through legislation such as this, say to a private owner, `Look, this Act allows us to come onto your property, take some of your land and install something on it'. Obviously, in this case it is a mechanism for beaming out a signal&mdash;probably a tower with the allied equipment on top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often private citizens feel rather threatened by bureaucracy and rather threatened by the power of governments to do this. Anyone who has served in local government, or who has been close to ordinary people in the community&mdash;as we always are on this side, although one is not too sure about those on the other side&mdash;can identify closely with their concerns. I hope the Minister can tell me when the code is prepared that we will give people the right to consultation. I hope we will give adequate consideration to their concerns as we go down this track of compulsory takeover, if you like, of their properties for the purpose of a common good with which I, for one, would not disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern that I have in these areas is the question of fair and adequate compensation. I do not think there are many members of the House, some of whom have been around politics for a long while, who have not had one constituent, with beating of breast and very heavy breathing, accuse government, be it State, federal or local, of ripping him off by a compulsory acquisition of land for some government purpose. I would ask the Minister to make sure, if we go down this track, that certainly any person in the electorate of McEwen who may have a particular parcel of land which is required for a facility will have his or her concerns properly approached by the bureaucrats concerned, that they will not be treated as just a simple cipher and that any consideration paid for the compulsory acquisition is proper and reasonable and will, in fact, include loss of future income if it is a farming area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the code which will apply under this legislation will require governments and organisations to give written notice to the occupier of intention to inspect and enter and, if they do in fact exercise their rights under the legislation, they will be required to give full restoration to the surface of the land and to the removal of material. I am pleased to see also that there is a fiat there that all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure as little damage as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As more of these towers pop up around our countryside&mdash;and I suppose all of us driving around the place have seen them popping up here, there and everywhere with their spiky little antennas sitting on top of them&mdash;we are all increasingly being inundated with concerns by many residents as to the electro-magnetic radiation aspects of these various electronic and microwave devices. I do not profess to have any simple answer. As a lawyer I am sometimes rather bemused by the technology we are now talking about, with compression and heaven only knows what else, and I am glad it is the Minister, and not me, who has to handle these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, I suppose, an increasing concern about the consequences to health of many of the electro-magnetic devices and signals now coming through our countryside. From my reading and from the research that I have been able to uncover I believe that people should not be concerned, that in fact the evidence at this stage is certainly fairly clear that electro-magnetic radiation is not as guilty as some people would like to believe and that the level of electro-magnetic radiation emissions from these mobile facilities is well within Australian standards. I am pleased to see that in fact the legislation will ensure that the Australian standards will be met in relation to all emissions from these facilities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I address some of the concerns raised by the honourable member for McEwen, particularly the land access code proposed in the legislation. It is envisaged that the land access code will address issues such as responsibility of carriers with respect to private property owners or occupiers; obligatory consultation procedures between landowners or occupiers and carriers; the possibility of carriers sharing facilities to minimise the proliferation of the infrastructure&mdash;which the honourable member referred to&mdash;recourses available to property owners or occupiers of land; and, of course, the aesthetic considerations of the towers that are springing up. The code will apply across the board to all carriers' activities in accessing land, thus giving private property owners or occupiers more safeguards than they currently have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The majority of his speech was taken up with pay television, which is not dealt with in this Bill, but I reiterate that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) again clearly enunciated the policy of the Government in Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk to the issue that he raised in relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article of today and perhaps reassure the honourable member about some of the concerns he raised about that particular article. The first paragraph of the article said that I, as Minister for Communications, had raised new doubts about the Federal Government's long-term plans for the telecommunications industry by suggesting that extra carriers may not be allowed after the industry is deregulated in 1997. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has misrepresented comments I made at the Australian Telecommunications Users Group conference yesterday about the telecommunications industry arrangements to apply after 30 June 1997. The Government announced in November 1990 that the duopoly will end on 30 June 1997. This decision stands and has not&mdash;I repeat not&mdash;been changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision is considered to provide a strong incentive to Telecom to restructure and for Optus to become established as a credible competitor. The review that I referred to in my speech is a review that has been scheduled for some time to determine the regulatory arrangements to apply after competition is opened fully in 1997. It is not a review about whether there will be open competition, but about, in fact, the nature of that competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give industry certainty about future regulatory arrangements, it is proposed to have the review well under way before the end of this Parliament's current term in 1996. The scope of the review has not been determined. It is expected to be broad ranging and cover such issues as whether any economic regulation is necessary at all, whether licensing is appropriate, and the powers, the rights and responsibilities of carriers, such as land access power and universal service obligations. This is itself not an exhaustive list. There will be full consultation with the industry during the review and we hope that the Opposition will play a very constructive part in this discussion process which will take the term of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is very proud of what it has done in terms of providing competition in telecommunications. It has introduced a regulated duopoly that expires in 1997. This model is now being reviewed by many countries, to see how they can break down their own monopolies and move towards open competition. Many South-East Asian nations are visiting us on a regular basis to have a look at the Australian model, and it is something that we can be very proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we are debating today shows another element of the competition that we have put into telecommunications. We already have Telecom and Optus operating mobile phones. The third carrier, Vodaphone, will be in operation by the end of this year. It will be a very competitive environment for mobile phones, and one that I think will be the envy of many countries. Certainly, telecommunication companies in the United States clearly say that the models the Government has put in place in Australia for competition between the two carriers, Telecom and Optus, are models that they wished they had taken on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also stress that competition is not just between the carriers. The carriers basically control the networks. Already we have a large number of resellers who are in the market providing telecommunications competition to all that equipment that hangs off the network. This is indeed one of the great policies that this Government has put in place; one that I am particularly proud of and very proud to be administering for the next term of this Government. Despite all the histrionics that go on in this place, I am sure that policy has bipartisan support and provides the most important element of competition. We see that on a daily basis with the reductions in the cost of telecommunications and reductions in the cost of telephone calls, providing the Australian consumer with the real benefit. Competition is no good unless it provides the consumer with the benefit. I am very pleased to commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I take this opportunity in the spirit of generosity of congratulating the Speaker on his appointment and you on your appointment. This is the first opportunity I have had as the member for Berowra to formally speak and to offer those pleasant remarks. But they will not be the last that I will utter on social security matters where the Australian people, particularly the elderly and the unemployed, have been so grievously let down by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 gives effect to a small number of the Government's election commitments which were announced prior to the 1993 Federal election. The Bill also mirrors some technical amendments necessary due to changes in the area of migration law. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) took the opportunity in his second reading speech to make some broad-ranging remarks about the Government's intention in relation to this legislation. It is timely to recall what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Saturday 13 March the Australian people clearly indicated that they shared the Government's belief that this nation must advance together. By advancing together not only will we build a strong economy but a fairer society that pays particular attention to the special needs of groups such as the aged and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>It is to those remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary that I intend to direct my comments in this speech tonight. I am disappointed that in the first two weeks of this Parliament we are subjected to a guillotine which constrains the debate and which ensures that there is limited time to comment on matters that I wish to raise. Few of my colleagues will have the opportunity to comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the functions of the Parliament are diminished&mdash;it is little more than a tabling office. We are also privileged to have the Parliamentary Secretary in the chamber. It seems that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who carries primary responsibility, will not deign to join us in this debate. That is another sign of the importance attached by this Government to issues affecting the elderly and the unemployed&mdash;fine words, but its actions speak louder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's speech fails to mention that there were several election commitments and promises made by this Government that have not been captured in this legislation. Indeed, some have already been jettisoned as the Government struggles with the enormous difficulty&mdash;and I admit that&mdash;of dealing with the cost of promises that it made in the knowledge of the economic circumstances of this country, and the enormous economic difficulties that we face. The fact is that the Government's promises and commitments were made in the knowledge that was before it and not given to the Australian people. Before I progress too far, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to address the special needs of the unemployed and the aged, noting:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)the comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training that the number of long-term unemployed would inevitably rise to between 400,000 and 500,000 in the next 12 to 18 months;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)the Government's failure to guarantee the extension of full Commonwealth fringe benefits to all long-term retirees beyond the remaining three months of 1992-93, even though the Prime Minister made special mention of this `promise' in his campaign policy speech;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)the Government's failure to rule out major increases in taxation and to outline a planned program of expenditure reduction to enable responsible implementation of its campaign commitments in relation to social security matters;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)further changes and tampering with the assets test for pensioners, adding further confusion and insecurity to their retirement plans; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)the need for a full and complete review of the inter-relationship between income and asset tests for better integration of the taxation and social security systems".</PARA>
<PARA>A number of comments have been made in recent days which should be of great concern to the Australian community. The principal point I want to make about the plight of the unemployed is that the Government held out during the election campaign that its policies and programs would create additional employment opportunities. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke glibly about the creation of an additional 500,000 new jobs. He was disparaging about our longer term commitment to growth in the Australian economy through significant taxation and other reform that would produce two million jobs by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately after the election the Government now wants to speak about the reality that it was unprepared to acknowledge in that campaign. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) announced that the number of long-term unemployed would rise to between 400,000 and 500,000 in the next 12 to 18 months. That is disastrous for those people who will be left in that predicament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of each period of recession from which Australia has suffered the number of long-term unemployed has remained high, and this recession will be no different. The hardship of that outcome will be faced by this country for generations. According to the Minister, where it is now unacceptable, where it is going will be even more unacceptable. They are fairly glib words. It is already clear that the Minister is trying to trade on his honesty in admitting after the election that this would be the result. Of course, he fails to be more honest and admit that this miserable position is a result of the policies of the Keating Government&mdash;a government which has been in office for nine years and whose record is one of record unemployment affecting so many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is a great pity that the Minister did not exhibit a similar degree of honesty during the election campaign when the disparate state of the Australian economy was hidden behind what can only be described as shameless lies, distortions and half-truths by Ministers. This statement he is now making is even more fatuous in light of his statement that it is reasonable to say to the long-term unemployed, `You are the loser', and put them on the scrap heap. It is a disgraceful utterance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government ought to be thoroughly condemned for corrupting its obligations and duties to the Australian people and then call them losers as the Minister has. Worse than that, having claimed that the long-term unemployed will take up a massively increased share of the total number of unemployed, the Government still has no solution to this worsening tragedy. It has no plan to reduce unemployment, no plan to effectively stimulate the economy&mdash;no idea what to do next. It is a government which has run out of ideas except for distractions, and we see an occasional grin from government members when distractions are mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking for ideas we need to go to those members who have been relegated to the backbench. These ideas seem to come from the former Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). He has said that he does not believe that we will find a solution to this problem. He was not saying that before the election. The honourable member for Bonython told us in his Evatt lecture that high levels of unemployment and increasingly high levels of long-term unemployed are a permanent feature of the Australian landscape and not just a temporary aberration produced by the pulling of the wrong economic levers. He says that we must throw more money at the problem and that we need to have a bigger social welfare program. I do not see any commitment coming from the Government to that other than the `generosity' of the programs that are now in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bonython was a senior Cabinet Minister for most of the time that this Government was in power, yet he laments this catastrophe. He was part of the responsibility. Undoubtedly, this Government will have to find more money to provide income and welfare support for the large numbers of people affected by the recession that the Government told us we had to have. That is an outcome of the Government's policies. The Government has not told us where the money will come from, but we are getting fairly clear pictures of that now after the election as government members talk about increased taxation. This is happening in the context of the Government legislating for tax reductions before the election and campaigning against anybody else who suggested there may be a case for taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reports that the Government will raise existing taxes or levy new ones. It is based upon a proper assessment that, unless the Government is prepared to reduce its expenditure in some way, it will have to address the ballooning deficit. It will be a ballooning deficit because of the social welfare commitments to the increasingly large number of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is talking about broadening sales tax, doubling Medicare levies and introducing an energy levy. There is a retraction of the policy to reduce the tax obligations of those who have a pension entitlement. All of these measures the Government is now talking about in a desperate effort to rein in the Budget which it has allowed to bolt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 this Government made a commitment to remove all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995. This promise was first released by the then Minister for Social Security as part of the Government's retirement incomes policy. It is not as if the matter passed without notice. The Government was questioned time and time again on the costing and implementation of this promise. The Government was tested on it. We were told it was not possible to give us any details of that measure until it was close to its implementation. We were fobbed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, then the Labor Party had its election launch and as part of that launch it released a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Labor Party: election 1993: policies for older Australians</EMPHASIS>. This was handed out by Labor candidates across Australia and utilised by senior Cabinet Ministers such as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) in his electorate. I have a copy of a pledge&mdash;a pledge, mind you&mdash;called, `Labor pledges new benefits for senior citizens', and the subheading, `Tax', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remove all age and service pensioners from the Tax System by 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>At the bottom of the document it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Printed and authorised by Simon Crean 6 Atherton Road Oakleigh 3166. </PARA>
<PARA>Senior Ministers were putting this out in marginal electorates to get themselves elected to this place, reliant upon a document distributed at Bankstown, in the Prime Minister's name&mdash;Labor's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Policies for older Australians</EMPHASIS>. There could not be a clearer statement under the heading Tax Reform. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor is working on details of implementing this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>Working on details of implementing! They were hidden in the cavern at Bankstown, working out how they would lie their way out of this issue after the election. That is what they were on about, working out how they were going to lie their way out of it after the election. That is exactly what we saw. After the election the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is certainly not an undertaking we have renewed and I certainly do not feel under any obligation to follow through with it.</PARA>
<PARA>How outrageous! I do not know how any Labor Party member could come into this House and hold his head up with any degree of dignity and speak about the needy, the aged, and the unemployed when Labor Party members have dealt with them like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure every Labor member that we did not go out making glib promises of things that we did not believe we could implement. We made honest statements upon which we sought to be judged, but we certainly did not make lies as policies and walk away from them within three weeks. That is what the Labor Party is about and that is its record. I want to assure members that, as the shadow Minister for social security and Parliamentary Secretary, I will not allow the Prime Minister to forget that undertaking throughout the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one promise that he makes in the future will have any credibility, when he makes a glib promise of that nature and expects to be able to get away with it. I certainly will not let his Ministers get away with it. I am sure I will gather up more evidence of Ministers, like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, making statements of that sort to their electors. I will not let his Ministers forget it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now on the path to witnessing the Government walking away from further commitments that it made in these policy documents. Another policy of the Government, blatantly exploited during the election campaign, was the promise to extend full Commonwealth fringe benefits to all long-term allowees beyond the remaining three months of 1992-93. Yet we had the Minister, in his second reading speech, introducing weasel words because what he is now suggesting is that a commitment, that in this document was so clear, is not a promise. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From April this year retirees who receive as little as one dollar per week in pension will also be eligible for the full range of Commonwealth and State provided fringe benefits for services such as hearing aids, electricity, rates and transport.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not say for three months. It did not say for the balance of 1992-93. It was held out that this was a promise. </PARA>

I do not run away from that but we did not make these promises; the Government did. The Government had the knowledge. It was privy to all the material that can be provided by Treasury and Finance. It had the calculation. It knows what the assumptions are. It can make the judgments but it wanted to deceive the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government wanted people to vote for it on the basis of a promise. It cannot walk away from those commitments. It will have either to accept the responsibility and find the resources and accept the odium that brings, or it will have to accept the judgment of every elderly person, every retiree and every allowee that its word cannot be accepted, that it will break it at the first term. The Minister said, `Some of these people are called losers, thrown on to the scrap heap'. When the Prime Minister spoke about the victory of the Labor Party being for true believers, what is he saying about the pensioners and the unemployed who, in good faith, voted for a government in the expectation that it would honour its promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have other matters. This Bill introduces changes to the pensions assets test, which will apply from 20 September this year. This issue was said to help over 40,000 non-pensioner and part-pensioner retirees at a total cost of $44 million to several portfolios. We have also seen a rash, particularly at the end of last year, of so-called cost saving measures. Some of them are most unreliable, looking at the assumptions upon which they have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government is doing increasingly is introducing a series of new anomalies between groups of people. We all agree that the assets and income testing arrangements need to be carefully targeted, to ensure that people who benefit from the provision that the Government makes to assist the needy are those who have a genuine need. We also need to ensure that the arrangements are fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members know, I will shortly be introducing a private member's Bill dealing with one aspect of this matter. But there are other areas in which these matters arise. I think it is clear that the Government will have to look very carefully at this issue of the relationship between the assets and the income tests to ensure that genuine fairness is introduced. A complete review of this inter-relationship between the two systems is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several other areas need to be addressed. In the area of social security we have the Government's treatment of unrealised capital gains, particularly in relation to shares assessed as income under the income test rather than under the assets test. This is in stark contrast to the way in which these issues are dealt with elsewhere, particularly in relation to taxation. There are areas where the Government can, I think, look legitimately at reforming the social security regime. It is a great pity that we are seeing these matters dealt with in this ad hoc way, coupled with the very clear breaking of promises to the elderly and the needy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the Minister that he ought to take on board all of the promises and commitments that the Government has made in relation to these matters. He can rest assured that I will be closely monitoring every one of them. He ought to ensure that the commitments are honoured thoroughly and properly to the benefit of those people who voted for this Government in the expectation that they would be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have supported this legislation generally. Some of the policies were ones that we had also argued for; some were not. But where the Government has a mandate from us it will have that mandate endorsed. We did not embark upon irresponsible promises in this area, and that ought to be noted very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise one other matter. I referred this Bill to a number of organisations which have an interest in social security legislation. One of them was the Australian Council of Social Service. I am grateful for the observations that it offered in relation to the Bill, and I thank it for that. I note that other organisations to whom I wrote have not had time to respond. It ought to be understood that people have only one week in which to comment on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Social Service has made some comments about the adequacy of the administrative arrangements in place between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Social Security in relation to the six-month waiting period now imposed on new migrants before they are eligible for benefits, unless of course they are refugees or obtain access under the humanitarian program. They were important qualifications, but it appears to a number of the organisations which are offering advice in this area that those people who are refugees and humanitarian applicants are not being advised of their entitlements. I hope that the Minister will take that on board and ensure that people are not being misled in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I open my remarks on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill by congratulating the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on his election to that seat and on his elevation to the position of shadow spokesperson on social security. Despite some of the comments I will make about his address, I find him to be an honourable and decent man and I am pleased to see that he has secured this position in the important social security portfolio. I know he will bring particular interests and qualities to that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I wish to take issue with some of his comments. I remind the honourable member that the election is over and that the Australian people once more placed their trust in the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and what a wise decision that was. It is very understandable why they made it. We need to remind the House of some of the commitments and promises that the coalition made coming into this election campaign. When one listens to the honourable member for Berowra one would think that those opposite had such an incredibly generous policy towards social security and the unemployed that we on this side of the House are the evil forces. We need to set the record straight because I am afraid that the honourable member for Berowra has engaged in a little bit of rewriting of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members of three major points in the coalition's policy agenda. They are very important to remember, particularly when we look at the amendment moved by the honourable member. In this amendment he is claiming that the Government has failed to address the special needs of the unemployed and the aged. Let us not forget what the Opposition proposed to do to the unemployed and the aged. First and foremost, those opposite were going to slash $10 billion from social security&mdash;and they talk about Labor not being committed to the care of the aged. In every single Budget since Labor came to power we have increased in real terms the amount of money we have spent on social security and on care for the aged&mdash;unlike the coalition's proposal to slash $10 billion. So let us not have any poppycock from the honourable member for Berowra about the great compassion that those opposite feel for the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also not forget the fundamental and major aspect of their policy platform, which was the imposition of an inequitable goods and services tax on all people in this country. What would have had a more draconian impact on the quality of life of pensioners and the unemployed than such an evil tax? It would have impacted on their quality of life and standards of living every single day. It would have affected their capacity to feed and clothe themselves and their ability to get around in the community. So let us not have any hypocrisy about the Opposition's care of the aged and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one does a detailed assessment of the Opposition's economic and social programs it becomes clear that employment would not have increased by two million as the Opposition claimed, but, as most economists have assessed, unemployment would have increased, particularly in the first three or four years of its policies. How would those opposite have reacted to that increase in unemployment? Another plank of the Opposition's program was to slash expenditure on training and assistance in labour market programs; that is how it would have cared for the unemployed. So let us treat this amendment with the contempt that it deserves because it certainly is no true reflection of the policy agenda of the coalition&mdash;the policy agenda that was so soundly rejected by the Australian people on 13 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra said that we are now intent on breaching election promises and that this legislation does not contain many election promises. He said it had a couple, but he asked what had happened to the rest. I  remind the honourable member that most income expenditure measures that governments introduce are introduced in the Budget. He should await the compilation of the Budget before he makes any further criticisms of this Government's intention to implement its election promises. This legislation sees the implementation of a number of election commitments, and I can assure the honourable member that many more will be contained in future legislation to be introduced in the Budget sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has also railed against the Government's breach of promise in relation to a couple of other measures. He made a particularly noisy claim that we will be going back on our word with regard to the extension of fringe benefits to part-pensioners. The honourable member has considerably distorted the Government's position and he has ignored our constitutional authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has committed itself to the introduction of a range of fringe benefits in areas for which it has responsibility. It is extending fringe benefits to part-pensioners from 1 April to include items such as hearing aids, the health care card, and transport on national rail lines. It does not have direct responsibility to provide pensioner discounts for services such as electricity and rates. It has already provided a compensation package to the States for the remainder of this financial year, and it is negotiating with the State governments to extend that into the next financial year. It is the responsibility of the State governments to come up with a fair and reasonable package, to recognise the real cost of these matters and to put a fair package to us. As I said, we are negotiating with them at the moment. There is no intention on the part of the Commonwealth to abrogate its promises in that area. Any statements to the contrary by the honourable member for Berowra are quite misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a strong commitment to the extension and improvement of the provision of services to our aged community, whether full or part-pensioners. Only this Government has demonstrated any real compassion for the aged. If one looks at the range of programs we have introduced over the years we have been in power, one would recognise that the fundamental plank of our social justice policy is the care of the aged&mdash;to improve their health care, income support, housing and rental assistance, transportation; to improve the full range of services that the aged require. Let that put an end to the poppycock from the honourable member for Berowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are in cognate debate, I will be concentrating my words this evening on the Social Security Amendment Bill. I would like to make some brief comments about what is contained in that Bill. Firstly, there are a number of provisions which will benefit many ordinary Australians, who I know will welcome the measures contained in that Bill. The first measure introduces an additional free area of $30 a fortnight for earned income for single recipients of jobsearch allowance and sickness allowance. For recipients with partners, the free area will rise from $30 to $50 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also adjusts the pension assets test. If a person has assets in excess of the assets value limit, the pension is reduced by only $19.50&mdash;down from $26 at the moment&mdash;for every $250 in excess assets. The Government has, therefore, taken note of the concerns expressed by the aged community about the impact of the assets test, particularly on those retired people who could be described as assets rich but income poor&mdash;a result of the declining interest rates and a consequent declining capacity on the part of those pensioners, part-pensioners and superannuants to earn sufficient income from their assets. The Government has recognised that situation and is extending and expanding the assets test to take account of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in this legislation the Government is rationalising certain ordinary waiting period provisions applicable to jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances by consolidating them under one rule. That rule will provide that an ordinary waiting period will not have to be served by a claimant if the claimant has been in receipt of income support for the previous 13 weeks. That measure has been strongly supported by the welfare community. It is also a measure strongly supported by the Australian Council of Social Service, and which it put to us some months ago. The Government picked up on and committed itself to that measure and is now introducing it through this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that one of the reasons why the Australian community supported Labor rather than the coalition in the last election was this Government's commitment to social justice, and its delivery of social justice in policy and practical terms. People knew that the Australian Labor Party had a basic commitment to justice, equity, fairness and caring for the community. They knew that only Labor would be able to implement policies based on those principles and practices. They were correct in making that judgment. With this legislation, and with the other legislation we are to debate today, this Government is putting into practical effect the promises that it has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that, through another clause in this legislation, the Government is trying to expand the opportunities for seeking part-time employment to those on unemployment benefits. At present, it is difficult for those who work part-time to be eligible for the full newstart or jobsearch allowance. One of the amendments to the legislation will allow a single recipient up to $30 per fortnight extra income before their payment is reduced. That means people can continue to have some contact with the work force, even if it is on a part-time basis, thereby maintaining their skills and improving their prospects for employment. That is another measure welcomed by the Australian Council of Social Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is helping not just those looking for work but also those who have finished their time in the work force&mdash;as demonstrated by the changes made to the assets test and the effect that will have on age pensioners. At present, to be eligible for a pension payment, people must have less than the prescribed amount of assets&mdash;currently $112,500 for a single home owner and $160,000 for a married home owner&mdash;before the asset test takes effect. Although, in effect, the rate will not increase, the maximum threshold before a person is not able to claim even a part-pension has been raised. It is expected that, initially, some 8,400 non-pensioner retirees, and a further 1,300 people presently excluded from other social security pensions on the basis of their assets, will become eligible, while a further 40,000 part-rate pensioners will also gain pension increases from this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other benefit about which we have talked is the consolidation of the waiting period provisions. That will ensure that claimants for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance will better understand what the provisions are. The provisions will become simpler to administer by the department, and clients will more easily understand what they need to do to comply with the provisions. The new provisions replace a number of existing conditions where the ordinary waiting period could be waived. Rationalising these provisions will improve incentives for recipients of those pensions to participate in casual or part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area on which I would like to briefly comment this evening relates to an issue raised in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra&mdash;it has been commented upon recently&mdash;and that is the changes to the Social Security Act relating to the treatment of shares. As a representative of a reasonably aged population in the electorate of Moreton, it has been of some concern to me that a lot of hysteria, fear and concern has been built up within the aged community about the impact of the changes that we introduced late last year to the treatment of shares on the aged population. As the honourable member for Berowra knows, the Opposition supported that legislation when it went through both Houses of this Parliament. It accepted that it was a fair measure and that it was bringing equity to the treatment of shares as compared with other forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had an orchestrated campaign by the financial planning industry in this country about the impact of this measure to build up as much fear and phobia as possible amongst the aged community. It has been a disgraceful campaign and adds further evidence to that which has been stated in this House by me and other speakers about some of the motives of the financial planning industry, their experience and what they are actually trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial planning groups, or some people in the financial planning industry&mdash;I should make that distinction, because not all financial planners are engaged in this plan&mdash;have seen that their income will be potentially cut by some pensioners getting out of the shares area and moving into other forms of investment. There is nothing that motivates people more than the possibility that they might lose a bit of income, particularly from a gravy train that they perceive pensioners to be. So some people in the financial planning industry have decided to orchestrate a massive campaign around this country which has put a lot of fear into the hearts and minds of many aged people. They have been distorting the true impact of the shares measure and have created a lot of anxiety. I think they should be ashamed of themselves for engaging in that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) has been involved in trying to explain in a reasonable and rational way to pensioners and aged care groups the true impact of this legislation. He knows, as I know, that none of the fears and phobias that pensioner groups have about this legislation will come to pass. We are bringing in equal treatment for shares and other forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long, people who had their assets in the shape of shares were given very favourable treatment whereas pensioners that did not engage in speculative action through shares but had other forms of investment were having all of their real value counted. Shares were not being counted. But there is no difference. In fact, there is probably a more favourable benefit in owning shares as compared with other investments because people can realise the real value of their shares almost instantly whereas with many other investments they cannot. The honourable member for Berowra well knows that pensioners who own shares are able to realise the real value of those shares almost instantly and that their real asset value should be counted at their current value and not at their value when first purchased, which could have been many years ago. It is unfair to treat shares differently from other forms of investment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in this debate on the Social Security Amendment Bill and, as it is a cognate debate, also the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. I say to the honourable member for Moreton, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) and others that what Labor was about with its disguised mechanism of last year&mdash;which is now codified in legislation and, after review, we quite properly seek to repeal under the good submission of my colleague the honourable member for Berowra&mdash;was a notional capital gains tax. These proposals were going to apply to pensioners after 30 September this year. It is a notional capital gains tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment&mdash;I have no argument&mdash;dividends from shares held by pensioners are taken into account, as honourable members agree, in the pension and incomes test. But buried in the small print&mdash;it is the thin end of the wedge&mdash;is the possibility of pensioners not trading on the stock exchange in the course of any particular calendar year but holding shares purchased some time ago losing their pension and being hit by a notional capital gains tax if the value of those shares went up after 30 September. That is a pernicious piece of legislation and is striking down the very core of freehold title, in one sense, and the ownership and encouragement to own shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After our careful review, Labor has now been fully exposed: the legislation is about a notional capital gains tax to apply initially to pensioners holding&mdash;not trading and not acting as speculators&mdash;their portfolios. Because share markets tend to go up and down&mdash;Westpac shares and the like go up and down&mdash;there will be a form of notional capital gains tax. It would be interesting to know how much capital gains tax would be payable in respect of trading in the notorious Westpac shares. In the public interest, I think that is a fair and legitimate question to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon, in the Senate, will provide more detailed comment, discussion and debate on the assets test aspects of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which my colleague the honourable member for Berowra has handled very effectively in this House. The coalition will not be opposing the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill in the House of Representatives. The Bill seeks to vary the service pension assets test by moderating its application. It also alters significantly the eligibilities and certain entitlements of our peacekeepers in Cambodia, Yugoslavia and Somalia. I will deal with each of those in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Cambodia, there is now a beyond border authorisation of some 50 kilometres into Laos and Thailand. In many ways history is repeating itself. In one sense, what set out as a limited exercise in peacekeeping to Cambodia and Cambodia only obviously now involves an extended activity across border. Given the fluid nature of some of those borders in that part of Asia and South-East Asia, it is a practical extension and one which the coalition accepts. However, I warn that the security conditions facing all Australians in Cambodia&mdash;not only the peacekeepers and the diplomatic staff but also non-government officers, some of whom have been there many years, and those who have arrived in more recent times at places such as Siem Reap near Angkor Wat and elsewhere&mdash;have deteriorated in recent weeks following the withdrawal of the Khmer Rouge from its headquarters in Phnom Penh and its more strident and shocking activity most recently in derailing and mining a section of the railway line in Cambodia. There is not much operational railway line in Cambodia. There is a little bit less now; the Khmer Rouge has progressively blown up sections of it. Worse still, those escaping from the wreckage of the derailed train were attacked by machine-gun fire and rocket fire in classic Khmer Rouge style of the worst kind about which we learnt in the five years of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime of yesteryear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is year zero activity of the worst kind. In Cambodia we have some very brave peace-keepers carrying out their jobs in very difficult circumstances. I note the additional commitment of 100 extra personnel and helicopters. I understand the personnel will be covered by the clauses in this legislation, as are the other peacekeepers, and that they will receive full eligibility under the declaration of operational area for Cambodia. I wish all Australians in Cambodia, and in the areas around the borders in Laos and Thailand, safety and well being during this critical period leading up to and beyond the election, and I hope for their earliest possible return. I hope the election will be able to be held against the odds, but I warn that it is a very delicate situation and one which the Federal Government must continually and closely monitor in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to part 4 of the Bill, which relates to the area previously known as Yugoslavia. Atrocities have clearly been committed by Croats, Muslims and Serbs almost every day and night in very sad circumstances in this civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a bitter pill for those involved that some 75 years after the war to end all wars&mdash;a description of World War I&mdash;that part of the world from which World War I arguably originated is at war again. On this occasion there is probably more blood being shed in a horrific way in the area previously known as Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House provides for an operational area declaration for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to pick up the service of ADF personnel who are serving with United Nations forces, and that will constitute qualifying service. That is as it should be, and I certainly support it. This is a rare opportunity for this Parliament to make direct comment with regard to that conflict. I equally support and hope for the application of a workable early cease-fire as a result of negotiations that have taken place. It is to be hoped that the parties can reach a conclusion that will allow safe haven areas to be established, for the killing to be stopped and for a resolution of the other matters without the loss of additional bloodshed, of human life and without the involvement of surrounding countries in a way which could deteriorate very rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have said that we should not say a great deal about this; that we should be absolutely even-handed in our comments. I cannot be even-handed in looking at that horrific conflict. We have to ask who started it, in the light of what has happened in the last year or two, and I particularly have to note the role of the Serbs. The sooner it all ends and a sustainable cease-fire is imposed, the better. That part of the legislation is supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Government policy to be even-handed in a related part of the world, and I refer to the Middle East&mdash;to the Israel and Arab equation. The Middle East is watching developments and is very disappointed with the treatment of Muslims in Yugoslavia. How even-handed is it for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to be making representations to Asian countries on behalf of Israel in relation to matters various? There are legitimate questions to ask about how even-handed that type of activity is. These are matters that have to be assessed very carefully. I am concerned for the Israeli deportees to Southern Lebanon. Recently, I had the opportunity of meeting the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Israeli Government. I make no apology for having expressed my concerns to him in a brief and informal meeting. This is an area of the world that is extremely volatile and in which Australia has legitimate national interests, which I will always seek to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always open to gaining more knowledge of the trading opportunities in these areas in my other capacity as shadow Minister for trade. I take this opportunity to reveal to the House that in the winter recess I plan to visit the following countries, schedule commitments permitting, in this order: Japan, China, Tibet, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. I shall make particular reference to trading opportunities, especially for the wool industry and Australian manufactured goods. I will be visiting China with a number of other National Party colleagues as part of a National Party delegation exploring those trade opportunities and ways and means of accelerating the wool pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to another part of the Bill, and I refer to Somalia. Australia's commitment has been very successful. It involves principally the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. The legislation declares Somalia as an operational area, and the ADF personnel serving with the UN in Somalia will have their service regarded as qualifying service. I welcome that. I salute the work of the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment&mdash;my old unit&mdash;in Somalia. I am concerned to learn that during the course of that commitment there have been over 30 accidental discharges of weapons. This would seem to be an unusually high number. It reflects, perhaps, the security of patrolling, necessitating those patrols to be conducted with safety catches off. It might also be an outcome of lack of training budgets over a period of time. Whatever the real reason, that is an unacceptably high level. But when we look at the commitment given by the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, and by the related personnel from the Australian Defence Force in Somalia, including those involved in the support roles of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, I have nothing but praise for the overall activity, and the coalition supports that section of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is not opposed by the coalition. It does ease the burden of the assets test and does provide for our peacekeeping forces in Cambodia, Yugoslavia and Somalia. Australia also has peacekeepers in Pakistan, whom I hope to see as part of my visit to the Middle East. We also have peacekeepers in the Sahara Desert and in part of Israel. I say to all our peacekeepers, keep up the good work and we hope that you return safely to Australia; you now have the confidence and knowledge that that service is recognised as operational in terms of veterans legislation and related legislation, and that is as it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill go some way towards ensuring that some of the promises that the Federal Government made prior to the election on 13 March are put in place. While the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) did make some disingenuous comments about the nature of these Bills and the extent to which they are producing a response in the community, I would point out that the electorate of Richmond has a high level of unemployed, plus a high number of aged people and people with veterans pensions. The proposals in these Bills are the things about which these people lobbied my office prior to 13 March, and they are looking forward to having them passed through this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes in the Social Security Amendment Bill&mdash;both the increase in the additional free area for the recipients and the reduction in the waiting period&mdash;are matters which, although not crucial, certainly go a long way towards helping people who are on unemployment benefits or social security of some sort remain on their feet. Unfortunately, I have to admit there is a high level of unemployment in my area. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) so aptly pointed out, these benefits help these people to keep in contact with the work force so that, when the economy does pick up and the opportunities are there, they will not be out of touch and will have the skills to step straight into a job. I do commend the local councils in the electorate of Richmond, with its present unemployment situation, for the work that is being done there through the capital works program money which is being used to create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is also of very significant interest to me and to many of the veterans in my electorate. The portfolio Bill gives effect to the Government's election promise to reduce that assets test withdrawal rate from $104 to $78 per annum for each $1,000 above the assets test threshold. This will increase the amount of assets that a person will be able to have and still qualify for payment of some service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also extends the benefits under the veterans affairs legislation to a number of Defence Force personnel serving with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Somalia and in areas comprising the former Yugoslavia. The Bill will provide that such service will be regarded as operational and qualifying service. The Bill includes an amendment to extend operational service in Cambodia to areas in Laos and Thailand that are no more than 50 kilometres from the border with Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the changes designating Somalia and the area comprising the former Yugoslavia as operational areas, the Bill contains consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Public Service Act 1922. These amendments will ensure that income tax concessions on certain Commonwealth employees compensation payments, and certain conditions of appointment and employment in the Australian Public Service, apply to members of the Australian defence forces who serve or have served in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging to the many veterans in my electorate to once again see that it is a Labor Government that is prepared to make these changes and to listen to what they have to say about veterans needs and in turn act upon their suggestions. These amendments mean that many veterans with assets above the assets threshold will either get more veterans entitlements or will qualify for the very first time. It is an appropriate response, I feel, to the needs of the veterans community at this time of very low interest rates. </PARA>

I might point out to the House a small amount of history on this sinking. The ship was steaming north from Sydney on her second voyage to New Guinea as a hospital ship. On board were some 75 merchant navy crew, the ship's army medical staff, comprising eight officers, 12 nurses, and another 45 other ranks, and 192 members of the 2/12 Field Ambulance. The latter troops were passengers travelling to New Guinea to set up medical units in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the pre-dawn of the third day of that voyage north, whilst fully illuminated in accordance with the Geneva convention, a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-177 struck the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centaur</EMPHASIS> on its portside near its oil bunkers. A tremendous explosion rocked the ship and fire broke out. Most of the personnel at that time of the morning were sleeping and many were trapped when the ship foundered. Fewer than 100 found themselves floating on the surface when the ship disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sunk in just a matter of minutes, and many of the people on board went down with the ship.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had the privilege of travelling to Somalia with the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), Senator David MacGibbon and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). The Australian Defence Force has restored some order to Somalia and, in the process, earned the respect of the Somali people. I saw this first hand when visiting an orphanage in Baidoa where CARE Australia's acting team leader, Anne Morris, described the changes brought about by the presence of the Australian troops as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Baidoa is now a city of life instead of a city of death.</PARA>

The people there do have hope for their future, but for many months they felt lost and did not have direction. They have been able to achieve that with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force, which certainly deserves our commendation. The Australian troops have proved themselves to be a professional force, although I was somewhat disturbed to hear reports of a lack of coordination by the United Nations of the initial relief efforts. To some extent there was evidence of that still going on when I was there just one month ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now some civil order in Somalia, but there remains no civil infrastructure. Whilst this Parliament has at times been described as containing a `rabble', if I could use that term, the Somali parliament building is itself rubble&mdash;a monument to the very hard task that country faces in its return to order. With the efforts of the Australian Defence Force and other personnel in that area there is certainly some hope and the people are looking forward to growth. This Government has, at the same time, wisely decided to stick to the timetable for the return of our troops. Some have returned home already; the rest will return home in a very short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also includes an amendment to extend operational service in Cambodia to areas in Laos and Thailand that are not more than 50 kilometres from the border with Cambodia. I commend this Government's clear commitment to the peace process in Cambodia and join with my colleague, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who made similar comments. Australia's contribution to the establishment of a means to conduct democratic elections has been acknowledged around the world and certainly heralds a new age of Australian diplomacy. This new diplomacy is not the manifestation of some quasi-British outpost; it is work that reflects Australia's position in the region&mdash;our regional priorities. It reflects our concern for our neighbours and our strengths as a nation ready to embark on its own course as a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial implications of the Government's promise to reduce the assets test withdrawal rate amounts to some $6.5 million in 1993-94 and $8.3 million in 1995-96. The cost of providing the benefits for operational service in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia over the next three years are negligible, and the financial impact of this decision will not be very significant for the compensation component of the benefit. This is because the total number of service personnel involved in the area is relatively small. In relation to the provision of service pension benefits, virtually no costs will be incurred until these service personnel reach retirement age. There are no additional costs associated with the proposal to extend the area of operational service in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents, particularly the veterans, are very pleased to express their gratitude for the extension of the fringe benefits assets test.

I have no problem with the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) giving his Government a pat on the back for its actions in respect of the assets test, but it reflects on the unrealised capital gains on pensioners' share portfolios which not only impinges on this matter but also impinges to some extent on the Social Security Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill we are debating concurrently tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I said in a debate here previously, the Government has got this completely wrong. It is totally beyond my comprehension that the Government cannot see that. To argue on some basis that it is consistent with the treatment of something else may be technically correct, but clearly the effect of this is disastrous for people who have shares. For instance, I do not know how a pensioner will live on a reduced pension in a situation where this mechanism applies. It is simply beyond my comprehension. Nobody has explained to me, or to anyone else, it seems, what pensioners will do for their weekly groceries when their pension is reduced. Do they take their share scrip down to the supermarket with them and say, `I'm sorry, I don't have any cash but my shares increased in value last year under this formula'&mdash;however it applies? It is beyond my comprehension. </PARA>

I have just finished reading a book about the British role in the fall of Singapore. A lot of British soldiers died there. They defended the island, in the case of some units, to the last man.

Many Australians died defending Singapore.</PARA></TALK.START>

They treated our Australian prisoners of war deplorably. The books that I have read on it brought tears to my eyes; there is no other way to describe it.

But the Japanese Government has never made reparation. It has never apologised for what it did to Australian prisoners of war, most of whom became prisoners of war after the fall of Singapore, which I think was on 15 February 1942. There has never been an apology. There has never been any indication from the Japanese Government of what it did between 1942 and 1944 to Australian, British, Dutch and, indeed, Thai nationals&mdash;never any acknowledgment, never any proper reparations.

They are not a big population these days; they are a diminishing population. There are 40,000 Vietnam veterans still alive in Australia&mdash;a significant number&mdash;and we are now, as has been noted tonight, giving veteran status to those who have served on various peacekeeping forces.

It is very difficult for the UN to operate in those circumstances, not the least reason being that there is a full-scale civil war going on in Bosnia, as there is in Somalia, and the job of the United Nations in distributing aid is made very difficult because of that. So I would not be too harsh in my criticism of the UN.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the spirit of the cognate debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, I want to make some comments about the Government's quite extraordinary decision to include unrealised capital gain in the pensioner income test. It is perfectly reasonable to include the value of shares in an assets test. Indeed, that happens, and so also should any capital gain be included in that assets test, but most observers regard it as absolutely unconscionable to include in an income test capital gain which may or may not ever actually be realised. Those who have their pensions cut as a result of these new provisions will not be able to access their unrealised capital gain to meet their day-to-day expenses, pay rent, buy groceries or clothing. One simply cannot live on unrealised income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also widespread criticism that the Government has decided to arbitrarily value all shares as at a predetermined date rather than recognise their real purchase cost. This decision means that many pensioners will be assessed as having received a capital gain when, in reality, the value of their share portfolio could actually be lower than its purchase price. The Government also fails to take into account any administrative costs associated with maintaining a share portfolio. The Government introduced deeming provisions in an attempt to maximise pensioners' income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security: if the Government really believes that, why on earth does it now introduce measures which will reduce pensioners' actual incomes by encouraging them&mdash;indeed, forcing many pensioners&mdash;to actually dispose of their shares? They may even be required to dispose of their shares at a capital loss, putting them at an increasing disadvantage personally, resulting in a greater dependence on our nation's welfare system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and the Parliamentary Secretary replied. A number of the excuses that he put up for this quite indefensible action seemed to me to be extraordinary. The first was:  it is designed to simplify the social security income test. How on earth can the Parliamentary Secretary justify that?  The administration of this new system is extremely complex. It will involve thousands of calculations and the employment of scores of extra bureaucrats. If that is the way the Government intends to simplify the system, it has certainly got the numbers wrong. The Parliamentary Secretary also says the test is fairer. What is fair about this particular system?  The capital gain on shares is to be taken into account, but a multi-million dollar house on the North Shore of Sydney with enormous unrealised capital gain is not taken into account. Shares only have been singled out for this unfair treatment. The test will be made more unfair, not fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then goes on to say that unrealised capital gain on shares reduces the real need of a person for social security assistance. What absolute rubbish. People cannot live on unrealised capital gain, they cannot buy food with unrealised capital gain. Yet under this Government they are required to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he said that the reduction in the pension by the Government will be offset by the extension of eligibility to fringe benefits. But that is available to everyone, irrespective of whether they have shares. So in no way is that compensation for this particular group of people. The Government's action is unjust.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are having yet another in the series of debates that we have had in this House over the last couple of years relating to the potential of the shipping industry to pollute the sea. As has been the case with similar legislation in the past few years, the Opposition will support the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of this debate it is worth making the point that in the life of the last Parliament the Opposition, without exception, supported all reasonable endeavours by this Government to do the right thing to protect our maritime environment and to ensure that potential damage and the costs involved can be minimised. All honourable members would recognise the potential for damage if an accident were to happen at sea in which a large quantity of oil was lost and that oil floated around in the ocean until such time as it either destroyed sea life or washed up on the coast and destroyed the coastal life and the potential tourism income generated by that coastal life. This Bill is part of the process of trying to correct the potential losses of a ship disappearing and the oil spilling into the ocean and doing tremendous damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a number of attempts over the years to minimise potential damage. One that immediately springs to mind and has been brought to my attention in the last few days was the Government's legislation for compulsory pilotage through the Great Barrier Reef. The Opposition supported that legislation. Indeed I spoke, and the then honourable member for Pearce, Fred Chaney, also spoke as our shadow Minister for the environment at the time, supporting the legislation. That legislation would have added costs to the operation of ships through that part of the world, but we supported it and the industry supported it because we recognised the importance of ensuring that everything possible was done to protect from any damage one of Australia's greatest natural assets, namely, our Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of that legislation is now well and truly a part of life. Now, all ships that travel through the Great Barrier Reef have a pilot on board; somebody who is expert in the ways of the Great Barrier Reef, who understands the ins and outs and can skilfully steer those ships through the reef. As a result, we have not had any accidents and, hopefully, that will be the case in future. The Opposition supported that initiative at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days we have been urging the Government to do whatever it can to investigate every possibility of ships avoiding passage through the reef. A number of arguments suggest that the Great Barrier Reef is the safest way for ships to get from the north to the south of the east coast of Australia and that putting ships outside the reef places them in greater danger because, in many instances, the waters are uncharted and the seas more dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The barrier reef itself is a very safe place to travel through, as long as one knows one's way and is careful and diligent. Putting ships through that passage can be much safer than putting them outside the reef where they have to travel in more dangerous waters. Also, the currents and winds that operate in that part of the world are such that if a ship did go down outside the reef, the oil would be carried onto the reef and probably cover a larger section of the reef than would otherwise have been the case had the ship gone down inside the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst old salts argue to maintain shipping passage through the reef, in recent weeks I have been urging the Government to look at every possibility of taking ships outside the reef if it can be proved that this would make it safer and reduce the risk to our Great Barrier Reef. At the same time, I have been urging the Government to ensure that we have the speediest and the most effective means of dealing with any accidents that may occur not only in the Great Barrier Reef but anywhere around Australia's very large coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has a number of depots around Australia in various port authorities where there is on-site equipment to deal with oil spills. However, it is questionable whether we can deal with a major oil spill regardless of the equipment located at various destinations around Australia. So in the last few weeks I have been calling on the Government to re-evaluate the potential damage and our ability to respond to any eventuality on the Australian coastline if a ship were to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All honourable members would remember the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> that went down off the west coast of Australia not so long ago. On that occasion we were just lucky. On other occasions the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who will shortly speak in this debate, has spoken about the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>. When that ship sank we were very lucky indeed. The oil broke up and evaporated, the winds were favourable and the oil did not blow onto the coast. Generally speaking, on that occasion we got off very lightly. But had the circumstances been different a major slice of our western coastline would have been damaged, which would have caused all Australians a great deal of concern. So on the basis that we have been lucky to date, we cannot presume that we will be lucky forever. It is important for this Government to ensure that we have the best possible means of responding in the best possible fashion to very large oil spills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also supported legislation that went through in the life of the last Parliament dealing with such things as the possibility of oil being discharged into the ocean, what quantities of oil can be mixed with water and so forth. We also supported legislation relating to the dumping of ballast water in Australian waters and the need to improve the various means by which ships get rid of their ballast water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while remembering that ships often come to Australia empty in order to pick up a load and, in order to travel safely and efficiently, they fill their holds with sea water. That helps the ships to travel properly. On many occasions they pick up that sea water in an Asian port. When they get to Australia they deposit their ballast, and along with it various organisms, sea life and so forth. There has been evidence to suggest that this is having a damaging effect on some aspects of our marine life, and legislation that came through this House during the last Parliament designed to minimise the potential damage was also supported by the coalition on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the coalition has been keen to support these types of responsible legislation, so too has the Australian shipping industry. I have found that on matters such as this our maritime industry has in the past acted, and is now acting, in a most responsible fashion. Indeed, in many cases it has initiated the measures taken over the last few years to minimise potential damage. Whilst congratulating the Government and ourselves for being prepared to initiate and support these types of measures, it is also important to recognise the role of the maritime industries in Australia that have also participated in a very responsible way in dealing with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth our while to remember that many places in Australia could be damaged by an oil spill&mdash;not just the Great Barrier Reef. We often hear people&mdash;and I am probably as guilty as anybody else&mdash;talking about the potential damage that can occur to Australia as a result of a large tanker spilling its oil into the sea. We often relate that potential experience to the Great Barrier Reef. But it is not just the Great Barrier Reef that tankers travel through and where serious damage can occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of Port Phillip Bay&mdash;a rather insular maritime environment which is not flushed out by the ocean on a daily basis. Indeed, if an accident were to occur in Port Phillip Bay it would be very difficult to deal with because those waters are not replenished from the ocean on a regular basis. So an accident in Port Phillip Bay would be of a very serious magnitude to the economy of that part of Australia and also of course to the maritime environment. Let us not fall into the trap of using examples relating only to the Great Barrier Reef when we talk of the possibility of damage to the ocean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is designed to deal with some of the financial aspects of an oil spill. This legislation establishes a fund to insure against the costs related to an oil spill in our waters. Of course, when there is an accident at sea and a tanker goes down, the costs involved in cleaning up the mess are horrific. Many millions of dollars are involved in mopping up the oil, trying to make it disperse and trying to get rid of it so that it does not affect our maritime environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also another cost involved in this type of accident which occurs in the form of losses in potential revenue by people affected by that spill. For example, if an accident were to occur on the Great Barrier Reef, tourist operators would obviously experience financial loss as a result of the bad publicity generated by the oil spill. Under this proposal, those people would be able to claim&mdash;for the first time as far as I can recall&mdash;against this insurance fund which is being set up to deal with the potential loss of revenue that they might experience as a result of an oil tanker breaking up and spilling its oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation should be welcomed by tourist operators, fishermen and other people who draw their income, in one form of another, from a maritime area which may be damaged as a result of an oil spill. This is good legislation, firstly, because it does that for the first time. Secondly, the insurance fund that Australia is participating in as a result of the implementation of this legislation also covers Australia for the cost of recovering the oil that is lost at sea and for the cost of cleaning up the mess. So there are two sides to this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the honourable member for Kooyong has come into the House because he has something that will be quite interesting to the House which I will mention in a few moments. This legislation covers not only the cost of cleaning up the damage but also any financial losses that are incurred by third parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This insurance fund will be run through the International Maritime Organisation and Australia will have a representative on the council. The premiums will be paid by oil companies receiving approximately 150,000 tonnes or more of oil per annum. These companies will pay the premiums and, if my memory serves me correctly, that will total about $95,000 for Australia this year. However, in the second year it will increase to about $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nine companies in Australia import more than 150,000 tonnes of oil per annum. Those companies have been acting in a voluntary scheme to insure against the sorts of losses and costs that I have already referred to. On their own volition, these nine companies have been participating in this voluntary scheme by paying premiums to insure against any possible losses. That scheme will be wound up in February of next year. This legislation is before the House today to ensure that Australia and Australian oil companies are not left in the position of having no insurance against the cost of oil spills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few moments ago I mentioned that that noted environmentalist, the honourable member for Kooyong, had come into the House. He has a particular interest in this debate because he has a world-first which I am sure he would like to speak about. He has demonstrated to me a product which can clean up&mdash;in an unbelievable way&mdash;any oil spilled in water. I am sure that if the opportunity is made available to him he will speak on it; but I have not seen anything like it in my life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He would like to demonstrate it. Indeed, if he had the equipment here we could immediately go through the process in a Barry Jones-style demonstration in the House. But he did demonstrate this product for me in his office the other day. When certain material is put on top of oil floating on water it literally lifts the oil out, leaving none in the water. It is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life and unless I had seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it. I think the honourable member for Kooyong is onto a winner. I am sure that he will not have to depend upon his parliamentary superannuation to sustain him in a proper fashion in his post-political career because if he goes out and markets this product he will be a very wealthy man indeed. I hope that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and other people with an interest in this area will take up the opportunity, as I did last week, of seeing the honourable member for Kooyong in action demonstrating his world-first product. I hope that this free plug bears some fruit for the honourable member for Kooyong.</PARA></TALK.START>

Its effectiveness will not be believed until it is seen first-hand. I am sure that, with his entrepreneurial skills, the honourable member for Kooyong will make it a very successful product indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the industry for being involved in this voluntary scheme. The oil companies have shown themselves to be good citizens in the way they have involved themselves in that scheme and in the way in which they are prepared to participate in this compulsory scheme the Government is now establishing through legislation. The Opposition will support the Bill for those reasons. We support it because we honestly take a sincere interest in doing everything we can to ensure that our maritime environment is as safe as possible for those who travel in it; that the risks of damage occurring are minimised; and that, if damage does occur, the cost to this nation is as minimal as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation fits within those guidelines and the Opposition is very happy to support it. Our shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), will also be speaking in this debate. For that reason, I will sit down now and give her sufficient time to speak. The Opposition supports this legislation because it protects our marine environment in one way or the other. For that reason we are happy to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on these Bills, and I am also pleased to learn that the Opposition will be supporting them. Indeed, it could hardly do otherwise. I make the point that on many of the shipping measures that have been in this House there has been bipartisan support. I only wish that bipartisan support could extend as far as cabotage, but maybe that would be pushing my luck a little too far. As has been said, the purpose of these Bills is to give effect to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution and the protocols of 1976 and 1992 amending the fund convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill will require persons who receive in Australia, or in a Territory of Australia, by sea more than 150,000 tonnes of crude oil or fuel oil in a calendar year to contribute to a fund established under the fund convention. The Bill distinguishes between the two funds, the 1971 fund and the protocol of the 1992 fund established by the fund convention after it was further amended by the 1992 protocol. Both the 1971 fund and the 1992 fund will pay compensation for pollution caused by oil where the pollution resulted from an incident involving one or more ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the 1971 fund will indemnify shipowners for a part of their liability to pay compensation for oil pollution under the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is required to provide information to the Director of the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, which is a United Kingdom based organisation established to manage the compensation regime, about persons who receive crude oil or fuel oil in Australia by sea, and the quantities received, in order to determine the liability of these persons to make contributions to the fund. Regulations may be made under the proposed Act to require persons who receive crude oil or fuel oil to provide information and documentation to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other three Bills impose contributions required to be made by the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long Australia has regarded itself as isolated from major oil spills. I put to this House that the fact that the Australian coastline has not been polluted has been through good luck rather than good planning or good management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was mentioned by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) the pollution incident involving the tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast in 1991 clearly demonstrated that Australia cannot be considered immune from large tanker spills. Had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> been a total loss&mdash;and as he so rightly said, it was just good luck that there was not a massive loss&mdash;the damage claim could easily have exceeded existing compensation limits. Had the oil spill been as great as its potential, the crayfishing industry in the whole of Western Australia could have been wiped out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the condition of many foreign flagships operating off the Australian coastline, I believe it is not a case of if but when the Australian coastline will be impacted by a major oil spill. Given the fact that most of the oil transported to Australia travels through our major tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef, it should be a matter of concern to all Australians. It is indeed a matter of concern to most Australians except, it appears, the environmental movement. During the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that led to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, despite being contacted personally by me&mdash;I contacted every major environmental group in Australia and invited each to put in a submission&mdash;no environmental group thought oil pollution was worthy of its attention. The environmentalists think there is more publicity in hugging a few gum trees than there is in seriously facing up to the two major environmental pollution problems of Australia: land degradation and the threat to the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the committee of inquiry into ship safety were amazed at the condition of many foreign flagships coming to Australia. I hope, as a matter of urgency, the Government adopts the recommendations contained in that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report has been hailed throughout the world as a landmark report but, if there was a shortcoming in the report, it was that, purely because of time constraints, there was not enough attention paid to oil carriers. That committee has been re-formed, under the able chairmanship of my friend and colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who is with us here. I happen to have also scored a place on the new committee. We have our first meeting tomorrow. Now that the committee has been re-formed with that high powered membership, I will be pushing for a further inquiry dealing just with oil tankers and oil pollution. There have been several seminars on this topic over recent years but no full inquiry. A full inquiry into oil tankers and oil spills is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with considerable interest to what the preceding speaker, the honourable member for Hume, said about ships travelling inside or outside the Great Barrier Reef. I am very much in favour of travelling inside the reef, for the very reasons that he mentioned. It is a safer passage. It is a well designated passage, and the sea is much calmer. That passage is also much cheaper. I worry that, if the ships went outside the reef, they would be in more uncharted waters. They would be in rougher waters and if there was an accident I think there would be greater environmental damage done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often people stand up in this House and say that there is compulsory pilotage through the Great Barrier Reef. There is only compulsory pilotage through part of the Great Barrier Reef, and that is the very northern part. There is no compulsory pilotage through the main tourist part at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The condition of many ships visiting Australia is an international disgrace: huge tankers, with poorly trained crews, lack of adequate language communication between bridge and rating&mdash;this is an issue that many people say was a cause of the Shetland disaster late last year&mdash;underpaid and undertrained crews. There are also too many greedy profiteers who see nothing wrong with putting our pristine coastline at risk in the never ending search for the quick dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation, but the answer to oil pollution is not compensation. How could the farmers or the tourist industry of the Shetlands ever be compensated for what happened there late last year? There must be much stricter control of shipping, much tighter inspections, much better training, better policed international conventions, all as recommended in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While ever there is a human factor, there will also be the threat of mishaps. So it is important when these mishaps happen that there be compensation. Just as the adoption of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report will place Australia at the forefront of securing safe shipping, the adoption of these Bills before the House will also place Australia in the international forefront of providing compensation for damages caused by oil pollution from tankers. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following from this side my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), I support this legislation. However, I would like to point out that, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said, compensation is not the answer when our environment is under threat. Our environment certainly is under threat from the oil tankers that circumnavigate Australia and the globe. Australia cannot compare with other waters, for instance the Mediterranean and the Middle East seas, with the amount of oil that is shipped, but certainly there is a considerable amount that goes past what are incredibly fragile and sensitive areas of our coastline. I read from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transport of hydrocarbons in the oil and gas industry</EMPHASIS> the extent of this. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1986-87&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>these are the most recent figures I could find&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">domestic coastal shipping carried approximately 17 million tonnes of crude and refined petroleum products around Australia. Coastal shipping carried the third largest share of hydrocarbons and is responsible for hauling tonnages nearly five times greater than those handled by rail.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a considerable tonnage going around our shores. Since World War II the size of tankers has grown considerably. At the end of World War II tankers were carrying about 10,000 dead weight tonnes; that is now up to 300,000 dead weight tonnes. If we think of the size of those tankers, what would happen to our coastline if there were an accident? We speak of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> and the damage that it did to the Alaskan coastline, but that only let out 36,000 tonnes of crude oil. So we can imagine the damage that one of these very large tankers, coming down the Australian coastline with the amount of oil that they carry, would do to our beaches, our mangroves and our reef&mdash;a particularly sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This danger is not just remote but very real. Accidents in Australian waters are rare, but they do happen. In a seven-year period between 1981 and 1987, there were 24 shipping accidents. Of those, 12 were groundings and seven were as a result of collisions. These incidents, fortunately, did not happen to oil tankers, but the potential for enormous damage was there. There was a warning when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> disaster took place off the Western Australian coast. It is interesting that, when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> started to break up, its bow&mdash;which was so rusted&mdash;actually fell off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil fleet that is currently sailing around the world is ageing. The average age of a very large crude oil tanker is 13.2 years. On the estimates, no tanker should be allowed to sail after 15 years, yet here we have these very large oil tankers circumnavigating the globe with an average age of 13.2 years&mdash;some being considerably older than that. So there is enormous potential for an accident to happen off our coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition naturally supports this Bill. It would support anything that gives compensation for an accident. But compensation is not the answer. The Bill limits compensation to half a billion dollars. The cost of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> disaster was $1 billion. That gives us an idea of the mess we could find ourselves in. That amount was just for the clean-up. When we get economic compensation and everything else, that money is by far exceeded. So there is no way that the compensation fund could cope with a massive oil disaster, although it would cover small ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all appreciate the effect of a small tanker disaster on the reef or on beaches, but there is also the potential effect of a disaster on the reputation of the reef. The reef at the moment supports a $1.6 billion tourist industry. Any damage or any suggestion of damage to the reef will keep away some of those tourists. The honourable member for Throsby, who followed the honourable member for Hume, referred to some consideration being given to shipping outside the reef. Both honourable members said that, because of a number of factors, this was perhaps not as favourable an idea as it may at first seem: it is calmer within the reef waters and the currents outside the reef would drive any oil spill onto the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, I point out to the honourable member for Throsby that no study has yet been done of these factors. The Great Barrier Marine Park Authority is very keen to do such a study: to work out the danger to the reef from ships taking either a course inside the reef or a course outside the reef. The plain truth is that the money has not been given to the authority; it does not have the money to do the study at present. It is somewhat appalling, when we consider that there is a $1.6 billion tourist industry based on the reef, that we have not yet done that study to consider whether those ships should be travelling outside the reef or within the reef waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other things need to be done to protect the reef. There needs to be a new navigation system for ships. The workshop that was held to consider the danger from oil spills on the reef decided that the main danger was from navigation. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> disaster was caused by human error to do with navigation. The captain was not on the deck. The officer misread his directions and landed up on a reef. That could happen in Australian waters, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, where there are many difficult channels to negotiate. All the ships that go through the reef should have an electronic mapping system and the DGPS, the differential global positionary system, which the Government has not afforded to the ships that come through the reef. This high priority and inexpensive system uses satellites to locate the position of a ship. Once the electronic mapping which can be obtained from the Department of Defence is in place, every ship can see where it is in relation to the reef. That should be obligatory for ships of all sizes going through the reef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much support this Bill, but I point out that there is a major likelihood of an accident on the reef that has not been catered for. I believe it is up to the Government to spend more than it is at present to care for the reef and to make sure that these spills do not happen. Should a large spill occur, the compensation fund is not enough in itself to cover the cost of the clean-up and the economic damage. </PARA>

Four out of five shipping incidents are the result of human behaviour, caused by a number of things: lack of attention, fatigue, sheer incompetence, and a lack of application to duty. The inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the report of which is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety</EMPHASIS>, found one factor to be the condition of vessels. Also, not nearly enough is being done to ensure that people serving on the vessels do have the necessary competence; that their qualifications are genuine; and that the management of the vessel does lend itself to the safe operation of the vessel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that only about 15 per cent of tankers in the world are owned by oil companies; they have moved out of ownership of the vessels. Some 85 per cent of the independent tankers belong to an organisation called Intertanker, which is trying to clean up the game and to ensure the vessels it is operating are in good condition and crewed competently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about prevention, preparedness and clean-up, we need to recognise that only about eight per cent of oil spilled at sea is ever recovered; so it is very much a cosmetic operation. A lot is said about the recovery of oil, but the reality is that only about eight per cent of it is recovered. The rest disperses, depending upon the nature of the oil, depending upon the circumstances in which the oil is lost, the temperature of the water and the weather conditions. We need to understand that some 1,305 million tonnes of oil was moved around the globe in 1992. Some 3,250 vessels are engaged in the trade. It was put to us in the course of our committee inquiry that some 20 per cent of the tankers plying for hire do not meet international standards. That figure is accepted generally around the world. I go to the words of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety</EMPHASIS> and its recommendations have been widely accepted and welcomed across the world. Australia has been commended for the leadership it has given on this issue. However, the issue has to be crew competency and effective inspections of vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is stepping up vessel inspections. If the countries&mdash;maritime nations and flag states&mdash;that register these vessels do not carry out their obligations, one thing is certain: other nations will go it alone and impose their own requirements, as the United States has done, particularly with the proposed provisions of the Oil Protection Act, OPA. The committee heard a great deal about those provisions, and the onerous nature of them. While the US Coast Guard and the other parties involved have not yet determined the rules of the OPA, there is a fair bit of clamour going on that exaggerates the imposition of provisions upon tanker operators and people transporting oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the actual rules that will apply under that Act have not yet been determined. The negotiation process is still going on. Part of the process is the recognition that there should be a certificate of financial responsibility signed by the oil companies, or the tanker owners, transporting the oil. The result of all this could be perverse because the conditions require a level of financial responsibility that is difficult to provide for, whether through contracts, insurance, protection indemnity clubs, or whatever financial provisions or guarantees are available. While it is still too early to be proven, it has been asserted that the result will be that the better tankers&mdash;particularly from those companies with assets in the United States&mdash;will steer away from the United States because they do not want to be caught up in any action if the unthinkable should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we need to follow those developments closely, the important thing for Australia is to ensure that the tankers coming into our ports are up to the standards required under the international maritime conventions&mdash;and that relates to the inspection process, which is being stepped up here. It is also important to ensure that the crews have the required competency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, four out of five incidents at sea result from human error, not vessel failure. A good crew can save a bad ship but a bad crew can destroy a good ship. While the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aegean Sea</EMPHASIS> incident&mdash;which resulted in a vessel running aground, catching fire and destroying an area on the coast of Spain&mdash;may have been the result of mechanical failure, the incident involving the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maersk</EMPHASIS> navigator occurred in circumstances one would have thought impossible: a new tanker and a 16-year-old tanker colliding in a wide-open stretch of water 40 miles from the nearest land. That incident had nothing to do with the condition of the vessel; it was the competency of the people. The background to that incident has yet to be proven but that is the thing that we have to concentrate on: ensuring that people are competent and that they can carry out their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a concern about going to increasingly sophisticated technology when it is evident, from our general inquiry, that crews cannot read and understand even the older technology on vessels. There is not much point having stress gauges and other sophisticated equipment when crews cannot read the language. That is not exaggerating the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available in this very important debate I want to emphasise that we have to concentrate on people. We were greatly heartened by the very strong and favourable response from the rest of the shipping world to the recommendations we put to the Parliament in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report. Intertanker's letter to the committee, which, as I mentioned, will be tabled tomorrow, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should like to make reference to and quote from the report, which is written in very clear language and in a very readable manner, and hope that you have no objection to this.

<PARA>meaning the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have made for the report, and for the very balanced and reasonable conclusions you have drawn.</PARA>
<PARA>For the members of this Parliament of whom the committee was constituted&mdash;including my colleague  the  honourable  member  for Throsby&mdash;there can be no greater accolade for the recommendations brought down. We now need to implement those recommendations. With the support that is coming from the major organisations, that process augurs well. But I remind the House that 80 per cent of the vessels going through the Barrier Reef are heading for Queensland ports. Competency, clean-up procedures and ensuring that the incidents do not happen in the first place are the major considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> incident in Alaska in 1989 caused the Australian oil industry to look very closely at the offshore transportation of oil. The industry concluded that the existing system and arrangements for controlling a major oil spill should be considerably upgraded. A working group was established within the Australian Institute of Petroleum, AIP, to examine the problem and to make recommendations. The major recommendation was to form the Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre as a wholly owned subsidiary of AIP. The Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre was opened on 5 June 1992 at Corio Quay near Geelong. Appropriately enough, 5 June 1992 was World Environment Day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMOSC is a world-class oil spill response and training facility. It cost the industry, through 12 participating companies, $10 million to establish. It is financed by the industry. An allocation of $9 million is directed towards materials and equipment. It has the equipment and training personnel to respond to an oil spill of up to 10,000 tonnes. Annual operating costs are in the region of $750,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be of interest to honourable members to know that AMOSC is on call 24 hours a day and can be at the scene of an incident anywhere off Australia's coast within 12 to 16 hours. Corio Quay in Victoria was chosen because of its good waterside facilities and its close links with air and road transport facilities. Geelong is close to Avalon and Tullamarine airports. I understand that another major factor in the siting of AMOSC was that Geelong is almost at the dead centre of oil movements around the Australian coast. AMOSC can respond to a spill in a wide area of the South Pacific&mdash;as far away as Tahiti&mdash;if required. Obviously, that area includes New Guinea and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMOSC complements the oil spill response facilities already provided by the oil companies. There is now a total of $1.6 million worth of equipment in some 60 oil ports around Australia. This expenditure was another recommendation of the working group under the auspices of the AIP which actually recommended the establishment of AMOSC. It set out to tackle the problem of oil spills on a number of fronts. The $1.6 million worth of equipment allows those oil ports to cope with small or moderate spills in their immediate region. AMOSC, however, is a very large and centrally located facility, and it was established to respond to a major spill anywhere off the coast. It is a national facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre is heavily involved in the training of government personnel on spill and control techniques, and up to 300 government personnel attend training courses each year. The equipment at the centre is the best currently available anywhere in the world. The AMOSC team is highly trained and motivated. Many if not all, as expected, have a strong marine background with personnel being drawn from different parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk of a major oil spill around Australia's coast is not great. I do not say that with any sense of complacency, nor would the industry, as evidenced by its establishment of AMOSC. There is a remarkable safety record. In the past 30 years over three billion barrels of oil have been produced and more than a thousand wells drilled. Over this time, the total amount of oil spilt offshore is 440 barrels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to the guillotine and the limitation of time, I will quickly draw my remarks to a close. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr O'Keefe), who is at the table, for allowing me to do so. Before I was interrupted I was pointing out the simple fact that, of three billion barrels of oil produced over the last three decades, only 440 barrels have been spilt&mdash;although that is before the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> accident in July 1992. I have to find out how much oil was spilt from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>. But there is no doubt that the amount of oil spilt is minuscule compared with what is produced and transported. Nevertheless, the industry accepts its responsibilities and has responded to community demands. We must have the capacity to respond immediately and effectively to any oil spill accidents, and AMOSC takes us a very long way towards that objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I encourage honourable members&mdash;and obviously those who have made a contribution tonight&mdash;who are concerned with the possibility and consequential effects of oil spills to visit AMOSC. It is quite remarkable. I am only sorry time prevents me describing the state-of-the-art equipment and the superbly trained teams ready to respond. It is down at Geelong&mdash;not so far from Melbourne airport. Consequently, I really think honourable members should make the effort to visit. I know that the AIP would be delighted for members who are genuinely concerned about the environment and the oil industry and all of its implications for the national economy to visit its world-class AMOSC facility. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an oil storage facility on Westernport Bay at Crib Point, which is being upgraded at this moment. The upgrade was allowed to go ahead by the Victorian Government without an environmental impact statement. I have complained quite vociferously about this, and I trust that my complaints and everything that I have done will get through to various people to get this environmental impact statement brought about. However, an inquiry into oil pollution may be the second prize. Mention was made of the facility at Geelong. However, Westernport Bay has tides of six to seven knots and even greater and the handling equipment at the facility at Geelong cannot handle anything that is spilt in Westernport Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ships that are being brought into the new terminal facility will be supertankers. If one of those goes aground anywhere in the bay and it loses its cargo, it will wipe out one of the greatest tourist attractions in Australia&mdash;the penguin parade at Phillip Island. Penguins have been killed by oil spills at Portland within just the last few years. The tourist trade at Phillip Island is worth $44 million a year, so it is most important to the Victorian economy that this does not happen to Phillip Island.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to bring to the Parliament's attention the plight of citrus growers throughout Australia, and in particular those in the MIA, Sunraysia and Riverland in South Australia. As most honourable members would know, the citrus industry is facing a very serious situation with the price of citrus going down to only $45 to $50 a tonne. A citrus grower has to realise about $150 a tonne to make a reasonable living, so one can understand the situation that those people face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the citrus growers are hedging their trees, or pulling the trees, because they believe that there is no way they can make a living at those prices. The problem is caused by the glut of citrus on the world market, and particularly with the frozen concentrated orange juice that is coming from Brazil. That country has over-produced and has caused a glut on the market. Although Australia produces only two-thirds of its needs, that low price is affecting not only the concentrated juice market in Australia but also the fresh juice market and the market that is being prepared for export. This is a tremendous problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might say, `What is the present situation in regard to picking the valencia crop that has just finished?'. Valencias have to be picked and it costs up to $45 or $50 a tonne to pick them. If the growers are getting only to $45 to $50 a tonne from the processors for their produce, we can see that the other things such as water, sprays and other agricultural pursuits cannot be paid for, and this is placing the citrus growers in a terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the recent federal election the coalition was pressing for the establishment of a task force similar to that set for the sugar industry to look into the citrus industry. The purpose of the task force was to see what could be done about the last harvest, and also to look at the future of the citrus industry. The coalition is not in government, but the present Government has set up a horticultural industry task force with a smaller committee to look at the problems of the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That task force is being headed by Senator Nick Sherry. He will be in some of the citrus areas next week, and I hope that he has wide and extensive talks there. He will be in Mildura and the Riverland, but unfortunately he is not coming to the MIA at this stage. This task force is supposed to report in six months time. Many of the citrus growers agree with me that this is just too long a period. I ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) whether the committee cannot bring in an interim report before the navel season comes in so that the growers at least have some hope for that crop. The tragedy with the valencias is that they have to be picked for the good of the trees, and also because we have problems in the area with fruit fly and other pests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim report would be handy because that would give the citrus growers some hope and they would know where they were going. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for seeing the Australian Citrus Growers Federation for talks before the federal election. Unfortunately those talks did not turn out as well as we might have hoped, and the ACGF would like to speak to the Minister again. After the visit of Nick Sherry to Mildura and the Riverland, I ask whether the Minister would take on notice the request of the citrus growers to meet with him, because I think it is very important that he understands exactly what the situation is. The welfare of those towns and villages and the areas where citrus is grown is very dependent on the citrus growers, and those who have not a diversified agricultural production find it extremely difficult. I ask the Government to take this matter seriously. I am pleased that the task force has been set up. I ask that the task force put in an interim report before the navel crop comes off. I also ask the Minister to meet the ACGF. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to mention a few things that affect my electorate, and therefore they will range over a large area. First of all, I would like to mention the Premier of Victoria, one Jeffrey Kennett, and what he has done to the residents of the electorate of Dunkley and all surrounding electorates. One of the appalling things that he has done is place a $100 land tax on everyone who owns a rateable property in Victoria. It is a tax that goes right across the board. If one lives in a million dollar house one pays $100; if one lives in a ministry of housing house one pays $100. It is a poll tax that has been imposed on the Victorian people because of Jeffrey Kennett's own blinkered view that he has to attack the average person in Victoria. He has increased fares on trains, buses and all public transport. He has cut down pensioner benefits for pensioner week. How mean can anyone be, to actually cut out free travel on trains and trams during pensioner week?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has closed schools around our area, he has increased the size of classes, he has cut down on maintenance and he has sacked thousands of teachers. He is now after thousands of nurses. What he is doing to Victoria is disgraceful. However, I cannot stay on Jeffrey Kennett all night; I will get back to him at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things needed in the electorate of Dunkley that have not been addressed in the last two years include a child-care facility in the Chelsea Heights area. I will be lobbying hard to ensure that this child-care facility is built. I am writing to the Springvale council at this very moment to try and make certain that they assist the Chelsea Heights community centre to get a child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankston Hospital is the major hospital on the peninsula and the casualty section is a disgrace. It must be upgraded. During the election campaign I went there with the former Minister for Health, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe). We saw young children mixed in with the victims of road traffic accidents. Injured people were sitting on chairs. The conditions were appalling. I have made representations to see whether we can get something done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the aspect of the environment, we have the beautiful Seaford wetlands area in the electorate of Dunkley. There is a community group implementing a plan of management for that area. I hope to get some of those who are unfortunate enough to be out of work to assist in beautifying the Seaford wetlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of concern to me is the Frankston library-theatre complex. I am pleased that the Federal Government, under its local council grants program, gave $3.1 million to Frankston council and almost $1 million to the Chelsea council for improvements. Frankston council has decided to go ahead and build a library. This library has been needed for many years, and it will create a lot of work in the Frankston and Chelsea areas and in the Dunkley electorate generally. I am very pleased to be involved in a slight way. Even though I was not the member for Dunkley at the time, I had enough influence on our councillors to make certain that we got this facility built. There are over 50,000 users of the library in Frankston. It is one of the busiest in Victoria. I have always said that any community with a good library is a good community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another scheme that I want to get up and going, and that is a scheme for older unemployed people. As I mentioned before, Jeffrey Kennett has been cutting out all maintenance on schools. I would like to see some sort of Federal Government scheme whereby people over 40 who have skills&mdash;not only in management but in trades&mdash;can use those skills on, maybe, a Federal Government scheme to improve the schools that are being let run down by the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a worthwhile job. It would be something that would contribute to the general community and it would also make certain that the infrastructure that has been built and placed there by Labor governments is not allowed to deteriorate. There is plenty of work to be done. It just takes a little bit of imagination. I am quite certain that our Government will come up with a special program to assist a particular area of the unemployed, that is, those who are elderly&mdash;not elderly; I am in that bracket&mdash;but those over 45 who have been displaced by this slight recession. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to inform this House of a project in my electorate that has succeeded in developing in our children an appreciation of the uniqueness of Australia's flora and fauna. One of the most satisfying aspects of being a member of parliament is being able to witness the evolution of a local project into a valued community resource. The Cheltenham primary school flora and fauna sanctuary is one such project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project was initiated by Mr Jim Griffin, and principal, Mr Kim Brownbill. A support group known as the friends of Cheltenham primary school sanctuary group was convened. Parents, interested members of the community and of course children of the school are active participants. Over $7,000 has been raised via school fetes, grants and donations. The goal of the project is to foster in the community the knowledge, skills and motivation required to protect and conserve the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a number of concerns tonight about the operation of the Civil Aviation Authority. I believe this authority has been floundering for some time and I think it is time that the Government took some strong action in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority, and particularly the Chairman, Mr Butcher, have shown themselves to be unresponsive to the needs of the public, the Government, the Parliament and, lately, even those of the pilots and air traffic controllers. The Civil Aviation Authority seems to be too interested in promoting its own particular interests. It seems to have become a fully self-serving organisation and it has lost all sense of public purpose. Now that the past CAA chairman, aviation expert, Dick Smith, has come out in strong opposition to the Civil Aviation Authority on a new airspace system, I think it is time that organisation was thoroughly looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The air traffic services centre controversy of last year was absolutely amazing. I think the Civil Aviation Authority showed an attitude towards public accountability which was totally unacceptable in its process of tendering for its new air traffic system. In that instance, the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Mr Butcher, and an officer, Dr Edwards, displayed an alarming disregard, even arrogance, towards the Parliament, particularly the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Mr Butcher even wrote to the chairman of that committee expressing his strong disagreement with the right of the committee or the public to even know the tender details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the question of the curfew at Kingsford-Smith airport. That curfew is under constant threat. It is hard to believe that the Civil Aviation Authority is not encouraging the situation. Prior to the election the coalition floated the possibility of lifting the curfew. I guess it was inevitable, given the success of commercial aviation interests in entrenching themselves at Sydney airport with the third runway decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to lift that curfew, let us lift it. At the moment it is being lifted by stealth. The Civil Aviation Authority is supposed to be monitoring the situation. Yet over the past few weeks there have been numerous cases of airliners coming in at 5 a.m. and earlier. This is in constant disregard of government statements. The public is just being treated with contempt. As things stand, that curfew is starting to disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the proposed Sydney heliport, which is now being promoted by the State Government. One would think that the Civil Aviation Authority would take a hand in this but it is disregarding the whole situation. The authority is the body set up to monitor the operation of helicopters, yet absolutely no monitoring is taking place whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no controls on flight paths and heights that helicopters are now travelling. This has the potential, like Kingsford-Smith airport, to affect the wellbeing of probably half a million inner city residents. This authority just wipes its hands of the matter and says that it is not responsible and that it will leave it to the Maritime Services Board. The Maritime Services Board is organising the heliport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the new airspace system. Dick Smith, the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, has come out strongly against the system recently announced by the authority. He has made a number of criticisms. He calls it a second-rate system. He says that the original plan introduced by John Wright and his team has been changed in a major way and that the new system has unique and complicated procedures. There is to be an abandonment of air traffic control service at 5,000 feet in radar airspace and 10,000 feet in all other airspace&mdash;in other words, over 80 per cent of all Australian airspace. No other country in the world does this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to compensate for the lowering of safety, the CAA has invented a new and unproven system. It is also highly complicated. The new system is not in harmony with best international practice. As a result, foreign pilots flying here will have to learn new procedures, and our own pilots abroad will have to do likewise. The equipment that the authority has chosen will have to be designed for the new system, which has potentially huge cost blow-outs and delays in commissioning. The operators of general aviation aircraft will incur substantial costs in fitting the transponder or radio equipment made mandatory by the CAA under its new system. Dick Smith's letter to the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am afraid that you and your fellow Board members do not appear to appreciate the high risk strategy you are allowing to be inflicted on Australian aviation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also states that the airspace system the authority is trying to introduce has never been tested anywhere else in the world and is potentially dangerous. The letter continues:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw to the attention of the House three particular issues of interest in my electorate of Bass. The first issue of interest is the need for the continuation of funding to programs such as jobstart, jobclub and skillshare. The areas that I have chosen are ones that I have worked in myself. They are very innovative programs that the Government has put in line. We need to continue that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a bit of discussion on the likelihood of funding being reduced in some of these areas. I will be strongly opposing loss of funding. These programs are put there in order to enhance the opportunities for unemployed persons to regain employment. Having been a provider of several of those programs, I can guarantee their benefit to the short-term and the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area that I am particularly keen to promote in this House is the extension of child-care funding for larger institutions. There have been two representations for child-care funding in the electorate of Bass. The first is from the Launceston General Hospital, which has a huge staff. Many of them, regardless of whether they are male or female, have children that need some form of child care. What is needed there is an on-site child-care facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area, as I have noticed from my local newspapers whilst I have been here this week, is the Launceston campus of the University of Tasmania. A Mr Robert Silver is very busy lobbying for that option for the university. I will be in contact with him to assist him with his work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another particular area of interest for me is the roads surrounding Launceston. At this point in time we have a couple of bypasses, but another is needed. I will lobby very hard for funding to be put aside within the next two to three years for the eastern bypass. It looks as though Tasmania will be acquiring B-doubles, the very large freight carriers. Our road system is just not built for that type of truck, so an extension of the major highway system is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eastern bypass that I am looking for will bypass some of Launceston's major suburbs, particularly Newstead that is now being inundated with large trucks carrying timber, for example. They come through the suburb which is a very high quality residential area. The roads there have definitely not been built for heavy duty traffic and are beginning to break up. What is definitely needed now is a link coming from the southern outlet area around through the eastern suburbs and joining the northern outlet that heads down to Bell Bay. They are three particular areas of interest which I draw to the attention of the House this evening. </PARA>

In fact, in Western Australia the republicans received 0.16 per cent of the vote; in Victoria, 0.17 per cent; in New South Wales, 0.13 per cent; and in South Australia, 0.44 per cent. House of Representatives candidates also received small percentages of the total vote. In other words, middle Australia was, and is, far more interested in jobs and economic recovery than in changing to a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burning desire for a republic emanates from comparatively few&mdash;mostly from the Labor Party&mdash;with the strong backing of some sections of the media. In the vanguard, of course, is the Prime Minister, who recently assured us of his minimalist preferred option. However, the Prime Minister's track record suggests that a minimalist republic might not last too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech by His Excellency the Governor-General on the occasion of the opening of parliament flagged this opinion when, after mentioning a referendum to enable Australia to become a republic by the year 2001, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is not opposed to examining other aspects of constitutional reform but these should be considered separately and on their own merits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, lull the people of Australia into accepting a republic first and then centralise power later. What particular constitutional reforms would these be, I wonder? Does it mean the abolition of the Senate? After all, the Prime Minister has arrogantly described it as `unrepresentative swill', and only today Queensland Labor Premier Goss confirmed that he considered the Senate to be unrepresentative also. That is a possibility. The abolition of State parliaments is another possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Labor member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in his maiden speech on 6 May represented one thread of Labor Party opinion on this matter when he spoke of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My desire to see the abolition of State Parliaments . . . the States are an anachronistic relic of colonial times.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know what some members of the Labor Party think of the system of State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the anglophobia of the Prime Minister and other Labor Party members extend to erasing the greatly respected Australian flag because it historically includes a Union Jack? That is another possibility. It is very clear from ALP policy statements over the years that the wider ALP agenda involves changing the flag, abolishing or curtailing the power of the Senate, and converting the States from sovereign elements of a federation to regional administrative units of a central government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republican putsch is not the manifestation of a great passionate desire emanating from the hearts of the Australian people. It is imposed by the few upon the many, led by the Prime Minister in order to centralise power in Canberra. I believe when Australians fully realise that the republican putsch is about removing the checks and balances to unbridled power, the referendum that we will face on this matter will be soundly defeated. I also believe, despite the polls, that that process of rejection has already begun. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into the chamber to deliver this adjournment speech last evening but the drivel uttered by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) caught my attention instead. Tonight, however, I turn to another example of Labor folly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other morning I was flicking through the papers and noticed a sordid little piece attacking pro-British traditions in the Australian defence forces. Labor has commissioned a 270-page report to investigate the possibility that a cultural bias exists in services. One of its authors, Dr Robert Hall, came to the conclusion that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force is seen by a growing segment of the population&mdash;including those of non-English speaking and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background&mdash;to be anachronistic and of declining relevance to their lives.</PARA>
<PARA>What Dr Hall and his fellow social engineers&mdash;all growing fat on the public purse&mdash;have forgotten is that, believe it or not, the purpose of our Army, Navy and Air Force is actually to defend our country and not to be some kind of late 20th century social laboratory where academic fantasies can be acted out at the taxpayers' expense. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. Top marks to the Returned Services League and its National President, Brigadier Alf Garland, who moved swiftly to describe the report as `a blatant attack on Australia's background and heritage'. The Armed Forces Federation, the union for service personnel, also rejects Labor's attack. Spokesman James Morris says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to maintain our cultural ties&mdash;they don't harm the ADF and they shouldn't be taken away. If it isn't broke, don't fix it.</PARA>
<PARA>The report must be seen in the light of Labor's obsessive opposition to all things British. Honourable members would have shared my disgust at the politicisation of Anzac Day by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when in a particularly tasteless attack, even for him, he savaged the British while pointedly failing to condemn Japanese wartime atrocities committed against Australian prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders what motivates Labor to seek to rewrite our history. Why is Labor so biased against Australia's British connection? The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has blamed the Prime Minister's bog Irish attitudes, but that would be to reflect on the loyal contribution made by Irish Australians over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one would doubt that parts of Australia now have a wide cultural diversity and that migrants have made valuable contributions to the community. Unfortunately, the Government's single-minded pursuit of the ethnic vote has elevated its version of multiculturalism almost to a state religion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it quite rightly seeks to encourage non-English speaking migrants to maintain their culture and traditions, Labor manages to convey the impression that the values and heritage which have evolved from British settlers are somehow inferior; they are to be shunned, held in contempt and treated with disdain. Labor seeks to create a dictatorship of minority interests while dismembering Australia's own beliefs and national ethos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF ethnic study epitomises this attitude and fails to concede that robust Australian service traditions have developed this century creating a distinctive Australian military identity; thus the legend of Gallipoli and Anzac. Service traditions such as the officers' mess, dine-in nights, formal dress and portraits of the head of state prominently displayed are common to most armed forces throughout the world. Just because some of them are also British does not make them un-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take strong exception to suggestions in the report that the ADF should help to give effect to the wider social agenda of the Government. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Large institutions with high public profiles like the ADF can help to give such policies the momentum they may need to achieve wider public acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the report commissioned by Labor suggests that the ADF should be an arm of the Government in power. This has horrendous connotations for the future, should this occur in combination with the Prime Minister's determination to impose a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach strikes hard at morale. Who cares what the family origin is of Australians who choose to join the services? Does it matter, as the report claims, that ethnic recruits are half the number the social engineers consider they should be? I could not care less, nor could the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions need to be asked. Who commissioned the ADF report? How much did it cost and what were the terms of reference? What submissions were made by the defence forces and their members? The Army, the Navy and the Air Force are there to do an important job. They do a fine job. They are in the business of defending Australia&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. The Government's agenda stands condemned. </PARA>
